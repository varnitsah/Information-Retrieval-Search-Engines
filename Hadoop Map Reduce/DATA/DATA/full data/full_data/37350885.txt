seneschal of dauphiny sat at his ease his purple doublet all undone to yield greater freedom to his vast bulk a yellow silken undergarment visible through the gap as is visible the flesh of some fruit that swollen with overripeness has burst its skin  his wigimposed upon him by necessity not fashion lay on the table amid a confusion of dusty papers and on his little fat nose round and red as a cherry at its end rested the bridge of his hornrimmed spectacles his bald headso bald and shining that it conveyed an unpleasant sense of nakedness suggesting that its uncovering had been an act of indelicacy on the owners partrested on the back of his great chair and hid from sight the gaudy escutcheon wrought upon the crimson leather his eyes were closed his mouth open and whether from that mouth or from his noseor perhaps conflicting for issue between boththere came a snorting rumbling sound to proclaim that my lord the seneschal was hard at work upon the kings business  yonder at a meaner table in an angle between two windows a palefaced threadbare secretary was performing for a yearly pittance the duties for which my lord the seneschal was rewarded by emoluments disproportionately large  the air of that vast apartment was disturbed by the sounds of monsieur de tressans slumbers the scratch and splutter of the secretarys pen and the occasional hiss and crackle of the logs that burned in the great cavernlike fireplace suddenly to these another sound was added with a rasp and rattle the heavy curtains of blue velvet flecked with silver fleursdelys were swept from the doorway and the master of monsieur de tressans household in a well filled suit of black relieved by his heavy chain of office stepped pompously forward  the secretary dropped his pen and shot a frightened glance at his slumbering master then raised his hands above his head and shook them wildly at the head lackey  sh he whispered tragically doucement monsieur anselme  anselme paused he appreciated the gravity of the situation his bearing lost some of its dignity his face underwent a change then with a recovery of some part of his erstwhile resolution  nevertheless he must be awakened he announced but in an undertone as if afraid to do the thing he said must needs be done  the horror in the secretarys eyes increased but anselmes reflected none of it it was a grave thing he knew by former experience to arouse his majestys seneschal of dauphiny from his afterdinner nap but it was an almost graver thing to fail in obedience to that blackeyed woman below who was demanding an audience  anselme realized that he was between the sword and the wall he was however a man of a deliberate habit that was begotten of inherent indolence and nurtured among the good things that fell to his share as master of the tressan household thoughtfully he caressed his tuft of red beard puffed out his cheeks and raised his eyes to the ceiling in appeal or denunciation to the heaven which he believed was somewhere beyond it  nevertheless he must be awakened he repeated  and then fate came to his assistance somewhere in the house a door banged like a cannonshot perspiration broke upon the secretarys brow he sank limply back in his chair giving himself up for lost anselme started and bit the knuckle of his forefinger in a manner suggesting an inarticulate imprecation  my lord the seneschal moved the noise of his slumbers culminated in a sudden choking grunt and abruptly ceased his eyelids rolled slowly back like an owls revealing pale blue eyes which fixed themselves first upon the ceiling then upon anselme instantly he sat up puffing and scowling his hands shuffling his papers  a thousand devils anselme why am i interrupted he grumbled querulously still halfasleep what the plague do you want have you no thought for the kings affairs babylasthis to his secretarydid i not tell you that i had much to do that i must not be disturbed  it was the great vanity of the life of this man who did nothing to appear the busiest fellow in all france and no audiencenot even that of his own lackeyswas too mean for him to take the stage to in that predilect role  monsieur le comte said anselme in tones of abject selfeffacement i had never dared intrude had the matter been of less urgency but madame the dowager of condillac is below she begs to see your excellency instantly  at once there was a change tressan became wideawake upon the instant his first act was to pass one hand over the waxlike surface of his bald head whilst his other snatched at his wig then he heaved himself ponderously out of his great chair he donned his wig awry in his haste and lurched forward towards anselme his fat fingers straining at his open doublet and drawing it together  madame la douairiere here he cried make fast these buttons rascal quick am i to receive a lady thus am i babylas he snapped interrupting himself and turning aside even as anselme put forth hands to do his bidding a mirror from my closet dispatch  the secretary was gone in a flash and in a flash returned even as anselme completed his masters toilet but clearly monsieur de tressan had awakened in a peevish humour for no sooner were the buttons of his doublet secured than with his own fingers he tore them loose again cursing his majordomo the while with vigour  you dog anselme have you no sense of fitness no discrimination am i to appear in this garment of the mode of a halfcentury ago before madame la marquise take it off take it off man get me the coat that came last month from paristhe yellow one with the hanging sleeves and the gold buttons and a sashthe crimson sash i had from taillemant can you move no quicker animal are you still here  anselme thus enjoined lent an unwonted alacrity to his movements waddling grotesquely like a hastening waterfowl between him and the secretary they dressed my lord the seneschal and decked him out till he was fit to compare with a bird of paradise for gorgeousness of colouring if not for harmony of hues and elegance of outline  babylas held the mirror and anselme adjusted the seneschals wig whilst tressan himself twisted his black mustachioshow they kept their colour was a mystery to his acquaintanceand combed the tuft of beard that sprouted from one of his several chins  he took a last look at his reflection rehearsed a smile and bade anselme introduce his visitor he desired his secretary to go to the devil but thinking better of it he recalled him as he reached the door his cherished vanity craved expression  wait said he there is a letter must be written the kings business may not suffer postponementnot for all the dowagers in france sit down  babylas obeyed him tressan stood with his back to the open door his ears strained to listen had caught the swish of a womans gown he cleared his throat and began to dictate  to her majesty the queenregent he paused and stood with knitted brows deep in thought then he ponderously repeatedto her majesty the queen regenthave you got that  yes monsieur le comte to her majesty the queen regent  there was a step and a throatclearing cough behind him  monsieur de tressan said a womans voice a rich melodious voice if haughty and arrogant of intonation  on the instant he turned advanced a step and bowed  your humblest servant madame said he his hand upon his heart this is an honour which  which necessity thrusts upon you she broke in imperiously dismiss that fellow  the secretary pale and shy had risen his eyes dilated at the womans speech he looked for a catastrophe as the natural result of her taking such a tone with this man who was the terror of his household and of all grenoble instead the lord seneschals meekness left him breathless with surprise  he is my secretary madame we were at work as you came i was on the point of inditing a letter to her majesty the office of seneschal in a province such as dauphiny is helasno sinecure he sighed like one whose brain is weary it leaves a man little time even to eat or sleep  you will be needing a holiday then said she with cool insolence take one for once and let the kings business give place for half an hour to mine  the secretarys horror grew by leaps and bounds  surely the storm would burst at last about this audacious womans head but the lord seneschalusually so fiery and tempestuousdid no more than make her another of his absurd bows  you anticipate madame the very words i was about to utter babylas vanish and he waved the scribbler doorwards with a contemptuous hand take your papers with youinto my closet there we will resume that letter to her majesty when madame shall have left me  the secretary gathered up his papers his quills and his inkhorn and went his way accounting the end of the world at hand  when the door had closed upon him the seneschal with another bow and a simper placed a chair at his visitors disposal she looked at the chair then looked at the man much as she had looked at the chair and turning her back contemptuously on both she sauntered towards the fireplace she stood before the blaze with her whip tucked under her arm drawing off her stout ridinggloves she was a tall splendidly proportioned woman of a superb beauty of countenance for all that she was well past the spring of life  in the waning light of that october afternoon none would have guessed her age to be so much as thirty though in the sunlight you might have set it at a little more but in no light at all would you have guessed the truth that her next would be her fortysecond birthday her face was pale of an ivory pallor that gleamed in sharp contrast with the ebony of her lustrous hair under the long lashes of low lids a pair of eyes black and insolent set off the haughty lines of her scarlet lips her nose was thin and straight her neck an ivory pillar splendidly upright upon her handsome shoulders  she was dressed for riding in a gown of sapphire velvet handsomely laced in gold across the stomacher and surmounted at the neck where it was cut low and square by the starched band of fine linen which in france was already replacing the more elaborate ruff on her head over a linen coif she wore a tallcrowned grey beaver swathed with a scarf of blue and gold  standing by the hearth one foot on the stone kerb one elbow leaning lightly on the overmantel she proceeded leisurely to remove her gloves  the seneschal observed her with eyes that held an odd mixture of furtiveness and admiration his fingersplump indolentlooking stumpsplucking at his beard  did you but know marquise with what joy with what a  i will imagine it whatever it may be she broke in with that brusque arrogance that marked her bearing the time for flowers of rhetoric is not now there is trouble coming man trouble dire trouble  up went the seneschals brows his eyes grew wider  trouble quoth he and having opened his mouth to give exit to that single word open he left it  she laughed lazily her lip curling her face twisting oddly and mechanically she began to draw on again the glove she had drawn off  by your face i see how well you understand me she sneered the trouble concerns mademoiselle de la vauvraye  from parisdoes it come from court his voice was sunk  she nodded you are a miracle of intuition today tressan  he thrust his tiny tuft of beard between his teetha trick he had when perplexed or thoughtful ah he exclaimed at last and it sounded like an indrawn breath of apprehension tell me more  what more is there to tell you have the epitome of the story  but what is the nature of the trouble what form does it take and by whom are you advised of it  a friend in paris sent me word and his messenger did his work well else had monsieur de garnache been here before him and i had not so much as had the mercy of this forewarning  garnache quoth the count who is garnache  the emissary of the queenregent he has been dispatched hither by her to see that mademoiselle de la vauvraye has justice and enlargement  tressan fell suddenly to groaning and wringing his hands a pathetic figure had it been less absurd  i warned you madame i warned you how it would end he cried i told you  oh i remember the things you told me she cut in scorn in her voice you may spare yourself their repetition what is done is done and ill noti would nothave it undone queenregent or no queenregent i am mistress at condillac my word is the only law we know and i intend that so it shall continue  tressan looked at her in surprise this unreasoning feminine obstinacy so wrought upon him that he permitted himself a smile and a lapse into irony and banter  parfaitement said he spreading his hands and bowing why speak of trouble then  she beat her whip impatiently against her gown her eyes staring into the fire because my attitude being such as it is trouble will there be  the seneschal shrugged his shoulders and moved a step towards her he was cast down to think that he might have spared himself the trouble of donning his beautiful yellow doublet from paris she had eyes for no finery that afternoon he was cast down too to think how things might go with him when this trouble came it entered his thoughts that he had lain long on a bed of roses in this pleasant corner of dauphiny and he was smitten now with fear lest of the roses he should find nothing remaining but the thorns  how came the queenregent to hear ofof mademoisellesahsituation he inquired  the marquise swung round upon him in a passion  the girl found a dog of a traitor to bear a letter for her that is enough if ever chance or fate should bring him my way by god he shall hang without shrift  then she put her anger from her put from her too the insolence and scorn with which so lavishly she had addressed him hitherto instead she assumed a suppliant air her beautiful eyes meltingly set upon his face  tressan said she in her altered voice i am beset by enemies but you will not forsake me you will stand by me to the endwill you not my friend i can count upon you at least  in all things madame he answered under the spell of her gaze what force does this man garnache bring with him have you ascertained  he brings none she answered triumph in her glance  none he echoed horror in his none thenthen  he tossed his arms to heaven and stood a limp and shaken thing she leaned forward and regarded him stricken in surprise  diable what ails you she snapped could i have given you better news  if you could have given me worse i cannot think what it might have been he groaned then as if smitten by a sudden notion that flashed a gleam of hope into this terrifying darkness that was settling down upon him he suddenly looked up you mean to resist him he inquired  she stared at him a second then laughed a thought unpleasantly  pish but you are mad she scorned him do you need ask if i intend to resisti with the strongest castle in dauphiny by god sir if you need to hear me say it hear me then say that i shall resist him and as many as the queen may send after him for as long as one stone of condillac shall stand upon another  the seneschal blew out his lips and fell once more to the chewing of his beard  what did you mean when you said i could have given you no worse news than that of his coming alone she questioned suddenly  madame said he if this man comes without force and you resist the orders of which he is the bearer what think you will betide  he will appeal to you for the men he needs that he may batter down my walls she answered calmly  he looked at her incredulously you realize it he ejaculated you realize it  what is there in it that should puzzle a babe  her callousness was like a gust of wind upon the living embers of his fears it blew them into a blaze of wrath sudden and terrific as that of such a man at bay could be he advanced upon her with the rolling gait of the obese his cheeks purple his arms waving wildly his dyed mustachios bristling  and what of me madame he spluttered what of me am i to be ruined gaoled and hanged maybe for refusing him menfor that is what is in your mind am i to make myself an outlaw am i who have been lord seneschal of dauphiny these fifteen years to end my days in degradation in the cause of a womans matrimonial projects for a simpering schoolgirl seigneur du ciel he roared i think you are gone madmad mad over this affair you would not think it too much to set the whole province in flames so that you could have your way with this wretched child but ventregris to ruin metoto  he fell silent for very want of words just gaped and gasped and then with hands folded upon his paunch he set himself to pace the chamber  madame de condillac stood watching him her face composed her glance cold she was like some stalwart oak weathering with unshaken front a hurricane when he had done she moved away from the fireplace and beating her side gently with her whip she stepped to the door  au revoir monsieur de tressan said she mighty cool her back towards him  at that he halted in his feverish stride stood still and threw up his head his anger went out as a candle is extinguished by a puff of wind and in its place a new fear crept into his heart  madame madame he cried wait hear me  she paused halfturned and looked at him over her shoulder scorn in her glance a sneer on her scarlet mouth insolence in every line of her  i think monsieur that i have heard a little more than enough said she i am assured at least that in you i have but a fairweather friend a poor lipserver  ah not that madame he cried and his voice was stricken say not that i would serve you as would none other in all this worldyou know it marquise you know it  she faced about and confronted him her smile a trifle broader as if amusement were now blending with her scorn  it is easy to protest easy to say i will die for you so long as the need for such a sacrifice be remote but let me do no more than ask a favour and it is what of my good name madame what of my seneschalship am i to be gaoled or hanged to pleasure you faugh she ended with a toss of her splendid head the world is peopled with your kind and ialas for a womans intuitionshad held you different from the rest  her words were to his soul as a sword of fire might have been to his flesh they scorched and shrivelled it he saw himself as she would have him see himselfa mean contemptible craven a coward who made big talk in times of peace but faced about and vanished into hiding at the first sign of danger he felt himself the meanest vilest thing acrawl upon this sinful earth and shedear godhad thought him different from the ruck she had held him in high esteem and behold how short had he not fallen of all her expectations shame and vanity combined to work a sudden sharp revulsion in his feelings  marquise he cried you say no more than what is just but punish me no further i meant not what i said i was beside myself let me atonelet my future actions make amends for that odious departure from my true self  there was no scorn now in her smile only an ineffable tenderness beholding which he felt it in his heart to hang if need be that he might continue high in her regard he sprang forward and took the hand she extended to him  i knew tressan said she that you were not yourself and that when you bethought you of what you had said my valiant faithful friend would not desert me  he stooped over her hand and slobbered kisses upon her unresponsive glove  madame said he you may count upon me this fellow out of paris shall have no men from me depend upon it  she caught him by the shoulders and held him so before her her face was radiant alluring and her eyes dwelt on his with a kindness he had never seen there save in some wild daydream of his  i will not refuse a service you offer me so gallantly said she it were an ill thing to wound you by so refusing it  marquise he cried it is as nothing to what i would do did the occasion serve but when this thing tis done when you have had your way with mademoiselle de la vauvraye and the nuptials shall have been celebrated thendare i hope  he said no more in words but his little blue eyes had an eloquence that left nothing to mere speech  their glances met she holding him always at arms length by that grip upon his shoulders a grip that was firm and nervous  in the seneschal of dauphiny as she now gazed upon him she beheld a very toad of a man and the soul of her shuddered at the sight of him combining with the thing that he suggested but her glance was steady and her lips maintained their smile just as if that ugliness of his had been invested with some abstract beauty existing only to her gaze a little colour crept into her cheeks and red being the colour of loves livery tressan misread its meaning  she nodded to him across the little distance of her outstretched arms then smothered a laugh that drove him crazed with hope and breaking from him she sped swiftly shyly it almost seemed to him to the door  there she paused a moment looking back at him with a coyness that might have become a girl of half her years yet which her splendid beauty saved from being unbecoming even in her  one adorable smile she gave him and before he could advance to hold the door for her she had opened it and passed out     chapter ii monsieur de garnache   to promise rashly particularly where a woman is the suppliant and afterwards if not positively to repent the promise at least to regret that one did not hedge it with a few conditions is a proceeding not uncommon to youth in a man of advanced age such as monsieur de tressan it never should have place and indeed it seldom has unless that man has come again under the sway of the influences by which youth for good or ill is governed  whilst the flush of his adoration was upon him hot from the contact of her presence he knew no repentance found room in his mind for no regrets he crossed to the window and pressed his huge round face to the pane in a futile effort to watch her mount and ride out of the courtyard with her little troop of attendants finding that he might notthe window being placed too highgratify his wishes in that connection he dropped into his chair and sat in the fastdeepening gloom reviewing fondly here hurriedly there the interview that had but ended  thus night fell and darkness settled down about him relieved only by the red glow of the logs smouldering on the hearth in the gloom inspiration visited him he called for lights and babylas both came and he dispatched the lackey that lighted the tapers to summon monsieur daubran the commander of the garrison of grenoble  in the interval before the soldiers coming he conferred with babylas concerning what he had in mind but he found his secretary singularly dull and unimaginative so that perforce he must fall back upon himself he sat glum and thoughtful his mind in unproductive travail until the captain was announced  still without any definite plan he blundered headlong nevertheless into the necessary first step towards the fulfilment of his purpose  captain said he looking mighty grave i have cause to believe that all is not as it should be in the hills in the district of montelimar  is there trouble monsieur inquired the captain startled  maybe there is maybe there is not returned the seneschal mysteriously you shall have your full orders in the morning meanwhile make ready to repair to the neighbourhood of montelimar tomorrow with a couple of hundred men  a couple of hundred monsieur exclaimed daubran but that will be to empty grenoble of soldiers  what of it we are not likely to require them here let your orders for preparation go round tonight so that your knaves may be ready to set out betimes tomorrow if you will be so good as to wait upon me early you shall have your instructions  mystified monsieur daubran departed on his errand and my lord seneschal went down to supper well pleased with the cunning device by which he was to leave grenoble without a garrison it was an astute way of escape from the awkward situation into which his attachment to the interests of the dowager of condillac was likely to place him  but when the morning came he was less pleased with the idea chiefly because he had been unable to invent any details that should lend it the necessary colour and daubranworse luckwas an intelligent officer who might evince a pardonable but embarrassing curiosity a leader of soldiers has a right to know something at least of the enterprise upon which he leads them by morning too tressan found that the intervening space of the night since he had seen madame de condillac had cooled his ardour very considerably  he had reached the incipient stages of regret of his rash promise  when captain daubran was announced to him he bade them ask him to come again in an hours time from mere regrets he was passing now through dismay into utter repentance of his promise he sat in his study at his littered writingtable his head in his hands a confusion of thoughts a wild frenzied striving after invention in his brain  thus anselme found him when he thrust aside the portiere to announce that a monsieur de garnache from paris was below demanding to see the lord seneschal at once upon an affair of state  tressans flesh trembled and his heart fainted then suddenly desperately he took his courage in both hands he remembered who he was and what he was the kings lord seneschal of the province of dauphiny throughout that province from the rhone to the alps his word was law his name a terror to evildoersand to some others besides was he to blench and tremble at the mention of the name of a court lackey out of paris who brought him a message from the queenregent body of god not he  he heaved himself to his feet warmed and heartened by the thought his eye sparkled and there was a deeper flush than usual upon his cheek  admit this monsieur de garnache said he with a fine loftiness and in his heart he pondered what he would say and how he should say it how he should stand how move and how look his roving eye caught sight of his secretary he remembered somethingthe cherished pose of being a man plunged fathomsdeep in business sharply he uttered his secretarys name  babylas raised his pale face he knew what was coming it had come so many times before but there was no vestige of a smile on his drooping lips no gleam of amusement in his patient eye he thrust aside the papers on which he was at work and drew towards him a fresh sheet on which to pen the letter which he knew by experience tressan was about to indite to the queenmother for these purposes her majesty was tressans only correspondent  then the door opened the portiere was swept aside and anselme announced monsieur de garnache  tressan turned as the newcomer stepped briskly into the room and bowed hat in hand its long crimson feather sweeping the ground then straightened himself and permitted the seneschal to take his measure  tressan beheld a man of a good height broad to the waist and spare thence to the ground who at first glance appeared to be mainly clad in leather a buff jerkin fitted his body below it there was a glimpse of winecoloured trunks and hose of a slightly deeper hue which vanished immediately into a pair of huge thighboots of untanned leather a leather swordbelt goldembroidered at the edges carried a long steelhalted rapier in a leather scabbard chaped with steel the sleeves of his doublet which protruded from his leather casing were of the same colour and material as his trunks in one hand he carried his broad black hat with its crimson feather in the other a little roll of parchment and when he moved the creak of leather and jingle of his spurs made pleasant music for a martial spirit  above all this mans head well set upon his shoulders claimed some attention his nose was hooked and rather large his eyes were blue bright as steel and set a trifle wide above a thinlapped delicate mouth his reddish mustachios slightly streaked with grey stood out bristling like a cats his hair was darkeralmost brown save at the temples where age had faded it to an ashen colour in general his aspect was one of rugged strength  the seneschal measuring him with an adversarys eye misliked his looks but he bowed urbanely washing his hands in the air and murmuring  your servant monsieur de  garnache came the others crisp metallic voice and the name had a sound as of an oath on his lips martin marie rigobert de garnache i come to you on an errand of her majestys as this my warrant will apprise you and he proffered the paper he held which tressan accepted from his hand  a change was visible in the wily seneschals fat countenance its round expanse had expressed interrogation until now but at the parisians announcement that he was an emissary of the queens tressan insinuated into it just that look of surprise and of increased deference which would have been natural had he not already been forewarned of monsieur de garnaches mission and identity  he placed a chair at his visitors disposal himself resuming his seat at his writingtable and unfolding the paper garnache had given him the newcomer seated himself hitched his swordbelt round so that he could lean both hands upon the hilt and sat stiff and immovable awaiting the lord seneschals pleasure from his desk across the room the secretary idly chewing the feathered end of his goosequill took silent stock of the man from paris and wondered  tressan folded the paper carefully and returned it to its owner it was no more than a formal credential setting forth that garnache was travelling into dauphiny on a state affair and commanding monsieur de tressan to give him every assistance he might require in the performance of his errand  parfaitement purred the lord seneschal and now monsieur if you will communicate to me the nature of your affair you shall find me entirely at your service  it goes without saying that you are acquainted with the chateau de condillac began garnache plunging straight into business  perfectly the seneschal leaned back and was concerned to feel his pulses throbbing a shade too quickly but he controlled his features and maintained a placid bland expression  you are perhaps acquainted with its inhabitants  yes  intimate with them  the seneschal pursed his lips arched his brows and slowly waved his podgy hands a combination of grimace and gesture that said much or nothing but reflecting that monsieur de tressan had a tongue garnache apparently did not opine it worth his while to set a strain upon his own imagination for  intimate with them he repeated and this time there was a sharper note in his voice  tressan leaned forward and brought his fingertips together his voice was as urbane as it lay within its power to be  i understood that monsieur was proposing to state his business not to question mine  garnache sat back in his chair and his eyes narrowed he scented opposition and the greatest stumblingblock in garnaches career had been that he could never learn to brook opposition from any man that characteristic evinced early in life had all but been the ruin of him he was a man of high intellectual gifts of military skill and great resource out of consideration for which had he been chosen by marie de medicis to come upon this errand but he marred it all by a temper so ungovernable that in paris there was current a byword explosive as garnache  little did tressan dream to what a cask of gunpowder he was applying the match of his smug pertness nor did garnache let him dream it just yet he controlled himself betimes bethinking him that after all there might be some reason in what this fat fellow said   you misapprehend my purpose sir said he his lean brown hand stroking his long chin i but sought to learn how far already you may be informed of what is taking place up there to the end that i may spare myself the pains of citing facts with which already you are acquainted still monsieur i am willing to proceed upon the lines which would appear to be more agreeable to yourself  this then is the sum of the affair that brings me the late marquis de condillac left two sons the elder florimondwho is the present marquis and who has been and still continues absent warring in italy since before his fathers deathis the stepson of the present dowager she being the mother of the younger son marius de condillac  should you observe me to be anywhere at error i beg monsieur that you will have the complaisance to correct me  the seneschal bowed gravely and monsieur de garnache continued  now this younger soni believe that he is in his twentyfirst year at presenthas been something of a scapegrace  a scapegrace bon dieu no that is a harsh name to give him a little indiscreet at times a little rash as is the way of youth  he would have said more but the man from paris was of no mind to waste time on quibbles  very well he snapped cutting in we will say a little indiscreet my errand is not concerned with monsieur mariuss morals or with his lack of them these indiscretions which you belittle appear to have been enough to have estranged him from his father a circumstance which but served the more to endear him to his mother i am told that she is a very handsome woman and that the boy favours her surprisingly  ah sighed the seneschal in a rapture a beautiful womana noble splendid woman  hum garnache observed the ecstatic simper with a grim eye then he proceeded with his story  the late marquis possessed in his neighbour the also deceased monsieur de la vauvraye a very dear and valued friend monsieur de la vauvraye had an only child a daughter to inherit his very considerable estates probably the wealthiest in all dauphiny so i am informed it was the dearest wish of his heart to transform what had been a lifelong friendship in his own generation into a closer relationship in the nexta wish that found a very ready echo in the heart of monsieur de condillac florimond de condillac was sixteen years of age at the time and valerie de la vauvraye fourteen for all their tender years they were betrothed and they grew up to love each other and to look forward to the consummation of the plans their fathers had laid for them  monsieur monsieur the seneschal protested how can you possibly infer so much how can you say that they loved each other what authority can you have for pretending to know what was in their inmost hearts  the authority of mademoiselle de la vauvraye was the unanswerable rejoinder i am telling you more or less what she herself wrote to the queen  ah well wellproceed monsieur  this marriage should render florimond de condillac the wealthiest and most powerful gentleman in dauphinyone of the wealthiest in france and the idea of it pleased the old marquis inasmuch as the disparity there would be between the worldly possessions of his two sons would serve to mark his disapproval of the younger but before settling down florimond signified a desire to see the world as was fit and proper and becoming in a young man who was later to assume such wide responsibilities his father realizing the wisdom of such a step made but slight objection and at the age of twenty florimond set out for the italian wars two years afterwards a little over six months ago his father died and was followed to the grave some weeks later by monsieur de la vauvraye the latter with a want of foresight which has given rise to the present trouble misjudging the character of the dowager of condillac entrusted to her care his daughter valerie pending florimonds return when the nuptials would naturally be immediately celebrated i am probably telling you no more than you already know but you owe the infliction to your own unwillingness to answer my questions  no no monsieur i assure you that in what you say there is much that is entirely new to me  i rejoice to hear it monsieur de tressan said garnache very seriously for had you been in possession of all these facts her majesty might have a right to learn how it chanced that you had nowise interfered in what is toward at condillac  but to proceed madame de condillac and her precious benjaminthis mariusfinding themselves in florimonds absence masters of the situation have set about turning it to their own best advantage mademoiselle de la vauvraye whilst being nominally under their guardianship finds herself practically gaoled by them and odious plans are set before her to marry marius could the dowager but accomplish this it would seem that she would not only be assuring a future of ease and dignity for her son but also be giving vent to all her pentup hatred of her stepson  mademoiselle however withstands them and in this she is aided by a fortuitous circumstance which has arisen out of the overbearing arrogance that appears to be madames chief characteristic condillac after the marquiss death had refused to pay tithes to mother church and has flouted and insulted the bishop this prelate after finding remonstrance vain has retorted by placing condillac under an interdict depriving all within it of the benefit of clergy thus they have been unable to find a priest to venture thither so that even had they willed to marry mademoiselle by force to marius they lacked the actual means of doing so  florimond continues absent we have every reason to believe that he has been left in ignorance of his fathers death letters coming from him from time to time prove that he was alive and well at least until three months ago a messenger has been dispatched to find him and urge him to return home at once but pending his arrival the queen has determined to take the necessary steps to ensure that mademoiselle de la vauvraye shall be released from her captivity that she shall suffer no further molestation at the hands of madame de condillac and her sonenfin that she shall run no further risks  my errand monsieur is to acquaint you with these facts and to request you to proceed to condillac and deliver thence mademoiselle de la vauvraye whom i am subsequently to escort to paris and place under her majestys protection until such time as the new marquis shall return to claim her  having concluded monsieur de garnache sat back in his chair and threw one leg over the other fixing his eyes upon the seneschals face and awaiting his reply  on that gross countenance before him he saw fall the shadow of perplexity tressan was monstrous illatease and his face lost a good deal of its habitual plethora of colour he sought to temporize  does it not occur to you monsieur that perhaps too much importance may have been attached to the word of this childthis mademoiselle de la vauvraye  does it occur to you that such has been the case that she has overstated it counterquestioned monsieur de garnache  no no i do not say that butbutwould it not be bettermoreahsatisfactory to all concerned if you yourself were to go to condillac and deliver your message in person demanding mademoiselle  the man from paris looked at him a moment then stood up suddenly and shifted the carriages of his sword back to their normal position his brows came together in a frown from which the seneschal argued that his suggestion was not well received  monsieur said the parisian very coldly like a man who contains a rising anger let me tell you that this is the first time in my life that i have been concerned in anything that had to do with women and i am close upon forty years of age the task i can assure you was little to my taste i embarked upon it because being a soldier and having received my orders i was in the unfortunate position of being unable to help myself but i intend monsieur to adhere rigidly to the letter of these commands already i have endured more than enough in the interests of this damsel i have ridden from paris and that means close upon a week in the saddleno little thing to a man who has acquired certain habits of life and developed a taste for certain minor comforts which he is very reluctant to forgo i have fed and slept at inns living on the worst of fares and sleeping on the hardest and hardly the cleanest of beds ventregris figure to yourself that last night we lay at luzan in the only inn the place containeda hovel monsieur le seneschal a hovel in which i would not kennel a dog i loved  his face flushed and his voice rose as he dwelt upon the things he had undergone  my servant and i slept in a dormitorya thousand devils monsieur in a dormitory do you realize it we had for company a drunken vintner a pedlar a pilgrim on his way to rome and two peasant women and they sent us to bed without candles for modestys sake i ask you to conceive my feelings in such a case as that i could tell you more but that as a sample of what i have undergone could scarcely be surpassed  trulytruly outrageous sympathized the seneschal yet he grinned  i ask youhave i not suffered inconvenience enough already in the service of mademoiselle de la vauvraye that you can blame me if i refuse to go a single step further than my orders bid me  the seneschal stared at him now in increasing dismay had his own interests been less at issue he could have indulged his mirth at the others fiery indignation at the inconveniences he recited as it was he had nothing to say no thought or feeling other than what concerned finding a way of escape from the net that seemed to be closing in about himhow to seem to serve the queen without turning against the dowager of condillac how to seem to serve the dowager without opposing the wishes of the queen  a plague on the girl he growled unconsciously uttering his thoughts aloud the devil take her  garnache smiled grimly that is a bond of sympathy between us said he i have said those very words a hundred timesa thousand times indeedbetween paris and grenoble yet i scarcely see that you can damn her with as much justice as can i  but there monsieur all this is unprofitable you have my message i shall spend the day at grenoble and take a wellearned rest by this time tomorrow i shall be ready to start upon my return journey i shall have then the honour to wait upon you again to the end that i may receive from you the charge of mademoiselle de la vauvraye i shall count upon your having her here in readiness to set out with me by noon tomorrow  he bowed with a flourish of his plumed hat and would with that have taken his departure but that the seneschal stayed him  monsieur monsieur he cried in piteous affright you do not know the dowager of condillac  why no what of it  what of it did you know her you would understand that she is not the woman to be driven i may order her in the queens name to deliver up mademoiselle de la vauvraye but she will withstand me  withstand you echoed garnache frowning into the face of this fat man who had risen also brought to his feet by excitement withstand youyou the lord seneschal of dauphiny you are amusing yourself at my expense  but i tell you that she will the other insisted in a passion you may look for the girl in vain tomorrow unless you go to condillac yourself and take her  garnache drew himself up and delivered his answer in a tone that was final  you are the governor of the province monsieur and in this matter you have in addition the queens particular authoritynay her commands are imposed upon you those commands as interpreted by me you will execute in the manner i have indicated  the seneschal shrugged his shoulders and chewed a second at his beard  it is an easy thing for you to tell me what to do tell me rather how to do it how to overcome her opposition  you are very sure of oppositionstrangely sure monsieur said garnache looking him between the eyes in any case you have soldiers  and so has she and the strongest castle in southern franceto say nothing of the most cursed obstinacy in the world what she says she does  and what the queen says her loyal servants do was garnaches rejoinder in a withering tone i think there is nothing more to be said monsieur he added by this time tomorrow i shall expect to receive from you here the charge of mademoiselle de la vauvraye a demain donc monsieur le seneschal  and with another bow the man from paris drew himself erect turned on his heel and went jingling and creaking from the room  the lord seneschal sank back in his chair and wondered to himself whether to die might not prove an easy way out of the horrid situation into which chance and his illstarred tenderness for the dowager of condillac had thrust him  at his desk sat his secretary who had been a witness of the interview lost in wonder almost as great as the seneschals own  for an hour tressan remained where he was deep in thought and gnawing at his beard then with a sudden burst of passion expressed in a round oath or two he rose and called for his horse that he might ride to condillac     chapter iii the dowagers compliance   promptly at noon on the morrow monsieur de garnache presented himself once more at the seneschals palace and with him went rabecque his bodyservant a lean swarthy sharpfaced man a trifle younger than his master  anselme the obese master of the household received them with profound respect and at once conducted garnache to monsieur de tressans presence  on the stairs they met captain daubran who was descending the captain was not in the best of humours for fourandtwenty hours he had kept two hundred of his men under arms ready to march as soon as he should receive his orders from the lord seneschal yet those instructions were not forthcoming he had been to seek them again that morning only to be again put off  monsieur de garnache had considerable doubt born of his yesterdays interview with the seneschal that mademoiselle de la vauvraye would be delivered into his charge as he had stipulated his relief was therefore considerable upon being ushered into tressans presence to find a lady in cloak and hat dressed as for a journey seated in a chair by the great fireplace  tressan advanced to meet him a smile of cordial welcome on his lips and they bowed to each other in formal greeting  you see monsieur said the seneschal waving a plump hand in the direction of the lady that you have been obeyed here is your charge  then to the lady this is monsieur de garnache he announced of whom i have already told you who is to conduct you to paris by order of her majesty  and now my good friends however great the pleasure i derive from your company i care not how soon you set out for i have some prodigious arrears of work upon my hands  garnache bowed to the lady who returned his greeting by an inclination of the head and his keen eyes played briskly over her she was a plumpfaced insipid child with fair hair and pale blue eyes stolid and bovine in their expressionlessness  i am quite ready monsieur said she rising as she spoke and gathering her cloak about her and garnache remarked that her voice had the southern drawl her words the faintest suggestion of a patois it was amazing how a lady born and bred could degenerate in the rusticity of dauphiny pigs and cows he made no doubt had been her chief objectives yet even so he thought he might have expected that she would have had more to say to him than just those five words expressing her readiness to depart he had looked for some acknowledgment of satisfaction at his presence some utterances of gratitude either to himself or to the queenregent for the promptness with which she had been succoured he was disappointed but he showed nothing of it as with a simple inclination of the head  good said he since you are ready and monsieur le seneschal is anxious to be rid of us let us by all means be moving you have a long and tedious journey before you mademoiselle  ii am prepared for that she faltered  he stood aside and bending from the waist he made a sweeping gesture towards the door with the hand that held his hat to the invitation to precede him she readily responded and with a bow to the seneschal she began to walk across the apartment  garnaches eyes narrowing slightly followed her like points of steel suddenly he shot a disturbing glance at tressans face and the corner of his wildcat mustachios twitched he stood erect and called her very sharply  mademoiselle  she stopped and turned to face him an incredible shyness seeming to cause her to avoid his gaze  you have no doubt monsieur le seneschals word for my identity but i think it is as well that you should satisfy yourself before placing yourself entirely in my care as you are about to do you would be well advised to assure yourself that i am indeed her majestys emissary will you be good enough to glance at this  he drew forth as he spoke the letter in the queens own hand turned it upside down and so presented it to her the seneschal looked on stolidly a few paces distant  but certainly mademoiselle assure yourself that this gentleman is no other than i have told you  thus enjoined she took the letter for a second her eyes met garnaches glittering gaze and she shivered then she bent her glance to the writing and studied it a moment what time the man from paris watched her closely  presently she handed it back to him  thank you monsieur was all she said  you are satisfied that it is in order mademoiselle he inquired and a note of mockery too subtle for her or the seneschal ran through his question  i am quite satisfied  garnache turned to tressan his eyes were smiling but unpleasantly and in his voice when he spoke there was something akin to the distant rumble that heralds an approaching storm  mademoiselle said he has received an eccentric education  eh quoth tressan perplexed  i have heard tell monsieur of a people somewhere in the east who read and write from right to left but never yet have i heard tell of anyparticularly in franceso oddly schooled as to do their reading upside down  tressan caught the drift of the others meaning he paled a little and sucked his lip his eyes wandering to the girl who stood in stolid inapprehension of what was being said  did she do that said he and he scarcely knew what he was saying all that he realized was that it urged him to explain this thing mademoiselles education has been neglecteda by no means uncommon happening in these parts she is sensitive of it she seeks to hide the fact  then the storm broke about their heads and it crashed and thundered awfully in the next few minutes  o liar o damned audacious liar roared garnache uncompromisingly advancing a step upon the seneschal and shaking the parchment threateningly in his very face as though it were become a weapon of offence was it to hide the fact that she had not been taught to write that she sent the queen a letter pageslong who is this woman and the finger he pointed at the girl quivered with the rage that filled him at this trick they had thought to put upon him  tressan sought refuge in offended dignity he drew himself up threw back his head and looked the parisian fiercely in the eye  since you take this tone with me monsieur  i take with youas with any manthe tone that to me seems best you miserable fool as sure as youre a rogue this affair shall cost you your position you have waxed fat and sleek in your seneschalship this easy life in dauphiny appears to have been well suited to your health but as your paunch has grown so of a truth have your brains dwindled else had you never thought to cheat me quite so easily  am i some lout who has spent his days herding swine think you that you could trick me into believing this creature to be mademoiselle de la vauvrayethis creature with the mien of a peasant with a breath reeking of garlic like a thirdrate eatinghouse and the walk of a woman who has never known footgear until this moment tell me sir for what manner of fool did you take me  the seneschal stood with blanched face and gaping mouth his fire all turned to ashes before the passion of this gaunt man  garnache paid no heed to him he stepped to the girl and roughly raised her chin with his hand so that she was forced to look him in the face  what is your name wench he asked her  margot she blubbered bursting into tears  he dropped her chin and turned away with a gesture of disgust  get you gone he bade her harshly get you back to the kitchen or the onionfield from which they took you  and the girl scarce believing her good fortune departed with a speed that bordered on the ludicrous tressan had naught to say no word to stay her with pretence he realized was vain  now my lord seneschal quoth garnache arms akimbo feet planted wide and eyes upon the wretched mans countenance what may you have to say to me  tressan shifted his position he avoided the others glance he was visibly trembling and when presently he spoke it was in faltering accents  ititseems monsieur thatahthat i have been the victim of some imposture  it had rather seemed to me that the victim chosen was myself  clearly we were both victims the seneschal rejoined then he proceeded to explain i went to condillac yesterday as you desired me and after a stormy interview with the marquise i obtained from heras i believedthe person of mademoiselle de la vauvraye you see i was not myself acquainted with the lady  garnache looked at him he did not believe him he regretted almost that he had not further questioned the girl but after all perhaps it might be easier and more expedient if he were to appear to accept the seneschals statement but he must provide against further fraud  monsieur le seneschal said he in calmer tones putting his anger from him at the best you are a blunderer and an ass at the worst a traitor i will inquire no further at present ill not seek to discriminate too finely  monsieur these insults began the seneschal summoning dignity to his aid but garnache broke in  la la i speak in the queens name if you have thought to aid the dowager of condillac in this resistance of her majestys mandate let me enjoin you as you value your seneschalshipas you value your very neckto harbour that thought no longer  it seems that after all i must deal myself with the situation i must go myself to condillac if they should resist me i shall look to you for the necessary means to overcome that resistance  and bear you this in mind i have chosen to leave it an open question whether you were a party to the trick it has been sought to put upon the queen through me her representative but it is a question that i have it in my power to resolve at any momentto resolve as i choose unless monsieur i find you hereafteras i trustactuated by the most unswerving loyalty i shall resolve that question by proclaiming you a traitor and as a traitor i shall arrest you and carry you to paris monsieur le seneschal i have the honour to give you goodday  when he was gone monsieur de tressan flung off his wig and mopped the perspiration from his brow he went white as snow and red as fire by turns as he paced the apartment in a frenzy never in the fifteen years that were sped since he had been raised to the governorship of the province had any man taken such a tone with him and harangued him in such terms  a liar and a traitor had he been called that morning a knave and a fool he had been browbeaten and threatened and he had swallowed it all and almost turned to lick the hand that administered the dose dame what manner of cur was he become and the man who had done all thisa vulgar upstart out of paris reeking of leather and the barrackroom still lived  bloodshed was in his mind murder beckoned him alluringly to take her as his ally but he put the thought from him frenzied though he might be he must fight this knave with other weapons frustrate his mission and send him back to paris and the queens scorn beaten and emptyhanded  babylass he shouted  immediately the secretary appeared  have you given thought to the matter of captain daubran he asked his voice an impatient snarl  yes monsieur i have pondered it all morning  well and what have you concluded  helas monsieur nothing  tressan smote the table before him a blow that shook some of the dust out of the papers that cumbered it ventregris how am i served for what do i pay you and feed you and house you goodfornaught if you are to fail me whenever i need the things you call your brains have you no intelligence no thought no imagination can you invent no plausible business no likely rising no possible disturbances that shall justify my sending aubran and his men to montelimarto the very devil if need be  the secretary trembled in his every limb his eyes shunned his masters as his masters had shunned garnaches awhile ago the seneschal was enjoying himself if he had been bullied and browbeaten here at least was one upon whom he in his turn might taste the joys of bullying and browbeating  you lazy miserable calf he stormed i might be better served by a wooden image go it seems i must rely upon myself it is always so wait he thundered for the secretary only too glad to obey his last order had already reached the door tell anselme to bid the captain attend me here at once  babylass bowed and went his errand  a certain amount of his illhumour vented tressan made an effort to regain his selfcontrol he passed his handkerchief for the last time over face and head and resumed his wig  when daubran entered the seneschal was composed and in his wonted habit of ponderous dignity ah daubran said he your men are ready  they have been ready these fourandtwenty hours monsieur  good you are a brisk soldier daubran you are a man to be relied upon  daubran bowed he was a tall active young fellow with a pleasant face and a pair of fine black eyes  monsieur le seneschal is very good  with a wave of the hand the seneschal belittled his own goodness  you will march out of grenoble within the hour captain and you will lead your men to montelimar there you will quarter them and await my further orders babylas will give you a letter to the authorities charging them to find you suitable quarters while there daubran and until my further orders reach you you will employ your time in probing the feeling in the hill district you understand  imperfectly daubran confessed  you will understand better when you have been in montelimar a week or so it may of course be a false alarm still we must safeguard the kings interests and be prepared perhaps we may afterwards be charged with starting at shadows but it is better to be on the alert from the moment the shadow is perceived than to wait until the substance itself has overwhelmed us  it sounded so very much as if the seneschals words really had some hidden meaning that daubran if not content with going upon an errand of which he knew so little was at least reconciled to obey the orders he received he uttered words that conveyed some such idea to tressans mind and within a halfhour he was marching out of grenoble with beating drums on his two days journey to montelimar     chapter iv the chateau de condillac   as captain daubran and his troop were speeding westwards from grenoble monsieur de garnache ever attended by his man rode briskly in the opposite direction towards the grey towers of condillac that reared themselves towards the greyer sky above the valley of the isere it was a chill dull autumnal day with a raw wind blowing from the alps its breath was damp and foretold of the rain that was likely to come anon the rain with which the clouds hanging low about the distant hills were pregnant  but monsieur de garnache was totally insensible to his surroundings his mind was very busy with the interview from which he had come and the interview to which he was speeding once he permitted himself a digression that he might point a moral for the benefit of his servant  you see rebecque what a plague it is to have to do with women are you sufficiently grateful to me for having quelled your matrimonial ardour of two months ago no you are not grateful you may be sufficiently grateful never it would be impossible no gratitude could be commensurate with the benefit i conferred upon you yet if you had married and discovered for yourself the troubles that come from too close an association with that sex which some wag of old ironically called the weaker and of which contemporary fools with no sense of irony continue so to speak in good faith you could have blamed only yourself you would have shrugged your shoulders and made the best of it realizing that no other man had put this wrong upon you but with methousand devilsit is very different i am a man who in one particular at least has chosen his way of life with care i have seen to it that i should walk a road unencumbered by any petticoat what happens what comes of all my careful plans  fate sends an infernal cutthroat to murder our good kingwhose soul god rest eternally and since his son is of an age too tender to wield the sceptre the boys mother does it in his name thus i a soldier being subject to the head of the state find myself by no devising of my own subject to a woman  in itself that is bad enough too bad indeedventregristoo bad yet fate is not content it must occur to this woman to select meme of all mento journey into dauphiny and release another woman from the clutches of yet a third and to what shifts are we not put to what discomforts not subjected you know them rabecque for you have shared them with me but it begins to break upon my mind that what we have endured may be as nothing to what may lie before us it is an ill thing to have to do with women yet you rabecque would have deserted me for one of them  rabecque was silent maybe he was ashamed of himself or maybe that not agreeing with his master he had yet sufficient appreciation of his position to be discreetly silent where his opinions might be at variance thus garnache was encouraged to continue  and what is all this trouble about which they have sent me to set right about a marriage there is a girl wants to marry one man and a woman who wants to marry her to another ponder the possibilities of tragedy in such a situation half this worlds upheavals have had their source in less yet you rabecque would have married  necessity at last turned his discourse to other matters  tell me now said he abruptly in a different tone is there hereabouts a ford  there is a bridge up yonder monsieur returned the servant thankful to have the conversation changed  they rode towards it in silence garnaches eyes set now upon the grey pile that crowned the hillock a halfmile away on the opposite bank of the stream they crossed the bridge and rode up the gently rising bare and rugged ground towards condillac the place wore an entirely peaceful air strong and massive though it appeared it was encircled by a ditch but the drawbridge was down and the rust on its chains argued that long had it been so  none coming to challenge them the pair rode across the planks and the dull thud of their hooves started into activity some one in the gatehouse  a fellow rudely clada hybrid between manatarms and lackeylounged on a musket to confront them in the gateway monsieur de garnache announced his name adding that he came to crave an audience of madame la marquise and the man stood aside to admit him thus he and rabecque rode forward into the roughly paved courtyard  from several doorways other men emerged some of martial bearing showing that the place was garrisoned to some extent garnache took little heed of them he flung his reins to the man whom he had first addressedthe fellow had kept pace beside himand leapt nimbly to the ground bidding rabecque await him there  the soldier lackey resigned the reins to rabecque and requested monsieur de garnache to follow him he led the way through a door on the left down a passage and across an anteroom and ushered the visitor finally into a spacious gloomy hall panelled in black oak and lighted as much by the piledup fire that flared on the noble hearth as by the grey daylight that filtered through the tall mullioned windows  as they entered a livercoloured hound that lay stretched before the fire growled lazily and showed the whites of his eyes paying little attention to the dog garnache looked about him the apartment was handsome beyond praise in a sombre noble fashion it was hung with pictures of departed condillacssome of them rudely wrought enoughwith trophies of ancient armour and with implements of the chase in the centre stood an oblong table of black oak very richly carved about its massive legs and in a china bowl on this an armful of late roses filled the room with their sweet fragrance  then garnache espied a page on the windowseat industriously burnishing a cuirass he pursued his task indifferent to the newcomers advent until the knave who had conducted thither the parisian called the boy and bade him go tell the marquise that a monsieur de garnache with a message from the queenregent begged an audience  the boy rose and simultaneously out of a great chair by the hearth whose tall back had hitherto concealed him there rose another figure this was a stripling of some twenty summerstwentyone in factof a pale beautifully featured face black hair and fine black eyes and very sumptuously clad in a suit of shimmering silk whose colour shifted from green to purple as he moved  monsieur de garnache assumed that he was in the presence of marius de condillac he bowed a trifle stiffly and was surprised to have his bow returned with a graciousness that amounted almost to cordiality  you are from paris monsieur said the young man in a gentle pleasant voice i fear you have had indifferent weather for your journey  garnache thought of other things besides the weather that he had found indifferent and he felt warmed almost to the point of anger at the very recollection but he bowed again and answered amiably enough  the young man offered him a seat assuring him that his mother would not keep him waiting long the page had already gone upon his errand  garnache took the proffered chair and sank down with creak and jingle to warm himself at the fire  from what you have said i gather that you are monsieur marius de condillac said he i as you may have heard me announced by your servant am martin marie rigobert de garnacheat your service  we have heard of you monsieur de garnache said the youth as he crossed his shapely legs of silken violet and fingered the great pearl that depended from his ear but we had thought that by now you would be on your way to paris  no doubtwith margot was the grim rejoinder  but marius either gathered no suggestion from its grimness or did not know the name garnache uttered for he continued  we understood that you were to escort mademoiselle de la vauvraye to paris to place her under the tutelage of the queenregent i will not conceal from you that we were chagrined at the reflection cast upon condillac nevertheless her majestys word is law in dauphiny as much as it is in paris  quite as much and i am relieved to hear you confess it said garnache drily and he scanned more closely the face of this young man he found cause to modify the excellent impression he had received at first mariuss eyebrows were finely pencilled but they arched a shade too much and his eyes were set a trifle too closely the mouth which had seemed beautiful at first looked in addition on this closer inspection weak sensual and cruel  there fell upon the momentary silence the sound of an opening door and both men rose simultaneously to their feet  in the splendid woman that entered monsieur de garnache saw a wonderful likeness to the boy who stood beside him she received the emissary very graciously marius set a chair for her between the two they had been occupying and thus interchanging phrases of agreeable greeting the three sat down about the hearth with every show of the greatest amity  a younger man might have been put out of countenance the womans surpassing beauty her charm of manner her melodious voice falling on the ear soft and gentle as a caress might have turned a man of less firmness a little from his purpose a little perhaps from his loyalty and the duty that had brought him all the way from paris but monsieur de garnache was to her thousand graces as insensible as a man of stone and he came to business briskly he had no mind to spend the day at her fireside in pleasant meaningless talk  madame said he monsieur your son informs me that you have heard of me and of the business that brings me into dauphiny i had not looked for the honour of journeying quite so far as condillac but since monsieur de tressan whom i made my ambassador appears to have failed so signally i am constrained to inflict my presence upon you  inflict quoth she with a pretty look of makebelieve dismay how harsh a word monsieur  the smoothness of the implied compliment annoyed him  i will use any word you think more adequate madame if you will suggest it he answered tartly  there are a dozen i might suggest that would better fit the caseand with more justice to yourself she answered with a smile that revealed a gleam of white teeth behind her scarlet lips marcus bid benoit bring wine monsieur de garnache will no doubt be thirsting after his ride  garnache said nothing acknowledge the courtesy he would not refuse it he could not so he sat and waited for her to speak his eyes upon the fire  madame had already set herself a course keener witted than her son she had readily understood upon garnaches being announced to her that his visit meant the failure of the imposture by which she had sought to be rid of him  i think monsieur she said presently watching him from under her lids that we have all of us who are concerned in mademoiselle de la vauvrayes affairs been at crosspurposes she is an impetuous impulsive child and it happened that some little time ago we had wordssuch things will happen in the most united families whilst the heat of her foolish anger was upon her she wrote a letter to the queen in which she desired to be removed from my tutelage since then monsieur she has come to repent her of it you who no doubt understand a womans mind  set out upon no such presumption madame he interrupted i know as little of a womans mind as any man who thinks he knows a dealand that is nothing  she laughed as at an excellent jest and marius overhearing garnaches retort as he was returning to resume his seat joined in her laugh  paris is a fine whetstone for a mans wits said he  garnache shrugged his shoulders  i take it madame that you wish me to understand that mademoiselle de la vauvraye repenting of her letter desires no longer to repair to paris desires in fact to remain here at condillac in your excellent care  you apprehend the position exactly monsieur  to my mind said he it presents few features difficult of apprehension  mariuss eyes flashed his mother a look of relief but the marquise who had an ear more finely trained caught the vibration of a second meaning in the emissarys words  all being as you say madame he continued will you tell me why instead of some message to this purport you sent monsieur de tressan back to me with a girl taken from some kitchen or barnyard whom it was sought to pass off upon me as mademoiselle de la vauvraye  the marquise laughed and her son who had shown signs of perturbation taking his cue from her laughed too  it was a jest monsieurshe told him miserably conscious that the explanation could sound no lamer  my compliments madame upon the humour that prevails in dauphiny but your jest failed of its purpose it did not amuse me nor so far as i could discern was monsieur de tressan greatly taken with it but all this is of little moment madame he continued since you tell me that mademoiselle de la vauvraye is content to remain here i am satisfied that it is so  they were the very words that she desired to hear from him yet his manner of uttering them gave her little reassurance the smile on her lips was forced her watchful eyes smiled not at all  still he continued you will be so good as to remember that i am not my own master in this affair were that so i should not fail to relieve you at once of my unbidden presence  oh monsieur  but being the queens emissary i have her orders to obey and those orders are to convey mademoiselle de la vauvraye to paris they make no allowance for any change that may have occurred in mademoiselles inclinations if the journey is now distasteful to her she has but her own rashness to blame in having sought it herself what imports is that she is bidden by the queen to repair to paris as a loyal subject she must obey the queens commands you as a loyal subject must see to it that she obeys them so madame i count upon your influence with mademoiselle to see that she is ready to set out by noon tomorrow one day already has been wasted me by yourahjest madame the queen likes her ambassadors to be brisk  the dowager reclined in her chair and bit her lip this man was too keen for her she had no illusions he had seen through her as if she had been made of glass he had penetrated her artifices and detected her falsehoods yet feigning to believe her and them he had first neutralized her only weaponsother than offensivethen used them for her own defeat marius it was who took up the conversation  monsieur he criedand there was a frown drawing together his fine browswhat you suggest amounts to a tyranny on the queens part  garnache was on his feet his chair grating the polished floor  monsieur says quoth he his glittering eye challenging the rash boy to repeat his words  but the dowager intervened with a little trill of laughter  bon dieu marius what are you saying foolish boy and you monsieur de garnache do not heed him i beg you we are so far from court in this little corner of dauphiny and my son has been reared in so free an atmosphere that he is sometimes betrayed into expressions whose impropriety he does not realize  garnache bowed in token of his perfect satisfaction and at that moment two servants entered bearing flagons and beakers fruits and sweetmeats which they placed upon the table the dowager rose and went to do the honours of the board the servants withdrew  you will taste our wine of condillac monsieur  he acquiesced expressing thanks and watched her fill a beaker for him one for herself and another for her son she brought him the cup in her hands he took it with a grave inclination of the head then she proffered him the sweetmeats to take one he set down the cup on the table by which he had also come to stand his left hand was gloved and held his beaver and whip  she nibbled herself at one of the comfits and he followed her example the boy a trifle sullen since the last words stood on the hearth with his back to the fire his hands clasped behind him  monsieur she said do you think it would enable you to comply with what i have signified to be not only our own wishes but those of mademoiselle de la vauvraye herself if she were to state them to you  he looked up sharply his lips parting in a smile that revealed his strong white teeth  are you proposing another of your jests madame  she laughed outright a wonderful assurance was hers thought monsieur de garnache mon dieu no monsieur she cried if you will you may see the lady herself  he took a turn in the apartment idly as does a man in thought  very well said he at last i do not say that it will alter my determination but perhapsyes i should be glad of an opportunity of the honour of making mademoiselle de la vauvrayes acquaintance but no impersonations i beg madame he said it halflaughingly taking his cue from her  you need have no fear of any  she walked to the door opened it and called gaston in answer came the page whom garnache had found in the room when he was admitted  desire mademoiselle de la vauvraye to come to us here at once she bade the boy and closed the door  garnache had been all eyes for some furtive sign some whispered word but he had surprised neither  his pacing had brought him to the opposite end of the board where stood the cup of wine madame had poured for marius his own garnache had left untouched as if abstractedly he now took up the beaker pledged madame with his glance and drank she watched him and suddenly a suspicion darted through her minda suspicion that he suspected them  dieu what a man was this he took no chances madame reflected that this augured ill for the success of the last resource upon which should all else fail she was counting to keep mademoiselle at condillac it seemed incredible that one so wary and watchful should have committed the rashness of venturing alone into condillac without taking his precautions to ensure his ability to retreat  in her heart she felt daunted by him but in the matter of that winethe faintest of smiles hovered on her lips her eyebrows went up a shade then she took up the cup that had been poured for the parisian and bore it to her son  marius you are not drinking said she and seeing a command in her eyes he took the beaker from her hand and bore it to his lips emptying the half of it whilst with the faintest smile of scorn the dowager swept garnache a glance of protest as of one repudiating an unworthy challenge  then the door opened and the eyes of all three were centred upon the girl that entered     chapter v monsieur de garnache loses his temper   you sent for me madame said the girl seeming to hesitate upon the threshold of the room and her voicea pleasant boyish contraltowas very cold and conveyed a suggestion of disdain  the marquise detected that inauspicious note and was moved by it to regret her already of having embarked upon so bold a game as to confront monsieur de garnache with valerie it was a step she had decided upon as a last means of convincing the parisian of the truth of her statement touching the change that had taken place in mademoiselles inclinations and she had provided for it as soon as she heard of garnaches arrival by informing mademoiselle that should she be sent for she must tell the gentleman from paris that it was her wish to remain at condillac mademoiselle had incontinently refused and madame to win her compliance had resorted to threats  you will do as you consider best of course she had said in a voice that was ominously sweet but i promise you that if you do otherwise than as i tell you you shall be married before sunset to marius whether you be willing or not monsieur de garnache comes alone and if i so will it alone he shall depart or not at all i have men enough at condillac to see my orders carried out no matter what they be  you may tell yourself that this fellow will return to help you perhaps he will but when he does it will be too late so far as you shall be concerned  terrified by that threat valerie had blenched and had felt her spirit deserting her  and if i comply madame she had asked if i do as you wish if i tell this gentleman that i no longer desire to go to pariswhat then  the dowagers manner had become more affectionate she had patted the shrinking girl upon the shoulder in that case valerie you shall suffer no constraint you shall continue here as you have done  and has there been no constraint hitherto had been the girls indignant rejoinder  hardly child the dowager had returned we have sought to guide you to a wise choiceno more than that nor shall we do more hereafter if you do my pleasure now and give this monsieur de garnache the answer that i bid you but if you fail me rememberyou marry marius before nightfall  she had not waited for the girl to promise her compliance she was too clever a woman to show anxiety on that score she left her with that threat vibrating in her mind confident that she would scare the girl into obedience by the very assurance she exhibited that valerie would not dare to disobey  but now at the sound of that chill voice at the sight of that calm resolved countenance madame was regretting that she had not stayed to receive the girls promise before she made so very sure of her pliability  she glanced anxiously at garnache his eyes were upon the girl he was remarking the slender supple figure moderately tall and looking taller in its black gown of mourning the oval face a trifle pale now from the agitation that stirred her with its fine level brows its clear hazel eyes and its crown of lustrous brown hair rolled back under the daintiest of white coifs his glance dwelt appreciatively on the slender nose with its delicate nostrils the charming line of mouth and chin the dazzling whiteness of her skin conspicuous not only in neck and face but in the long slender hands that were clasped before her  these signs of breeding everywhere proclaimed left him content that here was no imposture the girl before him was indeed valerie de la vauvraye  at madames invitation she came forward marius hastened to close the door and to set a chair for her his manner an admirable suggestion of ardour restrained by deference  she sat down with an outward calm under which none would have suspected the full extent of her agitation and she bent her eyes upon the man whom the queen had sent for her deliverance  after all garnaches appearance was hardly suggestive of the role of perseus which had been thrust upon him she saw a tall spare man with prominent cheekbones a gaunt highbridged nose very fierce mustachios and a pair of eyes that were as keen as swordblades and felt to her glance as penetrating there was little about him like to take a womans fancy or claim more than a moderate share of her attention even when circumstances rendered her as interested in him as was now mademoiselle de la vauvraye  there fell a silence broken at last by marius who leaned a supple graceful figure his elbow resting upon the summit of valeries chair  monsieur de garnache does us the injustice to find a difficulty in believing that you no longer wish to leave us  that was by no means what garnache had implied still since it really expressed his mind he did not trouble to correct marius  valerie said nothing but her eyes travelled to madames countenance where she found a frown garnache observed the silence and drew his own conclusions  so we have sent for you valerie said the dowager taking up her sons sentence that you may yourself assure monsieur de garnache that it is so  her voice was stern it bore to the girls ears a subtle unworded repetition of the threat the marquise had already voiced mademoiselle caught it and garnache caught it too although he failed to interpret it as precisely as he would have liked  the girl seemed to experience a difficulty in answering her eyes roved to garnaches and fell away in affright before their glitter that mans glance seemed to read her very mind she thought and suddenly the reflection that had terrified her became her hope if it were as she deemed it what matter what she said he would know the truth in spite of all  yes madame she said at last and her voice was wholly void of expression yes monsieur it is as madame says it is my wish to remain at condillac  from the dowager standing a pace or two away from garnache came the sound of a halfsigh garnache missed nothing he caught the sound and accepted it as an expression of relief the marquise stepped back a pace idly one might have thought not so thought garnache it had this advantage that it enabled her to stand where he might not watch her face without turning his head he was content that such was her motive to defeat her object to show her that he had guessed it he stepped back too also with that same idleness of air so that he was once more in line with her and then he spoke addressing valerie  mademoiselle that you should have written to the queen in haste is deplorable now that your views have undergone this change i am a stupid man mademoiselle just a blunt soldier with orders to obey and no authority to think my orders are to conduct you to paris your will was not taken into consideration i know not how the queen would have me act seeing your reluctance it may be that she would elect to leave you here as you desire but it is not for me to arrogate to determine the queens mind i can but be guided by her orders and those orders leave me no course but oneto ask you mademoiselle to make ready immediately to go with me  the look of relief that swept into valeries face the little flush of colour that warmed her cheeks hitherto so pale were all the confirmation that he needed of what he suspected  but monsieur said marius it must be plain to you that since the queens orders are but a compliance with mademoiselles wishes now that mademoiselles wishes have altered so too would her majestys commands alter to comply with them once more  that may be plain to you monsieur for me unfortunately there are my orders for only guide garnache persisted does not mademoiselle herself agree with me  she was about to speak her glance had looked eager her lips had parted then of a sudden the little colour faded from her cheeks again and she seemed stricken with a silence garnaches eyes directed in a sidelong glance to the marquises face surprised there a frown that had prompted that sudden change  he halfturned his manner changing suddenly to a freezing civility  madame la marquise said he i beg with all deference to suggest that i am not allowed the interview you promised me with mademoiselle de la vauvraye  the ominous coldness with which he had begun to speak had had a disturbing effect upon the dowager the words he uttered when she had weighed them brought an immense relief it seemed then that he but needed convincing that this was mademoiselle de la vauvraye this argued that for the rest he was satisfied  there monsieur you are at fault she cried and she was smiling into his grave eyes because once i put that jest upon you you imagine  no no he broke in you misapprehend me i do not say that this is not mademoiselle de la vauvraye i do not say that  he paused he was at the end of his resources he did not know how to put the thing without giving offence and it had been his resolverealizing the necessity for itto conduct this matter with a grave courtesy  to feel that after having carried the affair so far with a for himcommendable lightness of touch he should be at a loss for a delicate word to convey a harsh accusation began to anger him and once garnache began to be angered the rest followed quickly it was just that flaw in his character that had been the ruin of him that had blighted what otherwise might have been a brilliant career astute and wily as a fox brave as a lion and active as a panther gifted with intelligence insight and resource he had carried a dozen enterprises up to the very threshold of success there to have ruined them all by giving way to some sudden access of choler  so was it now his pause was but momentary yet in that moment from calm and freezing that he had been he became ruffled and hot the change was visible in his heightened colour in his flashing eyes and in his twitching mustachios for just a second he sought to smother his wrath he had a glimmer of remembrance of the need for caution and diplomacy in the darkness of anger that was descending over him then without further warning he exploded  his nervous sinewy hand clenched itself and fell with a crash upon the table overturning a flagon and sending a lake of wine across the board to trickle over at a dozen points and form in puddles at the feet of valerie startled they all watched him mademoiselle the most startled of the three  madame he thundered i have been receiving dancinglessons at your hands for long enough it is time i think we did a little ordinary walking else shall we get no farther along the road i mean to go and that is the road to paris with mademoiselle for company  monsieur monsieur cried the startled marquise placing herself intrepidly before him and marius trembled for her for so wild did the man seem that he almost feared he might strike her  i have heard enough he blazed not another word from any here in condillac ill take this lady with me now at once and if any here raises a finger to resist me as heaven is my witness it will be the last resistance he will ever offer any man let a hand be laid upon me or a sword bared before my eyes and i swear madame that ill come back and burn this dunghill of rebellion to the ground  in the blindness of his passion all his fine keenness was cast to the wind his allobserving watchfulness was smothered in the cloud of anger that oppressed his brain he never saw the sign that madame made to her son never so much as noticed mariuss stealthy progress towards the door  oh he continued a satirical note running now through his tempestuous voice it is a fine thing to cozen each other with honeyed words with smirks and with grimaces but we have done with that madame he towered grimly above her shaking a threatening finger in her very face we have done with that we shall resort to deeds instead  aye monsieur she answered very coldly sneering upon his redhot fury there shall be deeds enough to satisfy even your outrageous thirst for them  that cold sneering voice with its note of threat was like a hand of ice upon his overheated brain it cooled him on the instant he stiffened and looked about him he saw that marius had disappeared and that mademoiselle had risen and was regarding him with singularly imploring eyes  he bit his lip in mortified chagrin he cursed himself inwardly for a fool and a doltthe more pitiable because he accounted himself cunning above others had he but kept his temper had he done no more than maintain the happy pretence that he was a slave to the orders he had receiveda mere machinehe might have gained his ends by sheer audacity at least his way of retreat would have remained open and he might have gone to return another day with force at his heels  as it was that pretty whelp her son had been sent no doubt for men he stepped up to valerie  are you ready mademoiselle said he for little hope though he might still have of winning through yet he must do the best to repair the damage that was of his making  she saw that the storm of passion had passed and she was infected by the sudden desperate daring that prompted that question of his  i am ready monsieur said she and her boyish voice had an intrepid ring i will come with you as i am  then in gods name let us be going  they moved together towards the door with never another glance for the dowager where she stood patting the head of the hound that had risen and come to stand beside her in silence she watched them a sinister smile upon her beautiful ivory face  then came a sound of feet and voices in the anteroom the door was flung violently open and a halfdozen men with naked swords came blundering into the room marius bringing up the rear  with a cry of fear valerie shrank back against the panelled wall her little hands to her cheeks her eyes dilating with alarm  garnaches sword rasped out an oath rattled from his clenched teeth and he fell on guard the men paused and took his measure marius urged them on as if they had been a pack of dogs  at him he snapped his finger pointing his handsome eyes flashing angrily cut him down  they moved but mademoiselle moved at the same moment she sprang before them between their swords and their prey  you shall not do it you shall not do it she cried and her face looked drawn her eyes distraught it is murdermurder you curs and the memory of how that dainty little lady stood undaunted before so much bared steel to shield him from those assassins was one that abode ever after with garnache  mademoiselle said he in a quiet voice if you will but stand aside there will be some murder done among them first  but she did not move marius clenched his hands fretted by the delay the dowager looked on and smiled and patted her dogs head to her mademoiselle now turned in appeal  madame she exclaimed youll not allow it youll not let them do this thing bid them put up their swords madame bethink you that monsieur de garnache is here in the queens name  too well did madame bethink her of it garnache need not plague himself with vexation that his rash temper alone had wrought his ruin now it had but accelerated it it was just possible perhaps that suavity might have offered him opportunities but for the rest from the moment that he showed himself firm in his resolve to carry mademoiselle to paris his doom was sealed madame would never willingly have allowed him to leave condillac alive for she realized that did she do so he would stir up trouble enough to have them outlawed he must perish here and be forgotten if questions came to be asked later condillac would know nothing of him  monsieur de garnache promised us some fine deeds on his own account she mocked him we but afford him the opportunity to perform them if these be not enough for his exceeding valour there are more men without whom we can summon  a feeling of pity for mademoiselleperhaps of no more than decencynow overcame marius he stepped forward  valerie he said it is not fitting you should remain  aye take her hence the dowager bade him with a smile her presence is unmanning our fine parisian  eager to do so overeager marius came forward past his menatarms until he was but some three paces from the girl and just out of reach of a sudden dart of garnaches sword  softly very warily garnache slipped his right foot a little farther to the right suddenly he threw his weight upon it so that he was clear of the girl before they understood what he was about the thing had taken place he had leaped forward caught the young man by the breast of his shimmering doublet leaped back to shelter beyond mademoiselle hurled marius to the ground and planted his foot shod as it was in his thickly mudded ridingboot full upon the boys long shapely neck  move so much as a finger my pretty fellow he snapped at him and ill crush the life from you as from a toad  there was a sudden forward movement on the part of the men but if garnache was vicious he was calm were he again to lose his temper now there would indeed be a speedy end to him that much he knew and kept repeating to himself lest he should be tempted to forget it  back he bade them in a voice so imperative that they stopped and looked on with gaping mouths back or he perishes and dropping the point of his sword he lightly rested it upon the young mans breast  in dismay they looked to the dowager for instruction she craned forward the smile gone from her lips a horror in her eyes her bosom heaving a moment ago she had smiled upon mademoiselles outward signs of fear had mademoiselle been so minded she might in her turn have smiled now at the terror written large upon the dowagers own face but her attention was all absorbed by the swiftly executed act by which garnache had gained at least a temporary advantage  she had turned and looked at the strange spectacle of that dauntless man erect his foot upon mariuss neck like some fantastic figure of a contemporary saint george and a contemporary dragon she pressed her hands tighter upon her bosom her eyes sparkled with an odd approval of that brisk deed  but garnaches watchful eyes were upon the dowager he read the anxious fear that marred the beauty of her face and he took heart at the sight for he was dependent upon the extent to which he might work upon her feelings  you smiled just now madame when it was intended to butcher a man before your eyes you smile no longer i observe at this the first of the fine deeds i promised you  let him go she said and her voice was scarce louder than a whisper horrorladen let him go monsieur if you would save your own neck  at that price yesthough believe me you are paying too much for so poor a life as this still you value the thing and i hold it and so youll forgive me if i am extortionate  release him and in gods name go your ways none shall stay you she promised him  he smiled ill need some security for that i do not choose to take your word for it madame de condillac  what security can i give you she cried wringing her hands her eyes on the boys ashen face ashen from mingling fear and ragewhere it showed beyond garnaches heavy boot  bid one of your knaves summon my servant i left him awaiting me in the courtyard  the order was given and one of the cutthroats departed  in a tense and anxious silence they awaited his return though he kept them but an instant  rabecques eyes took on a startled look when he had viewed the situation garnache called to him to deprive those present of their weapons  and let none refuse or offer him violence he added or your masters life shall pay the price of it  the dowager with a ready anxiety repeated to them his commands rabecque understanding nothing went from man to man and received from each his weapons he placed the armful on the windowseat at the far end of the apartment as garnache bade him at the other end of the long room garnache ordered the disarmed men to range themselves when that was done the parisian removed his foot from his victims neck  stand up he commanded and marius very readily obeyed him  garnache placed himself immediately behind the boy madame said he no harm shall come to your son if he is but wise let him disobey me or let any man in condillac lift a hand against us and that shall be the signal for monsieur de condillacs death mademoiselle it is your wish to accompany me to paris  yes monsieur she answered fearlessly her eyes sparkling now  we will be going then place yourself alongside of monsieur de condillac rabecque follow me forward monsieur de condillac you will be so good as to conduct us to our horses in the courtyard  they made an odd procession as they marched out of the hall under the sullen eyes of the baulked cutthroats and their mistress on the threshold garnache paused and looked over his shoulder  are you content madame have you seen fine deeds enough for one day he asked her laughing but white to the lips with chagrin she returned no answer  garnache and his party crossed the anteroom after having taken the precaution to lock the door upon the marquise and her men and proceeding down a gloomy passage they gained the courtyard here marius was consoled to find some men of the garrison of condillac a halfscore or soall more or less armed surrounding the horses of garnache and his lackey at sight of the odd group that now appeared those ruffians stood at gaze surprised and with suspicions aroused by garnaches naked sword ready for anything their master might demand of them  marius had in that instant a gleam of hope thus far garnache had been master of the situation but surely the position would be reversed when garnache and his man came to mount their horses particularly considering how hampered they must be by valerie this danger garnache however was no less quick to perceive and with a dismaying promptness did he take his measures  remember he threatened monsieur de condillac if any of your men show their teeth it will be the worse for you they had come to a halt on the threshold of the courtyard you will be so good as to bid them retreat through that doorway across the yard yonder  marius hesitated and if i refuse he demanded hardily but keeping his back to garnache the men stirred and stray words of mingling wonder and anger reached the parisian  you will not said garnache with quiet confidence  i think you make too sure marius replied and dissembled his misgivings in a short laugh garnache became impatient his position was not being improved by delay  monsieur de condillac said he speaking quickly and yet with an incisiveness of tone that made his words sound deliberate i am a desperate man in a desperate position every moment that i tarry here increases my danger and shortens my temper if you think to temporize in the hope of gaining an opportunity of turning the tables upon me you must be mad to dream that i shall permit it monsieur you will at once order those men to leave the courtyard by that doorway or i give you my word of honour that i shall run you through as you stand  that would be to destroy yourself said marius with an attempted note of confidence  i should be no less destroyed by delay answered garnache and added more sharply give the word monsieur or i will make an end  from the movement behind him marius guessed almost by instinct that garnache had drawn back for a lunge at his side valerie looked over her shoulder with eyes that were startled but unafraid for a second marius considered whether he might not attempt to elude garnache by a wild and sudden dash towards his men but the consequences of failure were too fearful  he shrugged his shoulders and gave the order the men hesitated a moment then shuffled away in the direction indicated but they went slowly with much halfwhispered sullen conferring and many a backward glance at marius and those with him  bid them go faster snapped garnache marius obeyed him and the men obeyed marius and vanished into the gloom of the archway after all thought monsieur de condillac they need go no farther than that doorway they must have appreciated the situation by now and he was confident they would have the sense to hold themselves in readiness for a rush in the moment of garnaches mounting  but garnaches next order shattered that last hope  rebecque said he without turning his head go and lock them in before bidding the men go that way he had satisfied himself that there was a key on the outside of the door monsieur de condillac he resumed to marius you will order your men in no way to hinder my servant i shall act upon any menace of danger to my lackey precisely as i should were i myself in danger  mariuss heart sank within him as sinks a stone through water he realized as his mother had realized a little while before that in garnache they had an opponent who took no chances in a voice thick with the torturing rage of impotence he gave the order upon which the grim parisian insisted there followed a silence broken by the fall of rabecques heavily shod feet upon the stones of the yard as he crossed it to do his masters bidding the door creaked on its hinges the key grated screaming in its lock and rabecque returned to garnaches side even as garnache tapped marius on the shoulder  this way monsieur de condillac if you please said he and as marius turned at last to face him he stood aside and waved his left hand towards the door through which they had lately emerged a moment stood the youth facing his stern conqueror his hands were clenched until the knuckles showed white his face was a dull crimson vainly he sought for words in which to vent some of the malicious chagrin that filled his soul almost to burstingpoint then despairing with a shrug and an inarticulate mutter he flung past the parisian obeying him as the cur obeys with pendant tail and teethrevealing snarl  garnache closed the door upon him with a bang and smiled quietly as he turned to valerie  i think we have won through mademoiselle said he with pardonable vanity the rest is easy though you may be subjected to some slight discomfort between this and grenoble  she smiled back at him a pale timid smile like a gleam of sunshine from a wintry sky that matters nothing she assured him and strove to make her voice sound brave  there was need for speed and compliments were set aside by garnache who at his best was not felicitous with them valerie felt herself caught by the wrist a trifle roughly she remembered afterwards and hurried across the cobbles to the tethered horses with which rabecque was already busy she saw garnache raise his foot to the stirrup and hoist himself to the saddle then he held down a hand to her bade her set her foot on his and called with an oath to rabecque to lend her his assistance a moment later she was perched in front of garnache almost on the withers of his horse the cobbles rattled under its hooves the timbers of the drawbridge sent up a booming sound they were acrossout of condillacand speeding at a gallop down the white road that led to the river after them pounded rabecque bumping horribly in his saddle and attempting wildly and with awful objurgations to find his stirrups  they crossed the bridge that spans the isere and took the road to grenoble at a sharp pace with scarce a backward glance at the grey towers of condillac valerie experienced an overwhelming inclination to weep and laugh to cry and sing at one and the same time but whether this odd emotion sprang from the happenings in which she had had her part or from the exhilaration of that mad ride she could not tell no doubt it sprang from both owing a part to each she controlled herself however a shy upward glance at the stern set face of the man whose arm encircled and held her fast had a curiously sobering effect upon her their eyes met and he smiled a friendly reassuring smile such as a father might have bestowed upon a daughter  i do not think that they will charge me with blundering this time he said  charge you with blundering she echoed and the inflection of the pronoun might have flattered him had he not reflected that it was impossible she could have understood his allusion and now she bethought her that she had not thanked himand the debt was a heavy one he had come to her aid in an hour when hope seemed dead he had come singlehandedsave for his man rabecque and in a manner that was worthy of being made the subject of an epic he had carried her out of condillac away from the terrible dowager and her cutthroats the thought of them sent a shiver through her  do you feel the cold he asked concernedly and that the wind might cut her less he slackened speed  no no she cried her alarm waking again at the thought of the folk of condillac make haste go on go on mon dieu if they should overtake us  he looked over his shoulder the road ran straight for over a halfmile behind them and not a living thing showed upon it  you need have no alarm he smiled we are not pursued they must have realized the futility of attempting to overtake us courage mademoiselle we shall be in grenoble presently and once there you will have nothing more to fear  you are sure of that she asked and there was doubt in her voice  he smiled reassuringly again the lord seneschal shall supply us with an escort he promised confidently  still she said we shall not stay there i hope monsieur  no longer than may be necessary to procure a coach for you  i am glad of that said she i shall know no peace until grenoble is a good ten leagues behind us the marquise and her son are too powerful there  yet their might shall not prevail against the queens he made reply and as now they rode amain she fell to thanking him shyly at first then as she gathered confidence in her subject with a greater fervour but he interrupted her ere she had gone far mademoiselle de la vauvraye said he you overstate the matter his tone was chilling almost and she felt as she had been rebuked i am no more than the emissary of her majestyit is to her that your thanks are due  ah but monsieur she returned to the assault i owe some thanks to you as well what other in your place would have done what you have done  i know not that nor do i greatly care said he and laughed but with a laugh that jarred on her that which i did i must have done no matter whom it was a question of saving i am but an instrument in this matter mademoiselle  his thought was to do no more than belittle the service he had rendered her to stem her flow of gratitude since indeed he felt as he said that it was to the queenregent her thanks were due all unwitting was itout of his ignorance of the ways of thought of a sex with which he held the view that it is an ill thing to meddlethat he wounded her by his disclaimer in which her sensitive maiden fancy imagined a something that was almost contemptuous  they rode in silence for a little spell broken at last by garnache in expression of the thoughts that had come to him as a consequence of what she had said  on this same subject of thanks said heand as she raised her eyes again she found him smiling almost tenderlyif any are due between us they are surely due from me to you  from you to me she asked in wonder  assuredly said he had you not come between me and the dowagers assassins there had been an end to me in the hall of condillac  her hazel eyes were very round for a moment then they narrowed and little humorous lines formed at the corners of her lips  monsieur de garnache said she with a mock coldness that was a faint echo of his own recent manner you overstate the case that which i did i must have done no matter whom it was a question of saving i was but an instrument in this matter monsieur  his brows went up he stared at her a moment gathering instruction from the shy mockery of her glance then he laughed with genuine amusement  true he said an instrument you were but an instrument of heaven whereas in me you but behold the instrument of an earthly power we are not quite quits you see  but she felt at least that she was quits with him in the matter of his repudiation of her own thanks and the feeling bridged the unfriendly gap that she had felt was opening out between them and for no reason in the world that she could think of she was glad that this was so     chapter vi monsieur de garnache keeps his temper   night had fallen and it had begun to rain when garnache and valerie reached grenoble they entered the town afoot the parisian not desiring to attract attention by being seen in the streets with a lady on the withers of his horse  with thought for her comfort monsieur de garnache had divested himself of his heavy horsemans cloak and insisted upon her assuming it so setting it about her that her head was covered as by a wimple thus was she protected not only from the rain but from the gaze of the inquisitive  they made their way in the drizzle through the greasy slippery streets ashine with the lights that fell from door and window rabecque following closely with the horses garnache made straight for his innthe auberge du veau qui tetewhich enjoyed the advantage of facing the palais seneschal  the ostler took charge of the nags and the landlord conducted them to a room abovestairs which he placed at mademoiselles disposal that done garnache left rabecque on guard and proceeded to make the necessary arrangements for the journey that lay before them he began by what he conceived to be the more urgent measure and stepping across to the palais seneschal he demanded to see monsieur de tressan at once  ushered into the lord seneschals presence he startled that obese gentleman by the announcement that he had returned from condillac with mademoiselle de la vauvraye and that he would require an escort to accompany them to paris  for i am by no means minded to be exposed to such measures as the tigress of condillac and her cub may take to recover their victim he explained with a grim smile  the seneschal combed his beard and screwed up his pale eyes until they vanished in the cushions of his cheeks he was lost in amazement he could only imagine that the queens emissary had been duped more successfully this time  i am to gather then said he dissembling what was passing through his mind that you delivered the lady by force or strategy  by both monsieur was the short answer  tressan continued to comb his beard and pondered the situation if things were so indeed they could not have fallen out more to his taste he had had no hand in it one way or the other he had run with the hare and hunted with the hounds and neither party could charge him with any lack of loyalty his admiration and respect for monsieur de garnache grew enormously when the rash parisian had left him that afternoon for the purpose of carrying his message himself to condillac tressan had entertained little hope of ever again seeing him alive yet there he stood as calm and composed as ever announcing that singlehanded he had carried out what another might well have hesitated to attempt with a regiment at his heels  tressans curiosity urged him to beg for the details of this marvel and garnache entertained him with a brief recital of what had taken place whereat realizing that garnache had indeed outwitted them the seneschals wonder increased  but we are not out of the quagmire yet cried garnache and that is why i want an escort  tressan became uneasy how many men shall you require he asked thinking that the parisian would demand at least the half of a company  a halfdozen and a sergeant to command them  tressans uneasiness was dissipated and he found himself despising garnache more for his rashness in being content with so small a number than he respected him for the boldness and courage he had so lately displayed it was not for him to suggest that the force might prove insufficient rather was it for him to be thankful that garnache had not asked for more an escort tressan dared not refuse him and yet refuse it him he must have doneor broken with the condillacshad he asked for a greater number but six men pooh they would be of little account so he very readily consented inquiring how soon garnache would require them  at once was the parisians answer i leave grenoble tonight i hope to set out in an hours time meanwhile ill have the troopers form a guard of honour i am lodged over the way  tressan but too glad to be quit of him rose there and then to give the necessary orders and within ten minutes garnache was back at the sucking calf with six troopers and a sergeant who had left their horses in the seneschals stables until the time for setting out meanwhile garnache placed them on duty in the commonroom of the inn  he called for refreshment for them and bade them remain there at the orders of his man rabecque his reason for this step was that it became necessary that he should absent himself for a while to find a carriage suitable for the journey for as the sucking calf was not a posthouse he must seek one elsewhereat the auberge de france in fact which was situate on the eastern side of the town by the porte de savoieand he was not minded to leave the person of valerie unguarded during his absence the halfdozen troopers he considered ample as indeed they were  on this errand he departed wrapped tightly in his cloak walking briskly through the now heavier rain  but at the auberge de france a disappointment awaited him the host had no horses and no carriage nor would he have until the following morning he was sorrowstricken that the circumstance should discompose monsieur de garnache he was elaborate in his explanations of how it happened that he could place no vehicle at monsieur de garnaches disposalso elaborate that it is surprising monsieur de garnaches suspicions should not have been aroused for the truth of the matter was that the folk of condillac had been at the auberge de france before himas they had been elsewhere in the town wherever a conveyance might be procurableand by promises of reward for obedience and threats of punishment for disobedience they had contrived that garnache should hear this same story on every hand his mistake had lain in his eagerness to obtain a guard from the seneschal had he begun by making sure of a conveyance anticipating as he should have done this move on the part of the condillacsa move which he did not even now suspectit is possible that he might have been spared much of the trouble that was to follow  an hour or so later after having vainly ransacked the town for the thing he needed he returned wet and annoyed to the veau qui tote in a corner of the spacious commonrooma corner by the door leading to the interior of the innhe saw the six troopers at table waxing a trifle noisy over cards their sergeant sat a little apart in conversation with the landlords wife eyes upturned adoringly oblivious of the increasing scowl that gathered about her watchful husbands brow  at another table sat four gentlemenseemingly travellers by their air and garbin a conversation that was hushed at garnaches entrance but he paid no heed to them as he stalked with ringing step across the rushstrewn floor nor observed how covertly and watchfully their glances followed him as returning in passing the sergeants prompt salute he vanished through the doorway leading to the stairs  he reappeared again a moment later to call the host and give him orders for the preparing of his own and rabecques supper  on the landing above he found rabecque awaiting him  is all well he asked and received from his lackey a reassuring answer  mademoiselle welcomed him gladly his long absence it appeared had been giving her concern he told her on what errand he had been and alarm overspread her face upon hearing its result  but monsieur she cried you are not proposing that i should remain a night in grenoble  what alternative have we he asked and his brows met impatient at what he accounted no more than feminine whimsey  it is not safe she exclaimed her fears increasing you do not know how powerful are the condillacs  he strode to the fire and the logs hissed under the pressure of his wet boot he set his back to the blaze and smiled down upon her  nor do you know how powerful are we he answered easily i have below six troopers and a sergeant of the seneschals regiment with myself and rabecque we are nine men in all that should be a sufficient guard mademoiselle nor do i think that with all their power the condillacs will venture here to claim you at the sword point  and yet she answered for all that she was plainly reassured at least in part i would rather you had got me a horse that we might have ridden to saint marcellin where no doubt a carriage might be obtained  i did not see the need to put you to so much discomfort he returned it is raining heavily  oh what of that she flung back impatiently  besides he added it seems there are no horses at the posthouse a benighted place this dauphiny of yours mademoiselle  but she never heeded the gibe at her native province no horses she echoed and her hazel eyes looked up sharply the alarm returning to her face she rose and approached him surely that is impossible  i assure you that it is as i sayneither at the posthouse nor at any of the inns i visited could i find me a spare horse  monsieur she cried i see the hand of condillac in this  as how he inquired and his tone again was quickened by impatience  they have anticipated you they seek to keep you hereto keep us in grenoble  but to what end he asked his impatience growing the auberge de france has promised me a carriage in the morning what shall it avail them at condillac to keep us here tonight  they may have some project oh monsieur i am full of fears  dismiss them he answered lightly and to reassure her he added smiling rest assured we shall keep good watch over you rabecque and i and the troopers a guard shall remain in the passage throughout the night rabecque and i will take turn about at sentrygo will that give you peace  you are very good she said her voice quivering with feeling and real gratitude and as he was departing she called after him you will be careful of yourself she said  he paused under the lintel and turned surprised it is a habit of mine said he with a glint of humour in his eye  but there was no answering smile from her her face was all anxiety  beware of pitfalls she bade him go warily they are cruelly cunning those folk of condillac and if evil should befall you  there would still remain rabecque and the troopers he concluded  she shrugged her shoulders i implore you to be careful she insisted  you may depend upon me he said and closed the door  outside he called rabecque and together they went below but mindful of her fears he dispatched one of the troopers to stand sentry outside her door whilst he and his lackey supped that done he called the host and set himself at table rabecque at his elbow in attendance to hand him the dishes and pour his wine  across the lowceilinged room the four travellers still sat in talk and as garnache seated himself one of them shouted for the host and asked in an impatient tone to know if his supper was soon to come  in a moment sir answered the landlord respectfully and he turned again to the parisian he went out to bring the latters meal and whilst he was gone rabecque heard from his master the reason of their remaining that night in grenoble the inference drawn by the astute lackeyand freely expressed by himfrom the lack of horses or carriages in grenoble that night coincided oddly with valeries he too gave it as his opinion that his master had been forestalled by the dowagers people and without presuming to advise garnache to go warilya piece of advice that garnache would have resented to the extent perhaps of boxing the fellows earshe determined there and then to keep a close watch upon his master and under no circumstances if possible permit him to leave the sucking calf that night  the host returned bearing a platter on which there steamed a ragout that gave out an appetizing odour his wife followed with other dishes and a bottle of armagnac under her arm rabecque busied himself at once and his hungry master disposed himself to satisfy the healthiest appetite in france when suddenly a shadow fell across the table a man had come to stand beside it his body screening the light of one of the lamps that hung from a rafter of the ceiling  at last he exclaimed and his voice was harsh with illhumour  garnache looked up pausing in the very act of helping himself to that ragout rabecque looked up from behind his master and his lips tightened the host looked up from the act of drawing the cork of the flagon he had taken from his wife and his eyes grew big as in his mind he prepared a judicious blend of apology and remonstrance wherewith to soothe this very impatient gentleman but before he could speak garnaches voice cut sharply into the silence an interruption at such a moment vexed him sorely  monsieur says quoth he  to you sirnothing answered the fellow impudently and looked him straight between the eyes  with a flush mounting to his cheeks and his brows drawn together in perplexity garnache surveyed him he was that same traveller who had lately clamoured to know when he might sup a man of rather more than middle height lithe and active of frame yet with a breadth of shoulder and depth of chest that argued strength and endurance as well he had fair wavy hair which he wore rather longer than was the mode brown eyes and a face which without being handsome was yet more than ordinarily engaging by virtue of its strength and frank ingenuousness his dress was his worst feature it was flamboyant and showy cheap and tawdrily pretentious yet he bore himself with the easy dignity of a man who counts more inferiors than superiors  despite the arrogant manner of his address garnache felt prepossessed in the newcomers favour but before he could answer him the host was speaking  monsieur mistakes he began  mistakes thundered the other in an accent slightly foreign it is you who mistake if you propose to tell me that this is not my supper am i to wait all night while every jackanapes who follows me into your pigsty is to be served before me  jackanapes said garnache thoughtfully and looked the man in the face again behind the stranger pressed his three companions now whilst the troopers across the room forgot their cardplay to watch the altercation that seemed to impend  the foreignerfor such indeed his french proclaimed himturned halfcontemptuously to the host ignoring garnache with an air that was studiously offensive  jackanapes murmured garnache again and he too turned to the host tell me monsieur lhote said he where do the jackanapes bury their dead in grenoble i may need the information  before the distressed landlord could utter a word the stranger had wheeled about again to face garnache what shall that mean he asked sharply a great fierceness in his glance  that grenoble may be witnessing the funeral of a foreign bully by tomorrow monsieur letranger said garnache showing his teeth in a pleasant smile he became conscious in that moment of a pressure on his shoulder blade but paid no heed to it intent on watching the others countenance it expressed surprise a moment then grew dark with anger  do you mean that for me sir he growled  garnache spread his hands if monsieur feels that the cap fits him i shall not stay him in the act of donning it  the stranger set one hand upon the table and leaned forward towards garnache may i ask monsieur to be a little more definite he begged  garnache sat back in his chair and surveyed the man smiling quick though his temper usually might be it was checked at present by amusement he had seen in his time many quarrels spring from the flimsiest of motives but surely never had he seen one quite so selfbegotten it was almost as if the fellow had come there of set purpose to pick it with him  a suspicion flashed across his mind he remembered the warning mademoiselle had given him and he wondered was this a trick to lure him to some guetapens he surveyed his man more closely but the inspection lent no colour to his suspicions the stranger looked so frank and honest then again his accent was foreign it might very well be that he was some savoyard lordling unused to being kept waiting and that his hunger made him irritable and impatient if that were so assuredly the fellow deserved a lesson that should show him he was now in france where different manners obtained to those that he displayed yet lest he should be something else garnache determined to pursue a policy of conciliation it would be a madness to embroil himself just then whether this fellow were of condillac or not  i have asked you monsieur the stranger insisted to be a little more definite  garnaches smile broadened and grew more friendly frankly said he i experience difficulty my remark was vague i meant it so to be  but it offended me monsieur the other answered sharply  the parisian raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips then i deplore it said he and now he had to endure the hardest trial of all the strangers expression changed to one of wondering scorn  do i understand that monsieur apologizes  garnache felt himself crimsoning his selfcontrol was slipping from him the pressure against his shoulder blade was renewed and in time he became aware of it and knew it for a warning from rabecque  i cannot conceive sir that i have offended said he at length keeping a tight hand upon his every instinctwhich was to knock this impertinent stranger down but if i have i beg that you will believe that i have done so unwittingly i had no such intent  the stranger removed his hand from the table and drew himself erect  so much for that then said he provokingly contemptuous if you will be as amiable in the matter of the supper i shall be glad to terminate an acquaintance which i can see no honour to myself in pursuing  this garnache felt was more than he could endure a spasm of passion crossed his face another instant and despite rabecques frantic proddings he might have flung the ragout in the gentlemans face when suddenly came the landlord unexpectedly to the rescue  monsieur here comes your supper now he announced as his wife reentered from the kitchen with a laden tray  for a moment the stranger seemed out of countenance then he looked with cold insolence from the dishes set before garnache to those which were being set for himself  ah said he and his tone was an insult unsurpassable perhaps it is to be preferred this ragout grows cold i think  he sniffed and turning on his heel without word or sign of salutation to garnache he passed to the next table and sat down with his companions the parisians eyes followed him and they blazed with suppressed wrath never in all his life had he exercised such selfcontrol as he was exercising thenwhich was the reason why he had failed to achieve greatnessand he was exercising it for the sake of that child abovestairs and because he kept everpresent in his mind the thought that she must come to grievous harm if ill befell himself but he controlled his passion at the cost of his appetite he could not eat so enraged was he and so he pushed the platter from him and rose  he turned to rabecque and the sight of his face sent the lackey back a pace or two in very fear he waved his hand to the table  sup rabecque said he then come to me above  and followed as before by the eyes of the stranger and his companions garnache strode out of the room and mounting the stairs went to find solace in talk with valerie but however impossible he might find it to digest the affront he had swallowed no word of the matter did he utter to the girl lest it should cause her fears to reawaken     chapter vii the opening of the trap  garnache spent a sleepless night at grenoble on guard throughout the greater part of it since nothing short of that would appease the fears of valerie yet it passed without any bellicose manifestation on the part of the condillacs such as valerie feared and such as garnache was satisfied would notcould not indeedtake place  betimes next morning he dispatched rabecque to the auberge de france for the promised carriage and broke his fast in the commonroom what time he awaited his mans return the chamber was again occupied by the stranger of yesternight who sat apart however and seemed no longer disposed to interfere with the parisian garnache wondered idly might this be due to the circumstance that that same stranger was supported now by one single companion and was therefore less valorous than when he had been in the company of three  at another table were two gentlemen sprung he knew not whence quiet in dress and orderly in manner to whom he paid little heed until one of them a slender swarthy hawkfaced fellowlooking up suddenly started slightly at sight of the parisian and addressed him instantly by name garnache paused in the act of rising from table halfturned and sharply scrutinized the swarthy gentleman but failed to recognize him he advanced towards him  i have the honour to be known to you monsieur he halfstated halfinquired  parbleu monsieur de garnache exclaimed the other with a ready smile the more winning since it lighted up a face that at rest was very sombre lives there a parisian to whom you are not known i have seen you often at the hotel de bourgogne  garnache acknowledged the courtesy by a slight inclination of the head  and once continued the other i had the honour to be presented to you by monsieur le duc himself my name is gaubertfabre gaubert and as he introduced himself he rose out of respect for garnache who had remained standing garnache knew him not at all yet never doubted that his tale was true the fellow had a very courtly winning air moreover garnache was beginning to feel lonely in the wilds of dauphiny so that it rejoiced him to come into the company of one whom he might regard as something of a fellowcreature he held out his hand  i am honoured in that you should have borne me in your memory monsieur said he he was about to add that he would be overjoyed if it should happen that monsieur gaubert was travelling to paris since he might give himself the pleasure of his company on that tedious journey but he checked himself betimes he had no reason to suspect this gentleman and yet all things considered he bethought him suddenly that he would do well to observe the greatest circumspection so with a pleasant but meaningless civility touching monsieur gauberts presence in those parts garnache passed on and gained the door he paused in the porch above which the rebuslike sign of the sucking calf creaked and grated in each gust of the chill wind that was blowing from the alps the rain had ceased but the sky was dark and heavy with great banks of scudding clouds in the street the men of his escort sat their horses having mounted at his bidding in readiness for the journey a word or two he exchanged with the sergeant and then with a great rumble the clumsy carriage from the auberge de france heralded its approach it rolled up the street a vast machine of wood and leather drawn by three horses and drew up at the door of the inn out sprang rabecque to be immediately sent by his master to summon mademoiselle they would set out upon the instant  rabecque turned to obey but in that same moment he was thrust rudely aside by a man with the air of a servant who issued from he inn carrying a valise after him following close upon his heels with head held high and eyes that looked straight before him and took no heed of garnache came the foreigner of yesternight  rabecque his shoulders touching the timbers of the porch against which he had been thrust remained at gaze following with resentful eye the fellow who had so rudely used him garnache on the other side watched with some wonder the advent of the ingenuouslooking stranger but as yet with no suspicion of his intent  not until the servant had thrown open the door of the coach and deposited within the valise he carried did garnache stir not indeed until the foreigners foot was on the step preparatory to mounting did garnache speak  hi monsieur he called to him what is your pleasure with my carriage  the stranger turned and stared at garnache with a look of wonder that artfully changed to one of disdainful recognition  ah said he and his eyebrows went up the apologetic gentleman you said  garnache approached him followed a step not only by rabecque but also by monsieur gaubert who had sauntered out a second earlier behind them in the porch lounged now the foreigners friend and behind him again was to be seen the great face and staring somewhat startled eyes of the landlord  i asked you monsieur said garnache already at grips with that quick temper of his what might be your pleasure with my coach  with your coach echoed the other his superciliousness waxing more and more offensive voyons on my apologetic friend do all things in grenoble belong to you he turned to the postboy who looked on stolidly you are from the auberge de france are you not quoth he  i am monsieur replied the man this carriage was ordered last night by a gentleman lodging at the veau qui tete  perfectly replied the stranger in a tone of finality it was ordered by me and he was about to turn away when garnache approached him by yet another step  i will ask you to observe monsieur said he and for all that his tone and words were civil that they were forcedly so was obvious from their quiveri will ask you to observe that the carriage was fetched by my own man there who rode hither in it  the stranger looked him up and down with a curling lip  it seems sir said he with a broad sneer that you are one of those impertinent fellows who will be for ever thrusting themselves upon gentlemen with an eye to such profit as they can make he produced a purse and opened it last night it was my supper you usurped i suffered that now you would do the same by my coach and that i shall not suffer but there is for your pains and to be quit of your company and he tossed a silver coin at the parisian  there was an exclamation of horror in the background and monsieur de gaubert thrust himself forward  sir sir he exclaimed in an agitated voice you cannot know whom you are addressing this is monsieur martin marie rigobert de garnache mestredechamp in the army of the king  of all those names the one i should opine might fit him best but for his ugliness is that of marie answered the foreigner leering and with a contemptuous shrug he turned again to mount the carriage  at that all garnaches selfcontrol deserted him and he did a thing deplorable in one of his blind accesses of fury heedless of the faithful and watchful rabecques arresting tug at his sleeve he stepped forward and brought a heavy hand down upon the supercilious gentlemans shoulder he took him in the instant in which with one foot off the ground and the other on the step of the carriage the foreigner was easily thrown off his balance he dragged him violently backward span him round and dropped him floundering in the mire of the streetkennel  that done there fell a pausea hush that was ominous of things impending a little crowd of idlers that had gathered was quickly augmenting now and from some there came a cry of shame at garnaches act of violence  this is no moment at which to pause to moralize and yet how often is it not so how often does not public sympathy go out to the man who has been assaulted without thought of the extent to which that man may have provoked and goaded his assailant  that cry of shame did no more than increase the anger that was mastering garnache his mission in grenoble was forgotten mademoiselle abovestairs was forgotten the need for caution and the fear of the condillacs were forgotten everything was thrust from his mind but the situation of the moment  amid the hush that followed the stranger picked himself slowly up and sought to wipe the filth from his face and garments his servant and his friend flew to his aid but he waved them aside and advanced towards garnache eyes blazing lips sneering  perhaps said he in that soft foreign tone of his laden now with fierce mockpoliteness perhaps monsieur proposes to apologize again  sir you are mad interposed gaubert you are a foreigner i perceive else you would  but garnache thrust him quietly aside you are very kind monsieur gaubert said he and his manner now was one of frozen calma manner that betrayed none of the frenzy of seething passion underneath i think sir said he to the stranger adopting something of that gentlemans sardonic manner that it will be a more peaceful world without you it is that consideration restrains me from apologizing and yet if monsieur will express regret for having sought and with such lack of manners to appropriate my carriage  enough broke in the other we are wasting time and i have a long journey before me courthon said he addressing his friend will you bring me the length of this gentlemans sword my name sir he added to garnache is sanguinetti  faith said garnache it sorts well with your bloody spirit  and will sort well no doubt with his condition presently put in hawkfaced gaubert monsieur de garnache if you have no friend at hand to act for you i shall esteem myself honoured and he bowed  why thanks sir you are most opportunely met you should be a gentleman since you frequent the hotel de bourgogne my thanks  gaubert went aside to confer with monsieur courthon sanguinetti stood apart his manner haughty and impressive his eye roaming scornfully through the ranks of what had by now become a crowd windows were opening in the street and heads appearing and across the way garnache might have beheld the flabby face of monsieur de tressan among the spectators of that little scene  rabecque drew near his master  have a care monsieur he implored him if this should be a trap  garnache started the remark sobered him and brought to his mind his own suspicions of yesternight which his present anger had for the moment lulled still he conceived that he had gone too far to extricate himself but he could at least see to it that he was not drawn away from the place that sheltered mademoiselle and so he stepped forward joining courthon and gaubert to insist that the combat should take place in the inneither in the common room or in the yard but the landlord overhearing this protested loudly that he could not consent to it he had his house to think of he swore that they should not fight on his premises and implored them in the same breath not to attempt it  at that garnache now thoroughly on his guard was for putting off the encounter  monsieur courthon said heand he felt a flush of shame mounting to his brow and realized that it may need more courage to avoid an encounter than to engage in onethere is something that in the heat of passion i forgot something that renders it difficult for me to meet your friend at present  courthon looked at him as he might look at an impertinent lackey  and what may that be he inquired mightily contemptuous there was a snigger from some in the crowd that pressed about them and even monsieur gaubert looked askance  surely sir he began if i did not know you for monsieur de garnache  but garnache did not let him finish  give me air he cried and cuffed out to right and left of him at the grinning spectators who fell back and grinned less broadly my reason monsieur de courthon said he is that i do not belong to my self at present i am in grenoble on business of the state as the emissary of the queenregent and so it would hardly become me to engage in private quarrels  courthon raised his brows  you should have thought of that before you rolled monsieur sanguinetti in the mud he answered coldly  i will tender him my apologies for that garnache promised swallowing hard and if he still insists upon a meeting he shall have it in say a months time  i cannot permit began courthon very fiercely  you will be so good as to inform your friend of what i have said garnache insisted interrupting him  cowed courthon shrugged and went apart to confer with his friend  ah came sanguinettis soft voice yet loud enough to be heard by all present he shall have a caning then for his impertinence and he called loudly to the postboy for his whip but at that insult garnaches brain seemed to take fire and his cautious resolutions were reduced to ashes by the conflagration he stepped forward and virulent of tone and terrific of mien he announced that since monsieur sanguinetti took that tone with him he would cut his throat for him at once and wherever they should please  at last it was arranged that they should proceed there and then to the champs aux capuchins a halfmile away behind the franciscan convent  accordingly they set out sanguinetti and courthon going first and garnache following with gaubert the rear being brought up by a regiment of rabble idlers and citizens that must have represented a very considerable proportion of the population of grenoble this audience heartened garnache to whom some measure of reflection had again returned before such numbers it was unthinkable that these gentlemenassuming them to be acting on behalf of condillacshould dare to attempt foul measures with him for the rest he had taken the precaution of leaving rabecque at the sucking calf and he had given the sergeant strict injunctions that he was not to allow any of his men to leave their posts during his absence and that the troopers were to hold themselves entirely at the orders of rabecque comparatively easy therefore in his mind and but little exercised by any thought of the coming encounter garnache walked briskly along  they came at last to the champs aux capuchinsa pleasant stretch of verdure covering perhaps half an acre and set about by a belt of beechtrees  the crowd disposed itself on the fringe of the sward and the duellists went forward and set about the preparations principals and seconds threw off cloak and doublet and sanguinetti courthon and gaubert removed their heavy boots whilst garnache did no more than detach the spurs from his  sanguinetti observing this drew the attention of the others to it and an altercation arose it was gaubert who came to beg garnache that he should follow the example they had set him in that respect but garnache shook his head  the turf is sodden  but it is precisely on that account sir protested gaubert very earnestly in your boots you will be unable to stand firm you will run the risk of slipping every time that you break ground  i venture to think sir that that is my affair said garnache stiffly  but it is not the other cried if you fight in your boots we must all do the same and for myselfwell i have not come here to commit suicide  look you monsieur gaubert said garnache quietly your opponent will be monsieur courthon and since he is in his stockinged feet there is no reason why you yourself should not remain so too as for me i retain my boots and monsieur sanguinetti may have all the advantage that may give him since i am content in heavens name let the fight go forward i am in haste  gaubert bowed in submission but sanguinetti who had overheard turned with an oath  by god no said he i need no such advantage sir courthon be so good as to help me on with my boots again and there was a fresh delay whilst he resumed them  at last however the four men came together and proceeded to the measurement of swords it was found that sanguinettis was two inches longer than any of the other three  it is the usual length in italy said sanguinetti with a shrug  if monsieur had realized that he was no longer in italy we might perhaps have been spared this very foolish business answered garnache testily  but what are we to do cried the perplexed gaubert  fight said garnache impatiently is there never to be an end to these preliminaries  but i cannot permit you to oppose yourself to a sword two inches longer than your own cried gaubert almost in a temper  why not if i am satisfied asked garnache mine is the longer reach thus matters will stand equal  equal roared gaubert your longer reach is an advantage that you had from god his longer sword is one he had from an armourer is that equality  he may have my sword and ill take his cut in the italian also showing impatience i too am in haste  in haste to die then snapped gaubert  monsieur this is not seemly courthon reproved him  you shall teach me manners when we engage snapped the hawkfaced gentleman  sirs sirs garnache implored them are we to waste the day in words monsieur gaubert there are several gentlemen yonder wearing swords i make no doubt that you will find one whose blade is of the same length as your own sufficiently obliging to lend it to monsieur sanguinetti  that is an office that my friend can do for me interposed sanguinetti and thereupon courthon departed to return presently with a borrowed weapon of the proper length  at last it seemed that they might proceed with the business upon which they were come but garnache was wrong in so supposing a discussion now arose between gaubert and courthon as to the choice of spot the turf was drenched and slippery and for all that they moved from place to place testing the ground their principals following nowhere could they find the conditions sufficiently improved to decide upon engaging to garnache the utility of this was apparent from the first if these gentlemen had thought to avoid slippery ground they should have elected to appoint the meeting elsewhere but having chosen the champs aux capuchins it was idle to expect that one stretch of turf would prove firmer than another  wearied at last by this delay he gave expression to his thoughts  you are quite right monsieur said courthon but your second is overfastidious it would simplify matters so much if you would remove your boots  look you sirs said garnache taking a firm stand i will engage in my boots and on this very spot or not at all i have told you that i am in haste as for the slipperiness of the ground my opponent will run no greater risks than i i am not the only impatient one the spectators are beginning to jeer at us we shall have every scullion in grenoble presently saying that we are afraid of one another besides which sirs i think i am taking cold  i am quite of monsieurs mind myself drawled sanguinetti  you hear sir exclaimed courthon turning to gaubert you can scarce persist in finding objections now  why since all are satisfied so be it said gaubert with a shrug i sought to do the best for my principal as it is i wash my hands of all responsibility and by all means let us engage sirs  they disposed themselves accordingly gaubert engaging courthon on garnaches right hand and garnache himself falling on guard to receive the attack of sanguinetti the jeers and murmurs that had been rising from the evergrowing crowd that swarmed about the outskirts of the place fell silent as the clatter of meeting swords rang out at last and then scarce were they engaged when a voice arose calling angrily  hold sanguinetti wait  a big broadshouldered man in a suit of homespun and a featherless hat thrust his way rudely trough the crowd and broke into the space within the belt of trees the combatants had fallen apart at this commanding cry and the newcomer now dashed forward flushed and out of breath as if with running  vertudieu sanguinetti he swore and his manner was halfangry halfbantering do you call this friendship  my dear francois returned the foreigner you arrive most inopportunely  and is that all the greeting you have for me  looking more closely garnache thought that he recognized in him one of sanguinettis companions of yesternight  but do you not see that i am engaged  ay and that is my grievance that you should be engaged upon such an affair and that i should have no share in it it is to treat me like a lackey and have the right to feel offended enfin it seems i an not come too late  garnache cut in he saw the drift of the fellows intentions and he was not minded to submit to fresh delays already more than half an hour was sped since he had left the sucking calf he put it plainly to them that more than enough delay had there been already and he begged the newcomer to stand aside and allow them to terminate the business on which they were met but monsieur francoisas sanguinetti had called himwould not hear of it he proved indeed a very testy fellow and he had moreover the support of the others including even monsieur gaubert  let me implore you not to spoil sport sir the latter begged garnache i have a friend at the inn who would never forgive me if i permitted him to miss such a mornings diversion as this gentleman is willing to afford him suffer me to go for him  look you sir answered garnache sharply however you may view this meeting it is not with me an affair of jest or sport i am in a quarrel that has been forced upon me and  surely not sir courthon interrupted sweetly you forget that you rolled monsieur sanguinetti in the mud that is hardly to have a quarrel forced upon you  garnache bit his lip to the blood in his vexation  however the quarrel may have originated said francois with a great laugh i swear that it goes not forward until i am accommodated too  you had better accede monsieur murmured gaubert i shall not be gone five minutes and it will save time in the end  oh very well cried poor garnache in his despair anything to save time anything in gods name fetch your friend and i hope you and he and every man here will get his fill of fighting for once  gaubert departed on his errand and there were fresh murmurs in the mob until the reason of his going was understood five minutes sped ten minutes and yet he returned not grouped together were sanguinetti and his two friends in easy whispered talk at a little distance from them garnache paced up and down to keep himself warm he had thrown his cloak over his shoulders again and with sword tucked under arm and head thrust forward he stamped backwards and forwards the very picture of illhumour fifteen minutes passed twelve oclock boomed from the church of saint francois dassisi and still monsieur gaubert returned not garnache stood still a moment in angry thought this must not go on there must be an end and at once the tastes and inclinations of brawlers were no concern of his he had business of statehowever unworthyto dispatch he turned intending to demand of monsieur sanguinetti that they should engage at once and be done when suddenly a fellow roughly dressed with dirty face and a shock head of fair hair pushed his way through the throng and advanced towards monsieur sanguinetti and his friends garnache checked in his movement to look at the fellow for he recognized in him the ostler of the auberge de france he spoke at that moment and garnache overheard the words he uttered  monsieur sanguinetti said he addressing that gentleman my master sends to inquire if you shall want the carriage you ordered for today it has been standing for an hour at the door of the auberge de france awaiting you and if you dont want it  standing where asked sanguinetti harshly  at the door of the auberge de france  peste fool cried the foreigner why is it there when i bade it be sent to the sucking calf  i dont know sir i know no more than monsieur lhote told me  now a plague on monsieur lhote swore sanguinetti and in that moment his eye fell upon garnache standing there attentive at sight of the parisian he seemed lost in confusion he dropped his glance and appeared on the point of turning aside then to the ostler i shall want the carriage and i shall come for it anon carry that message to your master and with that he turned and advanced to garnache his whilom arrogance was all fallen from him he wore instead an air of extreme contrition  monsieur what shall i say to you he asked in a voice that was rather small it seems there has been an error i am deeply grieved believe me  say no more i beg cried garnache immensely relieved that at last there should be a conclusion to an affair which had threatened to be interminable let me but express my regrets for the treatment you received at my hands  i accept your expressions and i admire their generosity returned the other as courteous now as subservient indeed in his courtesyas he had been erstwhile fierce and intractable as for the treatment i received i confess that my mistake and my opinionativeness deserved it me i deplore to deprive these gentlemen of the entertainment to which they were looking forward but unless you should prove of an excessive amiability i am afraid they must suffer with me the consequences of my error  garnache assured him very briefly and none too politely that he did not intend to prove of any excessive amiability he spoke whilst struggling into his doublet he felt that he could cheerfully have caned the fellow for the inconvenience he had caused him and yet he realized that he had other more pressing matters to attend to he sheathed his sword took up his cloak and hat made those gentlemen the compliments that became the occasion in terms a trifle more brief perhaps than were usual and still wondering why monsieur de gaubert had not yet returned he stalked briskly away followed by the booings of the disappointed crowd he set out for the sucking calf at a sharp pace taking the shorter way behind the church and across the graveyard of saint francois     chapter viii the closing of the trap  upon leaving the champs aux capuchins hawkfaced monsieur gaubert had run every foot of the way to the sucking calf and he had arrived there within some five minutes out of breath and wearing every appearance of distressof a distress rather greater than his haste to find his friend should warrant  at the door of the inn he found the carriage still waiting the postboy however was in the porch leaning in talk with one of the drawers the troopers sat their horses in stolid patience keeping guard and awaiting as they had been bidden the return of monsieur de garnache rabecque very watchful lounged in the doorway betraying in his air none of the anxiety and impatience with which he looked for his master  at sight of monsieur gaubert running so breathlessly he started forward wondering and uneasy across the street from the palais seneschal came at that same moment monsieur de tressan with rolling gait he reached the door of the inn together with monsieur gaubert  full of evil forebodings rabecque hailed the runner  what has happened he cried where is monsieur de garnache  gaubert came to a staggering halt he groaned and wrung his hands  killed he panted rocking himself in a passion of distress he has been butchered oh it was horrible  rabecque gripped him by the shoulder and steadied him with a hand that hurt what do you say he gasped his face white to the lips  tressan halted too and turned upon gaubert a look of incredulity in his fat countenance who has been killed he asked not monsieur de garnache  helas yes groaned the other it was a snare a guetapens to which they led us four of them set upon us in the champs aux capuchins as long as he lived i stood beside him but seeing him fallen i come for help  my god sobbed rabecque and loosed his grasp of monsieur gauberts shoulder  who did it inquired tressan and his voice rumbled fiercely  i know not who they were the man who picked the quarrel with monsieur de garnache called himself sanguinetti there is a riot down there at present there was a crowd to witness the combat and they have fallen to fighting among themselves would to heaven they had stirred in time to save that poor gentleman from being murdered  a riot did you say cried tressan the official seeming to awaken in him  aye answered the other indifferently they are cutting one anothers throats  but but are you sure that he is dead monsieur inquired rabecque and his tone was one that implored contradiction  gaubert looked and paused seeming to give the matter a seconds thought i saw him fall said he it may be that he was no more than wounded  and you left him there roared the servant you left him there  gaubert shrugged his shoulders what could i do against four besides the crowd was interfering already and it seemed best to me to come for help these soldiers now  aye cut in tressan and he turned about and called the sergeant this becomes my affair and he announced his quality to monsieur gaubert i am the lord seneschal of dauphiny  i am fortunate in finding you returned gaubert and bowed i could place the matter in no better hand  but tressan without heeding him was already ordering the sergeant to ride hard with his troopers for the champs aux capuchins rabecque however thrust himself suddenly forward  not so monsieur le seneschal he interposed in fresh alarm and mindful of his charge these men are here to guard mademoiselle de la vauvraye let them remain i will go to monsieur de garnache  the seneschal stared at him with contemptuously pouting underlip you will go said he and what can you do alone who are you he asked  i am monsieur de garnaches servant  a lackey ah and tressan turned aside and resumed his orders as if rabecque did not exist or had never spoken to the champs aux capuchins said he at the gallop pommier i will send others after you  the sergeant rose in his stirrups and growled an order the troopers wheeled about another order and they were off their cantering hoofs thundering down the narrow street  rabecque clutched at the lord seneschals arm  stop them monsieur he almost screamed in his excitement stop them there is some snare some trick in this  stop them quoth the seneschal are you mad he shook off rabecques detaining hand and left him to cross the street again with ponderous and sluggish haste no doubt to carry out his purpose of sending more troopers to the scene of the disturbance  rabecque swore angrily and bitterly and his vexation had two entirely separate sources on the one hand his anxiety and affection for his master urged him to run at once to his assistance whilst tressans removal of the troopers rendered it impossible for him to leave mademoiselle de la vauvraye unguardedthough what he should do with her if garnache came not back at all he did not at this stage pause to consider on the other hand an instinctive and growing suspicion of this monsieur gaubertwho was now entering the inninspired him with the opinion that the fat seneschal had been duped by a wild tale to send the troopers from the spot where they might presently become very necessary  full of fears anxiety and mistrust it was a very dispirited rabecque that now slowly followed monsieur gaubert into the inn but as he set his foot across the threshold of the commonroom a sight met his eyes that brought him to a momentary standstill and turned to certainty all his rising suspicions he found it tenanted by a halfdozen fellows of very rude aspect all armed and bearing an odd resemblance in air and accoutrements to the braves he had seen at condillac the day before as to how they came there he could only surmise that they had entered through the stableyard as otherwise he must have observed their approach they were grouped now at the other end of the long low chamber by the door leading to the interior of the inn a few paces distant the landlord watched them with uneasy eyes  but what dismayed garnaches servant most of all was to see the man who called himself gaubert standing in talk with a slender handsome youth magnificently arrayed in whom he recognized marius de condillac  rabecque checked in his advance and caught in that moment from marius the words let her be told that it is monsieur de garnache wishes her to descend  at that rabecque stepped towards them very purposeful of mien gaubert turned at his approach and smiled marius looked up quickly then made a sign to the men instantly two of them went out by the door they guarded and ere it swung back again rabecque saw that they were making for the stairs the remaining four ranged themselves shoulder to shoulder across the doorway plainly with intent to bar the way gaubert followed immediately by marius stepped aside and approached the landlord with arms akimbo and a truculent smile on his pale hawk face what he and marius said rabecque could not make out but he distinctly heard the landlords answer delivered with a respectful bow to marius  bien monsieur de condillac i would not interfere in your concernsnot for the world i will be blind and deaf  marius acknowledged the servile protestation by a sneer and rabecque stirring at last went forward boldly towards the doorway and its ugly human barrier  by your leave sirs said heand he made to thrust one of them aside  you cannot pass this way sir he was answered respectfully but firmly  rabecque stood still clenching and unclenching his hands and quivering with anger it was in that moment that he most fervently cursed tressan and his stupid meddling had the troopers still been there they could have made short work of these tatterdemalions as it was and with monsieur de garnache dead or at least absent everything seemed at an end he might have contended that his master being slain it was no great matter what he did for in the end the condillacs must surely have their way with mademoiselle de la vauvraye but he never paused to think of that just then his sense of trust was strong his duty to his master plain he stepped back and drew his sword  let me pass he roared but at the same instant there came the soft slither of another weapon drawn and rabecque was forced to turn to meet the onslaught of monsieur gaubert  you dirty traitor cried the angry lackey and that was all they left him breath to say strong arms gripped him from behind the sword was wrenched from his hand he was flung down heavily and pinned prone in a corner by one of those bullies who knelt on his spine and then the door opened again and poor rabecque groaned in impotent anguish to behold mademoiselle de la vauvraye pause whitefaced and wideeyed on the threshold at sight of monsieur de condillac bowing low before her  she stood there a moment between the two ruffians who had been sent to fetch her and her eyes travelling round that room discovered rabecque in his undignified and half strangled condition  where where is monsieur de garnache she faltered  he is where all those who cross the will of condillac must sooner or later find themselves said marius airily he is disposed of  do you mean that he is dead she cried  i think it very probable by now he smiled so you see mademoiselle since the guardian the queen appointed you has deserted you you would do well to return to my mothers roof let me assure you that we shall very gladly welcome your return we blame none but garnache for your departure and he has paid for the brutality of his abduction of you  she turned in despair from that mocking gentleman and attempted to make appeal to the landlord as though he could help her who could not help himself  monsieur lhote she began but marius cut in sharply  take her out that way he said and pointed back down the passage by the stairs to the coach make haste  she sought to resist them now but they dragged her back and there was a rush of the others following through the doorway the rear being brought up by gaubert  follow presently was his parting command to the man who still knelt upon rabecque and with that he vanished too  their steps died away in the passage a door banged in the distance there followed a silence disturbed only by the sound of rabecques laboured breathing then came a stir outside the door of the inn some one shouted an order there was a movement of hoofs a creak and crunch of wheels and presently the rumble of a heavy carriage being driven rapidly away but too well did rabecque surmise what had taken place  the ruffian released him at last and leaping to his feet was gone before rabecque could rise once up however the lackey darted to the door in the distance he saw his late assailant running hard the coach had disappeared he turned and his smouldering eye fell upon the landlord  o pig he apostrophized him snarling at him to vent some of his pentup rage o cowardly pig  what would you expostulated the frightened taverner they had cut my throat if i resisted them  rabecque poured abuse upon him until for very lack of words he was forced to cease then with a final bark of contempt he went to recover his sword which had been flung into a corner of the room he was stooping in the act when a quick step rang behind him on the threshold an angry voice harsh and metallic pronounced his name  rebecque  the sword clattered from rabecques hand suddenly gone nervelessnerveless with sheer joy all else forgotten in the perception that there safe and sound stood his beloved master  monsieur he cried and the tears welled up to the rough servants eyes monsieur he cried again and then with the tears streaming down his cheeks sallow and wrinkled as parchment oh thank god he blubbered thank god  for what asked garnache coming forward a scowl like a thundercloud upon his brow where is the coach where the troopers where is mademoiselle answer me  he caught rabecques wrist in a grip that threatened to snap it his face was livid his eyes aflame  theythey stammered rabecque he had not the courage to tell the thing that had happened he feared garnache would strike him dead  and then out of his terror he gathered an odd daring he spoke to garnache as never he had dreamt to speak to him and it may well be that by his tone and by what he said he saved his life just then  you fool he cried to him i told you to be on your guard i warned you to go warily but you would not heed me you know better than rabecque you would have your way you must go abrawling and they duped you they fooled you to the very top of their bent monsieur  garnache dropped the servants hand and stood back a pace that counterblast of passion and that plain speaking from a quarter so unexpected served in part at least to sober him he understood the thing that had happened the thing that already he suspected must have happened but he understood too that he alone was to blame for ithe and his cursed temper  whowho fooled me he stammered  gaubertthe fellow that calls himself gaubert he and his friends they fooled you away then gaubert returned with a tale that you had been killed and that there was a disturbance in the champs aux capuchins monsieur de tressan was here as illluck would have it and gaubert implored him to send soldiers thither to quell the riot he dispatched the escort i sought in vain to stay them he would not listen to me the troopers went and then monsieur gaubert entered the inn to join monsieur de condillac and six of his braves who were waiting there they overpowered me and carried mademoiselle off in the coach i did what i could but  how long have they been gone garnache interrupted him to inquire  but few minutes before you came  it would be then the coach that passed me near the porte de savoie we must go after them rabecque i made a short cut across the graveyard of saint francis or i must have met the escort oh perdition he cried smiting his clenched right hand into his open left to have so much good work undone by a moments unguardedness then abruptly he turned on his heels i am going to monsieur de tressan said he over his shoulder and went out  as he reached the threshold of the porch the escort rode up the street returned at last at sight of him the sergeant broke into a cry of surprise  at least you are safe monsieur he said we had heard that you were dead and i feared it must be so for all that the rest of the story that was told us was clearly part of a very foolish jest  jest it was no jest vertudieu said garnache grimly you had best return to the palais seneschal i have no further need of an escort he added bitterly i shall require a larger force  and he stepped out into the rain which had begun again a few minutes earlier and was now falling in a steady downpour     chapter ix the seneschals advice   straight across the palais seneschal went garnache and sorely though his temper might already have been tried that day tempestuously though it had been vented there were fresh trials in store for him fresh storms for tressan  may i ask monsieur le seneschal he demanded arrogantly to what end it was that you permitted yourself to order from its post the escort you had placed under my command  to what end returned the seneschal between sorrow and indignation why to the end that it might succour you if still in time i had heard that if not dead already you were in danger of your life  the answer was one that disarmed garnache in spite of his mistrust of tressan and followed as it now was by the seneschals profuse expressions of joy at seeing garnache safe and well it left him clearly unable to pursue the subject of his grievance in this particular connection instead he passed on to entertain tressan with the recital of the thing that had been done and in reciting it his anger revived again nor did the outward signs of sympathetic perturbation which the seneschal thought it judicious to display do aught to mollify his feelings  and now monsieur he concluded there remains but one course to be pursuedto return in force and compel them at the swordpoint to surrender me mademoiselle that accomplished i shall arrest the dowager and her son and every jackanapes within that castle her men can lie in grenoble gaol to be dealt with by yourself for supporting her in an attempt to resist the queens authority madame and her son shall go with me to paris to answer there for their offence  the seneschal looked grave he thoughtfully combed his beard with his forefinger and his little eyes peered a shade fearfully at garnache through his hornrimmed spectaclesgarnache had found him at his neverfailing pretence of work  why yes he agreed speaking slowly that way lies your duty  i rejoice monsieur to hear you say so for i shall need your aid  my aid the seneschals face assumed a startled look  i shall require of you the necessary force to reduce that garrison  the seneschal blew out his cheeks almost to bursting point then wagged his head and smiled wistfully  and where he asked am i to find such a force  you have upwards of ten score men in quarters at grenoble  if i had those menwhich i have notwhat think you could they do against a fortress such as condillac monsieur deludes himself if they resist youll need ten times that number to bring them to their senses they are well victualled they have an excellent watersupply my friend they would just draw up the bridge and laugh at you and your soldiers from the ramparts  garnache looked at him from under lowering brows but for all his mistrust of the mana mistrust most excellently foundedhe was forced to confess that there was wisdom in what tressan said  ill sit down and besiege them if need be he announced  again the seneschal wagged his head you would have to be prepared to spend your winter there in that case and it can be cold in the valley of isere their garrison is smallsome twenty men at most but it is sufficient for their defence and not too many mouths to feed no no monsieur if you would win your way by force you must count upon more than ten score men  and now a flash of inspiration helped tressan it was his aim as we know to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds break with madame de condillac his foolish hopeful heart would not permit him break with this man who personified authority and the king he dared not he had soughtand it had given him much to doto steer a middle course serving the dowager and appearing not to withstand the parisian now it almost seemed to him as if he were come to an impasse beyond which he could no longer pursue that course but must halt and declare his side but the notion that now occurred to him helped him to win through this difficulty for madame de condillacs schemes he cared not a jot whether they came safe to harbour or suffered shipwreck on the way was all one to him whether valerie de la vauvraye married marius de condillac or the meanest cobbler in grenoble was similarly a matter that never disturbed his mind he would not even be concerned if he himself were to help the dowagers schemes to frustration so long as she were to remain in ignorance of his defection so long as outwardly he were to appear faithful to her interests  monsieur said he gravely the only course that promises you success is to return to paris and raising sufficient men with guns and other modern siege appliances such as we possess not here come back and batter down the walls of condillac  there the seneschal spoke good sense garnache realized it so much so that he almost began to doubt whether he had not done the man an injustice in believing him allied to the other party but however fully he might perceive the wisdom of the advice such a step was one that must wound his pride must be an acknowledgment that his own resources upon which the queen had relied when she sent him singlehanded to deal with this situation had proved insufficient  he took a turn in the apartment without answering tugging at his mustachios and pondering the situation what time the seneschal furtively watched him in the candlelight at last he came abruptly to a standstill by the seneschals writingtable immediately opposite tressan his hand fell to his side his eyes took on a look of determination  as a last resource your good advice may guide me monsieur le seneschal said he but first ill see what can be done with such men as you have here  but i have no men answered tressan dismayed to see the failure of his effort  garnache stared at him in an unbelief that was fast growing to suspicion no men he echoed dully no men  i might muster a scoreno more than that  but monsieur it is within my knowledge that you have at least two hundred i saw at least some fifty drawn up in the courtyard below here yesterday morning  i had them monsieur the seneschal made haste to cry his hands upheld his body leaning forward over his table i had them but unfortunately certain disturbances in the neighbourhood of montelimar have forced me to part with them they were on the point of setting out when you saw them  garnache looked at him a moment without speaking then sharply  they must be recalled monsieur said he  and now the seneschal took refuge in a fine pretence of indignation  recalled he cried and besides indignation there was some horror in his voice recalled and for what that they may assist you in obtaining charge of a wretched girl who is so headstrong as to wish to marry other than her guardians have determined a pretty affair that as gods my life and for the adjustment of such a family dispute as this a whole province is to go to ruin a conflagration of rebellion is to spread unquenched on my soul sir i begin to think that this mission of yours has served to turn your head you begin to see it out of all proportion to its size  monsieur it may have turned my head or it may not but i shall not be amazed if in the end it be the means of losing you yours tell me now what is the disturbance you speak of in montelimar that was a question all tressans ingenuity could not answer  what affair is it of yours he demanded are you seneschal of dauphiny or am i if i tell you that there is a disturbance let that suffice in quelling it i do but attend to my own business do you attend to yourswhich seems to be that of meddling in womens matters  this was too much there was such odious truth in it that the iron sank deep into garnaches soul the very reflection that such a business should indeed be his was of itself enough to put him in a rage without having it cast in his teeth as tressan had none too delicately done  he stormed and raged he waved his arms and thumped the table and talked of cutting men to ribbonsamong which men no doubt he counted my lord the seneschal of dauphiny but from the storm of fierce invective of threats and promises with which he filled the air the seneschal gathered with satisfaction the one clear statement that he would take his advice  ill do as you say garnache had ended ill get me back to paris as fast as horse can carry me when i return woe betide condillac and i shall send my emissaries into the district of montelimar to inquire into these disturbances you tell of woe betide you if they find the country quiet you shall pay a heavy price for having dispatched your soldiers thither to the end that they might not be here to further the queens business  with that he caught up his rainsodden hat flung it on his head and stalked out of the room and so out of the palace  he left grenoble next morning and it was a very tame and crestfallen garnache who quitted the auberge du veau qui tete and rode out of the town to take the road to paris how they would laugh at him at the luxembourg not even an affair of this kind was he fit to carry through not even as a meddler in womens matters as tressan had called himcould he achieve success rabecque reflecting his masters moodas becomes a good lackeyrode silent and gloomy a pace or two in the rear  by noon they had reached voiron and here at a quiet hostelry they descended to pause awhile for rest and refreshment it was a chill blustering day and although the rain held off the heavens were black with the promise of more to come there was a fire burning in the generalroom of the hostelry and garnache went to warm him at its cheerful blaze moodily he stood there one hand on the high mantel shelf one foot upon an andiron his eyes upon the flames  he was disconsolately considering his position considering how utterly how irrevocably he had failed pondering the gibes he would have to stomach on his return to paris the ridicule it would incumb him to live down it had been a fine thing to breathe fire and blood and vengeance to tressan yesterday to tell him of the great deeds he would perform on his return it was odds he never would return they would send another in his place if indeed they sent at all for after all before he could reach paris and the force required be in dauphiny a fortnight must elapse let them travel never so quickly by that time they must be singularly sluggish at condillac if they did not so contrive that no aid that came should come in time for mademoiselle now that they were warned that the queen was stirring in the matter  oh he had blundered it all most cursedly had he but kept his temper yesterday at grenoble had he but had the wit to thwart their plans by preserving an unruffled front to insult he might have won through and carried mademoiselle out of their hands as it was he let his arms fall to his sides in his miserable despair  your wine monsieur said rabecque at his elbow he turned and took the cup of mulled drink from his servant the beverage warmed him in body but it would need a butt of it to thaw the misery from his soul  rabecque he said with a pathetic grimness i think i am the most cursed blunderer that ever was entrusted with an errand  the thing so obsessed his mind that he must speak of it if it be only to his lackey rabecques sharp face assumed a chastened look he sighed most dutifully he sought for words of consolation at last  at least monsieur has made them fear him up there at condillac said he  fear me laughed garnache pish deride me you would say  fear you i repeat monsieur else why are they at such pains to strengthen the garrison  eh he questioned but his tone was not greatly interested are they doing that are they strengthening it how know you  i had it from the ostler at the veau qui tete that a certain captain fortunioan italian soldier of fortune who commands the men at condillacwas at the auberge de france last night offering wine to whomsoever would drink with him and paying for it out of madame la marquises purse to such as accepted his hospitality he talked of the glory of a military career particularly a freelances and to those who showed interest in what he said he offered a pike in his company  enrolled he many did you learn  not one monsieur the ostler told me and it seems he spent the evening watching him weave his spiders web but the flies were overwary they knew whence he came they knew the business for which he desired to enrol themfor a rumour had gone round that condillac was in rebellion against the queens commandsand there were none so desperate at the auberge de france as to risk their necks by enlisting no matter what the wage he offered  garnache shrugged his shoulders no matter said he get me another cup of wine but as rabecque turned away to obey him there came a sudden gleam into the eye of monsieur de garnache which lightened the depression of his countenance      chapter x the recruit  in the great hall of the chateau de condillac sat the dowager her son and the lord seneschal in conference  it was early in the afternoon of the last thursday in october exactly a week since monsieur de garnache all but brokenhearted at the failure of his missionhad departed from grenoble they had dined and the table was still strewn with vessels and the fragments of their meal for the cloth had not yet been raised but the three of them had left the boardthe seneschal with all that reluctance with which he was wont to part company with the table no matter how perturbed in spirit he might toand they had come to group themselves about the great open fireplace  a shaft of pale october sunshine entering through the gules of an escutcheon on the mullioned windows struck a scarlet light into silver aid glass upon the forsaken board  madame was speaking she was repeating words that she had uttered at least twenty times a day during the past week  it was a madness to let that fellow go had we but put him and his servant out of the way we should be able now to sleep tranquil in our beds i know their ways at court they might have marvelled a little at first that he should tarry so long upon his errand that he should send them no word of its progress but presently seeing him no more he would little by little have been forgotten and with him the affair in which the queen has been so cursedly ready to meddle  as it is the fellow will go back hot with the outrage put upon him there will be some fine talk of it in paris it will be spoken of as treason as defiance of the kings majesty as rebellion the parliament may be moved to make outlaws of us and the end of it allwho shall foresee  it is a long distance from condillac to paris madame said her son with a shrug  and you will find them none so ready to send soldiers all this way marquise the seneschal comforted her  bah you make too sure of your security you make too sure of what they will do what leave undone time will show my friends and mordieu i am much at fault if you come not both to echo my regret that we did not dispose of monsieur de garnache and his lackey when we had them in our power  her eye fell with sinister promise upon tressan who shivered slightly and spread his hands to the blaze as though his shiver had been of cold but marius did not so readily grow afraid  madame he said at the worst we can shut our gates and fling defiance at them we are wellmanned and fortunio is seeking fresh recruits  seeking them yes she sneered for a week has the fellow been spending money like water addling the brains of half grenoble with the best wine at the auberge de france yet not a single recruit has come in so far  marius laughed your pessimism leads you into rash conclusions he cried you are wrong one recruit has come in  one she echoed a thousand devils a brave number that a fine return for the river of wine with which we have washed the stomachs of grenoble  still it is a beginning ventured the seneschal  aye and no doubt an ending she flashed back at him and what manner of fool may this one be whose fortunes were so desperate that he could throw them in with ours  he is an italiana piedmontese who has tramped across savoy and was on his way to paris to make his fortune when fortunio caught him and made it clear to him that his fortune was made for him at condillac he is a lusty stalwart fellow speaking no word of french who was drawn to fortunio by discovering in him a fellowcountryman  mockery flashed from the dowagers beautiful eyes  in that you have the reason of his enrolling himself he knew no word of french poor devil so could not learn how rash his venture was could we find more such men as this one it might be well but where shall we find them pish my dear marius matters are little mended nor ever will be for the mistake we made in allowing garnache to go his ways  madame again ventured tressan i think that you want for hopefulness  at least i do not want for courage monsieur le comte she answered him and i promise you that while i liveto handle a sword if need beno paris men shall set foot in condillac  aye grumbled marius you can contemplate that and it is all you do contemplate you will not see madame that our position is far from desperate that after all there may be no need to resist the king it is three months since we had news of florimond much may happen in three months when a man is warring it may well be that he is dead  i wish i knew he wasand damned she snapped with a tightening of her scarlet lips  yes agreed marius with a sigh that were an end to all our troubles  im none so sure there is still mademoiselle with her newformed friends in parismay a pestilence blight them all there are still the lands of la vauvraye to lose the only true end to our troubles as they stand at present lies in your marrying this headstrong baggage  that the step should be rendered impossible you can but blame yourself marius reminded her  how so she cried turning sharply upon him  had you kept friends with the church had you paid tithes and saved us from this cursed interdict we should have no difficulty in getting hither a priest and settling the matter out of hand be valerie willing or not  she looked at him scorn kindling in her glance then she swung round to appeal to tressan  you hear him count said she there is a lover for you he would wed his mistress whether she love him or notand he has sworn to me that he loves the girl  how else should the thing be done since she opposes it asked marius sulkily  how else do you ask me how else god were i a man and had i your shape and face there is no woman in the world should withstand me if i set my heart on her it is address you lack you are clumsy as a lout where a woman is concerned were i in your place i had taken her by storm three months ago when first she came to us i had carried her out of condillac out of france over the border into savoy where there are no interdicts to plague you and there i would have married her  marius frowned darkly but before he could speak tressan was insinuating a compliment to the marquise  true marius he said with pursed lips nature has been very good to you in that she has made you the very counterpart of your lady mother you are as comely a gentleman as is to be found in franceor out of it  pish snapped marius too angered by the reflection cast upon his address to be flattered by their praises of his beauty it is an easy thing to talk an easy thing to set up arguments when we consider but the half of a question you forget madame that valerie is betrothed to florimond and that she clings faithfully to her betrothal  vertudieu swore the marquise and what is this betrothal what this faithfulness she has not seen her betrothed for three years she was a child at the time of their fiancailles think you her faithfulness to him is the constancy of a woman to her lover go your ways you foolish boy it is but the constancy to a word to the wishes of her father think you constancy that has no other base than that would stand between her and any man whoas you might do had you the addresscould make her love him  i do say so answered marius firmly  she smiled the pitying smile of one equipped with superior knowledge when confronted with an obstinate uninformed mind  there is a droll arrogance about you marius she told him quietly you a fledgling would teach me a woman the ways of a womans heart it is a thing you may live to regret  as how he asked  once already has mademoiselle contrived to corrupt one of our men and send him to paris with a letter out of that has sprung our present trouble another time she may do better when she shall have bribed another to assist her to escape when she herself shall have made off to the shelter of the queenmother perhaps you will regret that my counsel should have fallen upon barren ground  it is to prevent any such attempt that we have placed her under guard said he you are forgetting that  forgetting it not i but what assurance have you that she will not bribe her guard  marius laughed rose and pushed back his chair  madame said he you are back at your contemplation of the worst side of this affair you are persisting in considering only how we may be thwarted but set your mind at rest gilles is her sentinel every night he sleeps in her anteroom he is fortunios most trusted man she will not corrupt him  the dowager smiled pensively her eyes upon the fire suddenly she raised them to his face berthaud was none the less trusted yet with no more than a promise of reward at some future time should she succeed in escaping from us did she bribe him to carry her letter to the queen what happened to berthaud that may not happen to gilles  you might change her sentry nightly put in the seneschal  yes if we knew whom we could trust who would be above corruption as it isshe shrugged her shoulders that would be but to afford her opportunities to bribe them one by one until they were all ready to act in concert  why need she any sentinel at all asked tressan with some show of sense  to ward off possible traitors she told him and marius smiled and wagged his head  madame is never done foreseeing the worst monsieur  which shows my wisdom the men in our garrison are mercenaries all attached to us only because we pay them they all know who she is and what her wealth  pity you have not a man who is deaf and dumb said tressan half in jest but marius looked up suddenly his eyes serious  we have as good said he there is the italian knave fortunio enrolled yesterday as i have told you he knows neither her wealth nor her identity nor if he did could he enter into traffic with her for he knows no french and she no italian  the dowager clapped her hands the very man she cried  but marius either from sheer perverseness or because he did not share her enthusiasm made answer i have faith in gilles  yes she mocked him and you had faith in berthaud oh if you have faith in gilles let him remain let no more be said  the obstinate boy took her advice and shifted the subject speaking to tressan of some trivial business connected with the seneschalship  but madame womanlike returned to the matter whose abandoning she had herself suggested marius for all his affected disdain of it viewed it with a certain respect and so in the end they sent for the recruit  fortuniowho was no other than the man garnache had known as sanguinettibrought him still clad in the clothes in which he had come he was a tall limber fellow with a very swarthy skin and black oilylooking hair that fell in short ringlets about his ears and neck and a black drooping mustache which gave him a rather hangdog look there was a thick stubble of beard of several days growth about his chin and face his eyes were furtive in their glances but of a deep blue that contrasted oddly with his blackness when he momentarily raised them  he wore a tattered jerkin and his legs in default of stockings were swathed in soiled bandages and crossgartered from ankle to knee he stood in a pair of wooden shoes from one of which peeped forth some wisps of straw introduced no doubt to make the footgear fit he slouched and shuffled in his walk and he was unspeakably dirty nevertheless he was girt with a sword in a ragged scabbard hanging from a frayed and shabby belt of leather  madame scanned him with interest the fastidious marius eyed him with disgust the seneschal peered at him curiously through shortsighted eyes  i do not think i have ever seen a dirtier ruffian said he  i like his nose said madame quietly it is the nose of an intrepid man  it reminds me of garnaches laughed the seneschal  you flatter the parisian commented marius  the mercenary meanwhile stood blandly smiling at the party showing at least a fine array of teeth and wearing the patient attentive air of one who realizes himself to be under discussion yet does not understand what is being said  a countryman of yours fortunio sneered marius  the captain whose open ingenuous countenance dissembled as villainous a heart as ever beat in the breast of any man disowned the compatriotism with a smile  hardly monsieur said he battista is a piedmontese fortunio himself was a venetian  is he to be relied upon think you asked madame fortunio shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands it was not his habit to trust any man inordinately  he is an old soldier said he he has trailed a pike in the neapolitan wars i have crossquestioned him and found his answers bore out the truth of what he said  and what brings him to france asked tressan the captain smiled again and there came again that expressive shrug of his a little overready with the steel said he  they told fortunio that they proposed to place him sentry over mademoiselle instead of gilles as the italians absolute lack of french would ensure against corruption the captain readily agreed with them it would be a wise step the italian fingered his tattered hat his eyes on the ground  suddenly madame spoke to him she asked him for some account of himself and whence he came using the italian tongue of which she had a passing knowledge he followed her questions very attentively at times with apparent difficulty his eyes on her face his head craned a little forward  now and then fortunio had to intervene to make plainer to this ignorant piedmontese mind the marquises questions his answers came in a deep hoarse voice slurred by the accent of piedmont and madameher knowledge of italian being imperfecthad frequently to have recourse to fortunio to discover the meaning of what he said  at last she dismissed the pair of them bidding the captain see that he was washed and more fittingly clothed  an hour later after the seneschal had taken his departure to ride home to grenoble it was madame herself accompanied by marius and fortunio who conducted battistasuch was the name the italian had givento the apartments above where mademoiselle was now confined practically a prisoner     chapter xi valeries gaoler   my child said the dowager and her eyes dwelt on valerie with a look of studied gentleness why will you not be reasonable  the constant reflection that garnache was at large making his way back to paris to stir up vengeance for the outrage put upon him was not without a certain chastening effect upon the dowager she had a way of saying that she had as good a stomach for a fight as any man in france and a fight there should be if it came to it and garnache should return to assail condillac yet a certain pondering of the consequences a certain counting of the costordinarily unusual to her nature led her to have recourse to persuasion and to a gentleness no less unusual  valeries eyes were raised to hers with a look that held more scorn than wonder they were standing in the antechamber of valeries room yonder at his post lounged the recruit battista looking a trifle cleaner than when first he had been presented to the marquise but still not clean enough for a ladys antechamber he was leaning stolidly against the sill of the window his eyes on the distant waters of the isere which shone a dull copper colour in the afterglow of the october sunset his face was vacant his eyes pensive as he stood there undisturbed by the flow of a language he did not understand  fortunio and marius had departed and the marquiseplayed upon by her unusual tremorshad remained behind for a last word with the obstinate girl  in what madame asked valerie does my conduct fall short of reasonableness  the dowager made a movement of impatience if at every step she were to be confronted by these questions which had in them a savour of challenge she was wasting time in remaining  you are unreasonable in this foolish clinging to a promise given for you  given by me madame the girl amended knowing well to what promise the dowager referred  given by you then but given at an age when you could not understand the nature of it they had no right to bind you so  if it is for any to question that right it is for me valerie made answer her eyes ever meeting the dowagers unflinchingly and i am content to leave that right unquestioned i am content to fill the promise given in honour i could not do less  ah in honour the dowager sighed then she came a step nearer and her face grew sweetly wistful but your heart child what of your heart  my heart concerns myself i am the betrothed of florimondthat is all that concerns the world and you i respect and admire him more than any living man and i shall be proud to become his wife when he returns as his wife i shall become in spite of all that you and your son may do  the dowager laughed softly as if to herself  and if i tell you that florimond is dead  when you give me proof of that i shall believe it the girl replied the marquise looked at her her face manifesting no offence at the almost insulting words  and if i were to lay that proof before you she inquired sadly almost  valeries eyes opened a trifle wider as if in apprehension but her answer was prompt and her voice steady it still could have no effect upon my attitude towards your son  this is foolishness valerie  in you it is madame the girl broke in a foolishness to think you can constrain a girl compel her affections command her love by such means as you have employed towards me you think that it predisposes me to be wooed that it opens my heart to your son to see myself gaoled that he may pay me his court  gaoled child who gaols you the dowager cried as if the most surprising utterance had fallen from valeries lips  mademoiselle smiled in sorrow and some scorn  am i not gaoled then she asked what call you this what does that fellow there he is to lie outside my door at nights to see that none holds communication with me he is to go with me each morning to the garden when by your gracious charity i take the air sleeping and waking the man is ever within hearing of any word that i may utter  but if he has no french the dowager protested  to ensure no doubt against any attempt of mine to win him to my side to induce him to aid me escape from this prison oh madame i tell you you do but waste time and you punish me and harass yourself to little purpose had marius been such a man as i might have felt it in my nature to love which heaven forbidthese means by which you have sought to bring that thing about could but have resulted in making me hate him as i do  the dowagers fears were banished from her mind at that and with them went all thought of conciliating valerie anger gleamed in her eyes the set of her lips grew suddenly sneering and cruel so that the beauty of her face but served to render it hateful the more  so that you hate him ma mie a ripple of mockery on the current of her voice and he a man such as any girl in france might be proud to wed well well you are not to be constrained you say and the marquises laugh was menacing and unpleasant be not so sure mademoiselle be not so sure of that it may well betide that you shall come to beg upon your knees for this alliance with a man whom you tell me that you hate be not so sure you cannot be constrained  their eyes met both women were white to the lips but it was curbed passion in the one and deadly fear in the other for what the dowagers words left unsaid her eyes most eloquently conveyed the girl shrank back her hands clenched her lip caught in her teeth  there is a god in heaven madame she reminded the marquise  ayein heaven laughed the marquise turning to depart she paused by the door which the italian had sprung forward to open for her  marius shall take the air with you in the morning if it is fine ponder meanwhile what i have said  does this man remain here madame inquired the girl vainly seeking to render her voice steady  in the outer anteroom is his place but as the key of this room is on his side of the door he may enter here when he so pleases or when he thinks that he has reason to if the sight of him displeases you you may lock yourself from it in your own chamber yonder  the same she said in italian to the man who bowed impassively and followed the dowager into the outer room closing the door upon mademoiselle it was a chamber almost bare of furniture save for a table and chair which had been placed there so that the gaoler might take his meals  the man followed the marquise across the bare floor their steps resounding as they went and he held the outer door for her  without another word she left him and where he stood he could hear her steps as she tripped down the winding staircase of stone at last the door of the courtyard closed with a bang and the grating of a key announced to the mercenary that he and his charge were both imprisoned in that tower of the chateau de condillac  left alone in the anteroom mademoiselle crossed to the window and dropped limply into a chair her face was still very white her heart beating tumultuously for the horrid threat that had been conveyed in the dowagers words had brought her her first thrill of real fear since the beginning of this wooingbyforce three months ago a wooing which had become more insistent and less like a wooing day by day until it had culminated in her present helpless position  she was a strongsouled highspirited girl but tonight hope seemed extinguished in her breast florimond too seemed to have abandoned her either he had forgotten her or he was dead as the dowager said which might be the true state of things she did not greatly care the realization of how utterly she was in the power of madame de condillac and her son and the sudden chance discovery of how unscrupulously that power might be wielded filled her mind to the exclusion of all else  by the window she sat watching without heeding them the fading colours in the sky she was abandoned to these monsters and it seemed they would devour her she could hope for no help from outside since they had as she believedslain monsieur de garnache her mind dwelt for a moment on that glimpse of rescue that had been hers a week ago upon the few hours of liberty which she had enjoyed but which only seemed now to increase the dark hopelessness of her imprisonment  again with the eyes of her mind she beheld that grim stalwart figure saw his great nose his greying hair his fierce mustachios and his stern quick eyes again she heard the rasp of his metallic voice with its brisk derision she saw him in the hall below his foot upon the neck of that popinjay of condillac daring them all to draw a breath should he forbid it again in fancy she rode on the withers of his horse at the gallop towards grenoble a sigh escaped her surely that was the first man who was indeed a man she had ever set eyes on since her father died had garnache been spared she would have felt courage and she would have hoped for there was something about him that suggested energy and resource such as it is good to lean upon in times of stress again she heard that brisk metallic voice are you content madame have you had fine deeds enough for one day  and then breaking in upon her musings came the very voice of her daydream so suddenly sounding so natural and lifelike that she almost screamed so startled was she  mademoiselle it said i beg that youll not utterly lose heart i have come back to the thing her majesty bade me do and ill do it in spite of that tigress and her cub  she sat still as a statue scarce breathing her eyes fixed upon the violet sky the voice had ceased but still she sat on then it was slowly borne in upon her that that was no dreamvoice no trick of her overburdened mind a voice a living actual voice had uttered those words in this room here at her elbow  she turned and again she almost screamed for there just behind her his glittering eyes fixed upon her with singular intentness stood the swarthy blackhaired italian gaoler they had given her because he had no french  he had come up so quietly behind her that she had not heard his approach and he was leaning forward now with an odd suggestion of crouching in his attitude like a beast about to spring yet his gaze riveted hers as with a fascination and so while she looked his lips moved and from them in that same voice of her dreams came from this man who had no french the words  be not afraid mademoiselle i am that blunderer garnache that unworthy fool whose temper ruined what chance of saving you he had a week ago  she stared like one going mad  garnache said she in a husky whisper you garnache  yet the voice she knew was garnaches and none other it was a voice not easily mistaken and now as she looked and looked she saw that the mans nose was garnaches though oddly stained and those keen eyes they were garnaches too but the hair that had been brown and flecked with grey was black the reddish mustachios that had bristled like a mountain cats were black too and they hung limp and hid from sight the fine lines of his mouth a hideous stubble of unshorn beard defaced his chin and face and altered its sharp outline and the clear healthy skin that she remembered was now a dirty brown  suddenly the face smiled and it was a smile that reassured her and drove away the last doubt that she had she was on her feet in an instant  monsieur monsieur was all that she could say but her longing was to fling her arms about the neck of this man as she might have flung them about the neck of a brother or a father and sob out upon his shoulder the sudden relief and revulsion that his presence brought  garnache saw something of her agitation and to relieve it he smiled and began to tell her the circumstances of his return and his presentation to madame as a knave who had no french  fortune was very good to me mademoiselle said he i had little hope that such a face as mine could be disguised but i take no pride in what you see it is the handiwork of rabecque the most ingenious lackey that ever served a foolish master it helped me that having been ten years in italy when i was younger i acquired the language so well as to be able to impose even upon fortunio in that lay a circumstance which at once disarmed suspicion and if i stay not so long as it shall take the dye to wear from my hair and beard and the staining from my face i shall have little to fear  but monsieur she cried you have everything to fear and alarm grew in her eyes  but he laughed again for answer i have faith in my luck mademoiselle and i think i am on the tide of it at present i little hoped when i made my way into condillac in this array that i should end by virtue of my pretended ignorance of french in being appointed gaoler to you i had some ado to keep the joy from my eyes when i heard them planning it it is a thing that has made all else easy  but what can you do alone monsieur she asked him and there was a note almost of petulance in her voice  he moved to the window and leaned his elbow on the sill the light was fast fading i know not yet but i am here to contrive a means i shall think and watch  you know in what hourly peril i am placed she cried and suddenly remembering that he must have overheard and understood the dowagers words a sudden heat came to her cheeks to recede again and leave them marblepale and she thanked heaven that in the dusk and in the shadow where she stood he could but ill make out her face  if you think that i have been rash in returning  no no not rash monsieur noble and brave above all praise i would indeed i could tell you how noble and brave i account your action  it is as nothing to the bravery required to let rabecque do this hideous work upon a face for which i have ever entertained some measure of respect  he jested sooner than enlighten her that it was his egregious pride had fetched him back when he was but a few hours upon his journey pariswards his inability to brook the ridicule that would be his when he announced at the luxembourg that failure had attended him  ah but what can you do alone she repeated  give me at least a day or two to devise some means let me look round and take the measure of this gaol some way there must be i have not come so far and so successfully to be beaten now still he continued if you think that i overrate my strength or my resource if you would sooner that i sought men and made an assault upon condillac endeavouring to carry it and to let the queens will prevail by force of arms tell me so and i am gone tomorrow  whither would you go she cried her voice strained with sudden affright  i might seek help at lyons or moulins i might find loyal soldiers who would be willing to follow me by virtue of my warrant to levy such help as i may require if i but tell them that the help was refused me in grenoble i am not sure that it would be so for unfortunately my warrant is for the seneschal of dauphiny only still i might make the attempt  no no she implored him and in her eagerness to have him put all thought of leaving her from his mind she caught him by the arm and raised a pleading face to his do not leave me here monsieur of your pity do not leave me alone amongst them think me a coward if you will monsieur i am no less they have made a coward of me  he understood the thing she dreaded and a great pity welled up from his generous heart for this poor unfriended girl at the mercy of the beautiful witch of condillac and her beautiful rascally son he patted the hand that clutched his arm  i think myself that it will be best if i remain now that i have come so far he said let me ponder things it may well be that i shall devise some way  may heaven inspire you monsieur i shall spend the night in prayer i think imploring god and his saints to show you the way you seek  heaven i think should hear your prayers mademoiselle he answered musingly his glance upon the white saintly face that seemed to shine in the deepening gloom then suddenly he stirred and bent to listen  sh some one is coming he whispered and he sped quickly from her side and into the outer room where he sank noiselessly on to his chair as the steps ascended the stone staircase and a glow of yellow light grew gradually in the doorway that opened on to it     chapter xii a matter of conscience   that he might inspire the more confidence in the dowager and her son garnache organized and performed a little comedy at condillac a couple of nights after his appointment as mademoiselles gaoler he gave an alarm at dead midnight and when halfclad men followed presently by madame and marian rushed into the anteroom where he stood a very picture of the wildest excitement he drew their attention to two twisted sheets tied end to end hanging from the window which overlooked the moat and in answer to the marquises questions he informed her that he had been disturbed by sounds of movements and upon entering the chamber he had discovered mademoiselle making these preparations for departure  valerie locked in the inner chamber refused to come forth as the marquise bade her but her voice reassured madame de condillac of her presence and so since her attempt had failed madame was content to let her be  the little fool she said peering down from the window into the night she would have been killed for certain her rope of sheets does not reach more than a third of the way down she would have had over thirty feet to fall and if that had not been enough to finish her she would of a certainty have been drowned in the moat  she signified her satisfaction with the faithful battistas vigilance by a present of some gold pieces in the morning and since the height of the window and the moat beneath it did not appear sufficient obstacles to mademoiselles attempts at effecting her escape the dowager had the window nailed down thus only by breaking it could egress be obtained and the breaking of it could not be effected without such a noise as must arouse battista  under garnaches instructions the comedy was carried a little further mademoiselle affected for her gaoler a most unconquerable aversion and this she took pains to proclaim  one morning three days after her attempted escape she was taking the air in the garden of condillac battista ever watchful a few paces behind her when suddenly she was joined by mariusa splendid graceful figure in a ridingsuit of brown velvet and biscuitcoloured hose his points tipped with gold his long boots of the finest marroquin leather his livercoloured hound at his heels it was the last day of october but the weather from cold and wet that it had been for the past fortnight had taken on a sudden improvement the sun shone the air was still and warm and but for the strewn leaves and the faint smell of decay with which the breath of autumn is ever laden one might have fancied it a day of early spring  it was not valeries wont to pause when marius approached since she might not prevent him from walking where he listed she had long since abandoned the futility of bidding him begone when he came near her but at least she had never stopped in her walk never altered its pace she had suffered what she might not avoid but she had worn the outward air of suffering it with indifference this morning however she made a departure from her long habit not only did she pause upon observing his approach but she called to him as if she would have him hasten to her side and hasten he did a new light in his eyes that was mostly of surprise but a little also of hope  she was gracious to him for once and gave him good morning in a manner that bordered upon the pleasant wondering he fell into step beside her and they paced together the yewbordered terrace the evervigilant but discreet battista following them though keeping now a few paces farther in the rear  for a little while they appeared constrained and their talk was of the falling leaves and the grateful change that had so suddenly come upon the weather suddenly she stopped and faced him  will you do me a favour marius she asked he halted too and turned to her studying her gentle face seeking to guess her mind in the clear hazel eyes she raised to his his eyebrows lifted slightly with surprise nevertheless  there is in all the world valerie nothing you could ask me that i would not do he protested  she smiled wistfully how easy it is to utter words she sighed  marry me he answered leaning towards her his eyes devouring her now and you shall find my words very quickly turned to deeds  ah said she and her smile broadened and took on a scornful twist you make conditions now if i will marry you there is nothing you will not do for me so that conversely i may take it that if i do not marry you there is nothing you will do but in the meantime marius until i resolve me whether i will marry you or not would you not do a little thing that i might ask of you  until you resolve he cried and his face flushed with the sudden hope he gathered from those words hitherto there had been no suggestion of a possible modification of attitude towards his suit it had been repulsion definite and uncompromising again he studied her face was she fooling him this girl with the angelinnocence of glance the thought of such a possibility cooled him instantly what is it you want of me he asked his voice ungracious  only a little thing marius her glance travelled back over her shoulder to the tall limber fellow in leather jerkin and with crossgartered legs who lounged a dozen steps behind them rid me of that ruffians company said she  marius looked back at battista and from him to valerie then he smiled and made a slight movement with his shoulders  but to what end he asked as one who pleadingly opposes an argument that is unreasonable another would replace him and there is little to choose among the men that garrison condillac  little perhaps but that little matters sure of her ground and gathering from his tone and manner that the more ardently she begged this thing the less likely would it be that she should prevail she pursued her intercessions with a greater heat oh she cried in a pretended rage it is to insult me to give me that unclean knave for perpetual company i loathe and detest him the very sight of him is too much to endure  you exaggerate said he coldly  i do not indeed i do not she rejoined looking frankly pleadingly into his face you do not realize what it is to suffer the insolent vigilance of such as he to feel that your every step is under surveillance to feel his eyes ever upon you when you are within his sight oh it is insufferable  suddenly he gripped her arm his face within a hands breadth of her own his words falling hot and quickly on her ear  it is yours to end it when you will valerie he passionately reminded her give yourself into my keeping let it be mine to watch over you henceforth let me  abruptly he ceased she had drawn back her head her face was white to the lips and in her eyes as they dwelt on his at such close quarters there appeared a look of terror of loathing unutterable he saw it and releasing her arm he fell back as if she had struck him the colour left his face too  or is it he muttered thickly that i inspire you with much the same feeling as does he  she stood before him with lowered eyelids her bosom heaving still from the agitation of fear his closeness had aroused in her he studied her in silence a moment with narrowing eyes and tightening lips then anger stirred in him and quenched the sorrow with which at first he had marked the signs of her repulsion but anger in marius de condillac was a cold and deadly emotion that vented itself in no rantings uttered no loudvoiced threats or denunciations prompted no waving of arms or plucking forth of weapons  he stooped towards her again from his stately graceful height the cruelty hidden in the beautiful lines of his mouth took instant prominence in the smile that flickered round it  i think that battista makes a very excellent watchdog he said and you would have thought him amused as if at the foolish subterfuge of some little child you may be right to dislike him he knows no french so that it may not be yours to pervert and bribe him with promises of what you will do if he assists you to escape but you will see that this very quality which renders him detestable to you renders him invaluable to us  he laughed softly as one well pleased with his own astuteness doffed his hat with a politeness almost exaggerated and whistling his dog he abruptly left her  thus were marius and his motherto whom he bore the tale of valeries requesttricked further into reposing the very fullest trust in the watchful incorruptible battista realizing that this would be so garnache now applied himself more unreservedly to putting into effect the plans he had been maturing and he went about it with a zest that knew no flagging with a relish that nothing could impair not that it was other than usual for garnache to fling himself wholeheartedly into the conduct of any enterprise he might have upon his hands but he had come into this affair at condillac against his will stress of circumstances it was had driven him on step by step to take a personal hand in the actual deliverance of valerie  it was vanity and pride that had turned him back when already he was on the road to paris not without yet a further struggle would he accept defeat to this end had he been driven for the first time in his life to the indignity of his foul disguise and he whose methods had ever been direct had been forced to have recourse to the commonest of subterfuges it was with anger in his heart that he had proceeded to play the part he had assumed he felt it to be a thing unworthy of him a thing that derogated from his selfrespect had he but had the justification of some high political aim he might have endured it with a better resignation the momentous end to be served might have sanctioned the ignoble means adopted but here was a task in itself almost as unworthy of him as the methods by which he now set about accomplishing it he was to black his face and dye his beard and hair stain his skin and garb himself in filthy rags for no better end than that he might compass the enlargement of a girl from the captivity into which she had been forced by a designing lady of dauphiny was that a task to set a soldier a man of his years and birth and name he had revolted at it yet that stubborn pride of his that would not brook his return to paris to confess himself defeated by a woman over this womans business held him relentlessly to his distasteful course  and gradually the distaste of it had melted it had begun to fall away five nights ago when he had heard what passed between madame de condillac and valerie a great pity for this girl a great indignation against those who would account no means too base to achieve their ends with her a proper realization of the indignities she was suffering caused him to shed some of his reluctance some of his sense of injury to himself  his innate chivalry that fine spirit of his which had ever prompted him to defend the weak against the oppressor stirred him now and stirred him to such purpose that in the end from taking up the burden of his task reluctantly he came to bear it zestfully and almost gladly he was rejoiced to discover himself equipped with histrionic gifts of which he had had no suspicion hitherto and it delighted him to set them into activity  now it happened that at condillac there was a fellow countryman of battistas a mercenary from northern italy a rascal named arsenio whom fortunio had enlisted when first he began to increase the garrison a month ago upon this fellows honesty garnache had formed designs he had closely observed him and in arsenios countenance he thought he detected a sufficiency of villainy to augur well for the prosperity of any scheme of treachery that might be suggested to him provided the reward were adequate  garnache went about sounding the man with a wiliness peculiarly his own arsenio being his only compatriot at condillac it was not wonderful that in his few daily hours of relief from his gaolers duty battista should seek out the fellow and sit in talk with him the pair became intimate and intercourse between them grew more free and unrestrained garnache waited wishing to risk nothing by precipitancy and watched for his opportunity it came on the morrow of all saints on that day of the dead arsenio whose rearing had been that of a true son of mother church was stirred by the memory of his earthly mother who had died some three years before he was silent and moody and showed little responsiveness to garnaches jesting humour garnache wondering what might be toward in the fellows mind watched him closely  suddenly the little manhe was a short bowlegged sinewy fellowheaved a great sigh as he plucked idly at a weed that grew between two stones of the inner courtyard where they were seated on the chapel steps  you are a dull comrade today compatriot said garnache clapping him on the shoulder  it is the day of the dead the fellow answered him as though that were an ample explanation garnache laughed  to those that are dead it no doubt is so was yesterday so will tomorrow be but to us who sit here it is the day of the living  you are a scoffer the other reproached him and his rascally face was oddly grave you dont understand  enlighten me then convert me  it is the day when our thoughts turn naturally to the dead and mine are with my mother who has lain in her grave these three years i am thinking of what she reared me and of what i am  garnache made a grimace which the other did not observe he stared at the little cutthroat and there was some dismay in his glance what ailed the rogue was he about to repent him of his sins and to have done with villainy and treachery was he minded to slit no more gullets in the future be faithful to the hand that paid him and lead a godlier life peste that was a thing that would nowise suit monsieur de garnaches ends just then if arsenio had a mind to reform let him postpone that reformation until garnache should have done with him so he opened his lips and let out a deep guffaw of mockery  we shall have you turning monk said he a candidate for canonization going barefoot with flagellated back and shaven head no more wine no more dice no more wenches no more  peace snapped the other  say pax suggested garnache pax tecum or vobiscum it is thus you will be saying it later  if my conscience pricks me is it aught to you have you no conscience of your own  none men wax lean on it in this vale of tears it is a thing invented by the great to enable them to pursue the grinding and oppression of the small if your master pays you ill for the dirty work you do for him and another comes along to offer you some rich reward for an omission in that same service you are warned that if you let yourself be tempted your conscience will plague you afterwards pish a clumsy childish device that to keep you faithful  arsenio looked up words that defamed the great were ever welcome to him arguments that showed him he was oppressed and imposed upon sounded ever gratefully in his ears he nodded his approval of battistas dictum  body of bacchus he swore you are right in that compatriot but my case is different i am thinking of the curse that mother church has put upon this house yesterday was all saints and never a mass heard i today is all souls and never a prayer may i offer up in this place of sin for the rest of my mothers soul  how so quoth garnache looking in wonder at this religiously minded cutthroat  how so is not the house of condillac under excommunication and every man who stays in it of his own free will prayers and sacraments are alike forbidden here  garnache received a sudden inspiration he leapt to his feet his face convulsed as if at the horror of learning of a hitherto undreamtof state of things he never paused to give a moments consideration to the cutthroats mind so wonderfully constituted as to enable him to break with impunity every one of the commandments every day of the week for the matter of a louis dor or two and yet be afflicted by qualms of conscience at living under a roof upon which the church had hurled her malediction  what are you saying compatriot what is it that you tell me  the truth said arsenio with a shrug any man who wilfully abides in the services of condillacand instinctively he lowered his voice lest the captain or the marquise should be within earshot is excommunicate  by the host swore the false piedmontese i am a christian man myself arsenio and i have lived in ignorance of this thing  that ignorance may be your excuse but now that you know arsenio shrugged his shoulders  now that i know i had best have a care of my soul and look about me for other employment  alas sighed arsenio it is none so easy to find  garnache looked at him garnache began to have in his luck a still greater faith than hitherto he glanced stealthily around then he sat down again so that his mouth was close to arsenios ear  the pay is beggarly here yet i have refused a fortune offered me by another that i might remain loyal to my masters at condillac but this thing that you tell me alters everything by the host yes  a fortune sneered arsenio  aye a fortuneat least fifty pistoles that is a fortune to some of us  arsenio whistled tell me more said he  garnache rose with the air of one about to depart  i must think of it said he and he made shift to go but the others hand fell with a clenching grip upon his arm  of what must you think fool said he tell me this service you have been offered i have a conscience that upbraids me if you refuse these fifty pistoles why should not i profit by your folly  there would not be the need two men are required for the thing i speak of and there are fifty pistoles for each if i decide to undertake the task ill speak of you as a likely second  he nodded gloomily to his companion and shaking off his hold he set out to cross the yard but arsenio was after him and had fastened again upon his arm detaining him  you fool said he youd not refuse this fortune  it would mean treachery whispered garnache  that is bad the other agreed and his face fell but remembering what garnache had said he was quick to brighten again is it to these folk here at condillac he asked garnache nodded and they would paythese people that seek our service would pay you fifty pistoles  they seek my service only as yet they might seek yours were i to speak for you  and you will compatriot you will will you not we are comrades we are friends and we are fellowcountrymen in a strange land there is nothing i would not do for you battista look i would die for you if there should come the need body of bacchus i would i am like that when i love a man  garnache patted his shoulder you are a good fellow arsenio  and you will speak for me  but you do not know the nature of the service said garnache you may refuse it when it is definitely offered you  refuse fifty pistoles i should deserve to be the pauper that i am if such had been my habits be the service what it may my conscience pricks me for serving condillac tell me how the fifty pistoles are to be earned and you may count upon me to put my hand to anything  garnache was satisfied but he told arsenio no more that day beyond assuring him he would speak for him and let him know upon the morrow nor on the morrow when they returned to the subject at arsenios eager demand did garnache tell him all or even that the service was mademoiselles instead he pretended that it was some one in grenoble who needed two such men as they  word has been brought me he said mysteriously you must not ask me how  but how the devil are we to reach grenoble the captain will never let us go said arsenio in an illhumour  on the night that you are of the watch arsenio we will depart together without asking the captains leave you shall open the postern when i come to join you here in the courtyard  but what of the man at the door yonder and he jerked his thumb towards the tower where mademoiselle was a captive and where at night battista was locked in with her at the door leading to the courtyard a sentry was always posted for greater security that door and that sentry were obstacles which garnache saw the futility of attempting to overcome without aid that was why he had been forced to enlist arsenios assistance  you must account for him arsenio said he  thus inquired arsenio coolly and he passed the edge of his hand significantly across his throat garnache shook his head  no said he there will be no need for that a blow over the head will suffice besides it may be quieter you will find the key of the tower in his belt when you have felled him get it and unlock the door then whistle for me the rest will be easy  you are sure he has the key  i have it from madame herself they were forced to leave it with him to provide for emergencies mademoiselles attempted escape by the window showed them the necessity for it he did not add that it was the implicit confidence they reposed in battista himself that had overcome their reluctance to leave the key with the sentry  to seal the bargain and in earnest of all the gold to come garnache gave arsenio a couple of gold louis as a loan to be repaid him when their nameless employer should pay him his fifty pistoles in grenoble  the sight and touch of the gold convinced arsenio that the thing was no dream he told garnache that he believed he would be on guardduty on the night of the following wednesdaythis was fridayand so for wednesday next they left the execution of their plans unless meantime a change should be effected in the disposition of the sentries     chapter xiii the courier   monsieur de garnache was pleased with the issue of his little affair with arsenio  mademoiselle he told valerie that evening i was right to have faith in my luck right to believe that the tide of it is flowing all we need now is a little patience everything has become easy  it was the hour of supper valerie was at table in her anteroom and battista was in attendance it was an added duty they had imposed upon him for since her attempt to escape mademoiselles imprisonment had been rendered more rigorous than ever no servant of the chateau was allowed past the door of the outer anteroom now commonly spoken of as the guardroom of the tower valerie dined daily in the salon with madame de condillac and marius but her other meals were served her in her own apartments the servants who brought the meals from the kitchen delivered them to battista in the guardroom and he it was who laid the cloth and waited upon mademoiselle at first this added duty had irritated him more than all that he had so far endured had he martin marie rigobert de garnache lived to discharge the duties of a lackey to bear dishes to a ladys table and to remain at hand to serve her the very thought had all but set him in a rage but presently he grew reconciled to it it afforded him particular opportunities of being in mademoiselles presence and of conferring with her and for the sake of such an advantage he might well belittle the unsavoury part of the affair  a halfdozen candles burned in two gleaming silver sconces on the table in her tallbacked leather chair mademoiselle sat and ate and drank but little while garnache told her of the preparations he had made  if my luck but holds until wednesday next he concluded you may count upon being well out of condillac arsenio does not dream that you come with us so that even should he change his mind at least we have no cause to fear a betrayal but he will not change his mind the prospect of fifty pistoles has rendered it immutable  she looked up at him with eyes brightened by hope and by the encouragement to count upon success which she gathered from his optimism  you have contrived it marvellously well she praised him if we succeed  say when we succeed mademoiselle he laughingly corrected her  very well thenwhen we shall have succeeded in leaving condillac whither am i to go  why with me to paris as was determined my man awaits me at voiron with money and horses no further obstacle shall rise to hamper us once our backs are turned upon the ugly walls of condillac the queen shall make you welcome and keep you safe until monsieur florimond comes to claim his bride  she sipped her wine then set down the glass and leaned her elbow on the table taking her chin in her fine white hand madame tells me that he is dead said she and garnache was shocked at the comparative calmness with which she said it he looked at her sharply from under his sooted brows was she after all he wondered no different from other women was she cold and calculating and had she as little heart as he had come to believe was usual with her sex that she could contemplate so calmly the possibility of her lover being dead he had thought her better more natural more largehearted and more pure that had encouraged him to stand by her in these straits of hers no matter at what loss of dignity to himself it began to seem that his conclusions had been wrong  his silence caused her to look up and in his face she read something of what was passing in his thoughts she smiled rather wanly  you are thinking me heartless monsieur de garnache  i am thinking youwomanly  the same thing then to your mind tell me monsieur do you know much of women  god forbid i have found trouble enough in my life  and you pass judgment thus upon a sex with which you have no acquaintance  not by acquaintance only is it that we come to knowledge there are ways of learning other than by the road of experience one may learn of dangers by watching others perish it is the fool who will be satisfied alone with the knowledge that comes to him from what he undergoes himself  you are very wise monsieur said she demurely so demurely that he suspected her of laughing at him you were never wed  never mademoiselle he answered stiffly nor ever in any danger of it  must you indeed account it a danger  a deadly peril mademoiselle said he whereupon they both laughed  she pushed back her chair and rose slowly slowly she passed from the table and stepped towards the window turning she set her back to it and faced him  monsieur de garnache said she you are a good man a true and noble gentleman i would that you thought a little better of us all women are not contemptible believe me i will pray that you may yet mate with one who will prove to you the truth of what i say  he smiled gently and shook his head  my child said he i am not half the noble fellow you account me i have a stubborn pride that stands me at times in the stead of virtue it was pride brought me back here for instance i could not brook the laughter that would greet me in paris did i confess that i was beaten by the dowager of condillac i tell you this to the end that thinking less well of me you may spare me prayers which i should dread to see fulfilled i have told you before mademoiselle heaven is likely to answer the prayers of such a heart as yours  yet but a moment back you deemed me heartless she reminded him  you seemed so indifferent to the fate of florimond de condillac  i must have seemed then what i am not she told him for i am far from indifferent to florimonds fate the truth is monsieur i do not believe madame de condillac knowing me to be under a promise that naught can prevail upon me to break she would have me believe that nature has dissolved the obligation for me she thinks that were i persuaded of florimonds death i might turn an ear to the wooing of marius but she is mistaken utterly mistaken and so i sought to convince her my father willed that i should wed florimond florimonds father had been his dearest friend i promised him that i would do his will and by that promise i am bound but were florimond indeed dead and were i free to choose i should not choose marius were he the only man in all the world  garnache moved nearer to her  you speak said he as if you were indifferent in the matter of wedding florimond whilst i understand that your letter to the queen professed you eager for the alliance i may be impertinent but frankly your attitude puzzles me  i am not indifferent she answered him but calmly without enthusiasm florimond and i were playmates and as a little child i loved him and admired him as i might have loved and admired a brother perhaps he is comely honourable and true i believe he would be the kindest husband ever woman had and so i am content to give my life into his keeping what more can be needed  never ask me mademoiselle i am by no means an authority said he but you appear to have been well schooled in a most excellent philosophy and he laughed outright she reddened under his amusement  it was thus my father taught me said she in quieter tones and he was the wisest man i ever knew just as he was the noblest and the bravest  garnache bowed his head god rest his soul said he with respectful fervour  amen the girl replied and they fell silent  presently she returned to the subject of her betrothed  if florimond is living this prolonged absence this lack of news is very strange it is three months since last we heard of himfour months indeed yet he must have been apprised of his fathers death and that should have occasioned his return  was he indeed apprised of it inquired garnache did you yourself communicate the news to him  i she cried but no monsieur we do not correspond  that is a pity said garnache for i believe that the knowledge of the marquiss death was kept from him by his stepmother  mon dieu she exclaimed in horror do you mean that he may still be in ignorance of it  not that a month ago a courier was dispatched to him by the queenmother the last news of him some four months old as you have saidreported him at milan in the service of spain thither was the courier sent to find him and to deliver him letters setting forth what was toward at condillac  a month ago she said and still we have no word i am full of fears for him monsieur  and i said garnache am full of hope that we shall have news of him at any moment  that he was well justified of his hope was to be proven before they were many days older meanwhile garnache continued to play his part of gaoler to the entire satisfaction and increased confidence of the condillacs what time he waited patiently for the appointed night when it should be his friend arsenios turn to take the guard  on that fateful wednesday battista sought outas had now become his invariable customhis compatriot as soon as the time of his noontide rest was come the hour at which they dined at condillac he found arsenio sunning himself in the outer courtyard for it seemed that year that as the winter approached the warmth increased never could man remember such a saint martins summer as was this  in so far as the matter of their impending flight was concerned battista was as brief as he could be  is all well he asked shall you be on guard tonight  yes it is my watch from sunset till dawn at what hour shall we be stirring  garnache pondered a moment stroking that firm chin of his on which the erstwhile stubble had now grown into a straggling unkempt beardand it plagued him not a little for a close observer might have discovered that it was of a lighter colour at the roots his hair too was beginning to lose its glossy blackness it was turning dull and presently no doubt it would begin to pale so that it was high time he spread his wings and took flight from condillac  we had best wait until midnight it will give them time to be soundly in their slumbers though should there be signs of any one stirring even then you had better wait till later it were foolish to risk having our going prevented for the sake of leaving a halfhour earlier  depend upon me arsenio answered him when i open the door of your tower i shall whistle to you the key of the postern hangs on the guardroom wall i shall possess myself of that before i come  good said garnache we understand each other  and on that they might have parted there and then but that there happened in that moment a commotion at the gate men hurried from the guardhouse and fortunios voice sounded loud in command a horseman had galloped up to condillac walked his horse across the bridgewhich was raised only at nightand was knocking with the butt of his whip an imperative summons upon the timbers of the gate  by fortunios orders it was opened and a man covered with dust astride a weary foamflecked horse rode under the archway of the keep into the first courtyard of the chateau  garnache eyed him in surprise and inquiry and he read in the mans appearance that he was a courier the horseman had halted within a few paces of the spot where battista and his companion stood and seeing in the vilely clad garnache a member of the condillac household he flung him his reins then got down stiffly from his horse  fortunio bristling with importance his left hand on the hilt of his rapier the fingers of his right twirling at his long fair mustachios at once confronted him and craved his business  i am the bearer of letters for madame the dowager marquise de condillac was the reply whereupon with an arrogant nod fortunio bade the fellow go with him and issued an order that his horse should be cared for  arsenio was speaking in garnaches ear the mans nature was inquisitive and he was indulging idle conjectures as to what might be the news this courier brought garnaches mind actuated by very different motives was engaged upon the same task so much so that not a word heard he of what his supposed compatriot was whispering whence came this courier why had not that fool fortunio asked him so that garnache might have overheard his answer was he from paris and the queen or was he perchance from italy and florimond these were questions to which it imported him to have the answers he must know what letters the fellow brought the knowledge might guide him now might even cause him to alter the plans he had formed  he stood in thought whilst unheeded by him arsenio prattled at his elbow he bethought him of the old minstrels gallery at the end of the hall in which the condillacs were dining and whither the courier would be conducted he knew the way to that gallery for he had made a very close study of the chateau against the time when he might find himself in need of the knowledge  with a hurried excuse to arsenio he moved away and looking round to see that he was unobserved he was on the point of making his way to the gallery when suddenly he checked himself what went he there to do to play the spy to become fellow to the lackey who listens at keyholes ah no that was something no service could demand of him he might owe a duty to the queen but there was also a duty that he owed himself and this duty forbade him from going to such extremes thus spake his pride and he mistook its voice for that of honour betide what might it was not for garnache to play the eavesdropper not that pardieu  and so he turned away his desires in conflict with that pride of his and gloomily he paced the courtyard arsenio marvelling what might have come to him and well was it for him that pride should have detained him well would it seem as if his luck were indeed in the ascendant and had prompted his pride to save him from a deadly peril for suddenly some one called battista  he heard but for the moment absorbed as he was in his own musings he overlooked the fact that it was the name to which he answered at condillac  not until it was repeated more loudly and imperatively did he turn to see fortunio beckoning him with a sudden dread anxiety he stepped to the captains side was he discovered but fortunios words set his doubts to rest at once  you are to reconduct mademoiselle de la vauvraye to her apartments at once  garnache bowed and followed the captain up the steps and into the chateau that he might carry out the order and as he went he shrewdly guessed that it was the arrival of that courier had occasioned the sudden removal of mademoiselle  when they were alone togetherhe and shein her anteroom in the northern tower she turned to him before he had time to question her as he was intending  a courier has arrived said she  i know i saw him in the courtyard whence is he did you learn it  from florimond she was white with agitation  from the marquis de condillac he cried and he knew not whether to hope or fear from italy  no monsieur i do not think from italy from what was said i gathered that florimond is already on his way to condillac oh it made a fine stir it left them no more appetite for dinner and they seem to have thought it could have left me none for mine for they ordered my instant return to my apartments  then you know nothingsave that the courier is from the marquis  nothing nor am i likely to she answered and her arms dropped limply to her sides her eyes looked entreatingly up into his gloomy face  but garnache could do no more than rap out an oath then he stood still a moment his eyes on the window his chin in his hand brooding his pride and his desire to know more of that couriers message were fighting it out again in his mind just as they fought it out in the courtyard below suddenly his glance fell on her standing there so sweet so frail and so disconsolate for her sake he must do the thing repulsive though it might be  i must know more he exclaimed i must learn florimonds whereabouts if only that we may go to meet him when we leave condillac tonight  you have arranged definitely for that she asked her face lighting  all is in readiness he assured her then lowering his voice without apparent reason and speaking quickly and intently i must go find out what i can he said there may be a risk but it is as nothing to the risk we run of blundering matters through ignorance of what may be afoot should any one comewhich is unlikely for all those interested will be in the hall until the courier is dealt withand should they inquire into my absence you are to know nothing of it since you have no italian and i no french all that you will know will be that you believe i went but a moment since to fetch water you understand  she nodded  then lock yourself in your chamber till i return  he caught up a large earthenware vessel in which water was kept for his own and mademoiselles use emptied it through the guardroom window into the moat below then left the room and made his way down the steps to the courtyard  he peered out not a soul was in sight this inner courtyard was little tenanted at that time of day and the sentry at the door of the tower was only placed there at nightfall alongside this there stood another door opening into a passage from which access might be gained to any part of the chateau thrusting behind that door the earthenware vessel that he carried garnache sped swiftly down the corridor on his eavesdropping errand still his mind was in conflict at times he cursed his slowness at times his haste and readiness to undertake so dirty a business wishing all women at the devil since by the work of women was he put to such a shift as this     chapter xiv florimonds letter   in the great hall of condillac where the marquise her son and mademoiselle de la vauvraye had been at dinner a sudden confusion had been spread by the arrival of that courier so soon as it was known that he bore letters from florimond marquis de condillac  madame had risen hastily fear and defiance blending in her face and she had at once commanded mademoiselles withdrawal valerie had wondered might there not be lettersor leastways messagesfor herself from her betrothed but her pride had suppressed the eager question that welled up to her lips she would too have questioned the courier concerning florimonds health she would have asked him how the marquis looked and where the messenger had left him but of all this that she craved to know nothing could she bring herself to ask before the marquise  she rose in silence upon hearing the dowager order fortunio to summon battista that he might reconduct mademoiselle to her apartments and she moved a few paces down the hall towards the door in proud submissive readiness to depart yet she could not keep her eyes from the duststained courier who having flung his hat and whip upon the floor was now opening his wallet the dowager standing before him to receive his papers  marius affecting an insouciance he did not feel remained at table his page behind his chair his hound stretched at his feet and he now sipped his wine now held it to the light that he might observe the beauty of its deep red colour  at last fortunio returned and mademoiselle took her departure head in the air and outwardly seeming nowise concerned in what was taking place with her went fortunio and the marquise who now held the package she had received from the courier bade the page depart also  when the three were at last alone she paused before opening the letter and turned again to the messenger she made a brave figure in the flood of sunlight that poured through the gules and azures of the long blazoned windows her tall lissome figure clad in a closefitting robe of black velvet her abundant glossy black hair rolled back under its white coif her black eyes and scarlet lips detaching from the ivory of her face in which no trace of emotion showed for all the anxiety that consumed her  where left you the marquis de condillac she asked the fellow  at la rochette madame the courier answered and his answer brought marius to his feet with an oath  so near he cried out but the dowagers glance remained calm and untroubled  how does it happen that he did not hasten himself to condillac she asked  i do not know madame i did not see monsieur le marquis it was his servant brought me that letter with orders to ride hither  marius approached his mother his brow clouded  let us see what he says he suggested anxiously but his mother did not heed him she stood balancing the package in her hand  can you tell us then nothing of monsieur le marquis  nothing more than i have told you madame  she bade marius call fortunio and then dismissed the courier bidding her captain see to his refreshment  then alone at last with her son she hastily tore the covering from the letter unfolded it and read and marius moved by anxiety came to stand beside and just behind her where he too might read the letter ran  my very dear marquisei do not doubt but that it will pleasure you to hear that i am on my way home and that but for a touch of fever that has detained us here at la rochette i should be at condillac as soon as the messenger who is the bearer of these presents a courier from paris found me a fortnight since in milan with letters setting forth that my father had been dead six months and that it was considered expedient at court that i should return home forthwith to assume the administration of condillac i am lost in wonder that a communication of this nature should have been addressed to me from paris instead of from you as surely it must have been your duty to advise me of my fathers decease at the time of that untoward event i am cast down by grief at this evil news and the summons from court has brought me in all haste from milan the lack of news from condillac has been for months a matter of surprise to me my fathers death may be some explanation of this but scarcely explanation enough however madame i count upon it that you will be able to dispel such doubts as i am fostering i count too upon being at condillac by the end of week but i beg that neither you nor my dear marius will allow this circumstance to make any difference to yourselves just as although i am returning to assume the government of condillac as the court has suggested to me i hope that yourself and my dear brother will continue to make it your home for as long as it shall pleasure you so long shall it pleasure me  i am my dear marquise your very humble and very affectionate servant and stepson  florimond  when she had read to the end the dowager turned back and read aloud the passage however madame i count upon it that you will be able to dispel such doubts as i am fostering she looked at her son who had shifted his position so that he was now confronting her  he has his suspicions that all is not as it should be sneered marius  yet his tone is amiable throughout it cannot be that they said too much in that letter from paris a little trill of bitter laughter escaped her we are to continue to make this our home for as long as it shall pleasure us so long shall it pleasure him  then with a sudden seriousness she folded the letter and putting her hands behind her looked up into her sons face  well she asked what are you going to do  strange that he makes no mention of valerie said marius pensively  pooh a condillac thinks lightly of his women what are you going to do  his handsome countenance so marvellously like her own was overcast he looked gloomily at his mother for a moment then with a slight twitch of the shoulders he turned and moved past her slowly in the direction of the hearth he leaned his elbow on the overmantel and rested his brow against his clenched right hand and stood so awhile in moody thought she watched him a frown between her arrogant eyes  aye ponder it said she he is at la rochette within a days ride and only detained there by a touch of fever in any case he promises to be here by the end of the week by saturday then condillac will have passed out of our power it will be lost to you irretrievably will you lose la vauvraye as well  he let his hand fall to his side and turned fully to face her  what can i do what can we do he asked a shade of petulance in his question  she stepped close up to him and rested her hand lightly upon his shoulder  you have had three months in which to woo that girl and you have tarried sadly over it marius you have now at most three days in which to accomplish it what will you do  i have been maladroit perhaps he said with bitterness i have been overpatient with her i have counted too much upon the chance of florimonds being dead as seemed from the utter lack of news of him yet what could i do carry her off by force and compel at the daggers point some priest to marry us  she moved her hand from his shoulder and smiled as if she derided him and his heat  you want for invention marius said she and yet i beg that you will exert your mind or sunday next shall find us wellnigh homeless ill take no charity from the marquis de condillac nor i think will you  if all fails said he we have still your house in touraine  my house she echoed her voice shrill with scorn my hovel you would say could you abide therein such a sty  vertudieu if all else failed we might be glad of it  glad of it not i for one yet all else will fail unless you bestir yourself in the next three days condillac is as good as lost to you already since florimond is upon the threshold la vauvraye most certainly will be lost to you as well unless you make haste to snatch it in the little moment that is left you  can i achieve the impossible madame he cried and his impatience waxed beneath this unreasonable insistence of his mothers  who asks it of you  do not you madame  i pish all that i urge is that you take valerie across the border into savoy where you can find a priest to marry you and get it done this side of saturday  and is not that the impossible she will not go with me as you well know madame  there was a moments silence the dowager shot him a glance then her eyes fell her bosom stirred as if some strange excitement moved her fear and shame were her emotions for a way she knew by which mademoiselle might be induced to go with himnot only willingly but eagerly she thoughtto the altar but she was his mother and even her harsh nature shuddered before the task of instructing him in this vile thing why had the fool not wit enough to see it for himself  observing her silence marius smiled sardonically  you may well ponder it said he it is an easy matter to tell me what i should do tell me rather how it should be done  his blindness stirred her anger and her anger whelmed her hesitation  were i in your place marius i should find a way said she in a voice utterly expressionless her eyes averted ever from his own  he scanned her curiously her agitation was plain to him and it puzzled him as did the downcast glance of eyes usually so bold and insolent in their gaze then he pondered her tone so laden with expression by its very expressionlessness and suddenly a flood of light broke upon his mind revealing very clearly and hideously her meaning he caught his breath with a sudden gasp and blenched a little then his lips tightened suddenly  in that case madame he said after a pause and speaking as if he were still without revelation of her meaning i can but regret that you are not in my place for as it is i am thinking we shall have to make the best of the hovel in touraine  she bit her lip in the intensity of her chagrin and shame she was no fool nor did she imagine from his words that her meaning had been lost upon him she knew that he had understood and that he chose to pretend that he had not she looked up suddenly her dark eyes blazing a splash of colour in either cheek  fool she snapped at him you lilylivered fool are you indeed my son are youby godthat you talk so lightly of yielding she advanced a step in his direction through your cowardice you may be content to spend your days in beggary not so am i nor shall i be so long as i have an arm and a voice you may go hence if your courage fails you outright but ill throw up the bridge and entrench myself within these walls florimond de condillac sets no foot in here while i live and if he should come within range of musketshot it will be the worse for him  i think you are mad madamemad so to talk of resisting him as you are mad to call me coward ill leave you till you are come to a more tranquil frame of mind and turning upon his heel his face on fire from the lash of her contempt he strode down the hall and passed out leaving her alone  white again with heaving bosom and clenched hands she stood a moment where he had left her then dropped into a chair and taking her chin in her hand she rested her elbow on her knee thus she remained the firelight tinting her perfect profile on which little might be read of the storm that was raging in her soul another woman in her place would have sought relief in tears but tears came rarely to the beautiful eyes of the marquise de condillac  she sat there until the sun had passed from the windows behind her and the corners of the room were lost in the quickening shadows at last she was disturbed by the entrance of a lackey who announced that monsieur le comte de tressan lord seneschal of dauphiny was come to condillac  she bade the fellow call help to clear the board where still was set their interrupted noontide meal and then to admit the seneschal with her back to the stirring bustling servants she stood pensively regarding the flames and a smile that was mocking rather than aught else spread upon her face  if all else failed her she told herself there would be no touraine hovel for her she could always be comtesse de tressan let marius work out alone the punishment of his cowardice  away in the northern tower where mademoiselle was lodged she sat in eager talk with garnache who had returned unobserved and successful from his journey of espionage  he had told her what from the conversation of marius and his mother he had learned touching the contents of that letter florimond lay as near as la rochette detained there by a touch of fever but promising to be at condillac by the end of the week since that was so valerie opined there was no longer the need to put themselves to the trouble of the escape they had planned let them wait until florimond came  but garnache shook his head he had heard more and for all that he accounted her at present safe from marius yet he made no false estimate of that supple gentlemans character was not deluded by his momentary show of niceness as the time of florimonds arrival grew nearer he thought it very possible that marius might be rendered desperate there was grave danger in remaining he said naught of this yet he convinced mademoiselle that it were best to go  though there will no longer be the need of a toilsome journey as far as paris he concluded a four hours ride to la rochette and you may embrace your betrothed  did he speak of me in his letter know you monsieur she inquired  i heard them say that he did not garnache replied but it may well be that he had good reason he may suspect more than he has written  in that case she askedand there was a wounded note in her voicewhy should a touch of fever keep him at la rochette would a touch of fever keep you from the woman you loved monsieur if you knew or even suspected that she was in durance  i do not know mademoiselle i am an old man who has never loved and so it would be unfair of me to pass judgment upon lovers that they think not as other folk is notorious their minds are for the time disordered  nevertheless he looked at her where she sat by the window so gentle so lissome so sweet and so frail and he had a shrewd notion that were he florimond de condillac whether he feared her in durance or not not the fever nor the plague itself should keep him for the best part of a week at la rochette within easy ride of her  she smiled gently at his words and turned the conversation to the matter that imported most  tonight then it is determined that we are to go  at midnight or a little after be in readiness mademoiselle and do not keep me waiting when i rap upon your door haste may be of importance  you may count upon me my friend she answered him and stirred by a sudden impulse she held out her hand you have been very good to me monsieur de garnache you have made life very different for me since your coming i had it in my mind to blame you once for your rashness in returning alone i was a little fool you can never know the peace that has come to me from having you at hand the fears the terrors that possessed me before you came have all been dispelled in this last week that you have been my sentry in two senses  he took the hand she held out to him and looked down at her out of his grimy disfigured face an odd tenderness stirring him he felt as might have felt a father towards his daughterat least so thought he then  child he answered her you overrate it i have done no less than i could do no more than any other would have done  yet more than florimond has doneand he my betrothed a touch of fever was excuse enough to keep him at la rochette whilst the peril of death did not suffice to deter you from coming hither  you forget mademoiselle that maybe he does not know your circumstances  maybe he does not said she with a halfsigh then she looked up into his face again i am sad at the thought of going monsieur she surprised him by saying  sad he cried then he laughed but what can there be to sadden you  this monsieur that after tonight it is odds i shall never see you more she said it without hesitation and without coquetry for her upbringing had been simple and natural in an atmosphere different far from that in which had been reared the courtly women he had known you will return to paris and the great world and i shall live out my life in this little corner of dauphiny you will forget me in the bustle of your career monsieur but i shall always hold your memory very dear and very gratefully you are the only friend i have ever known since my father died excepting florimond though it is so long since i have seen him and he never came to me in times of stress as you have done  mademoiselle he answered touched despite himself more touched than he could have believed possible to his callous worldworn natureyou make me very proud you make me feel a little better than i am for if i have earned your regard and friendship there must be some good in old garnache believe me mademoiselle i too shall not forget  and thereafter they remained a spell in silence she sitting by the window gazing out into the bright october sky he standing by her chair thoughtfully considering her brown head so gracefully set upon her little shoulders a feeling came to him that was odd and unusual he sought to interpret it and he supposed it to mean that he wished that at some time in the dim past he might have married some woman who would have borne him for daughter such a one as this     chapter xv the conference   the matter that brought monsieur de tressan to condillacand brought him in most fearful hastewas the matter of the courier who had that day arrived at the chateau  news of it had reached the ears of my lord seneschal his mind had been a prey to uneasiness concerning this business of rebellion in which he had so rashly lent a hand and he was anxious to know whence came this courier and what news he brought but for all his haste he had pausedremembering it was the marquise he went to visitto don the gorgeous yellow suit with the hanging sleeves which he had had from paris and the crimson sash he had bought at taillemants all in the very latest mode  thus arrayed his wig well curled and a clump of it caught in ribbon of flamecoloured silk on the left side his sword hanging from belt and carriages richly wrought with gold and the general courtierlike effect rather marred by the heavy ridingboots which he would have liked to leave behind yet was constrained to wear he presented himself before the dowager hiding his anxiety in a melting smile and the latter in the profoundest of bows  the graciousness of his reception overwhelmed him almost for in his supreme vanity he lacked the wit to see that this cordiality might be dictated by no more than the need they had of him at condillac a lackey placed a great chair for him by the fire that he might warm himself after his evening ride and the dowager having ordered lights sat herself opposite him with the hearth between them  he simpered awhile and toyed with trivialities of speech before he gave utterance to the matter that absorbed him then at last when they were alone he loosed the question that was bubbling on his lips  i hear a courier came to condillac today  for answer she told him what he sought to learn whence came that courier and what the message that he brought  and so monsieur de tressan she ended my days at condillac are numbered  why so he asked since you say that florimond has adopted towards you a friendly tone surely he would not drive his fathers widow hence  she smiled at the fire in a dreamy pensive manner  no said she he would not drive me hence he has offered me the shelter of condillac for as long as it may pleasure me to make it my home  excellent he exclaimed rubbing his little fat hands and screwing the little features of his huge red face into the grotesque semblance of a smile what need to talk of going then  what need she echoed in a voice dull and concentrated do you ask that tressan do you think i should elect to live upon the charity of this man  for all that the lord seneschal may have been dullwitted yet he had wit enough to penetrate to the very marrow of her meaning  you must hate florimond very bitterly said he she shrugged her shoulders  i possess i think the faculty of feeling strongly i can love well monsieur and i can hate well it is one or the other with me and as cordially as i love my own son marius as cordially do i detest this coxcomb florimond  she expressed no reasons for her hatred of her late husbands elder son hers were not reasons that could easily be put into words they were little reasons trivial grains of offence which through long years had accumulated into a mountain they had their beginning in the foolish grievance that had its birth with her own son when she had realized that but for that rosycheeked wellgrown boy borne to the marquis by his first wife marius would have been heir to condillac her love of her own child and her ambitions for him her keen desire to see him fill an exalted position in the world caused her a thousand times a day to wish his halfbrother dead yet florimond had flourished and grown and as he grew he manifested a character which with all its imperfections was more lovable than the nature of her own offspring and their common father had never seen aught but the faults of marius and the virtues of florimond she had resented this and marius had resented it and marius having inherited with his mothers beauty his mothers arrogant dominant spirit had returned with insolence such admonitions as from time to time his father gave him and thus the breach had grown later since he could not be heir to condillac the marquises eyes greedy of advancement for him had fallen covetously upon the richer la vauvraye whose lord had then no son whose heiress was a little girl  by an alliance easy to compass since the lords of condillac and la vauvraye were lifelong friends mariuss fortunes might handsomely have been mended yet when she herself bore the suggestion of it to the marquis he had seized upon it approved it but adopted it for florimonds benefit instead  thereafter war had raged fiercely in the family of condillaca war between the marquis and florimond on the one side and the marquise and marius on the other and so bitterly was it waged that it was by the old marquiss suggestion that at last florimond had gone upon his travels to see the world and carry arms in foreign service  her hopes that he would take his death as was a common thing when warring rose highso high as to become almost assurance a thing to be reckoned with florimond would return no more and her son should fill the place to which he was entitled by his beauty of person and the high mental gifts his doting mother saw in him  yet the months grew into years and at long intervals full of hope for the marquise news came of florimond and the news was ever that he was well and thriving gathering honours and drinking deep of life  and now at last when matters seemed to have been tumbled into her lap that she might dispose of them as she listed now when in her anxiety to see her son supplant his stepbrother in the possession of la vauvrayeif not perhaps in that of condillac as well she had done a rashness which might end in making her and marius outlaws news came that this hated florimond was at the door tardily returned yet returned in time to overthrow her schemes and to make her son the pauper that her husbands will had seemed to aim at rendering him  her mind skimmed lightly over all these matters seeking somewhere some wrong that should stand out stark and glaring upon which she might seize and offer it to the seneschal as an explanation of her hatred but nowhere could she find the thing she sought her hatred had for foundation a material too impalpable to be fashioned into words tressans voice aroused her from her thoughts  have you laid no plans madame he asked her it were surely a madness now to attempt to withstand the marquis  the marquis ah yesflorimond she sat forward out of the shadows in which her great chair enveloped her and let candle and firelight play about the matchless beauty of her perfect face there was a flush upon it the flush of battle and she was about to tell the seneschal that not while one stone of condillac should stand upon another not while a gasp of breath remained in her frail body would she surrender but she checked her rashness well might it be that in the end she should abandon such a purpose tressan was ugly as a toad the most absurd ridiculous bridegroom that ever led woman to the altar yet rumour ran that he was rich and as a last resource for the sake of his possessions she might bring herself to endure his signal shortcomings  i have taken no resolve as yet said she in a wistful voice i founded hopes upon marius which marius threatens to frustrate i think i had best resign myself to the poverty of my touraine home  and then the seneschal realized that the time was now the opportunity he might have sought in vain was almost thrust upon him in the spirit he blessed florimond for returning so opportunely in the flesh he rose from the chair and without more ado he cast himself upon his knees before the dowager he cast himself down and the dowager experienced a faint stirring of surprise that she heard no flop such as must attend the violent falling of so fat a body but the next instant realizing the purpose of his absurd posture she shrank back with a faint gasp and her face was mercifully blurred to his sight once more amid the shadows of her chair thus was he spared the look of utter loathing of unconquerable irrepressible disgust that leapt into her countenance  his voice quivered with ridiculous emotion his little fat red fingers trembled as he outheld them in a theatrical gesture of supplication  never contemplate poverty madame until you have discarded me he implored her say but that you will and you shall be lady of tressan all that i have would prove but poor adornment to a beauty such as yours and i should shrink from offering it you were it not that with it all i can offer you the fondest heart in france marquiseclotilde i cast myself humbly at your feet do with me as you will i love you  by an effort she crushed down her loathing of hima loathing that grew a hundredfold as she beheld him now transformed by his amorousness into the semblance almost of a satyrand listened to his foolish rantings  as marquise de condillac it hurt her pride to listen and not have him whipped for his audacity as a woman it insulted her yet the marquise and the woman she alike repressed she would give him no answershe could not so near was she to fainting with disdain of himyet must she give him hope against the time when should all else fail she might have to swallow the bitter draught he was now holding to her lips so she temporized  she controlled her voice into a tone of gentle sadness she set a mask of sorrow upon her insolent face  monsieur monsieur she sighed and so far overcame her nausea as for an instant to touch his hand in a little gesture of caress you must not speak so to a widow of six months nor must i listen  the quivering grew in his hands and voice but no longer did they shake through fear of a rebuff they trembled now in the eager strength of the hope he gathered from her words she was so beautiful so peerless so noble so proudand he so utterly unworthythat naught but her plight had given him courage to utter his proposal and she answered him in such terms  you give me hope marquise if i come again  she sighed and her face which was once more within the light showed a look of sad inquiry  if i thought that what you have said you have said out of pity because you fear lest my necessities should hurt me i could give you no hope at all i have my pride mon ami but if what you have said you would still have said though i had continued mistress of condillac then tressan you may repeat it to me hereafter at a season when i may listen  his joy welled up and overflowed in him as overflows a river in time of spate  he bent forward caught her hand and bore it to his lips  clotilde he cried in a smothered voice then the door opened and marius stepped into the long chamber  at the creaking sound of the opening door the seneschal bestirred himself to rise even the very young care not so to be surprised how much less then a man well past the prime of life he came up laboriouslythe more laboriously by virtue of his very efforts to show himself still nimble in his mistresss eyes upon the intruder he turned a crimson furious face perspiration gleaming like varnish on brow and nose at sight of marius who stood arrested scowling villainously upon the pair the fire died suddenly from his glance  ah my dear marius said he with a flourish and an air of being mightily at his ease but the young mans eyes went over and beyond him to rest in a look of scrutiny upon his mother she had risen too and he had been in time to see the startled manner of her rising in her cheeks there was a guilty flush but her eyes boldly met and threw back her sons regard  marius came slowly down the room and no word was spoken the seneschal cleared his throat with noisy nervousness madame stood hand on hip the flush fading slowly her glance resuming its habitual lazy insolence by the fire marius paused and kicked the logs into a blaze regardless of the delicate fabric of his rosetted shoes  monsieur le seneschal said madame calmly came to see us in the matter of the courier  ah said marius with an insolent lifting of his brows and a sidelong look at tressan and tressan registered in his heart a vow that when he should have come to wed the mother he would not forget to take payment for that glance from her pert son  monsieur le comte will remain and sup with us before riding back to grenoble she added  ah said he again in the same tone and that for the moment was all he said he remained by the fire standing between them where he had planted himself in the flesh as if to symbolize the attitude he intended in the spirit  but one chance he had before supper was laid of a word alone with his mother in her own closet  madame he said his sternness mingling with alarm are you mad that you encourage the suit of this hedgehog tressan  she looked him up and down with a deliberate eye her lip curling a little  surely marius it is my own concern  not so he answered her and his grasp fastened almost viciously on her wrist i think that it is mine as well mother bethink you and his tone changed to an imploring key bethink you what you would do would youyoumate with such a thing as that  his emphasis of the pronoun was very eloquent not in all the words of the french language could he have told her better how high he placed her in his thoughts how utterly she must fall how unutterably be soiled by an alliance with tressan  i had hoped you would have saved me from it marius she answered him her eyes seeming to gaze down into the depths of his at la vauvraye i had hoped to live out my widowhood in tranquil dignity but she let her arms fall sharply to her sides and uttered a little sneering laugh  but mother he cried between the dignity of la vauvraye and the indignity of tressan surely there is some middle course  aye she answered scornfully starvation on a dunghill in touraineor something near akin to it for which i have no stomach  he released her wrist and stood with bent head clenching and unclenching his long white hands and she watched him watching in him the working of his proud and stubborn spirit  mother he cried at last and the word sounded absurd between them by so little did he seem the younger of the twain mother you shall not do it you must not  you leave me little alternativealas sighed she had you been more adroit you had been wed by now marius and the future would give us no concern as it is florimond comes home and we she spread her hands and thrust out her nether lip in a grimace that was almost ugly then come she said briskly supper is laid and my lord seneschal will be awaiting us  and before he could reply she had swept past him and taken her way below he followed gloomily and in gloom sat he at table never heeding the reckless gaiety of the seneschal and the forced mirth of the marquise he well understood the sort of tacit bargain that his mother had made with him she had seen her advantage in his loathing of the proposed union with tressan and she had used it to the full either he must compel valerie to wed him this side of saturday or resign himself to see his motherhis beautiful peerless mothermarried to this skin of lard that called itself a man  living he had never entertained for his father a sons respect nor dead did he now reverence his memory as becomes a son but in that hour as he sat at table facing this gross wooer of his mothers his eyes were raised to the portrait of the floridvisaged haughty marquis de condillac where it looked down upon them from the panelled wall and from his soul he offered up to that portrait of his dead sire an apology for the successor whom his widow destined him  he ate little but drank great draughts as men will when their mood is sullen and dejected and the heat of the wine warming his veins and lifting from him some of the gloom that had settled over him lent him anon a certain recklessness very different from the manner of his sober moments  chancing suddenly to raise his eyes from the cup into which he had been gazing absorbed as gazes a seer into his crystal he caught on the seneschals lips so odious a smile in the mans eyes so greedy hateful a leer as he bent them on the marquise that he had much ado not to alter the expression of that flabby face by hurling at it the cup he held  he curbed himself he smiled sardonically upon the pair and in that moment he swore that be the cost what it might he would frustrate the union of those two his thoughts flew to valerie and the road they took was fouled with the mud of ugly deeds a despair grim at first then mocking took possession of him he loved valerie to distraction loved her for herself apart from all worldly advantages that must accrue to him from an alliance with her his mother saw in that projected marriage no more than the acquisition of the lands of la vauvraye and she may even have thought that he himself saw no more in that she was wrong but because of it she may have been justified of her impatience with him at the tardiness the very clumsiness with which he urged his suit how was she to know that it was just the sincerity of his passion made him clumsy for like many another normally glib selfassured and graceful marius grew halting shy and clumsy only where he loved  but in the despair that took him now the quality of his passion seemed to change partly it was the wine partly the sight of this other loverof whom there must be an endwhose very glance seemed to him an insult to his mother his imagination had taken fire that night and it had ripened him for any villainy the seneschal and the wine between them had opened the floodgates of all that was evil in his nature and that evil thundered out in a great torrent that bid fair to sweep all before it  and suddenly unexpectedly for the others who were by now resigned to his moody silence the evil found expression the marquise had spoken of somethingsomething of slight importancethat must be done before florimond returned abruptly marius swung round in his seat to face his mother must this florimond return he asked and for all that he uttered no more words so ample in their expression were those four that he had uttered and the tone of them that his meaning left little work to the imagination  madame turned to stare at him surprise ineffable in her glancenot at the thing that he suggested but at the abruptness with which the suggestion came the cynical sneering tone rang in her ears after the words were spoken and she looked in his face for a confirmation of their full purport  she observed the wineflush on his cheek the wineglitter in his eye and she remarked the slight smile on his lips and the cynical assumption of nonchalance with which he fingered the jewel in his ear as he returned her gaze she beheld now in her son a man more purposeful than she had ever known before  a tense silence had followed his words and the lord seneschal gaped at him some of the colour fading from his plethoric countenance suspecting as he did the true drift of mariuss suggestion at last it was madame who spokevery softly with a narrowing of the eyes  call fortunio was all she said but marius understood full well the purpose for which she would have fortunio called  with a halfsmile he rose and going to the door he bade his page who was idling in the anteroom go summon the captain then he paced slowly back not to the place he had lately occupied at table but to the hearth where he took his stand with his shoulders squared to the overmantel  fortunio came fairhaired and freshcomplexioned as a babe his supple not ungraceful figure tawdrily clad in showy clothes of poor material the worse for hard usage and spilt wine the countess bade him sit and with her own hands she poured a cup of anjou for him  in some wonder and for all his ordinary selfpossession with a little awkwardness the captain did her bidding and with an apologetic air he took the seat she offered him  he drank this wine and here was a spell of silence till marius grown impatient brutally put the thing for which the marquise sought delicate words  we have sent for you fortunio said he in a blustering tone to inquire of you what price youd ask to cut the throat of my brother the marquis de condillac  the seneschal sank back in his chair with a gasp the captain a frown between his frankseeming wideset eyes started round to look at the boy the business was by no means too strong for the rufflers stomach but the words in which it was conveyed to him most emphatically were  monsieur de condillac said he with an odd assumption of dignity i think you have mistaken your man i am a soldier not a cutthroat  but yes the marquise soothed him throwing herself instantly into the breach and laying a long slender hand upon the frayed green velvet of the captains sleeve what my son means and what he says are vastly different things  it will sorely tax your wits madame laughed marius brutally to make clear that difference  and then the seneschal nervously cleared his throat and muttering that it waxed late and he must be riding home made shift to rise him too the marquise at once subdued she was not minded that he should go just yet it might be useful to her hereafter to have had him present at this conference into which she meant to draw him until she should have made him one with them a party to their guilt for the task she needed not over many words just one or two and a melting glance or so and the rebellion in his bosom was quelled at once  but with the captain her wiles were not so readily successful he had no hopes of winning her to wifehaply no desire since he was not a man of very great ambitions on the other hand he had against him the very worst record in france and for all that he might embark upon this business under the auspices of the lord seneschal himself he knew not how far the lord seneschal might dare to go thereafter to save him from a hanging should it come to that  he said as much in words in a business of this kind he knew from experience the more difficulties he advanced the better a bargain he drove in the end and if he was to be persuaded to risk his neck in this he should want good payment but even for good payment on this occasion he was none too sure as yet that he would let himself be persuaded  monsieur fortunio the marquise said very softly heed not monsieur mariuss words attend to me the marquis de condillac as no doubt you will have learned for yourself is lying at la rochette now it happens that he is noxious to uslet the reasons be what they may we need a friend to put him out of our way will you be that friend  you will observe sneered marius how wide a difference there is between what the marquise suggests and my own frank question of what price you would take to cut my brothers throat  i observe no difference which is what you would say fortunio answered truculently his head well back his brown eyes resentful of offencefor none can be so resentful of imputed villainy as your villain who is thoroughpaced and he concluded i return you the same answer madamethat i am no cutthroat  she repressed her anger at mariuss sneering interference and made a little gesture of dismay with her eloquent white hands  but we do not ask you to cut a throat  i have heard amiss then said he his insolence abating nothing  you have heard aright but you have understood amiss there are other ways of doing these things if it were but the cutting of a throat should we have sent for you there are a dozen in the garrison would have sufficed for our purpose  what is it then you need quoth he  we want an affair contrived with all decency the marquis is at the sanglier noir at la rochette you can have no difficulty in finding him and having found him less difficulty still in giving or provoking insult  excellent murmured marius from the background it is such an enterprise as should please a ready swordsman of your calibre fortunio  a duel quoth the fellow and his insolence went out of him thrust out by sheer dismay his mouth fell open a duel was another affair altogether but sangdieu what if he should slay me have you thought of that  slay you cried the marquise her eyes resting on his face with an expression as of wonder at such a question you jest fortunio  and he with the fever put in marius sneering  ah muttered fortunio he has the fever the fever is something butbutaccidents will happen  florimond was ever an indifferent swordsman murmured marius dreamily as if communing with himself  the captain wheeled upon him once more  why then monsieur marius said he since that is so and you are skilledas skilled as am i or moreand he has a fever where is the need to hire me to the task  where echoed marius what affair may that be of yours we ask you to name a price on which you will do this thing have done with counterquestions  marius was skilled with the foils as fortunio said but he cared not for unbaited steel and he was conscious of it so that the captains halfsneer had touched him on the raw but he was foolish to take that tone in answer there was a truculent southern pride in the ruffler which sprang immediately into life and which naught that they could say thereafter would stamp out  must i say again that you mistake your man was his retort and as he spoke he rose as though to signify that the subject wearied him and that his remaining to pursue it must be idle i am not of those to whom you can say i need such an one killed name me the price at which youll be his butcher  the marquise wrung her hands in pretty mimicry of despair and poured out soothing words as one might pour oil upon stormy waters the seneschal sat in stolid silence a halfscared spectator of this odd scene what time the marquise talked and talked until she had brought fortunio back to some measure of subjection  such reasoning as she made use of she climaxed by an offer of no less a sum than a hundred pistoles the captain licked his lips and pulled at his mustachios for all his vaunted scorn of being a butcher at a price now that he heard the price he seemed not half so scornful  tell me again the thing that you need doing and the manner of it said he as one who was moved to reconsider she told him and when she had done he made a compromise  if i go upon this business madame i go not alone  oh as for that said marius it shall be as you will take what men you want with you  and hang with them afterwards maybe he sneered his insolence returning the hundred pistoles would avail me little then look you monsieur de condillac and you madame if i go ill need to take with me a better hostage than the whole garrison of this place ill need for shield some one who will see to it that he is not hurt himself just as i shall see to it that he is hurt before i am  what do you mean speak out fortunio the marquise bade him  i mean madame that i will go not to do this thing but to stand by and render help if help be needed let monsieur de condillac go and i will go with him and i will undertake to see to it that he returns unhurt and that we leave the other stark  both started and the seneschal leaned heavily upon the table he was not with all his faults a man of blood and this talk of butchery turned him sick and faint  vainly now did the marquise seek to alter the captains resolution but in this she received a sudden check from marius himself he cut in upon her arguments to ask the captain  how can you promise so much do you mean that you and i must fall upon him you forget that he will have men about him a duel is one thing a roughandtumble another and we shall fare none so well in this im thinking  the captain closed one eye and a leer of subtle cunning overspread his face  ive thought of that said he neither a duel nor a roughandtumble do i propose but something between the two something that shall seem a duel yet be a roughandtumble  explain yourself  what further explanation does it ask we come upon monsieur le marquis where his men are not we penetrate let us say into his chamber i turn the key in the door we are alone with him and you provoke him he is angry and must fight you there and then i am your friend i must fill the office of second for both sides you engage and i stand aside and let you fight it out you say he is indifferently skilled with the sword and in addition that he has a fever thus you should contrive to put your steel through him and a duel it will have been but if by luck or skill he should have you in danger i shall be at hand to flick in my sword at the right moment and make an opening through which you may send yours home  believe me it were better began the dowager but marius who of a sudden was much taken with the notion again broke in  are you to be depended upon to make no mistake fortunio  per bacco swore the ruffler a mistake must cost me a hundred pistoles i think you may depend upon me there if i err at all it will be on the side of eagerness to see you make short work of him you have my answer now monsieur if we talk all night you shall not move me further but if my proposal suits you i am your man  and i yours fortunio answered marius and there was a ring almost of exultation in his voice  the dowager looked from one to the other as if she were weighing the men and satisfying herself that marius ran no risk she put a question or two to her son another to the captain then seeming satisfied with what had been agreed she nodded her head and told them they had best be stirring with the dawn  you will have light enough by halfpast six do not delay later in taking the road and see that you are back here by nightfall i shall be anxious till you are returned  she poured wine again for the captain and marius coming up to the table filled himself a glass which he tossed off the marquise was speaking to tressan  will you not drink to the success of the venture she asked him in a coaxing tone her eyes upon his own i think we are like to see the end of our troubles now monsieur and marius shall be lord both of condillac and la vauvraye  and the gross foolish seneschal under the spell of her magnificent eyes slowly raised his cup to his lips and drank to the success of that murderous business marius stood still a frown between his eyes haled thither by the mention of la vauvraye he might be winning it as his mother said but he would have preferred to have won it differently then the frown was smoothed away a sardonic smile replaced it another cup of wine he poured himself then without word to any there he turned on his heel and went from the room a trifle unsteady in his gait yet with such lines of purposefulness in the way he bore himself that the three of them stared after him in dull surprise     chapter xvi the unexpected   in her apartments in the northern tower valerie had supped andto spare monsieur de garnache the full indignity of that part of the offices he was charged withshe had herself removed the cloth and set the things in the guardroom where they might lie till morning when that was doneand despite her protests garnache had insisted upon lending a hand the parisian reminded her that it was already after nine and urged her to make such preparations as incumbed her for their journey  my preparations are soon made she assured him with a smile i need but what i may carry in a cloak  they fell to talking of their impending flight and they laughed together at the discomfiture that would be the dowagers and her sons when in the morning they came to discover the empty cage from that they passed on to talk of valerie herself of her earlier life at la vauvraye and later the conversation shifted to garnache and she questioned him touching the warring he had seen in early youth and afterwards asked him for particulars of paristhat wonderful city which to her mind was the only earthly parallel of paradiseand of the life at court  thus in intimate talk did they while away the time of waiting and in the hour that sped they came perhaps to know more of each other than they had done hitherto intimate indeed had they unconsciously become already their singular position locked together in that towera position utterly impossible under any but the conditions that attended ithad conduced to that goodfellowship whilst the girls trust and dependence upon the man the mans observance of that trust and his determination to show her that it had not been misplaced had done the rest  but tonight they seemed to have drawn nearer in spirit to each other and that maybe it was that prompted valerie to sigh and in her sweet unthinking innocence to say again  i am truly sorry monsieur de garnache that our sojourn here is coming to an end  he was no coxcomb and he set no false value on the words he laughed for answer as he rejoined  not so am i mademoiselle nor shall i know peace of mind again until this illomened chateau is a good three leagues or so behind us sh what was that  he came instantly to his feet his face intent and serious he had been sitting at his ease in an armchair over the back of which he had tossed the baldric from which his sword depended the clang of the heavy door below striking the wall as it was pushed open had reached his ears  can it be time already asked mademoiselle yet a panic took her and she blenched a little  he shook his head  impossible said he it is not more than ten oclock unless that fool arsenio has blundered he stopped sh he whispered some one is coming here  and suddenly he realized the peril that might lie in being found thus in her company it alarmed him more than did the visit itself so unusual at this hour he saw that he had not time to reach the guardroom he would be caught in the act of coming forth and that might be interpreted by the dowager or her sonif it should happen to be one or the other of themas a hurried act of flight such as guilt might prompt perhaps he exaggerated the risk but their fortunes at condillac had reached a point where they must not be jeopardized by any chance however slight  to your chamber mademoiselle he whispered fearfully and he pointed to the door of the inner room lock yourself in quick sh and he signed frantically to her to go silently  swift and quietly as a mouse she glided from the room and softly closed the door of her chamber and turned the key in a lock which garnache had had the foresight to keep well oiled he breathed more freely when it was done  a step sounded in the guardroom he sank without a rustle into the chair from which he had risen rested his head against the back of it closed his eyes opened his mouth and dissembled sleep  the steps came swiftly across the guardroom floor soft as of one lightly shod and garnache wondered was it the mother or the son just as he wondered what this illcome visitor might be seeking  the door of the antechamber was pushed gently open it had stood ajarand under the lintel appeared the slender figure of marius still in his brown velvet suit as garnache last had seen him he paused a moment to peer into the chamber then he stepped forward frowning to behold battista so cosily ensconced  ola there he cried and kicked the sentrys outstretched legs the more speedily to wake him is this the watch you keep  garnache opened his eyes and stared a second dully at the disturber of his feigned slumbers then as if being more fully awakened he recognized his master he heaved himself suddenly to his feet and bowed  is this the watch you keep quoth marius again and garnache scanning the youths face with foolishly smiling eyes noted the flush on his cheek the odd glitter in his handsome eyes and even caught a whiff of wine upon his breath alarm grew in garnaches mind but his face maintained its foolish vacancy its inane smile he bowed again and with a wave of the hands towards the inner chamber  la damigella a la said he  for all that marius had no italian he understood the drift of the words assisted as they were by the mans expressive gesture he sneered cruelly  it would be an ugly thing for you my ugly friend if she were not he answered away with you i shall call you when i need you and he pointed to the door  garnache experienced some dismay some fear even he plied his wits and he determined that he had best seem to apprehend from his gestures mariuss meaning but apprehend it in part only and go no further than the other side of that door  he bowed therefore for the third time and with another of his foolish grins he shuffled out of the chamber pulling the door after him so that marius should not see how near at hand he stayed  marius without further heeding him stepped to mademoiselles door and rapped on a panel with brisk knuckles  who is there she inquired from within  it is imarius open i have something i must say to you  will it not keep till morning  i shall be gone by then he answered impatiently and much depends upon my seeing you ere i go so open come  there followed a pause and garnache in the outer room set his teeth and prayed she might not anger marius he must be handled skillfully lest their flight should be frustrated at the last moment he prayed too that there might be no need for his intervention that would indeed be the end of alla shipwreck within sight of harbour he promised himself that he would not lightly intervene for the rest this news of mariuss intended departure filled him with a desire to know something of the journey on which he was bound  slowly mademoiselles door opened white and timid she appeared  what do you want marius  now and always and above all things the sight of you valerie said he and the flushed cheek the glittering eye and wineladen breath were as plain to her as they had been to garnache and they filled her with a deeper terror nevertheless she came forth at his bidding  i see that you were not yet abed said he it is as well we must have a talk he set a chair for her and begged her to be seated then he perched himself on the table his hands gripping the edges of it on either side of him and he turned his eyes upon her  valerie he said slowly the marquis de condillac my brother is at la rochette  he is coming home she cried clasping her hands and feigning surprise in word and glance  marius shook his head and smiled grimly  no said he he is not coming home that isnot unless you wish it  not unless i wish it but naturally i wish it  then valerie if you would have what you wish so must i if florimond is ever to come to condillac again you must be my wife  he leaned towards her now supported by his elbow so that his face was close to hers a deeper flush upon it a brighter glitter in his black eyes his vinous breath enveloping and suffocating her she shrank back her hands locking themselves one in the other till the knuckles showed white  whatwhat is it you mean she faltered  no more than i have said no less if you love him well enough to sacrifice yourself and his lips curled sardonically at the word then marry me and save him from his doom  what doom her voice came mechanically her lips seeming scarce to move  he swung down from the table and stood before her  i will tell you he said in a voice very full of promise i love you valerie above all else on earth or i think in heaven and ill not yield you to him say no to me now and at daybreak i start for la rochette to win you from him at point of sword  despite her fears she could not repress a little smile of scorn  is that all said she why if you are so rash it is yourself assuredly will be slain  he smiled tranquilly at that reflection upon his courage and his skill  so might it befall if i went alone said he she understood her eyes dilated with horror with loathing of him the angry words that sprang to her lips were not to be denied  you cur you cowardly assassin she blazed at him i might have guessed that in some such cutthroat manner would your vaunt of winning me at the swordpoint be accomplished  she watched the colour fade from his cheeks and the ugly livid hue that spread in its room to his very lips yet it did not daunt her she was on her feet confronting him ere he had time to speak again her eyes flashed and her arm pointed quivering to the door  go she bade him her voice harsh for once out of my sight go do your worst so that you leave me ill hold no traffic with you  will you not said he through setting teeth and suddenly he caught the wrist of that outstretched arm but she saw nothing of immediate danger the only danger that she knew was the danger that threatened florimond and little did that matter since at midnight she was to leave condillac to reach la rochette in time to warn her betrothed the knowledge gave her confidence and an added courage  you have offered me your bargain she told him you have named your price and you have heard my refusal now go  not yet awhile said he in a voice so odiously sweet that garnache caught his breath  he drew her towards him despite her wild struggles he held her fast against his breast do what she would he rained his hot kisses on her face and hair till at last freeing a hand she smote him with all her might across the face  he let her go then he fell back with an oath a patch of fingermarks showing red on his white countenance  that blow has killed florimond de condillac he told her viciously he dies at noon tomorrow ponder it my pretty  i care not what you do so that you leave me she answered defiantly restraining by a brave effort the tears of angry distress that welled up from her stricken heart and no less stricken no less angry was garnache where he listened it was by an effort that he had restrained himself from bursting in upon them when marius had seized her the reflection that were he to do so all would irretrievably be ruined alone had stayed him  marius eyed the girl a moment his face distorted by the rage that was in him  by god he swore if i cannot have your love ill give you cause enough to hate me  already have you done that most thoroughly said she and garnache cursed this pertness of hers which was serving to dare him on  the next moment there broke from her a startled cry marius had seized her again and was crushing her frail body in his arms  i shall kiss your lips before i go ma mie said he his voice thick now with a passion that was not all of anger and then while he still struggled to have his way with her a pair of arms took him about the waist like hoops of steel  in his surprise he let her free and in that moment he was swung back and round and cast a good six paces down the room  he came to a standstill by the table at which he clutched to save himself from falling and turned bewildered furious eyes upon battista by whom he now dimly realized that he had been assailed  garnaches senses had all left him in that moment when valerie had cried out he cast discretion to the winds reason went out of him and only blind anger remained to drive him into immediate action and as suddenly as that flood of rage had leaped as suddenly did it ebb now that he found himself face to face with the outraged condillac and began to understand the magnitude of the folly he had committed  everything was lost now utterly and irretrievablylost as a dozen other fine emprises had been by his sudden and ungoverned frenzy god what a fool he was what a cursed drivelling fool what after all was a kiss or two compared with all the evil that might now result from his interference haply marius would have taken them and departed and at midnight they would have been free to go from condillac  the future would not have been lacking in opportunities to seek out and kill marius for that insult  why could he not have left the matter to the future but now with florimond to be murdered on the morrow at la rochette himself likely to be murdered within the hour at condillac valerie was at their mercy utterly  wildly and vainly did he strive even then to cover up the foolish thing that he had done he bowed apologetically to marius he waved his hands and filled the air with italian phrases frenziedly uttered as if by the very vigour of them he sought to drive explanation into his masters brain marius watched and listened but his rage nowise abated it grew instead as if that farrago of a language he did not understand were but an added insult an oath was all he uttered then he swung round and caught garnaches sword from the chair beside him where it still rested and garnache in that moment cursed the oversight whipping the long keen blade from its sheath marius bore down upon the rash meddler  par dieu he swore between his teeth well see the colour of your dirty blood you that lay hands upon a gentleman  but before he could send home the weapon before garnache could move to defend himself valerie had slipped between them marius looked into her white determined face and was smitten with surprise what was this hind to her that she should interfere at the risk of taking the sword herself  then a slow smile spread upon his face he was smarting still under her disdain and resistance as well as under a certain sense of the discomfiture this fellow had put upon him he saw a way to hurt her to abase her pride and cut her to the very soul with shame  you are singularly concerned in this mans life said he an odious undercurrent of meaning in his voice  i would not have you murder him she answered for doing no more than madame your mother bade him  i make no doubt he has proved a very excellent guard he sneered  even now all might have been well with that insult marius might consider that he had taken payment for the discomfiture he had suffered he might have bethought him that perhaps as she said battista had done no more than observe the orders he had receiveda trifle excessively maybe yet faithfully nevertheless thinking thus he might even have been content to go his ways and take his fill of vengeance by slaying florimond upon the morrow but garnaches rash temper rising anew tore that last flimsy chance to shreds  the insult that mademoiselle might overlook might even not have fully understoodset him afire with indignation for her sake he forgot his role forgot even that he had no french  mademoiselle he cried and she gasped in her affright at this ruinous indiscretion i beg that you will stand aside his voice was low and threatening but his words were woefully distinct  par la mort dieu swore marius taken utterly aback what may your name beyou who hitherto have had no french  almost thrusting mademoiselle aside garnache stood out to face him the flush of hot anger showing through the dye on his cheeks  my name said he is martin marie rigobert de garnache and my business now to make an end of one at least of this obscene brood of condillac  and without more ado he caught up a chair and held it before him in readiness to receive the others onslaught  but marius hung back an instantat first in sheer surprise later in fear he had some knowledge of the fellows methods even the sword he wielded gave him little confidence opposed to garnache with a chair he must have help his eyes sought the door measuring the distance ere he could reach it garnache would cut him off there was nothing for it but to attempt to drive the parisian back and so with a sudden rush he advanced to the attack garnache fell back and raised his chair and in that instant mademoiselle once more intervened between them  stand aside mademoiselle cried garnache who now grown cool as was his way when once he was engaged saw clearly through the purpose formed by marius stand aside or we shall have him giving the alarm  he leapt clear of her to stop mariuss sudden rush for the door on the very threshold the young man was forced to turn and defend himself lest his brains be dashed out by that ponderous weapon garnache was handling with a rare facility but the mischief was done in that he had reached the threshold backing he defended himself and gained the anteroom garnache followed but the clumsy chair was defensive rather than offensive and mariuss sword meanwhile darted above it and below it forcing him to keep a certain distance  and now marius raised his voice and shouted with all the power of his lungs  to me to me fortunio abdon to me you dogs i am beset  from the courtyard below rose an echo of his words repeated in a shout by the sentinel who had overheard them and they caught the swift fall of the fellows feet as he ran for help furious picturing to himself how the alarm would spread like a conflagration through the chateau cursing his headstrong folly yet determined that marius at least should not escape him garnache put forth his energies to hinder him from gaining the door that opened on to the stairs from the doorway of the antechamber mademoiselle with a white face and terrified eyes watched the unequal combat and heard the shouts for help anon despair might whelm her at the thought of how they had lost their opportunity of escaping but for the present she had no thought save for the life of that brave man who was defending himself with an unwieldy chair  garnache leapt suddenly aside to take his opponent in the flank and thus turn him from his backward progress towards the outer door the manoeuvre succeeded and gradually always defending himself garnache circled farther round him until he was between marius and the threshold  and now there came a sound of running feet on the uneven stones of the courtyard light gleamed on the staircase and breathless voices were wafted up to the two men garnache bethought him that his last hour was assuredly at hand well if he must take his death he might as well take it here upon mariuss sword as upon anothers so he would risk it for the sake of leaving upon marius some token by which he might remember him he swung his chair aloft uncovering himself for a second the young mans sword darted in like a shaft of light nimbly garnache stepped aside to avoid it and moved nearer his opponent down crashed the chair and down went marius stunned and bleeding under its terrific blow the sword clattered from his hand and rolled with a pendulumlike movement to the feet of garnache  the parisian flung aside his chair and stooped to seize that very welcome blade he rose grasping the hilt and gathering confidence from the touch of that excellently balanced weapon and he swung round even as fortunio and two of his braves appeared in the doorway     chapter xvii how monsieur de garnache left condillac   never was there a man with a better stomach for a fight than martin de garnache nor did he stop to consider that here his appetite in that direction was likely to be indulged to a surfeit the sight of those three men opposing him swords drawn and fortunio armed in addition with a dagger drove from his mind every other thought every other consideration but that of the impending battle  he fell on guard to receive their onslaught his eyes alert his lips tight set his knees like springs of steel slightly flexed to support his wellpoised body  but they paused a moment in the extremity of their surprise and fortunio called to him in italian to know the meaning of this attitude of his as well as that of marius who lay huddled where he had fallen  garnache reckless now disdaining further subterfuge nor seeking to have recourse to subtleties that could avail him nothing retorted in french with the announcement of his true name at that perceiving that here was some deep treachery at work they hesitated no longer  led by fortunio they attacked him and the din they made in the next few minutes with their heavy breathing their frequent oaths their stamping and springing this way and that and ringing above all the clash and clatter of sword on sword filled the chamber and could be heard in the courtyard below  minutes sped yet they gained no advantage on this single man not one but a dozen swords did he appear to wield so rapid were his passes so ubiquitous his point had he but stood his ground there might have been a speedy end to him but he retreated slowly towards the door of the antechamber valerie still stood there watching with fearful eyes and bated breath that tremendous struggle which at any moment she expected to see terminate in the death of her only friend  in her way she was helping garnache though she little realized it the six tapers in the candlebranch she held aloft afforded the only light for that stormy scene and that light was in the eyes of garnaches assailants showing him their faces yet leaving his own in shadow  he fell back steadily towards that door he could not see it but there was not the need he knew that it was in a direct line with the one that opened upon the stairs and by the latter he steered his backward course his aim was to gain the antechamber although they guessed it not thinking that he did but retreat through inability to stand his ground his reasons were that here in this guardroom the best he could do would be to put his back to the wall where he might pick off one or two before they made an end of him the place was too bare to suit his urgent fearful need within the inner room there was furniture to spare with which he might contrive to hamper his opponents and give them such a lusty fight as would live in the memory of those who might survive it for as long as they should chance to live thereafter  he had no thought of perishing himself although to any less concerned his death sooner or later must seem inevitablethe only possible conclusion to this affray taken as he was his mind was concerned only with this fight his business to kill and not himself to be slain he knew that presently others would come to support these three already perhaps they were on their way and he husbanded his strength against their coming he was proudly conscious of his own superior skill for he had studied the art of fence in italyits homeduring his earlier years and there was no trick of swordplay with which he was not acquainted no ruse of service in a roughandtumble in which he was unversed he was proudly conscious too of his supple strength his endurance and his great length of reach and upon all these he counted to help him make a decent fight  valerie watching him guessed his purpose to be the gaining of the inner chamber the crossing of the threshold on which she was standing she drew back a pace or two almost mechanically to give him room the movement went near to costing him his life the light no longer falling so pitilessly upon fortunios eyes the captain saw more clearly than hitherto and shot a swift deadly stroke straight at the region of garnaches heart the parisian leapt back when it was within an inch of his breast one of the bravoes followed up springing a pace in advance of his companions and lengthening his arm in a powerful lunge garnache caught the blade almost on his hilt and by the slightest turn of the wrist made a simultaneous presentment of his point at the others outstretched throat it took the fellow just above the adams apple and with a horrid gurgling cry he sank stretched as he still was in the attitude of that murderous lunge that had proved fatal only to himself  garnache had come on guard again upon the instant yet in the briefest of seconds during which his sword had been about its work of death fortunios rapier came at him a second time he beat the blade aside with his bare left hand and stopped with his point the rush of the other bravo then he leapt back again and his leap brought him to the threshold of the anteroom he retreated quickly a pace and then another he was a swords length within the chamber and now he stood firm as a rock and engaged fortunios blade which had followed him through the doorway but he was more at his ease the doorway was narrow two men abreast could not beset him since one must cumber the movements of the other if they came at him one at a time he felt that he could continue that fight till morning should there still by then be any left to face him  a wild exultation took him an insane desire to laugh surely was swordplay the merriest game that was ever devised for mans entertainment he straightened his arm and his steel went out like a streak of lightning but for the dagger on which he caught its edge the blade had assuredly pierced the captains heart and now fighting still garnache called to valerie he had need of her assistance to make his preparations ere others came  set down your tapers mademoiselle he bade her on the mantel shelf at my back place the other candle branch there too  swiftly yet with halfswimming senses everything dim to her as to one in a nightmare she ran to do his bidding and now the light placed so at his back gave him over his opponents the same slight advantage that he had enjoyed before in brisk tones he issued his fresh orders  can you move the table mademoiselle he asked her try to drag it here to the wall on my left as close to the door as you can bring it  i will try monsieur she panted through dry lips and again she moved to do his bidding quickened by the need there was her limbs which awhile ago had seemed on the point of refusing their office appeared to gather more than ordinary strength she was unconsciously sobbing in her passionate anxiety to render him what help was possible frenziedly she caught at the heavy oaken table and began to drag it across the room as garnache had begged her and now fortunio seeing what was toward and guessing garnaches intentions sought by a rush to force his way into the chamber but garnache was ready for him there was a harsh grind of steel on steel culminating in a resounding lest and fortunio was back in the guardroom whither he had leapt to save his skin a pause fell at that and garnache lowered his point to rest his arm until they should again come at him from beyond the doorway the captain called upon him to yield he took the summons as an insult and flew into a momentary passion  yield he roared yield to you you cutthroat scum you shall have my sword if you will come for it but you shall have it in your throat  angered in his turn fortunio inclined his head to his companions ear issuing an order in obedience to it it was the bravo now who advanced and engaged garnache suddenly he dropped on to his knees and over his head garnache found his blade suddenly opposed by fortunios it was a clever trick and it all but did garnaches business then yet together with the surprise of it there came to him the understanding of what was intended under his guard the kneeling mans sword was to be thrust up into his vitals as a cry of alarm broke from mademoiselle he leapt aside and towards the wall where he was covered from fortunios weapon and turning suddenly he passed his sword from side to side through the body of the kneeling mercenary  the whole thing he had performed mechanically more by instinct than by reason and when it was done and the tables were thus effectively turned upon his assailants he scarcely realized how he had accomplished it  the mans body cumbered now the doorway and behind him fortunio stood never daring to advance lest a thrust of that sword which he could not seegarnache still standing close against the wallshould serve him likewise  garnache leaned there in that friendly shelter to breathe and he smiled grimly under cover of his mustache so long as he had to deal with a single assailant he saw no need to move from so excellent a position close beside him leaning heavily against the table she had dragged thus far stood valerie her face livid as death her heart sick within her at the horror inspired her by that thing lying on the threshold she could not take her eyes from the crimson stain that spread slowly on the floor coming from under that limply huddled mass of arms and legs  do not look mademoiselle garnache implored her softly be brave child try to be brave  she sought to brace her flagging courage and by an effort she averted her eyes from that horrid heap and fixed them upon garnaches calm intrepid face the sight of his quietly watchful eyes his grimly smiling lips seemed to infuse courage into her anew  i have the table monsieur she told him i can bring it no nearer to the wall  he understood that this was not because her courage or her strength might be exhausted but because he now occupied the spot where he had bidden her place it he motioned her away and when she had moved he darted suddenly and swiftly aside and caught the table his sword still fast in his two first fingers which he had locked over the quillons he had pushed its massive weight halfway across the door before fortunio grasped the situation instantly the captain sought to take advantage of it thinking to catch garnache unawares but no sooner did he show his nose inside the doorpost than garnaches sword flashed before his eyes driving him back with a bloody furrow in his cheek  have a care monsieur le capitaine garnache mocked him had you come an inch farther it might have been the death of you  a clatter of steps sounded upon the stairs and the parisian bent once more to his task and thrust the table across the open doorway he had a moments respite now for fortunio stungthough lightly was not likely to come again until he had others to support him and while the others came while the hum of their voices rose higher and finally their steps clattered over the bare boards of the guardroom floor garnache had caught up and flung a chair under the table to protect him from an attack from below while he had piled another on top to increase and further strengthen the barricade  valerie watched him agonizedly leaning now against the wall her hands pressed across her bosom as if to keep down its tempestuous heaving yet her anguish was tempered by a great wonder and a great admiration of this man who could keep such calm eyes and such smiling lips in the face of the dreadful odds by which he was beset in the face of the certain death that must ultimately reach him before he was many minutes older and in her imagination she conjured up a picture of him lying there torn by their angry swords and drenched in blood his life gone out of him his brave spirit quenched for everand all for her unworthy sake because she little worthless thing that she waswould not marry as they listed this fine chivalrous soul was to be driven from its stalwart body  an agony of grief took her now and she fell once more to those awful sobs that awhile ago had shaken her she had refused to marry marius that florimonds life should be spared knowing that before marius could reach him she herself would have warned her betrothed yet even had that circumstance not existed she was sure that still she would have refused to do the will of marius but equally sure was she that she would not so refuse him were he now to offer as the price of her compliance the life of garnache which she accounted irrevocably doomed  suddenly his steady soothing voice penetrated her anguished musings  calm yourself mademoiselle all is far from lost as yet  she thought that he but spoke so to comfort her she did not follow the working of his warlike mind concentrated entirely upon the business of the moment with little thoughtor care for that matterfor what might betide anon yet she made an effort to repress her sobs she would be brave if only to show herself worthy of the companionship and friendship of so brave a man  across his barricade he peered into the outer room to ascertain with what fresh opponents he might have to reckon and he was surprised to see but four men standing by fortunio whilst behind them among the thicker shadows he dimly made out a womans figure and beside her another man who was short and squat  he bethought him that the hour and the circumstance that most of the mercenaries would be in their beds accounted for the reinforcement not being greater  the woman moved forward and he saw as he had suspected that it was the dowager herself the squat figure beside her moving with her into the shaft of light that fell from the doorway garnache defended revealed to him the features of monsieur de tressan if any doubt he had still entertained concerning the seneschals loyalty that doubt was now dispelled  and now the dowager uttered a sudden cry of fear she had caught sight of the fallen marius and she hurried to his side tressan sped after her and between them they raised the boy and helped him to a chair where he now sat passing a heavy hand across his no doubt aching brow clearly he was recovering from which garnache opined with regret that his blow had been too light the dowager turned to fortunio who had approached her and her eyes seemed to take fire at something that he told her  garnache the parisian heard her say and he saw fortunio jerk his thumb in the direction of the barricade  she appeared to forget her son she stepped suddenly from his side and peered through the doorway at the stalwart figure of garnache dimly to be seen through the pile of furniture that protected him to the height of his breast no word said she to the parisian she stood regarding him a moment with lips compressed and a white startled angry face then  it was by mariuss contrivance that he was placed sentry over the girl he heard her tell fortunio and he thought she sneered  she looked at the two bodies on the floor one almost at her feet the other just inside the doorway now almost hidden in the shadows of the table then she issued her commands to the men and fiercely she bade them pull down that barricade and take the dog alive  but before they could move to do her bidding garnaches voice rang imperatively through the chamber  a word with you ere they begin monsieur de tressan he shouted and such was the note of command he assumed that the men stood arrested looking to the dowager for fresh orders tressan changed colour for all that there was surely naught to fear and he fingered his beard perplexedly looking to the marquise for direction she flashed him a glance lifted one shoulder disdainfully and to the men  fetch him out said she and she pointed to garnache but again garnache stayed them  monsieur de tressan he called impressively to your dying dayand that will be none so distantshall you regret it if you do not hear me  the seneschal was stirred by those words and the halfthreat halfwarning they seemed to cover he paused a moment and this time his eyes avoided the marquises at last taking a step forward  knave said he i do not know you  you know me well enough you have heard my name i am martin marie rigobert de garnache her majestys emissary into dauphiny to procure the enlargement of mademoiselle de la vauvraye from the chateau de condillac where she is detained by force and for the serving of unscrupulous ends now you know me and my quality  the dowager stamped her foot  fetch him out she commanded harshly  hear me first monsieur le seneschal or it will be the worse for you and the seneschal moved by that confident promise of evil threw himself before the menatarms  a moment i beseech you marquise he cried and the men seeing his earnestness and knowing his quality stood undecided buffeted as they were between his will and the marquises what have you to say to me tressan demanded seeking to render arrogant his tone  this that my servant knows where i am and that should i fail within a very few days to come forth safe and sound from condillac to rejoin him he is to ride to paris with certain letters i have given him those letters incriminate you to the full in this infamous matter here at condillac i have set forth in them how you refused me help how you ignored the queens commands of which i was the bearer and should it be proved in addition that through your treachery and insubordination my life has been lost i promise you that nothing in all this world will save you from a hanging  never listen monsieur cried the dowager seeing tressan start back like a man in sudden fear it is no more than the ruse of a desperate man  heed me or not at your choice garnache retorted addressing himself ever to tressan you have had your warning i little thought to see you here tonight but seeing you confirms my worst suspicions and if i am to die i can die easy in my conscience at the thought that in sacrificing you to her majestys wrath i have certainly not sacrificed an innocent man  madame the seneschal began turning to the dowager but she broke in impatiently upon his intended words upon the prayer that bubbled to his lips that she should pause a while ere she made an end of this parisian  monsieur said she you may bargain with him when he is taken we will have him alive go in she bade her men her voice so resolute now that none dared tarry longer fetch the knave outalive  garnache smiled at mademoiselle as the words were uttered  they want me alive said he that is a hopeful state of things bear up child i may need your help ere we are through  you shall find me ready monsieur she assured him for all her tremors he looked at the pale face composed now by an effort of her will and at the beautiful hazel eyes which strove to meet his with calm and to reflect his smile and he marvelled at her courage as much as did she at his  then the assault began and he could have laughed at the way in which a couple of those cutthroatsneither wishing to have the honour of meeting him singlyhindered each other by seeking to attack him at once  at last the dowager commanded one of them to go in the fellow came and he was driven back by the sword that darted at him from above the barricade  there matters might have come to a deadlock but that fortunio came forward with one of his men to repeat the tactics which had cost him a life already his fellow went down on his knees and drove his sword under the table and through the frame of the chair seeking to prick garnache in the legs simultaneously the captain laid hold of an arm of the chair above and sought to engage garnache across it the ruse succeeded to the extent of compelling the parisian to retreat the table seemed likely to be his undoing instead of helping him he dropped like lightning to one knee seeking to force the fellow out from underneath but the obstacles which should have hindered his assailants hindered garnache even more at this juncture in that instant fortunio whipped the chair from the tabletop and flung it forward one of its legs caught garnache on the sword arm deadening it for a second the sword fell from his hand and valerie shrieked aloud thinking the battle at an end but the next moment he was on his feet his rapier firmly gripped once more for all that his arm still felt a trifle numbed as seconds passed the numbness wore away but before that had taken place the table had been thrust forward and the man beneath it had made it impossible for garnache to hinder this suddenly he called to valerie  a cloak mademoiselle get me a cloak he begged and she stemming her fears once more ran to do his bidding  she caught up a cloak that lay on a chair by the door of her bedchamber and brought it to him he twisted it twice round his left arm letting its folds hang loose and advanced again to try conclusions with the gentleman underneath he cast the garment so that it enmeshed the sword when next it was advanced stepping briskly aside he was up to the table and his busy blade drove back the man who assailed him across it he threw his weight against it and thrust it back till it was jammed hard once more against the doorposts leaving the chair at his very feet the man beneath had recovered his sword by this and again he sought to use it that was the end of him again garnache enmeshed it kicked away the chair or rather thrust it aside with his foot stooped suddenly and driving his blade under the table felt it sink into the body of his tormentor  there was a groan and a spluttering cough and then before garnache could recover he heard mademoiselle crying out to him to beware the table was thrust suddenly forward almost on top of him its edge caught his left shoulder and sent him back a full yard sprawling upon the ground  to rise again gasping for airfor the fall had shaken himwas the work of an instant but in that instant fortunio had thrust the table clear of the doorway and his men were pouring into the room  they came at garnache in a body with wild shouts and fierce mockery and he hurriedly fell on guard and gave way before them until his shoulders were against the wainscot and he had at least the assurance that none could take him in the rear three blades engaged his own fortunio had come no farther than the doorway where he stood his torn cheek drenched in blood watching the scene the marquise beside him and tressan standing just behind them very pale and scared  yet garnaches first thought even in that moment of dire peril was for valerie he would spare her the sight that must before many moments be spread to view within that shambles  to your chamber mademoiselle he cried to her you hinder me he added by way of compelling her obedience she did his bidding but only in part no farther went she than the doorway of her room where she remained standing watching the fray as earlier she had stood and watched it from the door of the antechamber  suddenly she was moved by inspiration he had gained an advantage before by retreating through a doorway into an inner room might he not do the same again and be in better case if he were to retreat now to her own chamber impulsively she called to him  in here monsieur de garnache in here  the marquise looked across at her and smiled in mockery garnache was too well occupied she thought to attempt any such rashness if he but dared remove his shoulders from the wall there would be a speedier end to him than as things were  not so however thought garnache the cloak twisted about his left arm gave him some advantage and he used it to the full he flicked the slack of it in the face of one and followed it up by stabbing the fellow in the stomach before he could recover guard whilst with another wave of that cloak he enmeshed the sword that shot readily into the opening he had left  madame cursed and fortunio echoed her imprecations the seneschal gasped his fears lost in amazement at so much valour and dexterity  garnache swung away from the wall now and set his back to mademoiselle determined to act upon her advice but even in that moment he asked himself for the first time since the commencement of that carnageto what purpose his arms were growing heavy with fatigue his mouth was parched and great beads of perspiration stood upon his brow soon he would be spent and they would not fail to take a very full advantage of it  hitherto his mind had been taken up with the battle only and if he had thought of retreating it was but to the end that he might gain a position of some vantage now conscious of his growing fatigue his thoughts turned them at last to the consideration of flight was there no way out of it must he kill every man in condillac before he could hope to escape  whimsically and almost mechanically he set himself in his mind to count the men there were twenty mercenaries all told excluding fortunio and himself on arsenio he might rely not to attack him perhaps even to come to his assistance at the finish that left nineteen four he had already either killed outright or effectively disabled so that fifteen remained him the task of dealing with those other fifteen was utterly beyond him presently no doubt the two now opposing him would be reinforced by others so that if any possible way out existed he had best set about finding it at once  he wondered could he cut down these two make an end of fortunio and running for it attempt to escape through the postern before the rest of the garrison had time to come up with him or guess his purpose but the notion was too wild its accomplishment too impossible  he was fighting now with his back to mademoiselle and his face to the tall window through the leaded panes of which he caught the distorted shape of a crescent moon suddenly the idea came to him through that window must lie his way it was a good fifty feet above the moat he knew and if he essayed to leap it it must be an even chance that he would be killed in leaping but the chance of death was a certain one if he tarried where he was until others came to support his present opponents and so he briskly determined upon the lesser risk  he remembered that the window was nailed down as it had remained since mademoiselles pretended attempt at flight but surely that should prove no formidable obstacle  and now that his resolve was taken his tactics abruptly changed hitherto he had been sparing of his movements husbanding his strength against the long battle that seemed promised him suddenly he assumed the offensive where hitherto he had but acted in selfdefence and a most deadly offensive was it he plied his cloak untwisting it from his arm and flinging it over the head and body of one of his assailants so that he was enmeshed and blinded by it leaping to the fellows flank garnache with a terrific kick knocked his legs from under him so that he fell heavily then stooping suddenly the parisian ran his blade under the other braves guard and through the fellows thigh the man cried out staggered and then went down utterly disabled  one swift downward thrust garnache made at the mass that wriggled under his cloak the activity of its wriggles increased in the next few seconds then ceased altogether  tressan felt wet from head to foot with a sweat provoked by horror of what he saw the dowagers lips were pouring forth a horrid litany of guardroom oaths and meanwhile garnache had swung round to meet fortunio the last of all who had stood with him  the captain came on boldly armed with sword and dagger and in that moment feeling himself spent garnache bitterly repented having relinquished his cloak yet he made a stubborn fight and whilst they fenced and stamped about that room marius came to watch them staggering to his mothers side and leaning heavily upon tressans shoulder the marquise turned to him her face livid to the lips  that man must be the very fiend garnache heard her tell her son run for help tressan or god knows he may escape us yet go for men or we shall have fortunio killed as well bid them bring muskets  tressan moving like one bereft of wits went her errand while the two men fought on stamping and panting circling and lunging their breath coming in gasps their swords grinding and clashing till sparks leapt from them  the dust rose up to envelop and almost choke them and more than once they slipped in the blood with which the floor was spattered whilst presently garnache barely recovered and saved himself from stumbling over the body of one of his victims against which his swiftly moving feet had hurtled  and the dowager who watched the conflict and who knew something of swordplay realized that tired though garnache might be unless help came soon or some strange chance gave the captain the advantage fortunio would be laid low with the others  his circling had brought the parisian round so that his back was now to the window his face to the door of the bedchamber where mademoiselle still watched in evergrowing horror his right shoulder was in line with the door of the antechamber which madame occupied and he never saw her quit mariuss side and creep slyly into the room to speed swiftly round behind him  the only one from whom he thought that he might have cause to fear treachery was the man whom he had dropped with a thigh wound and he was careful to keep beyond the reach of any sudden swordthrust from that fellow  but if he did not see the womans movements mademoiselle saw them and the sight set her eyes dilating with a new fear she guessed the dowagers treacherous purpose and no sooner had she guessed it than with a choking sob she told herself that what madame could do that could she also  suddenly garnache saw an opening fortunios eyes caught by the dowagers movements strayed for a moment past his opponent and the thing would have been fatal to the captain but that in that moment as garnache was on the point of lunging he felt himself caught from behind his arms pinioned to his sides by a pair of slender ones that twined themselves about him and over his shoulder the breath of it fanning his hot cheek came a vicious voice  stab now fortunio  the captain asked nothing better he raised his weary swordarm and brought his point to the level of garnaches breast but in that instant its weight became leaden imitating the marquise valerie had been in time she seized fortunios halflifted arm and flung all her weight upon it  the captain cursed her horridly in a frenzy of fear for he saw that did garnache shake off the marquise there would be an end of himself he sought to wrench himself free of her detaining grasp and the exertion brought him down weary as he was and with her weight hanging to him he sank to his knees and the girl still clinging valiantly sank with him calling to garnache that she held the captain fast  putting forth all his remaining strength the parisian twisted from the dowagers encircling grasp and hurled her from him with a violence he nowise intended  yours madame are the first womans arms that ever martin de garnache has known said he and never could embrace of beauty have been less welcome  panting he caught up one of the overturned chairs holding it by the back he made for the window he had dropped his sword and he called to mademoiselle to hold the captain yet an instant longer he swung his chair aloft and dashed it against the window there was a thundering crash of shivered glass and a cool draught of that november night came to sweeten the air that had been fouled by the stamping of the fighters  again he swung up his chair and dashed it at the window and yet again until no window remained but a great gaping opening with a fringe of ragged glass and twisted leadwork  in that moment fortunio struggled to his feet free of the girl who sank almost in a swoon he sprang towards garnache the parisian turned and flung his now shattered chair toward the advancing captain it dropped at his feet and his flying shins struck against an edge of it bringing him hurt and sprawling to the ground before he could recover a figure was flying through the open gap that lately had been a window  mademoiselle sat up and screamed  you will be killed monsieur de garnache dear god you will be killed and the anguish in her voice was awful  it was the last thing that reached the ears of monsieur de garnache as he tumbled headlong through the darkness of the chill november night     chapter xviii in the moat  fortunio and the marquise reached the window side by side and they were in time to hear a dull splash in the waters fifty feet below them there was a cloud over the little sickle of moon and to their eyes fresh from the blaze of candlelight the darkness was impenetrable  he is in the moat cried the marquise excitedly and valerie who sat on the floor whither she had slipped when fortunio shook her off rocked herself in an agony of fear  to the horrors about herthe huddled bodies lying so still upon the floor the bloody footprints everywhere the shattered furniture and the groans of the man with the wounded thighto all this she was insensible garnache was dead she told herself he was surely dead and it seemed as if the very thought of it were killing too a part of her own self  unconsciously she sobbed her fears aloud he is dead she moaned he is dead  the marquise overheard that piteous cry and turned to survey the girl her brows lifting her lips parting in an astonishment that for a second effaced the horrors of that night suspicion spread like an oil stain in her evil mind she stepped forward and caught the girl by one of her limp arms marius paler than his stunning had left him leaned more heavily against the doorpost and looked on with bloodshot eyes if ever maiden avowed the secret of her heart it seemed to him that valerie avowed it then  the marquise shook her angrily  what was he to you girl what was he to you she demanded shrilly  and the girl no more than half conscious of what she was saying made answer  the bravest gentleman the noblest friend i have ever known  pah the dowager dropped her arm and turned to issue a command to fortunio but already the fellow had departed his concern was not with women but with the man who had escaped him he must make certain that the fall had killed garnache  breathless and worn as he was all spattered now with blood from the scratch in his cheek which lent him a terrific aspect he dashed from that shambles and across the guardroom he snatched up a lighted lantern that had been left in the doorway and leapt down the stairs and into the courtyard here he came upon monsieur de tressan with a halfdozen fellows at his heels all more or less half clad but all very fully armed with swords and knives and one or two with muskets  roughly with little thought for the dignity of his high office he thrust the lord seneschal aside and turned the men some he ordered off to the stables to get horses for if garnache had survived his leap and swum the moat they must give chase whatever betide the parisian must not get away he feared the consequences of that as much for himself as for condillac some five or six of the men he bade follow him and never pausing to answer any of tressans fearful questions he sped across the courtyard through the kitchenswhich was the nearest wayinto the outer quadrangle never pausing to draw breath spent though he was he pursued his flight under the great archway of the keep and across the drawbridge the raising of which had been that night postponed to await the lord seneschals departure  here on the bridge he paused and turned in a frenzy to scream to his followers that they should fetch more torches meanwhile he snatched the only one at hand from the manatarms that carried it  his men sprang into the guardroom of the keep realizing from his almost hysterical manner the urgent need for haste and while he waited for them standing there on the bridge his torch held high he scanned by its lurid red light the water as far as eye could reach on either side of him  there was a faint movement on the dark oily surface for all that no wind stirred not more than four or five minutes could have elapsed since garnaches leap and it would seem as if the last ripple from the disturbance of his plunge had not yet rolled itself out but otherwise there was nothing here nor did fortunio expect aught the window of the northern tower abutted on to the other side of the chateau and it was there he must look for traces of the fugitive or for his body  hasten he shouted over his shoulder follow me and without waiting for them he ran across the bridge and darted round the building his torch scattering a shower of sparks behind him on the night and sending little rills of bloodred light down the sword which he still carried  he gained the spot where garnache must have fallen and he stood below the radiance that clove the night from the shattered window fifty feet above casting the light of his torch this way and that over the black bosom of the moat not a ripple moved now upon that even steely surface voices sounded behind him and with them a great glare of ruddy light came to herald the arrival of his men he turned to them and pointed with his sword away from the chateau  spread yourselves he shouted make search yonder he cannot have gone far  and they but dimly realizing whom they sought yet realizing that they sought a man dashed off and spread themselves as he had bidden them to search the stretch of meadowland where ill must betide any fugitive since no cover offered  fortunio remained where he was at the edge of the moat he stooped and waving his torch along the ground he moved to the far angle of the chateau examining the soft oozy clay it was impossible that a man could have clambered out over that without leaving some impression he reached the corner and found the clay intact at least nowhere could he discover a mark of hands or a footprint set as would be that of a man emerging from the water  he retraced his steps and went back until he had reached the eastern angle of the chateau yet always with the same result he straightened himself at last and his manner was more calm his frenzied haste was gone and deliberately he now raised his torch and let its light shine again over the waters he pondered them a moment his dark eyes musing almost regretfully  drowned he said aloud and sheathed his sword  from the window overhead a voice hailed him he looked up and saw the dowager and behind her the figure of her son away in the meadows the lights of his mens torches darted hither and thither like playful jackolanterns  have you got him fortunio  yes madame he answered with assurance you may have his body when you will he is underneath here and he pointed to the water  they appeared to take his word for it for they questioned him no further the marquise turned to mademoiselle who was still sitting on the floor  he is drowned valerie she said slowly watching the girls face  valerie looked up her eyes were very wide and her lips moved for a second then she fell forward without a word this last horror treading on the heels of all those that already had assailed her proved too great a strain for her brave spirit she had swooned  tressan entered at that moment full of questions as to what might be toward for he had understood nothing in the courtyard the marquise called to him to help her with the girl marius being still too faint and between them they bore her to her chamber laid her on the bed and withdrawing closed the door upon her then she signed to marius and the seneschal  come she said let us go the sight and smell of the place are turning me sick although my stomach is strong enough to endure most horrors  she took up one of the candlebranches to light them and they went below and made their way to the hall where they found mariuss page gaston looking very pale and scared at the din that had filled the chateau during the past halfhour or so with him was mariuss hound which the poor boy had kept by him for company and protection in that dreadful time  the marquise spoke to him kindly and she stooped to pat the dogs glossy head then she bade gaston set wine for them and when it was fetched the three of them drank in brooding gloomy silence  the draught invigorated marius it cheered tressans drooping spirits and it quenched the dowagers thirst the seneschal turned to her again with his unanswered questions touching the end of that butchery abovestairs she told him what fortunio had said that garnache was drowned as a consequence of his mad leap from the window  into tressans mind there sprang the memory of the thing garnache had promised should befall him in such a case it drove the colour from his cheeks and brought great lines of fearful care into sharp relief about his mouth and eyes  madame we are ruined he groaned  tressan she answered him contemptuously you are chickenhearted listen to me did he not say that he had left his man behind him when he came to condillac where think you that he left his man  maybe in grenoble answered the seneschal staring  find out she told him impressively her eyes on his and calm as though they had never looked upon such sights as that very night had offered them if not in grenoble certainly at least somewhere in this dauphiny of which you are the kings lord seneschal turn the whole province inside out man but find the fellow yours is the power to do it do it then and you will have no consequences to fear you have seen the man  ay i have seen him i remember him and his name i bethink me is rabecque  he took courage his face looked less dejected  you overlook nothing madame he murmured you are truly wonderful i will start the search this very night my men are almost all at montelimar awaiting my commands ill dispatch a messenger with orders that they are to spread themselves throughout dauphiny upon this quest  the door opened and fortunio entered he was still unwashed and terrible to look upon all bloodbespattered the sight of him drove a shudder through tressan the marquise grew solicitous  how is your wound fortunio was her first question  he made a gesture that dismissed the matter  it is nothing i am over fullblooded and if i am scratched i bleed without perceiving it enough to drain another man  here drink mon capitaine she urged him very friendly filling him a cup with her own hands and you marius she asked are you recovering strength  i am well answered marius sullenly his defeat that evening had left him glum and morose he felt that he had cut a sorry figure in the affair and his vanity was wounded i deplore i had so little share in the fight he muttered  the lustiest fight ever i or any man beheld swore fortunio dieu but he was a fighter that monsieur de garnache and he deserved a better end than drowning  you are quite sure that he is drowned  fortunio replied by giving his reasons for that conclusion and they convinced both the marquise and her son indeed they had never deemed it possible that the parisian could have survived that awful leap the dowager looked at marius and from him to the captain  do you think you two that you will be fit for tomorrows business  for myself laughed fortunio i am ready for it now  and i shall be when i have rested answered marius grimly  then get you both to rest you will be needing it she bade them  and i too madame said the seneschal bending over the hand she held out to him goodnight to you all he would have added a word to wish them luck in the morrows venture but for the life of him he dared not he turned made another of his bows and rolled out of the room  five minutes later the drawbridge was being raised after his departure and fortunio was issuing orders to the men he had recalled from their futile search to go clear the guardroom and antechamber of the northern tower and to bear the dead to the chapel which must serve as a mortuary for the time that done he went off to bed and soon after the lights were extinguished in condillac and save for arsenio who was on guard sorely perturbed by all that had befallen and marvelling at the rashness of his friend battistafor he had no full particulars of the businessthe place was wrapped in sleep  had they been less sure that garnache was drowned maybe they had slumbered less tranquilly that night at condillac fortunio had been shrewd in his conclusions yet a trifle hasty for whilst as a matter of fact he was correct in assuming that the parisian had not crawled out of the moatneither at the point he had searched nor elsewhereyet was he utterly wrong to assume him at the bottom of it  garnache had gone through that window prepared to leap into anotherand he hoped a better world he had spun round twice in the air and shot feet foremost through the chill waters of the moat and down until his toes came in contact with a less yielding substance yet yielding nevertheless marvelling that he should have retained until now his senses he realized betimes that he was touching mudthat he was really ankle deep in it a vigorous frantic kick with both legs at once released him and he felt himself slowly reascending to the surface  it has been often said that a drowning man in his struggles sees his whole life mirrored before him in the instants of garnaches ascent through the half stagnant waters of that moat he had reviewed the entire situation and determined upon the course he should pursue when he reached the surface he must see to it that he broke it gently for at the window above were sure to be watchers looking to see how he had fared madame he remembered had sent tressan for muskets if he had returned with them and they should perceive him from above a bullet would be sent to dispose of him and it were a pity to be shot now after having come through so much  his head broke the surface and emerged into the chill darkness of the night he took a deep breath of cold but very welcome air and moving his arms gently under water he swam quietly not to the edge of the moat but to the chateau wall close under which he thought he would be secure from observation he found by good fortune a crevice between two stones he did not see it his fingers found it for him as they groped along that granite surface he clung there a moment and pondered the situation he heard voices above and looking up he saw the glare of light through the opening he had battered  and now he was surprised to feel new vigour running through him he had hurled himself from that window with scarce the power to leap bathed in perspiration and deeming his strength utterly spent the icecold waters of the moat had served it would seem to brace him to wash away his fatigue and to renew his energies his mind was singularly clear and his senses rendered superacute and he set himself to consider what he had best do  swim to the edge of the moat and clambering out take to his legs was naturally the first impulse but reflecting upon the open nature of the ground he realized that that must mean his ruin presently they would come to see how he had fared and failing to find him in the water they would search the country round about he set himself in their place he tried to think as they would think the better that he might realize how they would act and then an idea came to him that might be worth heeding in any case his situation was still very desperate on that score he allowed himself no illusions that they would take his drowning for granted and never come to satisfy themselves he was not optimist enough to assume  he abandoned his grip of the wall and began to swim gently toward the eastern angle if they came out they must lower the bridge he would place himself so that in falling it should cover him and screen him from their sight he rounded the angle of the building and now the friendly cloud that had hung across the moon moved by and a faint silver radiance was upon the water under his eyes but yonder ahead of him something black lay athwart the moat at once he knew it for the bridge it was down and he had the explanation in that he remembered that the lord seneschal had not yet left condillac it mattered little to him one way or the other the bridge was there and he made the best of it  a few swift silent strokes brought him to it he hesitated a moment before venturing into the darkness underneath then bethinking him that it was that or discovery he passed under he made for the wall and as he groped along he found a chain depending and reaching down into the water he caught at it with both hands and hung by it to await events  and now for the first time that night his pulses really quickened there in the dark he waited and the moments that sped seemed very long to him and they were very anxious he had no good sword wherewith to defend himself were he attacked no good solid ground on which to take his stand if he were discovered he was helpless at their mercy to shoot or take or beat to death as best they listed and so he waited his pulses throbbing his breath coming short and fast the cold water that had invigorated him some minutes ago was numbing him now and seemed to be freezing his courage as it froze the blood in his veins the very marrow in his bones  presently his ears caught a rush of feet a sound of voices and fortunios raised above the others heavy steps rang on the bridge over his head and the thud of their fall was like thunder to the man beneath a crimson splash of light fell on the moat on either side of him the fellow on the bridge had halted then the steps went on the light flared this way and that and garnache almost trembled expecting at every moment that its rays would penetrate the spot where he was hanging and reveal him cowering there like a frightened waterrat but the man moved on and his light flared no longer  then others followed him garnache heard the sounds of their search so overwrought was he that there was a moment when he thought of swimming to the edge and making across the country to the north while they were hunting the meadows to the east but he repressed the impulse and stayed on an eternity did it seem before those men returned and marched once more over his head a further eternity was it until the clatter of hoofs on the courtyard stones and their thunder on the planks above him brought him the news that tressan was riding home he heard the hoofs quicken and their loud rattle on the road that led down to the isere a halfmile away and then when the hoofbeats grew more distant there came again the echo of voices up above  was it not over yet dear god would it never end he felt that a few moments more of this immersion and he should be done for utterly his numbness must rob him of the power to cross the moat  suddenly the first welcome sound he had heard that night came to his ears chains creaked hinges groaned and the great black pall above him began gradually to rise faster it went till at last it fell back into position flat with the wall of the chateau and such little light as there was from the moon was beating down upon his frozen face  he let the chain go and with strokes swift and silent as he could contrive he crossed the water he clambered up the bank almost bereft of strength a moment he crouched there listening had he moved too soon had he been incautious  nothing stirred behind him to confirm his fears he crept softly across the hard ground of the road where he had landed then when the yielding silent turf was under his feet he gave not another thought for his numbness but started to run as a man runs in a nightmare so little did the speed of his movements match the pace of his desire to set a distance between himself and condillac      chapter xix through the night  it wanted something over an hour to midnight when monsieur de garnache started out in his sodden clothes to run from condillac he bore away to the north and continued running until he had covered a mile or so when perforce he must slacken his pace lest presently he should have to give way to utter exhaustion he trudged on bravely thereafter at a good swinging pace realizing that in moving briskly lay his salvation from such ill effects as might otherwise attend his too long immersion his run had set a pleasant glow upon his skin and seemed to have thawed the frozen condition of his joints yet he could not disguise from himself that he was sorely worn by that nights happenings and that if he would reach his goal he must carefully husband such strength as yet remained him  that goal of his was voiron some four leagues distant to the north where at the inn of the beau paon his man rabecque should be lodged ready for his coming at any time once already when repairing to condillac he had travelled by that road and it was so direct that there seemed scant fear of his mistaking it on he plodded through the night his way lighted for him by the crescent moon the air so still that despite his wet garments being warmed as he was by his brisk movements he never felt the cold of it  he had overheard enough of what had been said by marius to valerie to understand the business that was afoot for the morrow and he doubted him that he had not sufficiently injured the dowagers son to make him refrain from or adjourn his murderous ride across the border into savoy  garnaches purpose now was to reach voiron there to snatch a brief rest and then equipped anew to set out with his man for la rochette and anticipate the fell plans of marius and fortunio  he might have experienced elation at his almost miraculous escape and at the circumstance that he was still at large to carry this duel with the condillacs to a fitting finish were it not for the reflection that but for his besetting sin of hastiness he might now be travelling in dry garments toward la rochette with mademoiselle beside him once again that rash temper of his had marred an enterprise that was on the point of succeeding and yet even as he regretted his rashness rage stirred him again at the thought of marius crushing that slender shape against him and seeking to force his odious kisses upon her pure immaculate lips and then the thought of her left behind at condillac at the mercy of marius and that shedevil the marquise and the fears that of a sudden leapt up in his mind brought him to a standstill as though he were contemplating the incomparable folly of a return he beat his hands together for a moment in a frenzy of anguish he threw back his head and raised his eyes to the sky above with a burst of imprecations on his lips and then reflection brought him peace no no they dare offer her no hurt to do so must irrevocably lose them la vauvraye and it was their covetousness had made them villains upon that covetousness did their villainy rest and he need fear from them no wanton ruthlessness that should endanger their chance of profit  he trudged on reassured he had been a fool so to give way to fear as great a fool as he had been when he had laid hands on marius to quell his excessive amorousness dieu was he bewitched what ailed him again he paused there in the night to think the situation out  a dozen thoughts all centering about valerie came crowding in upon his brain till in the end a great burst of laughterthe laughter of a madman almost eerie and terrific as it rang upon the silent night broke from his parted lips that brief moment of introspection had revealed him to himself and the revelation had fetched that peal of mocking laughter from him  he realized now at last that not because the queen had ordered him to procure mademoiselle de la vauvrayes enlargement had he submitted to assume a filthy travesty to set his neck in jeopardy to play the lackey and the spy it was because something in valeries eyes something in her pure lily face had moved him to it and simultaneously had come the thought of the relation in which she stood to that man at la rochette whose life he now sought to save for her and it had stabbed him with a bitterness no misfortune no failure yet had brought him  he trudged on knowing himself for what he was a fool who after close upon forty years of a strenuous life in which no petticoat had played a part was come under the spell of a pair of innocent eyes belonging to a child almost young enough to have been his daughter  he despised himself a little for his weakness he despised himself for his apostasy from the faith that had governed his lifethe faith to keep himself immune from the folly to which womanhood had driven so many a stout man  and yet mock himself despise himself as he would a great tenderness a great desire grew strong in his soul that night as he trudged on toward distant voiron mile after mile her image kept him company and once when he had left voreppe behind him the greater portion of his journey done some devil whispered in his ear that he was weary that he would be overweary on the morrow for any ride to la rochette he had done all that mortal man could do let him rest tomorrow whilst marius and fortunio accomplished by florimond what the fever had begun  a cold perspiration broke on him as he wrestled with that grim temptation valerie was his she belonged to him by the right of dangers shared never had mother in her labours been nearer death for the offsprings sake than had he for valerie during the days that were sped and the hours that were but gone she belonged to him by the title of those dangers he had been through what had florimond done to establish his claim to her he had remained absent during long years awarring in a foreign land with how many banal loves might not the fellow in that time have strewn his soldiers path garnache knew well how close does cupid stalk in the wake of mars knew well the way of these gay soldiers and the lightness of their loves  was then this fellow to come now and claim her when perils were past when there was naught left to do but lead her to the altar could he be worthy of such a pearl of womanhood this laggard who because a fever touched him sat him down in an inn within a few hours ride of her to rest him as though the world held no such woman as valerie  and she herself by what ties was she bound to him by the ties of an old promise given at an age when she knew not what love meant he had talked of it with her and he knew how dispassionately she awaited florimonds return florimond might be betrothed to herher father and his had encompassed that between thembut no lover of hers was he  thus far did his thoughts journey and temptation gripped him ever more and more strongly and then his manhood and his honour awoke with a shudder as awakens a man from an ugly dream what manner of fool was he he asked himself again upon what presumptions did he base his silly musings did he suppose that even were there no florimond it would be left for a harsh warworn old greybeard such as he to awaken tenderness in the bosom of that child the tenderness of friendship perhapsshe had confessed to that but the tenderness of her sweet love must be won by a younger comelier man  if love had indeed touched him at last let him be worthy of it and of her who inspired it let him strain every sinew in her service asking no guerdon let him save the life of the man to whom she was affianced let him save her from the clutches of the marquise de condillac and her beautiful unscrupulous son  he put his folly from him andwent on seeking to hold his mind to the planning of his tomorrows journey and its business he had no means to know that at that very hour valerie was on her knees by her little white bed in the northern tower of condillac praying for the repose of the soul of monsieur de garnachethe bravest gentleman the noblest friend she had ever known for she accounted him dead and she thought with horror of his body lying in the slime under the cold waters of the moat beneath the window of her antechamber a change seemed to have come upon her her soul was numb her courage seemed dead and little care had she in that hour of what might betide her now  florimond was coming she remembered coming to wed her ah well it mattered little since monsieur de garnache was deadas though it could have mattered had he been living  three hours of his long striding brought garnache at last to voiron and the echo of his footsteps rang through the silent streets and scared a stray cat or two that were preying out of doors there was no watch in the little township and no lights but by the moons faint glimmer garnache sought the inn of the beau paon and found it at the end of a little wandering a gaudy peacock with tail spread wide was the sign above the door on which he thumped and kicked as if he would have beaten it down  it opened after some delay and a man half clad candle in hand a nightcap on his hoary locks showed an angry face at the opening  at sight of the gaunt bedraggled figure that craved admittance the landlord would have shut the door again fearing that he had to do with some wild bandit from the hills but garnache thrust his foot in the way  there is a man named rabecque from paris lodging here i must have instant speech with him said he and his words together with the crisp commanding tones in which they were uttered had their effect upon the host  rabecque had been playing the great lord during the week he had spent at voiron and had known how to command a certain deference and regard that this tatterdemalion with the haughty voice should demand to see him at that hour of the night with such scant unconcern of how far he might incommode the great monsieur rabecque earned for him too a certain measure of regard though still alloyed with some suspicion  the landlord bade him enter he did not know whether monsieur rabecque would forgive him for being disturbed he could not say whether monsieur rabecque would consent to see this visitor at such an hour very probably he would not still monsieur might enter  garnache cut him short before he had half done announced his name and bade him convey it to rabecque the alacrity with which the lackey stirred from his bed upon hearing who it was that had arrived impressed the host not a little but not half so much as it impressed him presently to observe the deference with which this great monsieur rabecque of paris confronted the scarecrow below stairs when he was brought into its presence  you are safe and sound monsieur he cried in deferential joy  aye by a miracle mon fils garnache answered him with a short laugh help me to bed then bring me a cup of spiced wine i have swum a moat and done other wonders in these clothes  the host and rabecque bustled now to minister to his wants between them and when jaded and worn garnache lay at last between goodsmelling sheets with the feeling in him that he was like to sleep until the day of judgment he issued his final orders  awake me at daybreak rabecque said he drowsily we must be stirring then have horse ready and clothes for me i shall need you to wash me clean and shave me and make me what i was before your tricks and dyes turned me into what i have been this week and more take away the light at daybreak dont let me sleep beyond that as you value your place with me we shall have brisk work tomorrow atdaybreakrabecque     chapter xx florimond de condillac   it was noon of the next day when two horsemen gained the heights above la rochette and paused to breathe their nags and take a survey of the little township in the plain at their feet one of these was monsieur de garnache the other was his man rabecque but it was no longer the travestied garnache that condillac had known as battista during the past days it was that gentleman as he had been when first he presented himself at the chateau rabecque had shaved him and by means of certain unguents had cleansed his skin and hair of the dyes with which he had earlier overlaid them  that metamorphosis of itself was enough to set garnache in a good humour he felt himself again and the feeling gave him confidence his mustachios bristled as fiercely as of old his skin was clear and healthy and his dark brown hair showed ashen at the temples he was becomingly arrayed in a suit of dark brown camlet with rows of closeset gold buttons running up his hanging sleeves a leather jerkin hid much of his finery and his great boots encased his legs he wore a brown hat with a tallish crown and a red feather and rabecque carried his cloak for him for the persistent saint martins summer rendered that day of november rather as one of early autumn  a flood of sunshine descended from a cloudless sky to drench the country at their feet and all about them the trees preserved a green that was but little touched by autumnal browning  awhile he paused there on the heights then he gave his horse a touch of the spur and they started down the winding road that led into la rochette a halfhour later they were riding under the porte cochere of the inn of the black boar of the ostler who hastened forward to take their reins monsieur de garnache inquired if the marquis de condillac were lodged there he was answered in the affirmative and he got down at once from his horse indeed but for the formality of the thing he might have spared himself the question for lounging about the courtyard were a score of stalwart weathertanned fellows whose air and accoutrements proclaimed them soldiers it required little shrewdness to guess in them the personal followers of the marquis the remainder of the little troop that had followed the young seigneur to the wars when some three years ago he had set out from condillac  garnache gave orders for the horses to be cared for and bade rabecque get himself fed in the common room heralded by the host the parisian then mounted the stairs to monsieur de condillacs apartments  the landlord led the way to the inns best room turned the handle and throwing wide the door stood aside for monsieur de garnache to enter  from within the chamber came the sounds of a scuffle a mans soft laugh and a girls softer intercession  let me go monsieur of your pity let me go some one is coming  and what care i who comes answered a voice that seemed oppressed by laughter  garnache strode into the chamberspacious and handsomely furnished as became the best room of the auberge du sanglier noirto find a meal spread on the table steaming with an odour promising of good things but neglected by the guest for the charms of the servingwench whose waist he had imprisoned as garnaches tall figure loomed before him he let the girl go and turned a halflaughing halfstartled face upon the intruder  who the devil may you be he inquired and a brown eye rakish and roving in its glance played briskly over the parisian whilst garnache himself returned the compliment and calmly surveyed this florid gentleman of middle height with the fair hair and regular features  the girl scurried by and darted from the room dodging the smiting hand which the host raised as she flew past him the parisian felt his gorge rising was this the sort of fever that had kept monsieur le marquis at la rochette whilst mademoiselle was suffering in durance at condillac his last nights jealous speculations touching a man he did not know had leastways led him into no exaggeration he found just such a man as he had pictureda lightlyloving pleasuretaking roysterer with never a thought beyond the amusement which the hour afforded him  with curling lip garnache bowed stiffly and in a cold formal voice he announced himself  my name is martin marie rigobert de garnache i am an emissary dispatched from paris by her majesty the queenmother to procure the enlargement of mademoiselle de la vauvraye from the durance in which she is held by madame your stepmother  the pleasant gentlemans eyebrows went up a smile that was almost insolent broke on his face  that being so monsieur why the devil are you here  i am here monsieur answered him garnache throwing back his head his nostrils quivering because you are not at condillac  the tone was truculent to the point of defiance for despite the firm resolve he had taken last night never again to let his temper overmaster him already garnaches selfcontrol was slipping away  the marquis noted the tone and observed the man in their way he liked both in their way he disliked both but he clearly saw that this peppery gentleman must be treated less cavalierly or trouble would come of it so he waved him gracefully to the table where a brace of flagons stood amid the steaming viands  you will dine with me monsieur said he the utmost politeness marking his utterance now i take it that since you have come here in quest of me you have something to tell me shall we talk as we eat i detest a lonely meal  the florid gentlemans tone and manner were mollifying in the extreme garnache had risen early and ridden far the smell of the viands had quickened an appetite already very keen moreover since he and this gentleman were to be allies it was as well they should not begin by quarrelling  he bowed less stiffly expressed his willingness and his thanks laid hat and whip and cloak aside unbuckled and set down his sword and that done took at table the place which his host himself prepared him  garnache took more careful stock of the marquis now he found much to like in his countenance it was frank and jovial obviously that of a sensualist but leastways an honest sensualist he was dressed in black as became a man who mourned his father yet with a striking richness of material whilst his broad collar of fine point and the lace cuffs of his doublet were worth a fortune  what time they ate monsieur de garnache told of his journey from paris and of his dealings with tressan and his subsequent adventures at condillac he dwelt passingly upon the manner in which they had treated him and found it difficult to choose words to express the reason for his returning in disguise to play the knighterrant to valerie he passed on to speak of last nights happenings and of his escape throughout the marquis heard him with a grave countenance and a sober attentive glance yet when he had finished a smile crept round the sensual lips  the letter that i had at milan prepared me for some such trouble as this said he and garnache was amazed at the lightness of his tone just as he had been amazed to see the fellow keep his countenance at the narrative of mademoiselles position i guessed that my beautiful stepmother intended me some such scurviness from the circumstance of her having kept me in ignorance of my fathers death but frankly sir your tale by far outstrips my wildest imaginings you have behaved veryvery bravely in this affair you seem in fact to have taken a greater interest in mademoiselle de la vauvrayes enlargement than the queen could have a right to expect of you and he smiled a world of suggestion in his eyes garnache sat back in his chair and stared at the man  this levity monsieur on such a subject leaves me thunderstruck he said at last  diable laughed the other you are too prone after your trials to view its tragic rather than its comic side forgive me if i am smitten only with the humour of the thing  the humour of the thing gurgled garnache his eyes starting from his head then out leapt that temper of his like an eager hound that has been suddenly unleashed he brought down his clenched hand upon the table caught in passing a flagon and sent it crashing to the floor if there was a table near at hand when his temper went he never failed to treat it so  par la mort dieu monsieur you see but the humour of it do you and what of that poor child who is lying there suffering this incarceration because of her fidelity to a promise given you  the statement was hardly fully accurate but it served its purpose the others face became instantly grave  calm yourself i beg monsieur he cried raising a soothing hand i have offended you somewhere that is plain there is something here that i do not altogether understand you say that valerie has suffered on account of a promise given me to what are you referring  they hold her a prisoner monsieur because they wish to wed her to marius answered garnache striving hard to cool his anger  parfaitement that much i understood  well then monsieur is the rest not plain because she is betrothed to you he paused he saw at last that he was stating something not altogether accurate but the other took his meaning there and then lay back in his chair and burst out laughing  the blood hummed through garnaches head as he tightened his lips and watched this gentleman indulge his inexplicable mirth surely monsieur de condillac was possessed of the keenest sense of humour in all france he laughed with a will and garnache sent up a devout prayer that the laugh might choke him the noise of it filled the hostelry  sir said garnache with an everincreasing tartness there is a byword has it much laughter little wit in confidence won is that your case monsieur  the other looked at him soberly a moment then went off again  monsieur monsieur he gasped youll be the death of me for the love of heaven look less fierce is it my fault that i must laugh the folly of it all is so colossal three years from home yet there is a woman keeps faithful and holds to a promise given for her come monsieur you who have seen the world you must agree that there is in this something that is passing singular extravagantly amusing my poor little valerie he spluttered through his halfchecked mirth does she wait for me still does she count me still betrothed to her and because of that says no to brother marius death of my life i shall die of it  i have a notion that you may monsieur rasped garnaches voice and with it rasped garnaches chair upon the boards he had risen and he was confronting his merry host very fiercely white to the lips his eyes aflame there was no mistaking his attitude no mistaking his words  eh gasped the other recovering himself at last to envisage what appeared to develop into a serious situation  monsieur said garnache his voice very cold do i understand that you no longer intend to carry out your engagement and wed mademoiselle de la vauvraye  a dull flush spread upon the marquiss face he rose too and across the table he confronted his guest his mien haughty his eyes imperious  i thought monsieur said he with a great dignity i thought when i invited you to sit at my table that your business was to serve me however little i might be conscious of having merited the honour it seems instead that you are come hither to affront me you are my guest monsieur let me beg that you will depart before i resent a question on a matter which concerns myself alone  the man was right and garnache was wrong he had no title to take up the affairs of mademoiselle de la vauvraye but he was past reason now and he was not the man to brook haughtiness however courteously it might be cloaked he eyed the marquiss flushed ace across the board and his lip curled  monsieur said he i take your meaning very fully half a word with me is as good as a whole sentence with another you have dubbed me in polite phrases an impertinent that i am not and i resent the imputation  oh that said the marquis with a halflaugh and a shrug if you resent it his smile and his gesture made the rest plain  exactly monsieur was garnaches answer but i do not fight sick men  florimonds brows grew wrinkled his eyes puzzled  sick men he echoed awhile ago monsieur you appeared to cast a doubt upon my sanity is it a case of the drunkard who thinks all the world drunk but himself  garnache gazed at him that doubt he had entertained grew now into something like assurance  i know not whether it is the fever makes your tongue run so he began when the other broke in a sudden light of understanding in his eyes  you are at fault he cried i have no fever  but then your letter to condillac demanded garnache lost now in utter amazement  what of it ill swear i never said i had a fever  ill swear you did  you give me the lie then  but garnache waved his hands as if he implored the other to have done with giving and taking offence there was some misunderstanding somewhere he realized and sheer astonishment had cooled his anger his only aim now was to have this obscure thing made clear  no no he cried i am seeking enlightenment  florimond smiled  i may have said that we were detained by a fever but i never said the patient was myself  who then who else cried garnache  why now i understand monsieur but it is my wife who has the fever  your garnache dared not trust himself to utter the word  my wife monsieur the marquis repeated the journey proved too much for her travelling at the rate she did  a silence fell garnaches long chin sank on to his breast and he stood there his eyes upon the tablecloth his thoughts with the poor innocent child who waited at condillac so full of trust and faith and loyalty to this betrothed of hers who had come home with a wife out of italy  and then while he stood so and florimond was regarding him curiously the door opened and the host appeared  monsieur le marquis said he there are two gentlemen below asking to see you one of them is monsieur marius de condillac  marius cried the marquis and he started round with a frown  marius breathed garnache and then realizing that the assassins had followed so close upon his heels he put all thoughts from his mind other than that of the immediate business he had himself a score to settle with them the time was now he swung round on his heel and before he knew what he had said the words were out  bring them up monsieur lhote  florimond looked at him in surprise  oh by all means if monsieur wishes it said he with a fine irony  garnache looked at him then back at the hesitating host  you have heard said he coolly bring them up  bien monsieur replied the host withdrawing and closing the door after him  your interference in my affairs grows really droll monsieur said the marquis tartly  when you shall have learned to what purpose i am interfering youll find it possibly not quite so droll was the answer no less tart we have but a moment monsieur listen while i tell you the nature of their errand     chapter xxi the ghost in the cupboard   garnache had but a few minutes in which to unfold his story and he needed in addition a second or two in which to ponder the situation as he now found it  his first reflection was that florimond since he was now married might perhaps instead of proving valeries saviour from marius join forces with his brother in coercing her into this alliance with him but from what valerie herself had told him he was inclined to think more favourably of florimond and to suppress such doubts as these still he could incur no risks is business was to serve valerie and valerie only to procure at all costs her permanent liberation from the power of the condillacs to make sure of this he must play upon florimonds anger letting him know that marius had journeyed to la rochette for the purpose of murdering his halfbrother that he but sought to murder him to the end that he might be removed from his path to valerie was a circumstance that need not too prominently be presented still presented it must be for florimond would require to know by what motive his brother was impelled ere he could credit him capable of such villainy  succinctly but tellingly garnache brought out the story of the plot that had been laid for florimonds assassination and it joyed him to see the anger rising in the marquiss face and flashing from his eyes  what reason have they for so damnable a deed he cried between incredulity and indignation  their overweening ambition marius covets mademoiselle de la vauvrayes estates  and to gain his ends he would not stop at murdering me is it indeed the truth you tell me  i pledge my honour for the truth of it answered garnache watching him closely florimond looked at him a moment the steady glance of those blue eyes and the steady tone of that crisp voice scattered his last doubt  the villains cried the marquis the fools he added for me marius had been welcome to valerie he might have found in me an ally to aid him in the urging of his suit but now he raised his clenched hand and shook it in the air as if in promise of the battle he would deliver  good said garnache reassured i hear their steps upon the stairs they must not find me with you  a moment later the door opened and marius very bravely arrayed entered the room followed closely by fortunio neither showed much ill effects of last nights happenings save for a long darkbrown scar that ran athwart the captains cheek where garnaches sword had ploughed it  they found florimond seated quietly at table and as they entered he rose and came forward with a friendly smile to greet his brother his sense of humour was being excited he was something of an actor and the role he had adopted in the comedy to be played gave him a certain grim satisfaction he would test for himself the truth of what monsieur de garnache had told him concerning his brothers intentions marius received his advances very coolly he took his brothers hand submitted to his brothers kiss but neither kiss nor handpressure did he return florimond affected not to notice this  you are well my dear marius i hope said he and thrusting him out at arms length he held him by the shoulders and regarded him critically ma foi but you are changed into a comely wellgrown man and your mothershe is well too i trust  i thank you florimond she is well said marius stiffly  the marquis took his hands from his brothers shoulders his florid goodnatured face smiling ever as if this were the happiest moment of his life  it is good to see france again my dear marius he told his brother i was a fool to have remained away so long i am pining to be at condillac once more  marius eyeing him looked in vain for signs of the fever he had expected to find a debilitated emaciated man instead he saw a very lusty healthy hearty fellow full of good humour and seemingly full of strength he began to like his purpose less despite such encouragement as he gathered from the support of fortunio still it must be gone through with  you wrote us that you had the fever he said half inquiringly  pooh that is naught and florimond snapped a strong finger against a stronger thumb but whom have you with you he asked and his eyes took the measure of fortunio standing a pace or two behind his master  marius presented his bravo  this is captain fortunio the commander of our garrison of condillac  the marquis nodded goodhumouredly towards the captain  captain fortunio he is well named for a soldier of fortune my brother no doubt will have family matters to tell me of if you will step below monsieur le capitaine and drink a health or so while you wait i shall be honoured  the captain nonplussed looked at marius and florimond surprised the look but mariuss manner became still chillier  fortunio here said he and he half turned and let his hand fall on the captains shoulder is my very good friend i have no secrets from him  the instant lift of florimonds eyebrows was full of insolent supercilious disdain yet marius did not fasten his quarrel upon that he had come to la rochette resolved that any pretext would serve his turn but the sight of his brother so inflamed his jealousy that he had now determined that the quarrel should be picked on the actual ground in which it had its roots  oh as you will said the marquis coolly perhaps your friend will be seated and you too my dear marius and he played the host to them with a brisk charm setting chairs he forced them to sit and pressed wine upon them  marius cast his hat and cloak on the chair where garnaches had been left the parisians hat and cloak he naturally assumed to belong to his brother the smashed flagon and the mess of wine upon the floor he scarce observed setting it down to some clumsiness either his brothers or a servants they both drank marius in silence the captain with a toast  your good return monsieur le marquis said he and florimond thanked him by an inclination of the head then turning to marius  and so he said you have a garrison at condillac what the devil has been taking place there i have had some odd news of you it would almost seem as if you were setting up as rebels in our quiet little corner of dauphiny  marius shrugged his shoulders his face suggested that he was illhumoured  madame the queenregent has seen fit to interfere in our concerns we condillacs do not lightly brook interference  florimond showed his teeth in a pleasant smile  that is true that is very true pardieu but what warranted this action of her majestys  marius felt that the time for deeds was come this fatuous conversation was but a futile waste of time he set down his glass and sitting back in his chair he fixed his sullen black eyes full upon his halfbrothers smiling brown ones  i think we have exchanged compliments enough said he and fortunio wagged his head approvingly there were too many men in the courtyard for his liking and the more time they waited the more likely were they to suffer interruption their aim must be to get the thing done quickly and then quickly to depart before an alarm could be raised our trouble at condillac concerns mademoiselle de la vauvraye  florimond started forward with a ready assumption of loverlike solicitude  no harm has come to her he cried tell me that no harm has come to her  reassure yourself answered marius with a sneer a greyness that was of jealous rage overspreading his face no harm has come to her whatever the trouble was that i sought to wed her and she because she is betrothed to you would have none of me so we brought her to condillac hoping always to persuade her you will remember that she was under my mothers tutelage the girl however could not be constrained she suborned one of our men to bear a letter to paris for her and in answer to it the queen sent a hotheaded rash blunderer down to dauphiny to procure her liberation he lies now at the bottom of the moat of condillac  florimonds face had assumed a look of horror and indignation  do you dare tell me this he cried  dare answered marius with an ugly laugh men enough have died over this affair already that fellow garnache left some bodies on our hands last night before he set out for another world himself you little dream how far my daring goes in this matter ill add as many more as need be to the death roll that we have already before you set foot in condillac  ah said florimond as one upon whose mind a light breaks suddenly so that is the business on which you come to me i doubted your brotherliness i must confess my dear marius but tell me brother mine what of our fathers wishes in this matter have you no respect for those  what respect had you flashed back marius his voice now raised in anger was it like a lover to remain away for three yearsto let all that time go by without ever a word from you to your betrothed what have you done to make good your claim to her  nothing i confess yet  well you shall do something now exclaimed marius rising i am here to afford you the opportunity if you would still win mademoiselle de la vauvraye you shall win her from meat point of sword fortunio see to the door  wait marius cried florimond and he looked genuinely aghast do not forget that we are brothers men of the same blood that my father was your father  i choose to remember rather that we are rivals answered marius and he drew his rapier fortunio turned the key in the lock florimond gave his brother a long searching look then with a sigh he picked up his sword where it lay ready to his hand and thoughtfully unsheathed it holding the hilt in one hand and the blade in the other he stood bending the weapon like a whip whilst again he searchingly regarded his brother  hear me a moment said he if you will force this unnatural quarrel upon me at least let the thing be decently done not here not in these cramped quarters but out in the open let our meeting take place if the captain there will act for you ill find a friend to do me the like service  we settle this matter here and now marius answered him in a tone of calm finality  but if i were to kill you florimond began  reassure yourself said marius with an ugly smile  very well then either alternative will suit the case i wish to put if you were to kill meit may be ranked as murder the irregularity of it could not be overlooked  the captain here will act for both of us  i am entirely at your service gentlemen replied fortunio pleasantly bowing to each in turn  florimond considered him i do not like his looks he objected he may be the friend of your bosom marius you may have no secrets from him but for my part frankly i should prefer the presence of some friend of my own to keep his blade engaged  the marquiss manner was affable in the extreme now that it was settled that they must fight he appeared to have cast aside all scruples based upon their consanguinity and he discussed the affair with the greatest bonhomie as though he were disposing of a matter of how they should sit down to table  it gave them pause the change was too abrupt they did not like it it was as the calm that screens some surprise yet it was impossible he should have been forewarned impossible he could have had word of how they proposed to deal with him  marius shrugged his shoulders  there is reason in what you say he acknowledged but i am in haste i cannot wait while you go in search of a friend  why then he answered with a careless laugh i must raise one from the dead  both stared at him was he mad had the fever touched his brain was that healthy colour but the brand of a malady that rendered him delirious  dieu how you stare he continued laughing in their faces you shall see something to compensate you for your journey messieurs i have learnt some odd tricks in italy they are a curious people beyond the alps what did you say was the name of the man the queen had sent from parishe who lies at the bottom of the moat of condillac  let there be an end to this jesting growled marius on guard monsieur le marquis  patience patience florimond implored him you shall have your way with me i promise you but of your charity messieurs tell me first the name of that man  it was garnache said fortunio and if the information will serve you it was i who slew him  you cried florimond tell me of it i beg you  do you fool us questioned marius in a rage that overmastered his astonishment his growing suspicion that here all was not quite as it seemed  fool you but no i do but wish to show you something that i learned in italy tell me how you slew him monsieur le capitaine  i think we are wasting time said the captain angry too he felt that this smiling gentleman was deriding the pair of them it crossed his mind that for some purpose of his own the marquis was seeking to gain time he drew his sword  florimond saw the act watched it and his eyes twinkled suddenly mariuss sword shot out at him he leapt back beyond the table and threw himself on guard his lips still wreathed in their mysterious smile  the time has come messieurs said he i should have preferred to know more of how you slew that monsieur de garnache but since you deny me the information i shall do my best without it ill try to conjure up his ghost to keep you entertained monsieur le capitaine and then raising his voice his sword engaging now his brothers  ola monsieur de garnache he cried to me  and then it seemed to those assassins that the marquis had been neither mad nor boastful when he had spoken of strange things he had learned beyond the alps or else it was they themselves were turned lightheaded for the doors of a cupboard at the far end of the room flew open suddenly and from between them stepped the stalwart figure of martin de garnache a grim smile lifting the corners of his mustachios a naked sword in his hand flashing back the sunlight that flooded through the window  they paused aghast and they turned ashen and then in the mind of each arose the same explanation of this phenomenon this garnache wore the appearance of the man who had announced himself by that name when he came to condillac a fortnight ago then the sallow blackhaired knave who had last night proclaimed himself as garnache in disguise was some impostor that was the conclusion they promptly arrived at and however greatly they might be dismayed by the appearance of this ally of florimonds yet the conclusion heartened them anew but scarce had they arrived at it when monsieur de garnaches crisp voice came swiftly to dispel it  monsieur le capitaine it said and fortunio shivered at the sound for it was the voice he had heard but a few hours ago i welcome the opportunity of resuming our last nights interrupted swordplay and he advanced deliberately  mariuss sword had fallen away from his brothers and the two combatants stood pausing fortunio without more ado made for the door but garnache crossed the intervening space in a bound  turn he cried turn or ill put my sword through your back the door shall serve you presently but it is odds that it will need a couple of men to bear you through it look to your dirty skin     chapter xxii the offices of mother church   a couple of hours after the engagement in the marquis de condillacs apartments at the sanglier noir at la rochette monsieur de garnache attended only by rabecque rode briskly into france once more and made for the little town of cheylas which is on the road that leads down to the valley of the isere and to condillac but not as far as the township did he journey on a hill the slopes all cultivated into an opulent vineyard some two miles east of cheylas stood the low square grey building of the convent of saint francis thither did monsieur de garnache bend his horses steps up the long white road that crept zigzag through the franciscans vineyards rode the parisian and his servant under the welcome sunshine of that november afternoon  garnaches face was gloomy and his eyes sad for his thoughts were all of valerie and he was prey to a hundred anxieties regarding her  they gained the heights at last and rabecque got down to beat with his whip upon the convent gates  a laybrother came to open and in reply to garnaches request that he might have a word with the father abbot invited him to enter  through the cloisters about the great quadrangle where a couple of monks their habits girt high as their knees were busy at gardeners work garnache followed his conductor and up the steps to the abbots chamber  the master of the convent of saint francis of cheylas a tall lean man with an ascetic face prominent cheekbones and a nose not unlike garnaches ownthe nose of a man of action rather than of prayerbowed gravely to this stalwart stranger and in courteous accents begged to be informed in what he might serve him  hat in hand garnache took a step forward in that bare scantily furnished little room permeated by the faint waxlike odour that is peculiar to the abode of conventuals without hesitation he stated the reason of his visit  father said he a son of the house of condillac met his end this morning at la rochette  the monks eyes seemed to quicken as though his interest in the outer world had suddenly revived  it is the hand of god he cried their evil ways have provoked at last the anger of heaven how did this unfortunate meet his death  garnache shrugged his shoulders  de mortuis nil nisi bonum said he his air was grave his blue eyes solemn and the abbot had little cause to suspect the closeness with which that pair of eyes was watching him he coloured faintly at the implied rebuke but he inclined his head as if submissive to the correction and waited for the other to proceed  there is the need father to give his body burial said garnache gently  but at that the monk raised his head and a deeper flush the flush of angerspread now upon his sallow cheeks garnache observed it and was glad  why do you come to me he asked  why echoed garnache and there was hesitancy now in his voice is not the burial of the dead enjoined by mother church is it not a part of your sacred office  you ask me this as you would challenge my reply said the monk shaking his head it is as you say but it is not within our office to bury the impious dead nor those who in life were excommunicate and died without repentance  how can you assume he died without repentance  i do not but i assume he died without absolution for there is no priest who knowing his name would dare to shrive him and if one should do it in ignorance of his name and excommunication why then it is not done at all bid others bury this son of the house of condillac it matters no more by what hands or in what ground he be buried than if he were the horse he rode or the hound that followed him  the church is very harsh father said garnache sternly  the church is very just the priest answered him more sternly still a holy wrath kindling his sombre eyes  he was in life a powerful noble said garnache thoughtfully it is but fitting that being dead honour and reverence should be shown his body  then let those who have themselves been honoured by the condillacs honour this dead condillac now the church is not of that number monsieur since the late marquiss death the house of condillac has been in rebellion against us our priests have been maltreated our authority flouted they paid no tithes approached no sacraments weary of their ungodliness the church placed its ban upon them under this ban it seems they die my heart grieves for them but  he spread his hands long and almost transparent in their leanness and on his face a cloud of sorrow rested  nevertheless father said garnache twenty brothers of saint francis shall bear the body home to condillac and you yourself shall head this grim procession  i the monk shrank back before him and his figure seemed to grow taller who are you sir that say to me what i shall do the churchs law despite  garnache took the abbot by the sleeve of his rough habit and drew him gently towards the window there was a persuasive smile on his lips and in his keen eyes which the monk almost unconsciously obeyed  i will tell you said garnache and at the same time i shall seek to turn you from your harsh purpose  at the hour at which monsieur de garnache was seeking to persuade the abbot of saint francis of cheylas to adopt a point of view more kindly towards a dead man madame de condillac was at dinner and with her was valerie de la vauvraye neither woman ate appreciably the one was oppressed by sorrow the other by anxiety and the circumstance that they were both afflicted served perhaps to render the dowager gentler in her manner towards the girl  she watched the pale face and troubled eyes of valerie she observed the almost lifeless manner in which she came and went as she was bidden as though a part of her had ceased to exist and that part the part that matters most it did cross her mind that in this condition mademoiselle might the more readily be bent to their will but she dwelt not overlong upon that reflection rather was her mood charitable no doubt because she felt herself the need of charity the want of sympathy  she was tormented by fears altogether disproportionate to their cause a hundred times she told herself that no ill could befall marius florimond was a sick man and were he otherwise there was still fortunio to stand by and see to it that the right sword pierced the right heart else would his pistoles be lost to him  nevertheless she was fretted by anxiety and she waited impatiently for news fuming at the delay yet knowing full well that news could not yet reach her  once she reproved valerie for her lack of appetite and there was in her voice a kindness valerie had not heard for monthsnot since the old marquis died nor did she hear it now or hearing it she did not heed it  you are not eating child the dowager said and her eyes were gentle  valerie looked up like one suddenly awakened and in that moment her eyes filled with tears it was as if the dowagers voice had opened the floodgates of her sorrow and let out the tears that hitherto had been repressed the marquise rose and waved the page and an attendant lackey from the room she crossed to valeries side and put her arm about the girls shoulder  what ails you child she asked for a moment the girl suffered the caress almost she seemed to nestle closer to the dowagers shoulder then as if understanding had come to her suddenly she drew back and quietly disengaged herself from the others arms her tears ceased the quiver passed from her lip  you are very good madame she said with a coldness that rendered the courteous words almost insulting but nothing ails me save a wish to be alone  you have been alone too much of late the dowager answered persisting in her wish to show kindness to valerie for all that had she looked into her own heart she might have been puzzled to find a reason for her moodunless the reason lay in her own affliction of anxiety for marius  perhaps i have said the girl in the same cold almost strained voice it was not by my own contriving  ah but it was child indeed it was had you been reasonable you had found us kinder we had never treated you as we have done never made a prisoner of you  valerie looked up into the beautiful ivorywhite face with its black eyes and singularly scarlet lips and a wan smile raised the corners of her gentle mouth  you had no rightnone ever gave it youto set constraint and restraint upon me  i hadindeed indeed i had the marquise answered her in a tone of sad protest your father gave me such a right when he gave me charge of you  was it a part of your charge to seek to turn me from my loyalty to florimond and endeavour to compel me by means gentle or ungentle into marriage with marius  we thought florimond dead or if not dead then certainly unworthy of you to leave you without news of him for years together and if he was not dead then it is odds he will be dead by now the words slipped out almost unconsciously and the marquise bit her lip and straightened herself fearing an explosion but none came the girl looked across the table at the fire that smouldered on the hearth in need of being replenished  what do you mean madame she asked but her tone was listless apathetic as of one who though uttering a question is incurious as to what the answer may be  we had news some days ago that he was journeying homewards but that he was detained by fever at la rochette we have since heard that his fever has grown so serious that there is little hope of his recovery  and it was to solace his last moments that monsieur marius left condillac this morning  the dowager looked sharply at the girl but valeries face continued averted her gaze resting on the fire her tone suggested nothing beyond a natural curiosity  yes said the dowager  and lest his own efforts to help his brother out of this world should prove insufficient he took captain fortunio with him said valerie in the same indifferent voice  what do you mean the marquise almost hissed into the girls ear  valerie turned to her a faint colour stirring in her white face  just what i have said madame would you know what i have prayed all night was i upon my knees from the moment that i recovered consciousness and my prayers were that heaven might see fit to let florimond destroy your son not that i desire florimonds return for i care not if i never set eyes on him again there is a curse upon this house madame the girl continued rising from her chair and speaking now with a greater animation whilst the marquise recoiled a step her face strangely altered and suddenly gone grey and i have prayed that that curse might be worked out upon that assassin marius a fine husband madame you would thrust upon the daughter of gaston de la vauvraye  and turning without waiting for an answer she moved slowly down the room and took her way to her own desolate apartments so full of memories of him she mournedof him it seemed to her she must always mourn of him who lay dead in the black waters of the moat beneath her window  stricken with a sudden inexplicable terror the dowager who for all her spirit was not without a certain superstition felt her knees loosen and she sank limply into a chair she was amazed at the extent of valeries knowledge and puzzled by it she was amazed too at the seeming apathy of valerie for the danger in which florimond stood and at her avowal that she did not care if she never again beheld him but such amazement as came to her was whelmed fathomsdeep in her sudden fears for marius if he should die she grew cold at the thought and she sat there her hands folded in her lap her face grey that mention of the curse the church had put upon them had frozen her quick blood and turned her stout spirit to mere water  at last she rose and went out into the open to inquire if no messenger had yet arrived for all that she knew there was not yet time for any messenger to have reached the chateau she mounted the winding staircase of stone that led to the ramparts and there alone in the november sunshine she paced to and fro for hours waiting for news straining her eyes to gaze up the valley of the isere watching for the horseman that must come that way then as time sped on and the sun approached its setting and still no one came she bethought her that if harm had befallen marius none would ride that night to condillac this very delay seemed pregnant with news of disaster and then she shook off her fears and tried to comfort herself there was not yet time besides what had she to fear for marius he was strong and quick and fortunio was by his side a man was surely dead by now at la rochette but that man could not be marius  at last in the distance she espied a moving object and down on the silent air of eventide came the faroff rattle of a horses hoofs some one was riding galloping that way he was returned at last she leaned on the battlements her breath coming in quick short gasps and watched the horseman growing larger with every stride of his horse  a mist was rising from the river and it dimmed the figure and she cursed the mist for heightening her anxiety for straining further her impatience then a new fear was begotten in her mind why came one horseman only where two should have ridden who was it that returned and what had befallen his companion god send at least it might be marius who rode thus at such a breakneck pace  at last she could make him out he was close to the chateau now and she noticed that his right arm was bandaged and hanging in a sling and then a scream broke from her and she bit her lip hard to keep another in check for she had seen the horsemans face and it was fortunios fortunioand wounded then assuredly marius was dead  she swayed where she stood she set her hand on her bosom above her heart as if she would have repressed the beating of the one the heaving of the other her soul sickened and her mind seemed to turn numb as she waited there for the news that should confirm her fears  the hoofs of his horse thundered over the planks of the drawbridge and came clatteringly to halt as he harshly drew rein in the courtyard below there was a sound of running feet and men sprang to his assistance madame would have gone below to meet him but her limbs seemed to refuse their office she leaned against one of the merlons of the embattled parapet her eyes on the spot where he should emerge from the stairs and thus she waited her eyes haggard her face drawn  he came at last lurching in his walk being overstiff from his long ride she took a step forward to meet him her lips parted  well she asked him and her voice sounded harsh and strained how has the venture sped  the only way it could he answered as you would wish it  at that she thought that she must faint het lungs seemed to writhe for air and she opened her lips and took long draughts of the rising mist never speaking for a moment or two until she had sufficiently recovered from this tremendous revulsion from her fears  then where is marius she asked at last  he has remained behind to accompany the body home they are bringing it here  they she echoed who are they  the monks of saint francis of cheylas he answered  a something in his tone a something in his shifty eyes a cloud upon his fair and usually so ingenuous looking countenance aroused her suspicions and gave her resurrected courage pause  she caught him viciously by the arms and forced his glance to meet her own in the fading daylight  it is the truth you are telling me fortunio she snapped and her voice was halfangry halffearful  he faced her now his eyes bold he raised a hand to lend emphasis to his words  i swear madame by my salvation that monsieur marius is sound and well  she was satisfied she released his arm  does he come tonight she asked  they will be here tomorrow madame i rode on to tell you so  an odd fancy this of his butand a sudden smile overspread her facewe may find a more useful purpose for one of these monks  an hour ago she would willingly have set mademoiselle at liberty in exchange for the assurance that marius had been successful in the business that had taken him over the border into savoy she would have done it gladly content that marius should be heir to condillac but now that condillac was assured her son she must have more for him her insatiable greed for his advancement and prosperity was again upon her now more than evernow that florimond was deadmust she have la vauvraye for marius and she thought that mademoiselle would no longer be difficult to bend the child had fallen in love with that mad garnache and when a woman is crossed in love while her grief lasts it matters little to her where she weds did she not know it out of the fund of her own bitter experience was it not thatthe compulsion her own father had employed to make her find a mate in a man so much older than herself as condillacthat had warped her own nature and done much to make her what she was  a lover she had had and whilst he lived she had resisted them and stood out against this odious marriage that for convenience sake they forced upon her he was killed in paris in a duel and when the news of it came to her she had folded her hands and let them wed her to whom they listed  of just such a dejection of spirit had she observed the signs in valerie let them profit by it while it lasted they had been long enough without church ceremonies at condillac there should be two tomorrow to make up for the empty timea wedding and a burial  she was going down the stairs fortunio a step behind her when her mind reverted to the happening at la rochette  was it well done she asked  it made some stir said he the marquis had men with him and had the affair taken place in france ill might have come of it  you shall give me a full account of it said she rightly thinking that there was still something to be explained then she laughed softly yes it was a lucky chance for us his staying at la rochette florimond was born under an unlucky star i think and you under a lucky one fortunio  i think so too as regards myself he answered grimly and he thought of the sword that had ploughed his cheek last night and pierced his swordarm that morning and he thanked such gods as in his godlessness he owned for the luck that had kept that sword from finding out his heart     chapter xxiii the judgment of garnache   on the morrow which was a friday and the tenth of novembera date to be hereafter graven on the memory of all concerned in the affairs of condillacthe dowager rose betimes and for decencys sake having in mind the business of the day she gowned herself in black  betimes too the lord seneschal rode out of grenoble attended by a couple of grooms and headed for condillac in doing whichlittle though he suspected ithe was serving nobodys interests more thoroughly than monsieur de garnaches  madame received him courteously she was in a blitheand happy mood that morningthe reaction from her yesterdays distress of mind the world was full of promise and all things had prospered with her and marius her boy was lord of condillac florimond whom she had hated and who had stood in the way of her boys advancement was dead and on his way to burial garnache the man from paris who might have made trouble for them had he ridden home again with the tale of their resistance was silenced for all time and the carp in the moat would be feasting by now upon what was left of him valerie de la vauvraye was in a dejected frame of mind that augured well for the success of the dowagers plans concerning her and by noon at latest there would be priests at condillac and if marius still wished to marry the obstinate baggage there would be no difficulty as to that  it was a glorious morning mild and sunny as an april day as though nature took a hand in the dowagers triumph and wished to make the best of its wintry garb in honour of it  the presence of this gross suitor of hers afforded her another source of satisfaction there would no longer be the necessity she once had dreaded of listening to his suit for longer than it should be her pleasure to be amused by him but when tressan spoke he struck the first note of discord in the perfect harmony which the dowager imagined existed  madame said he i am desolated that i am not a bearer of better tidings but for all that we have made the most diligent search the man rabecque has not yet been apprehended still we have not abandoned hope he added by way of showing that there was a silver lining to his cloud of danger  for just a moment madames brows were knitted she had forgotten rabecque until now but an instants reflection assured her that in forgetting him she had done him no more than such honour as he deserved she laughed as she led the way down the garden stepsthe mildness of the day and the brightness of her mood had moved her there to receive the seneschal  from the sombreness of your tone one might fear your news to be of the nature of some catastrophe what shall it signify that rabecque eludes your men he is but a lackey after all  true said the seneschal very soberly but do not forget i beg that he is the bearer of letters from one who is not a lackey  the laughter went out of her face at that here was something that had been lost sight of in the allabsorbing joy of other things in calling the forgotten rabecque to mind she had but imagined that it was no more than a matter of the tale he might tella tale not difficult to refute she thought her word should always weigh against a lackeys but that letter was a vastly different matter  he must be found tressan she said sharply  tressan smiled uneasily and chewed at his beard  no effort shall be spared he promised her of that you may be very sure the affairs of the province are at a standstill he added that vanity of his for appearing a man of infinite business rising even in an hour of such anxiety for to himself no less than to her was there danger should rabecque ever reach his destination with the papers garnache had said he carried  the affairs of the province are at a standstill he repeated while all my energies are bent upon this quest should we fail to have news of his capture in dauphiny we need not nevertheless despond i have sent men after him along the three roads that lead to paris they are to spare neither money nor horses in picking up his trail and effecting his capture after all i think we shall have him  he is our only danger now the marquise answered for florimond is deadof the fever she added with a sneering smile which gave tressan sensations as of cold water on his spine it were an irony of fate if that miserable lackey were to reach paris now and spoil the triumph for which we have worked so hard  it were indeed tressan agreed with her and we must see that he does not  but if he does she returned then we must stand together and with that she set her mind at ease once more her mood that morning being very optimistic  always i hope clotilde he answered and his little eyes leered up out of the dimples of fat in which they were embedded i have stood by you like a true friend in this affair is it not so  indeed do i deny it she answered half scornfully  as i shall stand by you always when the need arises you are a little in my debt concerning monsieur de garnache  ii realize it said she and she felt again as if the sunshine were gone from the day the blitheness from her heart she was moved to bid him cease leering at her and to take himself and his wooing to the devil but she bethought her that the need for him might not yet utterly be passed not only in the affair of garnachein which he stood implicated as deeply as herselfmight she require his loyalty but also in the matter of what had befallen yesterday at la rochette for despite fortunios assurances that things had gone smoothly his tale hung none too convincingly together and whilst she did not entertain any serious fear of subsequent trouble yet it might be well not utterly to banish the consideration of such a possibility and to keep the seneschal her ally against it so she told him now with as much graciousness as she could command that she fully realized her debt and when encouraged he spoke of his reward she smiled upon him as might a girl smile upon too impetuous a wooer whose impetuosity she deprecates yet cannot wholly withstand  i am a widow of six months she reminded him as she had reminded him once before her widowhood was proving a most convenient refuge it is not for me to listen to a suitor however my foolish heart may incline come to me in another six months time  and you will wed me then he bleated  by an effort her eyes smiled down upon him although her face was a trifle drawn  have i not said that i will listen to no suitor and what is that but a suitors question  he caught her hand he would have fallen on his knees there and then at her feet on the grass still wet with the nights mist but that he in time bethought him of how sadly his fine apparel would be the sufferer  yet i shall not sleep i shall know no rest no peace until you have given me an answer just an answer is all i ask i will set a curb upon my impatience afterwards and go through my period of ahprobation without murmuring say that you will marry me in six months timeat easter say  she saw that an answer she must give and so she gave him the answer that he craved and hepoor foolnever caught the ring of her voice as false as the ring of a base coin never guessed that in promising she told herself it would be safe to break that promise six months hence when the need of him and his loyalty would be passed  a man approached them briskly from the chateau he brought news that a numerous company of monks was descending the valley of the isere towards condillac a faint excitement stirred her and accompanied by tressan she retraced her steps and made for the battlements whence she might overlook their arrival  as they went tressan asked for an explanation of this cortege and she answered him with fortunios story of how things had sped yesterday at la rochette  up the steps leading to the battlements she went ahead of him with a youthful eager haste that took no thought for the corpulence and shortwindedness of the following seneschal from the heights she looked eastwards shading her eyes from the light of the morning sun and surveyed the procession which with slow dignity paced down the valley towards condillac  at its head walked the tall lean figure of the abbot of saint francis of cheylas bearing on high a silvered crucifix that flashed and scintillated in the sunlight his cowl was thrown back revealing his pale ascetic countenance and shaven head behind him came a coffin covered by a black pall and borne on the shoulders of six blackrobed black cowled monks and behind these again walked two by two some fourteen cowled brothers of the order of saint francis their heads bowed their arms folded and their hands tucked away in their capacious sleeves  it was a numerous cortege and as she watched its approach the marquise was moved to wonder by what arguments had the proud abbot been induced to do so much honour to a dead condillac and bear his body home to this excommunicated roof  behind the monks a closed carriage lumbered down the uneven mountain way and behind this rode four mounted grooms in the livery of condillac of marius she saw nowhere any sign and she inferred him to be travelling in that vehicle the attendant servants being those of the dead marquis  in silence with the seneschal at her elbow she watched the procession advance until it was at the foot of the drawbridge then while the solemn rhythm of their feet sounded across the planks that spanned the moat she turned and signing to the seneschal to follow her she went below to meet them but when she reached the courtyard she was surprised to find they had not paused as surely would have been seemly unbidden the abbot had gone forward through the great doorway and down the gallery that led to the hall of condillac already when she arrived below the coffin and its bearers had disappeared and the last of the monks was passing from sight in its wake leaning against the doorway through which they were vanishing stood fortunio idly watching that procession and thoughtfully stroking his mustachios about the yard lounged a dozen or so menatarms practically all the garrison that was left them since the fight with garnache two nights ago  after the last monk had disappeared she still remained there expectantly and when she saw that neither the carriage nor the grooms made their appearance she stepped up to fortunio to inquire into the reason of it  surely monsieur de condillac rides in that coach said she  surely fortunio answered himself looking puzzled i will go seek the reason madame meanwhile will you receive the abbot the monks will have deposited their burden  she composed her features into a fitting solemnity and passed briskly through to the hall tressan ever at her heels here she found the coffin deposited on the table its great black pall of velvet silveredged sweeping down to the floor no fire had been lighted that morning nor had the sun yet reached the windows so that the place wore a chill and gloomy air that was perhaps well attuned to the purpose that it was being made to serve  with a rare dignity her head held high she swept down the length of that noble chamber towards the abbot who stood erect as a pikestaff at the tablehead awaiting her and well was it for him that he was a man of austere habit of mind else might her majestic incomparable beauty have softened his heart and melted the harshness of his purpose  he raised his hand when she was within a swords length of him and with startling words delivered in ringing tones he broke the ponderous silence  wretched woman he denounced her your sins have found you out justice is to be done and your neck shall be bent despite your stubborn pride derider of priests despoiler of purity mocker of holy church your impious reign is at an end  tressan fell back aghast his face blenching to the lips for if justice was at hand for her as the abbot said then was justice at hand for him as well where had their plans miscarried what flaw was there that hitherto she had not perceived thus he questioned himself in his sudden panic  but the marquise was no sharer in his tremors her eyes opened a trifle wider a faint colour crept into her cheeks but her only emotions were of amazement and indignation was he mad this shaveling monk that was the question that leapt into her mind the very question with which she coldly answered his outburst  for madness only she thought fit to add could excuse such rash temerity as yours  not madness madame he answered with chill haughtinessnot madness but righteous indignation you have defied the power of holy church as you have defied the power of our sovereign lady and justice is upon you we are here to present the reckoning and see its payment made in full  she fancied he alluded to the body in the coffinthe body of her stepsonand she could have laughed at his foolish conclusions that she must account florimonds death an act of justice upon her for her impiety but her rising anger left her no room for laughter  i thought sir priest you were come to bury the dead but it rather seems you are come to talk  he looked at her long and sternly then he shook his head and the faintest shadow of a smile haunted his ascetic face  not to talk madame oh not to talk he answered slowly but to act i have come madame to liberate from this shambles the gentle lamb you hold here prisoned  at that some of the colour left her cheeks her eyes grew startled at last she began to realize that all was not as she had thoughtas she had been given to understandstill she sought to hector it from very instinct  vertudieu she thundered at him what mean you  behind her tressans great plump knees were knocking one against the other fool that he had been to come to condillac that day and to be trapped thus in her company a partner in her guilt this proud abbot who stood there uttering denunciations had some power behind him else had he never dared to raise his voice in condillac within call of desperate men who would give little thought to the sacredness of his office  what mean you she repeatedadding with a sinister smile in your zeal sir abbot you are forgetting that my men are within call  so madame are mine was his astounding answer and he waved a hand towards the array of monks all standing with bowed heads and folded arms  at that her laughter rang shrill through the chamber these poor shavelings she questioned  just these poor shavelings madame he answered and he raised his hand again and made a sign and then an odd thing happened and it struck a real terror into the heart of the marquise and heightened that which was already afflicting her fat lover tressan  the monks drew themselves erect it was as if a sudden gust of wind had swept through their ranks and set them all in motion cowls fell back and habits were swept aside and where twenty monks had stood there were standing now a score of nimble stalwart men in the livery of condillac all fully armed all grinning in enjoyment of her and tressans dismay  one of them turned aside and locked the door of the chamber but his movement went unheeded by the dowager whose beautiful eyes starting with horror were now back upon the grim figure of the abbot marvelling almost to see no transformation wrought in him  treachery she breathed in an awful voice that was no louder than a whisper and again her eyes travelled round the company and suddenly they fastened upon fortunio standing six paces from her to the right pulling thoughtfully at his mustachios and manifesting no surprise at what had taken place  in a sudden blind choler she swept round plucked the dagger from tressans belt and flung herself upon the treacherous captain he had betrayed her in some way he had delivered up condillacinto whose power she had yet had no time to think she caught him by the throat with a hand of such nervous strength as one would little have suspected from its white and delicate contour her dagger was poised in the air and the captain taken thus suddenly was palsied with amazement and could raise no hand to defend himself from the blow impending  but the abbot stepped suddenly to her side and caught her wrist in his thin transparent hand  forbear he bade her the man is but a tool  she fell backdragged back almost by the abbotpanting with rage and grief and then she noticed that during the moment that her back had been turned the pall had been swept from the coffin the sight of the bare deal box arrested her attention and for the moment turned aside her anger what fresh surprise did they prepare her  no sooner had she asked herself the question than herself she answered it and an icy hand seemed to close about her heart it was marius who was dead they had lied to her mariuss was the body they had borne to condillacthose men in the livery of her stepson  with a sudden sob in her throat she took a step towards the coffin she must see for herself one way or the other she must at once dispel this torturing doubt but ere she had taken three paces she stood arrested again her hands jerked suddenly to the height of her breast her lips parting to let out a scream of terror for the coffinlid had slowly raised and clattered over and as if to pile terror for her a figure rose from the box and sitting up looked round with a grim smile and the figure was the figure of a man whom she knew to be dead a man who had died by her contrivingit was the figure of garnache it was garnache as he had been on the occasion of his first coming to condillac as he had been on the day they had sought his life in this very room how well she knew that great hooked nose and the bright steely blue eyes the dark brown hair ashcoloured at the temples where age had paled it and the fierce reddish mustachios bristling above the firm mouth and long square chin  she stared and stared her beautiful face livid and distorted till there was no beauty to be seen in it what time the abbot regarded her coldly and tressan behind her turned almost sick with terror but not the terror of ghosts was it afflicted him he saw in garnache a man who was still of the quicka man who by some miracle had escaped the fate to which they supposed him to have succumbed and his terror was the terror of the reckoning which that man would ask  after a moments pause as if relishing the sensation he had created garnache rose to his feet and leapt briskly to the ground there was nothing ghostly about the thud with which he alighted on his feet before her a part of her terror left her yet not quite all she saw that she had but a man to deal with yet she began to realize that this man was very terrible  garnache again she gasped  he bowed serenely his lips smiling  aye madame he told her pleasantly always garnache tenacious as a leech madame and like a leech come hither to do a little work of purification  her eyes now kindling again as she recovered from her recent fears sought fortunios shifty glance garnache followed it and read what was in her mind  what fortunio has done said he he has done by your sons authority and sanction  marius she inquired and she was almost fearful lest she should hear that by her son he meant her stepson and that marius was dead  yes marius he answered her i bent him to my will i threatened him that he and this fellow of his this comrade in arms so worthy of his master should be broken on the wheel together unless i were implicitly obeyed if they would save their lives this was their chance they were wise and they took it and thus afforded me the means of penetrating into condillac and rescuing mademoiselle de la vauvraye  then marius she left her question unfinished her hand clutching nervously at the bosom of her gown  is sound and well as fortunio truthfully will have told you but he is not yet out of my grasp nor will be until the affairs of condillac are settled for if i meet with further opposition here broken on the wheel he shall be yet i promise you  still she made a last attempt at hectoring it the long habit of mastership dies hard she threw back her head her courage revived now that she knew marius to be alive and sound  fine words she sneered but who are you that you can threaten so and promise so  i am the queenregents humble mouthpiece madame what i threaten i threaten in her name ruffle it no longer i beseech you it will prove little worth your while you are deposed madame and you had best take your deposition with dignity and calmin all friendliness do i advise it  i am not yet come so low that i need your advice she answered sourly  you may before the sun sets he answered with his quiet smile the marquis de condillac and his wife are still at la rochette waiting until my business here is done that they may come home  his wife she cried  his wife madame he has brought home a wife from italy  thenthenmarius she said no more than that maybe she had no intention of muttering even so much of her thoughts aloud but garnache caught the trend of her mind and he marvelled to see how strong a habit of thought can be at once upon hearing of the marquiss marriage her mind had flown back to its wonted pondering of the possibilities of mariuss wedding valerie  but garnache dispelled such speculations  no madame said he marius looks elsewhere for a wifeunless mademoiselle of her own free will should elect to wed hima thing unlikely then with a sudden change to sternnessmademoiselle de la vauvraye is well madame he asked  she nodded her head but made no answer in words he turned to fortunio  go fetch her he bade the captain and one of the men unlocked the door to let fortunio out upon that errand  the parisian took a turn in the apartment and came close to tressan he nodded to the seneschal with a friendliness that turned him sick with fright  well met my dear lord seneschal i am rejoiced to find you here had it been otherwise i must have sent for you there is a little matter to be settled between us you may depend upon me to settle it to your present satisfaction if to your future grief and with a smile he passed on leaving the seneschal too palsied to answer him too stricken to disclaim his share in what had taken place at condillac  you have terms to make with me the marquise questioned proudly  certainly he answered with his grim courtesy upon your acceptance of those terms shall depend mariuss life and your own future liberty  what are they  that within the hour all your peopleto the last scullionshall have laid down their arms and vacated condillac  it was beyond her power to refuse  the marquis will not drive me forth she half affirmed half asked  the marquis madame has no power in this matter it is for the queen to deal with your insubordinationfor me as the queens emissary  if i consent monsieur what then  he shrugged his shoulders and smiled quietly  there is no if madame consent you must willingly or unwillingly to make sure of that have i come back thus and with force but should you deliver battle you will be worstedand it will be very ill for you bid your men depart as i have told you and you also shall have liberty to go hence  aye but whither she cried in a sudden frenzy of anger  i realize madame from what i know of your circumstances that you will be wellnigh homeless you should have thought of how one day you might come to be dependent upon the marquis de condillacs generosity before you set yourself to conspire against him before you sought to encompass his death you can hardly look for generosity at his hands now and so you will be all but homeless unless he paused and his eyes strayed to tressan and were laden with a sardonic look  you take a very daring tone with me she told him you speak to me as no man has ever dared to speak  when the power was yours madame you dealt with me as none has ever dared to deal the advantage now is mine behold how i use it in your own interests observe how generously i shall deal with you who deal in murder monsieur de tressan he called briskly the seneschal started forward as if some one had prodded him suddenly  mumonsieur said he  with you too will i return good for evil come hither  the seneschal approached wondering what was about to take place the marquise watched his coming a cold glitter in her eye forkeener of mental vision than tressanshe already knew the hideous purpose that was in garnaches mind  the soldiers grinned the abbot looked on with an impassive face  the marquise de condillac is likely to be homeless henceforth said the parisian addressing the seneschal will you not be gallant enough to offer her a home monsieur de tressan  will i gasped tressan scarce daring to believe his own ears his eyes staring with a look that was almost one of vacancy madame well knows how readily  oho crowed garnache who had been observing madames face she knows then do so monsieur and on that condition i will forget your indiscretions here i pledge you my word that you shall not be called to further account for the lives that have been lost through your treachery and want of loyalty provided that of your own free will you lay down your seneschalship of dauphiny an office which i cannot consent to see you filling hereafter  tressan stared from the dowager to garnache and back to the dowager she stood there as if garnaches words had turned her into marble bereft of speech through very rage and then the door opened and mademoiselle de la vauvraye entered followed closely by fortunio  at sight of garnache she stood still set her hand on her heart and uttered a low cry was it indeed garnache she sawgarnache her brave knighterrant he looked no longer as he had looked during those days when he had been her gaoler but he looked as she liked to think of him since she had accounted him dead he advanced to meet her a smile in his eyes that had something wistful in it he held out both hands to her and she took them and there under the eyes of all before he could snatch them away she had stooped and kissed them whilst a murmur of thank god thank god escaped from her lips to heaven  mademoiselle mademoiselle he remonstrated when it was too late to stay her you must not it is not seemly in me to allow it  he saw in the act no more than an expression of the gratitude for what he had done to serve her and for the risk in which his life had been so willingly placed in that service under the suasion of his words she grew calm again then suddenly a fear stirred her once more in that place where she had known naught but fears  why are you here monsieur you have come into danger again  no no he laughed these are my own men at least for the time being i am come in power this time to administer justice what shall be done with this lady mademoiselle he asked and knowing well the merciful sweetness of the girls soul he added speak now her fate shall rest in your hands  valerie looked at her enemy and then her eyes strayed round the room and took stock of the men standing there in silence of the abbot who still remained at the tablehead a pale scarceinterested spectator of this odd scene  the change had come so abruptly a few minutes ago she had been still a prisoner suffering tortures at having heard that marius was to return that day and that willynilly she must wed him now and now she was free it seemed her champion was returned in power and he stood bidding her decide the fate of her late oppressors  madames face was ashen she judged the girl by her own self she had no knowledge of any such infinite sweetness as that of this childs nature a sweetness that could do no hurt to any death was what the marquise expected since she knew that death would she herself have pronounced had the positions been reversed but  let her go in peace monsieur she heard mademoiselle say and she could not believe but that she was being mocked and as if mockery were at issue garnache laughed  we will let her go mademoiselleyet not quite her own way you must not longer remain unrestrained madame he told the marquise natures such as yours need a mans guidance i think you will be sufficiently punished if you wed this rash monsieur de tressan just as he will be sufficiently punished later when disillusionment follows his present youthful ardour make each other happy then and he waved his arms from one to the other our good father here will tie the knot at once and then my lord seneschal you may bear home your bride her son shall follow you  but the marquise blazed out now she stamped her foot and her eyes seemed to have taken fire  never sir never in life she cried i will not be so constrained i am the marquise de condillac monsieur do not forget it  i am hardly in danger of doing that it is because i remember it that i urge you to change your estate with all dispatch and cease to be the marquise de condillac that same marquise has a heavy score against her let her evade payment by this metamorphosis i have opened for you madame a door through which you may escape  you are insolent she told him by god sir i am no baggage to be disposed of by the will of any man  at that garnache himself took fire her anger proved as the steel smiting the flint of his own nature and one of his fierce bursts of blazing passion whirled about her head  and what of this child here he thundered what of her madame was she a baggage to be disposed of by the will of any man or woman yet you sought to dispose of her against her heart against her nature against her plighted word enough said he barked and so terrific was his mien and voice that the stoutspirited dowager was cowed and recoiled as he advanced a step in her direction get you married take you this man to husband you who with such calmness sought to drive others into unwilling wedlock do it madame and do it now or by the heaven above us you shall come to paris with me and youll not find them nice there it will avail you little to storm and shout at them that you are marquise de condillac as a murderess and a rebel shall you be tried and as both or either it is odds you will be broken on the wheeland your son with you so make your choice madame  he ceased valerie had caught him by the arm at once his fury fell from him he turned to her  what is it child  do not compel her if she will not wed him said she i knowandshe did nothow terrible a thing it is  nay patience child he soothed her smiling now his smile as the sunshine that succeeds a thunderstorm  it is none so bad with her she is but coy they had plighted their troth already so it seems besides i do not compel her she shall marry him of her own free willor else go to paris and stand her trial and the consequences  they had plighted their troth do you say  wellhad you not monsieur le seneschal  we had monsieur said tressan with conscious pride and for myself i am ready for these immediate nuptials  then in gods name let madame give us her answer now we have not the day to waste  she stood looking at him her toe tapping the ground her eyes sullenly angry and in the end halffainting in her great disdain she consented to do his will paris and the wheel formed too horrible an alternative besides even if that were spared her there was but a hovel in touraine for her and tressan for all his fat ugliness was wealthy  so the abbot who had lent himself to the mummery of coming there to read a burial service made ready now by order of the queens emissary to solemnize a wedding  it was soon done fortunio stood sponsor for tressan and garnache himself insisted upon handing the lord seneschal his bride a stroke of irony which hurt the proud lady of condillac more than all her sufferings of the past halfhour  when it was over and the dowager marquise de condillac had been converted into the comtesse de tressan garnache bade them depart in peace and at once  as i have promised you shall be spared all prosecution monsieur de tressan he assured the seneschal at parting but you must resign at once the kings seneschalship of dauphiny else will you put me to the necessity of having you deprived of your officeand that might entail unpleasant consequences  they went madame with bowed head her stubborn pride broken at last as the abbot of saint francis had so confidently promised her after them went the abbot and the lackeys of florimond and fortunio went with these to carry out garnaches orders that the men of the dowagers garrison be sent packing at once leaving with the parisian in the great hall just mademoiselle de la vauvraye     chapter xxiv saint martins eve   uneasy in his mind seeking some way to tell the thing and acquit himself of the painful task before him garnache took a turn in the apartment  mademoiselle leaned against the table which was still burdened by the empty coffin and observed him his ponderings were vain he could find no way to tell his story she had said that she did not exactly love this florimond that her loyalty to him was no more than her loyalty to her fathers wishes nevertheless he thought what manner of hurt must not her pride receive when she learned that florimond had brought him home a wife garnache was full of pity for her and for the loneliness that must be hers hereafter mistress of a vast estate in dauphiny alone and friendless and he was a little sorry for himself and the loneliness which he felt would be his hereafter but that was by the way  at last it was she herself who broke the silence  monsieur she asked him and her voice was strained and husky were you in time to save florimond  yes mademoiselle he answered readily glad that by that question she should have introduced the subject i was in time  and marius she inquired from what i heard you say i take it that he has suffered no harm  he has suffered none i have spared him that he might participate in the joy of his mother at her union with monsieur de tressan  i am glad it was so monsieur tell me of it her voice sounded formal and constrained  but either he did not hear or did not heed the question  mademoiselle he said slowly florimond is coming  florimond she broke in and her voice went shrill as if with a sudden fear her cheeks turned white as chalk the thing that for months she had hoped and prayed for was come at last and it struck her almost dead with terror  he remarked the change and set it down to a natural excitement he paused a moment then  he is still at la rochette but he does no more than wait until he shall have learned that his stepmother has departed from condillac  butwhywhy was he then in no haste to come to me she inquired her voice faltering  he is he stopped and tugged at his mustachios his eyes regarding her sombrely he was close beside her now where he had halted and he set his hand gently upon her shoulder looked down into that winsome little oval face she raised to his  mademoiselle he inquired would it afflict you very sorely if you were not destined after all to wed the lord of condillac  afflict me she echoed the very question set her gasping with hope nono monsieur it would not afflict me  that is true that is really really true he cried and his tone seemed less despondent  dont you know how true it is she said in such accents and with such a shy upward look that something seemed suddenly to take garnache by the throat the blood flew to his cheeks he fancied an odd meaning in those words of hersa meaning that set his pulses throbbing faster than joy or peril had ever set them yet then he checked himself and deep down in his soul he seemed to hear a peal of mocking laughterjust such a burst of sardonic mirth as had broken from his lips two nights ago when on his way to voiron then he went back to the business he had in hand  i am glad it is so with you he said quietly because florimond has brought him home a wife  the words were out and he stood back as stands a man who having cast an insult prepares to ward the blow he expects in answer he had looked for a storm a wild frantic outburst the lightning of flashing angry eyes the thunder of outraged pride instead here was a gentle calm a wan smile overspreading her sweet pale face and then she hid that face in her hands buried face and hands upon his shoulder and fell to weeping very quietly  this he thought was almost worse than the tempest he had looked for how was he to know that these tears were the overflow of a heart that was on the point of bursting from sheer joy he patted her shoulder he soothed her  little child he whispered in her ear what does it matter you did not really love him he was all unworthy of you do not grieve child so so that is better  she was looking up at him smiling through the tears that suffused er eyes  i am weeping for joy monsieur said she  for joy quoth he vertudieu there is no end to the things a woman weeps for  unconsciously instinctively almost she nestled closer to him and again his pulses throbbed again that flush came to overspread his lean countenance very softly he whispered in her ear  will you go to paris with me mademoiselle  he meant by that question no more than to ask whether now that here in dauphiny she would be friendless and alone it were not better for her to place herself under the care of the queenregent but what blame to her if she misunderstood the question if she read in it the very words her heart was longing to hear from him the very gentleness of his tone implied his meaning to be the one she desired she raised her hazel eyes again to his she nestled closer to him and then with a shy fluttering of her lids a delicious red suffusing her virgin cheek she answered very softly  i will go anywhere with you monsieuranywhere  with a cry he broke from her there was no fancying now no possibility of misunderstanding he saw how she had misread his question how she had delivered herself up to him in answer his almost roughness startled her and she stared at him as he stamped down the apartment and back to where she stood seeking in vain to master the turbulence of his feelings he stood still again he took her by the shoulders and held her at arms length before him thus surveying her and there was trouble in his keen eyes  mademoiselle mademoiselle he cried valerie my child what are you saying to me  what would you have me say she asked her eyes upon the floor was i too forward it seemed to me there could not be question of such a thing between us now i belong to you what man has ever served a woman as you have served me what better friend what nobler lover did ever woman have why then need i take shame at confessing my devotion  he swallowed hard and there was a mist before his eyeseyes that had looked unmoved on many a scene of carnage  you know not what you do he cried out and his voice was as the voice of one in pain i am old  old she echoed in deep surprise and she looked up at him as if she sought evidence of what he stated  aye old he assured her bitterly look at the grey in my hair the wrinkles in my face i am no likely lover for you child youll need a lusty comely young gallant  she looked at him and a faint smile flickered at the corners of her lips she observed his straight handsome figure his fine air of dignity and of strength every inch a man was he never lived there one who was more a man and what more than such a man could any maid desire  you are all that i would have you she answered him and in his mind he almost cursed her stubbornness her want of reason  i am peevish and crossgrained he informed her and i have grown old in ignorance of womans ways love has never come to me until now what manner of lover think you can i make  her eyes were on the windows at his back the sunshine striking through them seemed to give her the reply she sought  tomorrow will be saint martins day she told him yet see with a warmth the sun is shining  a poor makebelieve saint martins summer said he i am fitly answered by your allegory  oh not makebelieve not makebelieve she exclaimed there is no makebelieve in the suns brightness and its warmth we see it and we feel it and we are none the less glad of it because the time of year should be november rather do we take the greater joy in it and it is not yet november in your life not yet by many months  what you say is apt perhaps said he and may seem more apt than it is since my name is martin though i am no saint then he shook off this mood that he accounted selfish this mood that would take heras the wolf takes the lambwith no thought but for his own hunger  no no he cried out it were unworthy in me  when i love you martin she asked him gently  a moment he stared at her as if through those clear eyes he would penetrate to the very depths of her maiden soul then he sank on to his knees before her as any stripling lover might have done and kissed her hands in token of the fact that he was conquered
