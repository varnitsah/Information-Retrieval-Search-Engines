he shakes hands and goes out followed by harris       when the door is dosed builder stands a moment quite still with a      gratified smile on his face then turns and scrutinises himself in      the glass over the hearth  while he is doing so the door from the      diningroom is opened quietly and camille comes in  builder      suddenly seeing her reflected in the mirror turns  builder  what is

that womanshes a tantalizer       he compresses his lips and is settling back into his chair when      the door from the hall is opened and his daughter maud comes in a      pretty girl rather pale with fine eyes  though her face has a      determined cast her manner at this moment is by no means decisive      she has a letter in her hand and advances rather as if she were      stalking her father who after a hallo maud has begun to read      his paper  maud  getting as far as the table  father  builder  not lowering the paper  well  i know that tone  what do you wantmoney  maud  i always want money of course butbut  builder  pulling out a noteabstractedly  heres five pounds for you       maud advancing takes it then seems to find what she has come for      more on her chest than ever  builder  unconscious  will you take a letter for me       maud sits down left of table and prepares to take down the letter  dictating dear mr mayorreferring to your call this morning i have ergiven the matter very careful consideration and though somewhat reluctant  maud  are you really reluctant father  builder  go onto assume greater responsibilities i feel it my duty to come forward in accordance with your wish  theerhonour is one of which i hardly feel myself worthy but you may rest assured  maud  worthy  but you do you know  builder  look here  are you trying to get a rise out of mebecause you wont succeed this morning  maud  i thought you were trying to get one out of me  builder  well how would you express it  maud  i know im the best man for the place and so do you  builder  the disrespect of you young people is something extraordinary and that reminds me where do you go every evening now after tea  maud  ii dont know  builder  come now that wont doyoure never in the house from six to seven  maud  well  it has to do with my education  builder  why you finished that two years ago  maud  well call it a hobby if you like then father       she takes up the letter she brought in and seems on the point of      broaching it  builder  hobby  well what is it  maud  i dont want to irritate you father  builder  you cant irritate me more than by having secrets  see what that led to in your sisters case  and by the way im going to put an end to that this morning  youll be glad to have her back wont you  maud  startled  what  builder  your mother and i are going round to athene at twelve oclock i shall make it up with her  she must come back here  maud  aghast but hiding it  oh  itsits no good father  she wont  builder  we shall see that  ive

this morning  its all nonsense a familys a family  maud  more and more disturbed but hiding it  father if i were you i wouldntreally  its notdignified  builder  you can leave me to judge of that  its not dignified for the mayor of this town to have an unmarried daughter as young as athene living by herself away from home  this idea that shes on a visit wont wash any longer  now finish that letterworthy but you may rest assured that i shall do my best to sustain theerdignity of the office maud types desperately  got that  anderpreserve the tradition so worthily  no  so staunchlyerer  maud  upheld  builder  ah  upheld by yourselffaithfully yours  maud  finishing  father you thought athene went off in a huff  it wasnt that a bit  she always meant to go  she just got you into a rage to make it easier  she hated living at home  builder  nonsense  why on earth should she  maud  well she did  and so do checking herself  and so you see itll only make you ridiculous to go  builder  rises  now whats behind this maud  maud  behindoh  nothing  builder  the fact is you girls have been spoiled and you enjoy twisting my tail but you cant make me roar this morning  im too pleased with things  youll see itll be all right with athene  maud  very suddenly  father  builder  grimly humorous  well  get it off your chest  whats that letter about  maud  failing again and crumpling the letter behind her back oh nothing  builder  everythings nothing this morning  do you know what sort of people athene associates with nowi suppose you see her  maud  sometimes  builder  well  maud  nobody much  there isnt anybody here to associate with  its all hopelessly behind the times  builder  oh you think so  thats the inflammatory fiction you pick up i tell you what young womanthe sooner you and your sister get rid of your silly notions about not living at home and making your own way the sooner youll both get married and make it  men dont like the new spirit in womenthey may say they do but they dont  maud  you dont father i know  builder  well im very ordinary  if you keep your eyes open youll soon see that  maud  men dont like freedom for anybody but themselves  builder  thats not the way to put it  tapping out his pipe  women in your class have never had to face realities  maud  no but we want to  builder  goodhumouredly  well ill bet you what you like athenes dose of reality will have cured her  maud  and ill bet youno i wont  builder  youd better not  athene will come home and only too glad to do it  ring for topping and order the car at twelve       as he opens the door to pass out maud starts forward but checks      herself  maud  looking at her watch  halfpast eleven  good heavens       she goes to the bell and rings  then goes back to the table and      writes an address on a bit of paper       topping enters right  topping  did you ring miss  maud  with the paper  yes  look here topping  can you manage on your bicyclenow at once  i want to send a

   kitchen  she reappears with a bread pan which she deposits in the      centre of the room then crosses again to the bedroom and once more      reappears with a clothes brush two hair brushes and a norfolk      jacket  as she stuffs all these into the bread pan and bears it      back into the kitchen there is the sound of a car driving up and      stopping  annie reappears at the kitchen door

dutchpretty little figure  staring round  hm  extraordinary girls are  fancy athene preferring this to home  what  mrs builder  i didnt say anything  builder  placing a chair for his wife and sitting down himself  well we must wait i suppose  confound that nixon legacy  if athene hadnt had that potty little legacy left her she couldnt have done this well i daresay its all spent by now  i made a mistake to lose my temper with her  mrs builder  isnt it always a mistake to lose ones temper  builder  thats very nice and placid sort of thing you women who live sheltered lives can say  i often wonder if you women realise the strain on a business man  mrs builder  in her softly ironical voice  it seems a shame to add the strain of family life  builder  youve always been so passive  when i want a thing ive got to have it  mrs builder  ive noticed that  builder  with a short laugh  odd if you hadnt in twentythree years touching a canvas standing against the chair with his toe  art  just a pretext  we shall be having maud wanting to cut loose next  shes very restive  still i oughtnt to have had that scene with athene  i ought to have put quiet pressure       mrs builder smiles  builder  what are you smiling at       mrs builder shrugs her shoulders  look at thiscigarettes  he examines the brand on the box strong veryand not good  he opens the door  kitchen  he shuts it crosses and opens the door right  bedroom  mrs builder  to his disappearing form  do you think you ought john       he has disappeared and she ends with an expressive movement of her      hands a long sigh and a closing of her eyes  builders peremptory      voice is heard julia  what now       she follows into the bedroom  the maid annie puts her head out of      the kitchen door she comes out a step as if to fly then at      builders voice shrinks back into the kitchen  builder reappearing with a razor strop in one hand and a shavingbrush in the other is followed by mrs builder  builder  explain these  my god  wheres that girl  mrs builder  john  dont  getting between him and the kitchen door its not dignified  builder  i dont care a damn  mrs builder  john you mustnt  athene has the tiny beginning of a moustache you know  builder  what  i shall stay and clear this up if i have to wait a week men who let their daughters  this age is the limit  he makes a vicious movement with the strop as though laying it across someones back  mrs builder  she would never stand that  even wives object nowadays  builder  grimly  the wars upset everything  women are utterly out of hand  why the deuce doesnt she come  mrs builder  suppose you leave me here to see her  builder  ominously  this is my job  mrs builder  i think its more mine  builder  dont stand there opposing everything i say  ill go and have another lookhe is going towards the bedroom when the sound of a latchkey in the outer door arrests him  he puts the strop and brush behind his back and adds in a low voice  here she is       mrs builder has approached him and they have both turned towards      the opening door  guy herringhame comes in  they are a little out      of his line of sight and he has shut the door before he sees them      when he does his mouth falls open and his hand on to the knob of      the door  he is a comely young man in harris tweeds  moreover he      is smoking  he would speak if he could but his surprise is too      excessive  builder  well sir  guy  recovering a little i was about to say the same to you sir  builder  very red from repression  these rooms are not yours are they  guy  nor

musical voice with a slight lisp  athene  oh  how are you mother dear  this is rather a surprise father always keeps his word so i certainly didnt expect him  she looks steadfastly at builder but does not approach  builder  controlling himself with an effort  now athene whats this  athene  whats what  builder  the strop held out  are you married to thisthis  athene  quietly  to all intents and purposes  builder  in law  athene  no  builder  my god  youyou  athene  father dont call names please  builder  why arent you married to him  athene  do you want a lot of reasons or the real one

builder  dont be impudent  my patience is at breakingpoint i warn you  athene  im perfectly serious father  i tell you we meant to marry but so far i havent been able to bring myself to it  you never noticed how we children have watched you  builder  me  athene  yes  you and mother and other things all sorts of things  builder  taking out a handkerchief and wiping his brow  i really think youre mad  athene  im sure you must dear  builder  dont dear me  what have you noticed  dyou mean im not a good husband and father  athene  look at mother  i suppose you cant now youre too used to her  builder  of course im used to her  what else is marrying for  athene  that and the production of such as me  and it isnt good enough father  you shouldnt have set us such a perfect example  builder  youre talking the most arrant nonsense i ever heard  he lifts his hands  ive a good mind to shake it out of you  athene  shall i call guy       he drops his hands  confess that being a good husband and father has tried you terribly  it has us you know  builder  taking refuge in sarcasm when youve quite done being funny perhaps youll tell me why youve behaved like a common street flapper  athene  simply  i couldnt bear to think of guy as a family man thats allabsolutely  its not his fault hes been awfully anxious to be one  builder  youve disgraced us then thats what it comes to  athene  i dont want to be unkind but youve brought it on yourself  builder  genuinely distracted  i cant even get a glimmer of what you mean  ive never been anything but firm  impatient perhaps  im not an angel no ordinary healthy man is  ive never grudged you girls any comfort or pleasure  athene  except wills of our own  builder  what do you want with wills of your own till youre married  athene  you

when guys in the right mothers fortyone and twentythree years of that shes been your wife its a long time father  dont you ever look at her face  builder  troubled in a remote way  rubbish  athene  i didnt want my face to get like that  builder  with such views about marriage what business had you to go near a man  come now  athene  because i fell in love  builder  love leads to marriageand to nothing else but the streets what an example to your sister  athene  you dont know maud any more than you knew me  shes got a will of her own too i can tell you  builder  now look here athene  its

typewriter  she sits facing the audience with her hands      stretched over the keys  maud  to herself  i must get that expression       her face assumes a furtive listening look  then she gets up      whisks to the mirror over the fireplace scrutinises the expression      in it and going back to the table sits down again with hands      outstretched above the keys and an accentuation of the expression      the door up left is opened and topping appears  he looks at maud      who just turns her eyes  topping  lunch has been ready some time miss maud  maud  i dont want any lunch  did you

point topping its psychological  topping  indeed miss  maud  should i naturally put my hand on them or would there be a reaction quick enough to stop me  you see im aloneand the point is whether the

there go we  mayor  harris go out and bring them in yourself dont let the servants       harris goes out left  the mayor takes the upper chair behind the      bureau sitting rather higher because of the book than chantrey who      takes the lower  now that they are in the seats of justice a sort      of reticence falls on them as if they were afraid of giving away      their attitudes of mind to some unseen presence  mayor  suddenly  hm  chantrey  touch of frost  birds ought to come well to the gunsno wind  i like these october days  mayor  i think i ear them  hm       chantrey drops his eyeglass and puts on a pair of grandfather      spectacles  the mayor clears his throat and takes up a pen  they      neither of them look up as the door is opened and a little      procession files in  first harris then ralph builder athene      herringhame maud mrs builder sergeant martin carrying a heavy      malacca cane with a silver knob john builder and the constable      moon a young man with one black eye  no funeral was ever attended      by mutes so solemn and dejected  they stand in a sort of row  mayor  without looking up  sit down ladies sit down       harris and herringhame succeed in placing the three women in chairs      ralph builder also sits  herringhame stands behind  john builder      remains standing between the two policemen  his face is unshaved      and menacing but he stands erect staring straight at the mayor      harris goes to the side of the bureau back to take down the      evidence  mayor  charges  sergeant  john builder of the cornerways breconridge contractor and justice of the peace charged with assaulting his daughter maud builder by striking her with a stick in the presence of constable moon and two other persons also with resisting constable moon in the execution of his duty and injuring his eye  constable moon  moon  stepping forwardone twolike an automaton and saluting in river road yesterday afternoon your worship about threethirty pm i was attracted by a young woman callin constable outside a courtyard on hearing the words follow me quick i followed her to a painters studio inside the courtyard where i found three persons in the act of disagreement  no sooner ad i appeared than the defendant who was engaged in draggin a woman towards the door turns to the young woman who accompanied me with violence  you dare father she says whereupon he hit her twice with the stick the same which is produced in the presence of myself and the two other persons which im given to understand is his wife and other daughter  mayor  yes never mind what youre given to understand  moon  no sir  the party struck turns to me and says come in  i give this man in charge for assault  i moves accordingly with the words i saw you  come along with me  the defendant turns to me sharp and says you stupid loutim a magistrate  come off it i says to the best of my recollection  you struck this woman in my presence i says and you come along   we were then at close quarters  the defendant gave me a push with the words get out you idiot  not at all i replies and took old of his arm  a struggle ensues in the course of which i receives the black eye which i herewith produce  he touches his eye with awful solemnity       the mayor clears his throat chantreys eyes goggle harris bends      over and writes rapidly  during the struggle your worship a young man has appeared on the scene and at the instigation of the young woman the same who was assaulted assists me in securing the prisoner whose language and resistance was violent in the extreme  we placed him in a cab which we found outside and i conveyed him to the station  chantrey  what was hiserconduct in theercab  moon  he sat quiet  chantrey  that seems  moon  seein i had his further arm twisted behind him  mayor looking at builder any questions to ask him       builder makes not the faintest sign and the mayor drops his glance  mayor  sergeant       moon steps back two paces and the sergeant steps two paces forward  sergeant  at ten minutes to four your worship yesterday afternoon constable moon brought the defendant to the station in a fourwheeled cab  on his recounting the circumstances of the assault they were taken down and read over to the defendant with the usual warning  the defendant said nothing  in view of the double assault and the condition of the constables eye and in the absence of the superintendent i thought it my duty to retain the defendant for the night  mayor  the defendant said nothing  sergeant  he as not opened his lips to my knowledge your worship from that hour to this  mayor  any questions to ask the sergeant  builder continues to stare at the mayor without a word  mayor  very well       the mayor and chantrey now consult each other inaudibly and the      mayor nods  mayor  miss maud builder will you tell us what you know of thiser occurrence  maud  rising with eyes turning here and there must i  mayor  im afraid you must  maud  after a look at her father who never turns his eyes from the mayors face ii wish to withdraw the charge of striking me please ii never meant to make it  i was in a temperi saw red  mayor  i see  aa domestic disagreement  very well that charge is withdrawn  you do not appear to have been hurt and that seems to me quite proper  now tell me what you know of the assault on the constable  is his account correct  maud  timidly  yeyes  only  mayor  yes  tell us the truth  maud  resolutely  only i dont think my father hit the constable i think the stick did that  mayor  oh the stick  buterthe stick was in is and wasnt it  maud  yes but i mean my father saw red and the constable saw red and the stick flew up between them and hit him in the eye  chantrey  and then he saw black  mayor  with corrective severity  but did e it im with the stick  maud  nono  i dont think he did  mayor  then who supplied theermomentum  maud  i think there was a struggle for the cane and it flew up  mayor  hand up the cane       the sergeant hands up the cane  the mayor and chantrey examine it mayor  which enddo you suggestinflicted this injury  maud  oh the knob end sir  mayor  what do you say to that constable  moon  stepping the mechanical two paces i dont deny there was a struggle your worship but its my impression i was it  chantrey  of course you were bit we can see that  but with the cane or with the fist  moon  a little flurried iiwith the fist sir  mayor  be careful  will you swear to that  moon  with that sudden uncertainty which comes over the most honest in such circumstances  notnot so to speak in black and white your worship but that was my idea at the time  mayor  you wont swear to it  moon  ill swear he called me an idiot and a lout the words made a deep impression on me  chantrey  to himself  mort aux vaches  mayor  eh  thatll do constable stand back  now who else saw the struggle  mrs builder  youre not obliged to say anything unless you like  thats your privilege as his wife       while he is speaking the door has been opened and harris has gone      swiftly to it spoken to someone and returned  he leans forward to      the mayor  eh  wait a minute  mrs builder do you wish to give evidence  mrs builder  rising  no mr mayor       mrs builder sits  mayor  very good  to harris  now then what is it  harris says something in a low and concerned voice  the mayors face lengthens  he leans to his right and consults chantrey who gives a faint and deprecating shrug  a moments silence  mayor  this is an open court  the press have the right to attend if they wish       harris goes to the door and admits a young man in glasses of a      pleasant appearance and indicates to him a chair at the back  at      this untimely happening builders eyes have moved from side to side      but now he regains his intent and bulllike stare at his      fellowjustices  mayor  to maud  you can sit down miss builder       maud resumes her seat  miss athene builder you were present i think  athene  rising  yes sir  mayor  what do you say to this matter  athene  i didnt see anything very clearly but i think my sisters account is correct sir  mayor  is it your impression that the cane inflicted the injury  athene  in a low voice  yes  mayor  with or without deliberate intent  athene  oh  without  builder looks at her  mayor  but you were not in a position to see very well  athene  no sir  mayor  your sister having withdrawn her charge we neednt go into that very good       he motions her to sit down  athene turning her eyes on her      fathers impassive figure sits  mayor  now there was a young man  pointing to herringhame  is this the young man  moon  yes your worship  mayor  whats your name  guy  guy herringhame  mayor  address  guy  erthe aerodrome sir  mayor  private i mean       the moment is one of considerable tension  guy  with an effort  at the moment sir i havent one  ive just left my diggings and havent yet got any others  mayor  hm  the aerodrome  how did you come to be present  guy  ier       builders eyes go round and rest on him for a moment  its in my sisters studio that miss athene builder is at present working sir  i just happened toto turn up  mayor  did you appear on the scene as the constable says during the struggle  guy  yes sir  mayor  did he summon you to his aid  guy  yesno sir  miss maud builder did that  mayor  what do you say to this blow  guy  jerking his chin up a little  oh  i saw that clearly  mayor  well let us hear  guy  the constables arm struck the cane violently and it flew up and landed him in the eye  mayor  with a little grunt  you are sure of that  guy  quite sure sir  mayor  did you hear any language  guy  nothing out of the ordinary sir  one or two damns and blasts  mayor  you call that ordinary  guy  well hes amagistrate sir       the mayor utters a profound grunt  chantrey smiles  there is a      silence  then the mayor leans over to chantrey for a short      colloquy  chantrey  did you witness any particular violence other than a resistance to arrest  guy  no sir  mayor  with a gesture of dismissal  very well that seems to be the evidence  defendant john builderwhat do you say to all this  builder  in a voice different from any we have heard from him say what business had he to touch me a magistrate  i gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house for interfering with me for taking my wife home  mayor  that charge is not pressed and we cant go into the circumstances  what do you wish to say about your conduct towards the constable  builder  in his throat  not a damned thing  mayor  embarrassed  ii didnt catch  chantrey  nothingnothing  he  said  mr mayor  mayor  clearing his throat i understand then that you do not wish to offer any explanation  builder  i consider myself abominably treated and i refuse to say another word  mayor  drily very good  miss maud builder       maud stands up   mayor  when you spoke of the defendant seeing red what exactly did you mean  maud  i mean that my father was so angry that he didnt know what he was doing  chantrey  would you say as angry as heeris now  maud  with a faint smile  oh  much more angry  ralph builder stands up  ralph  would you allow me to say a word mr mayor  mayor  speaking of your own knowledge mr builder  ralph  in regard to the state of my brothers mindyes mr mayor  he was undoubtedly under great strain yesterday certain circumstances domestic and otherwise  mayor  you mean that he might have been as one might say beside himself  ralph  exactly sir  mayor  had you seen your brother  ralph  i had seen him shortly before this unhappy business       the mayor nods and makes a gesture so that maud and ralph sit down      then leaning over he confers in a low voice with chantrey  the      rest all sit or stand exactly as if each was the only person in the      room except the journalist who is writing busily and rather      obviously making a sketch of builder  mayor  miss athene builder       athene stands up  this young man mr herringhame i take it is a friend of the familys       a moment of some tension  athene  nno mr mayor not of my father or mother  chantrey  an acquaintance of yours  athene  yes  mayor  very good  he clears his throat  as the defendant wrongly we think refuses to offer his explanation of this matter the bench has to decide on the evidence as given  there seems to be some discrepancy as to the blow which the constable undoubtedly received  in view of this we incline to take the testimony of mr       harris prompts him  mr erringhameas the party least implicated personally in the affair and most likely to ave a cool and impartial view  that evidence is to the effect that the blow was accidental  there is no doubt however that the defendant used reprehensible language and offered some resistance to the constable in the execution of his duty  evidence as been offered that he was in an excited state of mind and it is possible i dont say that this is any palliationbut it is possible that he may have thought his position as magistrate made himer  chantrey  prompting  caesars wife  mayor  eh  we think considering all the circumstances and the fact that he has spent a night in a cell that justice will be met byer discharging him with a caution  builder  with a deeply muttered  the devil you do       walks out of the room  the journalist grabbing his pad starts up      and follows  the builders rise and huddle and with herringhame      are ushered out by harris  mayor  pulling out a large handkerchief and wiping his forehead my aunt  chantrey  these new constables mayor  i say builderll have to go damn the press how they nose everything out  the great unpaid we shall get it again  he suddenly goes off into a fit of laughter come off it i says to the best of my recollection  oh  oh i shant hit a bird all day  that poor devil builder  its no joke for him  you did it well mayor you did it well  british justice is safe in your hands  he blacked the fellows eye all right  which i herewith produce  oh my golly  it beats the band       his uncontrollable laughter and the mayors rueful appreciation are      exchanged with lightning rapidity for a preternatural solemnity as      the door opens admitting sergeant martin and the lugubrious object      of their next attentions  mayor  charges       sergeant steps forward to read the charge as       the curtain falls    scene ii       noon the same day       builders study  topping is standing by the

with inherited trouble  come are you going to be nice to him both of you  athene  were going to try  ralph  good  i dont even now understand how it happened  maud  when you went out with guy it wasnt three minutes before he came  mother had just told us aboutwell about something beastly father wanted us to go and we agreed to go out for five minutes while he talked to mother  we went and when we came back he told me to get a cab to take mother home  poor mother stood there looking like a ghost and he began hunting and hauling her towards the door  i saw red and instead of a cab i fetched that policeman  of course father did black his eye  guy was splendid  athene  you gave him the lead  maud  i couldnt help it seeing father standing there all dumb  athene  it was awful  uncle why didnt you come back with guy  maud  oh yes  why didnt you uncle  athene  when maud had gone for the cab i warned him not to use force i told him it was against the law but he only said the law be damned  ralph  well it all sounds pretty undignified  maud  yes everybody saw red       they have not seen the door opened from the hall and builder      standing there  he is still unshaven a little sunken in the face      with a glum glowering expression  he has a document in his hand      he advances a step or two and they see him  athene and maud  aghast  father  builder  ralph oblige me  see them off the premises  ralph  steady john  builder  go  maud  proudly  all right  we thought you might like to know that athenes married and that ive given up the movies  now well go       builder turns his back on them and sitting down at his      writingtable writes       after a moments whispered conversation with their uncle the two      girls go out       ralph builder stands gazing with whimsical commiseration at his      brothers back  as builder finishes writing he goes up and puts      his hand on his brothers shoulder  ralph  this is an awful jar old man  builder  heres what ive said to that fellow mr mayoryou had the effrontery today to discharge me with a cautionforsoothyour fellow magistrate  ive consulted my solicitor as to whether an action will lie for false imprisonment  im informed that it wont  i take this opportunity of saying that justice in this town is a travesty  i have no wish to be associated further with you or your fellows  but you are vastly mistaken if you imagine that i shall resign my position on the bench or the town councilyours  john builder  ralph  i saykeep your sense of humour old boy  builder  grimly  humour  ive spent a night in a cell  see this he holds out the document  it disinherits my family  ralph  john  builder  ive done with those two ladies  as to my wifeif she doesnt come back  when i suffer i make others suffer  ralph  julias very upset my dear fellow we all are  the girls came here to try and  builder  rising they may go to hell  if that lousy mayor thinks im done withhes mistaken  he rings the bell i dont want any soft sawder  im a fighter  ralph  in a low voice  the enemy stands within the gate old chap  builder  whats that  ralph  lets boss our own natures before we boss those of other people have a sleep on it john before you do anything  builder  sleep  i hadnt a wink last night  if youd passed the night i had  ralph  i hadnt many myself       topping enters  builder  take this note to the mayor with my compliments and dont bring back an answer  topping  very good sir  theres a gentleman from the comet in the hall sir  would you see him for a minute he says  builder  tell him to go to       a voice says mr builder  builder turns to see the figure of the      journalist in the hall doorway  topping goes out  journalist  advancing with his card  mr builder its very good of you to see me  i had the pleasure this morningi meani tried to reach you when you left the mayors  i thought you would probably have your own side of this unfortunate matter  we shall be glad to give it every prominence       topping has withdrawn and ralph builder at the window stands      listening  builder  drily regarding the journalist who has spoken in a pleasant and polite voice  very good of you  journalist  not at all sir  we felt that you would almost certainly have good reasons of your own which would put the matter in quite a different light  builder  good reasons  i should think so  i tell youa very little more of this libertylicence i call itand there isnt a man wholl be able to call himself head of a family  journalist  encouragingly  quite  builder  if the law thinks it can back up revolt its damned well mistaken  i struck my daughteri was in a passion as you would have been  journalist  encouraging  im sure  builder glaring at him  well i dont know that you would you look a soft sort but any man with any blood in him  journalist  can one ask what she was doing sir  we couldnt get that point quite clear  builder  doing  i just had my arm round my wife trying to induce her to come home with me after a little family tiff and this girl came at me  i lost my temper and tapped her with my cane  andthat policeman brought by my own daughtera policeman  if the law is going to enter private houses and abrogate domestic authority where the hell shall we be  journalist  encouraging  no im sureim sure  builder  the maudlin sentimentality in these days is absolutely rotting this country  a man cant be master in his own house cant require his wife to fulfil her duties cant attempt to control the conduct of his daughters without coming up against it and incurring odium  a man cant control his employees he cant put his foot down on rebellion anywhere without a lot of humanitarians and licencelovers howling at him  journalist  excellent sir excellent  builder  excellent  its damnable  here am ia man whos always tried to do his duty in private life and publicbrought up before the bench my god because i was doing that duty with a little too much zeal perhapsim not an angel  journalist  no  no of course  builder  a proper englishman never is  but there are no proper englishmen nowadays       he crosses the room in his fervour  ralph  suddenly  as i look at faces  builder  absorbed  what  i told this young man i wasnt an angel  journalist  drawing him on  yes sir i quite understand  builder  if the law thinks it can force me to be one of your weakkneed sentimentalists who let everybody do what they like  ralph  there are a good many who stand on their rights left john  builder  absorbed  what  how can men stand on their rights left  journalist  im afraid you had a painful experience sir  builder  every kind of humiliation  i spent the night in a stinking cell  i havent eaten since breakfast yesterday  did they think i was going to eat the muck they shoved in  and all because in a moment of angerwhich i regret i regreti happened to strike my daughter who was interfering between me and my wife  the thing would be funny if it werent so disgusting  a mans house used to be sanctuary  what is it now  with all the world poking their noses in  he stands before the fire with his head bent excluding as it were his interviewer and all the world  journalist  preparing to go  thank you very much mr builder  im sure i can do you justice  would you like to see a proof  builder  half conscious of him  what  journalist  or will you trust me  builder  i wouldnt trust you a yard  journalist  at the door  very well sir you shall have a proof i promise  good afternoon and thank you  builder  here       but he is gone and builder is left staring at his brother on whose      face is still that look of whimsical commiseration  ralph  take a pull old man  have a hot bath and go to bed  builder  theyve chosen to drive me to extremes now let them take the consequences  i dont care a kick what anybody thinks  ralph  sadly  well i wont worry you anymore now  builder  with a nasty laugh  no come again tomorrow  ralph  when youve had a sleep  for the sake of the family name john dont be hasty  builder  shut the stable door  no my boy the horse has gone  ralph  well well       with a lingering look at his brother who has sat down sullenly at      the writing table he goes out into the hall       builder remains staring in front of him  the diningroom door      opens and camilles head is thrust in  seeing him she draws back      but he catches sight of her  builder  here  camille comes doubtfully up to the writing table  her forehead is puckered as if she were thinking hard  builder  looking at her unsmiling  so you want to be my mistress do you       camille makes a nervous gesture  well you shall  come here  camille  not moving  you ffrighten me  builder  ive paid a pretty price for you  but youll make up for it you and others  camille  starting back  no i dont like you today  no  builder  come along  she is just within reach and he seizes her arm all my married life ive put a curb on myself for the sake of respectability  ive been a man of principle my girl as you saw yesterday  well they dont want that  he draws her close you can sit on my knee now  camille  shrinking  no i dont want to today  builder  but you shall  theyve asked for it  camille  with a supple movement slipping away from him they  what is all that  i dont want any trouble  no no i am not taking any       she moves back towards the door  builder utters a sardonic laugh  oh  you are a dangerous man  no no  not for me  goodbye sare       she turns swiftly and goes out  builder again utters his glum      laugh  and then as he sits alone staring before him perfect      silence reigns in the room  over the windowsill behind him a boys      face is seen to rise it hangs there a moment with a grin spreading      on it  boys voice  sotto  johnny builder       as builder turns sharply it vanishes  oo beat is wife       builder rushes to the window  boys voice  more distant and a little tentative  johnny builder  builder  you little devil  if i catch you ill wring your blasted little neck  boys voice  a little distant oo blacked the coppers eye       builder in an ungovernable passion seizes a small flowerpot from      the sill and dings it with all his force  the sound of a crash  boys voice  very distant  yaaah  missed       builder stands leaning out face injected with blood shaking his      fist       the curtain falls for a few seconds    scene iii  evening the same day       builders study is dim and neglectedlooking the window is still      open though it has become night  a street lamp outside shines in      and the end of its rays fall on builder asleep  he is sitting in a      high chair at the fireside end of the writingtable with his elbows      on it and his cheek resting on his hand  he is still unshaven and      his clothes unchanged  a boys head appears above the level of the      windowsill as if beheaded and fastened there  boys voice  in a forceful whisper  johnny builder       builder stirs uneasily  the boys head vanishes  builder raising      his other hand makes a sweep before his face as if to brush away a      mosquito  he wakes  takes in remembrance and sits a moment      staring gloomily before him  the door from the hall is opened and      topping comes in with a long envelope in his hand  topping  approaching  from the comet sir  proof of your interview sir will you please revise the messenger says he wants to take it back at once  builder  taking it  all right  ill ring  topping  shall i close in sir  builder  not now       topping withdraws  builder turns up a standard lamp on the table      opens the envelope and begins reading the galley slip  the signs      of uneasiness and discomfort grow on him   builder  did i say that  muck muck  he drops the proof sits a moment moving his head and rubbing one hand uneasily on the surface of the table then reaches out for the telephone receiver town 245 pause the comet  john builder  give me the editor  pause that you mr editor  john builder

muck  im tearing it up goodnight  he replaces the receiver and touches a bell then taking up the galley slip he tears it viciously across into many pieces and rams them into the envelope       topping enters  here give this to the messengersharp and tell him to run with it  topping  whose hand can feel the condition of the contents with a certain surprise  yes sir       he goes with a look back from the door  the mayor is here sir  i dont know whether you would wish       builder rising takes a turn up and down the room  builder  nor do i  yes ill see him       topping goes out and builder stands over by the fender with his      head a little down  topping  reentering  the mayor sir       he retires up left  the mayor is overcoated and carries of all      things a top hat  he reaches the centre of the room before he      speaks  mayor  embarrassed  well builder  builder  well  mayor  come  that caution of mine was quite parliamentary  i ad to save face you know  builder  and what

bench has got a name to keep upmust stand well in the peoples eyes  as it is i sailed very near the wind suppose we had an ordinary person up before us for striking a woman  builder  i didnt strike a womani struck my daughter  mayor  well but shes not a child you know  and you did resist the police if no worse  come  youd have been the first to maintain british justice  shake ands  builder  is

never yet met a man who couldnt face another mans position  mayor  after all what is it  builder  splendid isolation  no wife no daughters no councillorship no magistracy no futurewith a laugh  not even a french maid  and why  because i tried to exercise a little wholesome family authority thats the position youre facing mayor  mayor  dear dear  youre devilish bitter builder  its unfortunate this publicity  but itll all blow over and youll be back where you were  youve a good sound practical sense underneath your temper  a pause  come now  a pause  well ill say goodnight then  builder  you shall have them in writing tomorrow  mayor  with sincerity  come  shake ands  builder after a long look holds out his hand  the two men exchange a grip       the mayor turning abruptly goes out       builder remains motionless for a minute then resumes his seat at      the side of the writing table leaning his head on his hands       the boys head is again seen rising above the level of the      windowsill and another and another follows till the three      as if decapitated heads are seen in a row  boys voices  one after another in a whispered crescendo  johnny builder  johnny builder  johnny builder       builder rises turns and stares at them  the three heads disappear      and a boys voice cries shrilly  johnny builder  builder moves      towards the window voices are now crying in various pitches and      keys johnny builder  beatey builder  beat is wifeer      beatey builder       builder stands quite motionless staring with the street lamp      lighting up a queer rather pitiful defiance on his face  the      voices swell  there comes a sudden swish and splash of water and      broken yells of dismay  toppings voice  scat  you young devils       the sound of scuffling feet and a longdrawnout and distant      miaou       builder stirs shuts the window draws the curtains goes to the      armchair before the fireplace and sits down in it       topping enters with a little tray on which is a steaming jug of      fluid some biscuits and a glass  he comes stealthily up level with      the chair  builder stirs and looks up at him  topping  excuse me sir you must ave digested yesterday mornings breakfast by nowmust live to eat sir  builder  all right  put it down  topping  putting the tray down on the table and taking up builders pipe i fair copped those young devils  builder  youre a good fellow  topping  filling the pipe  youll excuse me sir the missishas come back sir       builder stares at him and topping stops  he hands builder the      filled pipe and a box of matches  builder  with a shiver  light the fire topping  im chilly       while topping lights the fire builder puts the pipe in his mouth and      applies a match to it  topping having lighted the fire turns to      go gets as far as half way then comes back level with the table      and regards the silent brooding figure in the chair  builder  suddenly  give me that paper on the table  no the other onethe will       topping takes up the will and gives it to him  topping  with much hesitation  excuse me sir  its pluck that gets em ome sirbegging your pardon       builder has resumed his attitude and does not answer  in a voice just touched with feeling goodnight sir  builder  without turning his head  goodnight       topping has gone  builder sits drawing at his pipe between the      firelight and the light from the standard lamp  he takes the pipe      out of his mouth and a quiver passes over his face  with a half      angry gesture he rubs the back of his hand across his eyes  builder  to himself  pluck  pluck  his lips quiver again  he presses them hard together puts his pipe back into his mouth and taking the will thrusts it into the newlylighted fire and holds it there with a poker        while he is doing this the door from the hall is opened quietly and      mrs builder enters without his hearing her  she has a work bag in      her hand  she moves slowly to the table and stands looking at him      then going up to the curtains she mechanically adjusts them and      still keeping her eyes on builder comes down to the table and pours      out his usual glass of whisky toddy  builder who has become      conscious of her presence turns in his chair as she hands it to      him  he sits a moment motionless then takes it from her and      squeezes her hand  mrs builder goes silently to her usual chair      below the fire and taking out some knitting begins to knit      builder makes an effort to speak does not succeed and sits drawing      at his pipe                             the curtain falls
