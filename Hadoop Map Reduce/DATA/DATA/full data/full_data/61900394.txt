61900394	the doctors dilemma  by bernard shaw  1906   transcribers note the edition from which this play was taken was printed with no contractions thus weve is written as weve hadnt as hadnt etc there is no trailing period after mr dr etc and show is spelt shew shakespeare is shakespear   i am grateful to hesba stretton the authoress of jessicas first prayer for permission to use the title of one of her stories for this play     act i  on the 15th june 1903 in the early forenoon a medical student surname redpenny christian name unknown and of no importance sits at work in a doctors consultingroom he devils for the doctor by answering his letters acting as his domestic laboratory assistant and making himself indispensable generally in return for unspecified advantages involved by intimate intercourse with a leader of his profession and amounting to an informal apprenticeship and a temporary affiliation redpenny is not proud and will do anything he is asked without reservation of his personal dignity if he is asked in a fellowcreaturely way he is a wideopeneyed ready credulous friendly hasty youth with his hair and clothes in reluctant transition from the untidy boy to the tidy doctor  redpenny is interrupted by the entrance of an old servingwoman who has never known the cares the preoccupations the responsibilities jealousies and anxieties of personal beauty she has the complexion of a neverwashed gypsy incurable by any detergent and she has not a regular beard and moustaches which could at least be trimmed and waxed into a masculine presentableness but a whole crop of small beards and moustaches mostly springing from moles all over her face she carries a duster and toddles about meddlesomely spying out dust so diligently that whilst she is flicking off one speck she is already looking elsewhere for another in conversation she has the same trick hardly ever looking at the person she is addressing except when she is excited she has only one manner and that is the manner of an old family nurse to a child just after it has learnt to walk she has used her ugliness to secure indulgences unattainable by cleopatra or fair rosamund and has the further great advantage over them that age increases her qualification instead of impairing it being an industrious agreeable and popular old soul she is a walking sermon on the vanity of feminine prettiness just as redpenny has no discovered christian name she has no discovered surname and is known throughout the doctors quarter between cavendish square and the marylebone road simply as emmy  the consultingroom has two windows looking on queen anne street between the two is a marbletopped console with haunched gilt legs ending in sphinx claws the huge pierglass which surmounts it is mostly disabled from reflection by elaborate painting on its surface of palms ferns lilies tulips and sunflowers the adjoining wall contains the fireplace with two armchairs before it as we happen to face the corner we see nothing of the other two walls on the right of the fireplace or rather on the right of any person facing the fireplace is the door on its left is the writingtable at which redpenny sits it is an untidy table with a microscope several test tubes and a spirit lamp standing up through its litter of papers there is a couch in the middle of the room at right angles to the console and parallel to the fireplace a chair stands between the couch and the windowed wall the windows have green venetian blinds and rep curtains and there is a gasalier but it is a convert to electric lighting the wall paper and carpets are mostly green coeval with the gasalier and the venetian blinds the house in fact was so well furnished in the middle of the xixth century that it stands unaltered to this day and is still quite presentable  emmy entering and immediately beginning to dust the couch theres a lady bothering me to see the doctor  redpenny distracted by the interruption well she cant see the doctor look here whats the use of telling you that the doctor cant take any new patients when the moment a knock comes to the door in you bounce to ask whether he can see somebody  emmy who asked you whether he could see somebody  redpenny you did  emmy i said theres a lady bothering me to see the doctor that isnt asking its telling  redpenny well is the lady bothering you any reason for you to come bothering me when im busy  emmy have you seen the papers  redpenny no  emmy not seen the birthday honors  redpenny beginning to swear what the  emmy now now ducky  redpenny what do you suppose i care about the birthday honors get out of this with your chattering dr ridgeon will be down before i have these letters ready get out  emmy dr ridgeon wont never be down any more young man  she detects dust on the console and is down on it immediately  redpenny jumping up and following her what  emmy hes been made a knight mind you dont go dr ridgeoning him in them letters sir colenso ridgeon is to be his name now  redpenny im jolly glad  emmy i never was so taken aback i always thought his great discoveries was fudge let alone the mess of them with his drops of blood and tubes full of maltese fever and the like now hell have a rare laugh at me  redpenny serve you right it was like your cheek to talk to him about science he returns to his table and resumes his writing  emmy oh i dont think much of science and neither will you when youve lived as long with it as i have whats on my mind is answering the door old sir patrick cullen has been here already and left first congratulationshadnt time to come up on his way to the hospital but was determined to be firstcoming back he said all the rest will be here too the knocker will be going all day what im afraid of is that the doctorll want a footman like all the rest now that hes sir colenso mind dont you go putting him up to it ducky for hell never have any comfort with anybody but me to answer the door i know who to let in and who to keep out and that reminds me of the poor lady i think he ought to see her shes just the kind that puts him in a good temper she dusts redpennys papers  redpenny i tell you he cant see anybody do go away emmy how can i work with you dusting all over me like this  emmy im not hindering you workingif you call writing letters working there goes the bell she looks out of the window a doctors carriage thats more congratulations she is going out when sir colenso ridgeon enters have you finished your two eggs sonny  ridgeon yes  emmy have you put on your clean vest  ridgeon yes  emmy thats my ducky diamond now keep yourself tidy and dont go messing about and dirtying your hands the people are coming to congratulate you she goes out  sir colenso ridgeon is a man of fifty who has never shaken off his youth he has the offhanded manner and the little audacities of address which a shy and sensitive man acquires in breaking himself in to intercourse with all sorts and conditions of men his face is a good deal lined his movements are slower than for instance redpennys and his flaxen hair has lost its lustre but in figure and manner he is more the young man than the titled physician even the lines in his face are those of overwork and restless scepticism perhaps partly of curiosity and appetite rather than of age just at present the announcement of his knighthood in the morning papers makes him specially selfconscious and consequently specially offhand with redpenny  ridgeon have you seen the papers youll have to alter the name in the letters if you havnt  redpenny emmy has just told me im awfully glad i  ridgeon enough young man enough you will soon get accustomed to it  redpenny they ought to have done it years ago  ridgeon they would have only they couldnt stand emmy opening the door i daresay  emmy at the door announcing dr shoemaker she withdraws  a middleaged gentleman well dressed comes in with a friendly but propitiatory air not quite sure of his reception his combination of soft manners and responsive kindliness with a certain unseizable reserve and a familiar yet foreign chiselling of feature reveal the jew in this instance the handsome gentlemanly jew gone a little pigeonbreasted and stale after thirty as handsome young jews often do but still decidedly goodlooking  the gentleman do you remember me schutzmacher university college school and belsize avenue loony schutzmacher you know  ridgeon what loony he shakes hands cordially why man i thought you were dead long ago sit down schutzmacher sits on the couch ridgeon on the chair between it and the window where have you been these thirty years  schutzmacher in general practice until a few months ago ive retired  ridgeon well done loony i wish i could afford to retire was your practice in london  schutzmacher no  ridgeon fashionable coast practice i suppose  schutzmacher how could i afford to buy a fashionable practice i hadnt a rap i set up in a manufacturing town in the midlands in a little surgery at ten shillings a week  ridgeon and made your fortune  schutzmacher well im pretty comfortable i have a place in hertfordshire besides our flat in town if you ever want a quiet saturday to monday ill take you down in my motor at an hours notice  ridgeon just rolling in money i wish you rich gps would teach me how to make some whats the secret of it  schutzmacher oh in my case the secret was simple enough though i suppose i should have got into trouble if it had attracted any notice and im afraid youll think it rather infra dig  ridgeon oh i have an open mind what was the secret  schutzmacher well the secret was just two words  ridgeon not consultation free was it  schutzmacher shocked no no really  ridgeon apologetic of course not i was only joking  schutzmacher my two words were simply cure guaranteed  ridgeon admiring cure guaranteed  schutzmacher guaranteed after all thats what everybody wants from a doctor isnt it  ridgeon my dear loony it was an inspiration was it on the brass plate  schutzmacher there was no brass plate it was a shop window red you know with black lettering doctor leo schutzmacher lrcpmrcs advice and medicine sixpence cure guaranteed  ridgeon and the guarantee proved sound nine times out of ten eh  schutzmacher rather hurt at so moderate an estimate oh much oftener than that you see most people get well all right if they are careful and you give them a little sensible advice and the medicine really did them good parrishs chemical food phosphates you know one tablespoonful to a twelveounce bottle of water nothing better no matter what the case is  ridgeon redpenny make a note of parrishs chemical food  schutzmacher i take it myself you know when i feel run down goodbye you dont mind my calling do you just to congratulate you  ridgeon delighted my dear loony come to lunch on saturday next week bring your motor and take me down to hertford  schutzmacher i will we shall be delighted thank you goodbye he goes out with ridgeon who returns immediately  redpenny old paddy cullen was here before you were up to be the first to congratulate you  ridgeon indeed who taught you to speak of sir patrick cullen as old paddy cullen you young ruffian  redpenny you never call him anything else  ridgeon not now that i am sir colenso next thing you fellows will be calling me old colly ridgeon  redpenny we do at st annes  ridgeon yach thats what makes the medical student the most disgusting figure in modern civilization no veneration no mannersno  emmy at the door announcing sir patrick cullen she retires  sir patrick cullen is more than twenty years older than ridgeon not yet quite at the end of his tether but near it and resigned to it his name his plain downright sometimes rather arid common sense his large build and stature the absence of those odd moments of ceremonial servility by which an old english doctor sometimes shews you what the status of the profession was in england in his youth and an occasional turn of speech are irish but he has lived all his life in england and is thoroughly acclimatized his manner to ridgeon whom he likes is whimsical and fatherly to others he is a little gruff and uninviting apt to substitute more or less expressive grunts for articulate speech and generally indisposed at his age to make much social effort he shakes ridgeons hand and beams at him cordially and jocularly  sir patrick well young chap is your hat too small for you eh  ridgeon much too small i owe it all to you  sir patrick blarney my boy thank you all the same he sits in one of the armchairs near the fireplace ridgeon sits on the couch ive come to talk to you a bit to redpenny young man get out  redpenny certainly sir patrick he collects his papers and makes for the door  sir patrick thank you thats a good lad redpenny vanishes they all put up with me these young chaps because im an old man a real old man not like you youre only beginning to give yourself the airs of age did you ever see a boy cultivating a moustache well a middleaged doctor cultivating a grey head is much the same sort of spectacle  ridgeon good lord yes i suppose so and i thought that the days of my vanity were past tell me at what age does a man leave off being a fool  sir patrick remember the frenchman who asked his grandmother at what age we get free from the temptations of love the old woman said she didnt know ridgeon laughs well i make you the same answer but the worlds growing very interesting to me now colly  ridgeon you keep up your interest in science do you  sir patrick lord yes modern science is a wonderful thing look at your great discovery look at all the great discoveries where are they leading to why right back to my poor dear old fathers ideas and discoveries hes been dead now over forty years oh its very interesting  ridgeon well theres nothing like progress is there  sir patrick dont misunderstand me my boy im not belittling your discovery most discoveries are made regularly every fifteen years and its fully a hundred and fifty since yours was made last thats something to be proud of but your discoverys not new its only inoculation my father practised inoculation until it was made criminal in eighteenforty that broke the poor old mans heart colly he died of it and now it turns out that my father was right after all youve brought us back to inoculation  ridgeon i know nothing about smallpox my line is tuberculosis and typhoid and plague but of course the principle of all vaccines is the same  sir patrick tuberculosis mmmm youve found out how to cure consumption eh  ridgeon i believe so  sir patrick ah yes its very interesting what is it the old cardinal says in brownings play i have known four and twenty leaders of revolt well ive known over thirty men that found out how to cure consumption why do people go on dying of it colly devilment i suppose there was my fathers old friend george boddington of sutton coldfield he discovered the openair cure in eighteenforty he was ruined and driven out of his practice for only opening the windows and now we wont let a consumptive patient have as much as a roof over his head oh its very very interesting to an old man  ridgeon you old cynic you dont believe a bit in my discovery  sir patrick no no i dont go quite so far as that colly but still you remember jane marsh  ridgeon jane marsh no  sir patrick you dont  ridgeon no  sir patrick you mean to tell me you dont remember the woman with the tuberculosis ulcer on her arm  ridgeon enlightened oh your washerwomans daughter was her name jane marsh i forgot  sir patrick perhaps youve forgotten also that you undertook to cure her with kochs tuberculin  ridgeon and instead of curing her it rotted her arm right off yes i remember poor jane however she makes a good living out of that arm now by shewing it at medical lectures  sir patrick still that wasnt quite what you intended was it  ridgeon i took my chance of it  sir patrick jane did you mean  ridgeon well its always the patient who has to take the chance when an experiment is necessary and we can find out nothing without experiment  sir patrick what did you find out from janes case  ridgeon i found out that the inoculation that ought to cure sometimes kills  sir patrick i could have told you that ive tried these modern inoculations a bit myself ive killed people with them and ive cured people with them but i gave them up because i never could tell which i was going to do  ridgeon taking a pamphlet from a drawer in the writingtable and handing it to him read that the next time you have an hour to spare and youll find out why  sir patrick grumbling and fumbling for his spectacles oh bother your pamphlets whats the practice of it looking at the pamphlet opsonin what the devil is opsonin  ridgeon opsonin is what you butter the disease germs with to make your white blood corpuscles eat them he sits down again on the couch  sir patrick thats not new ive heard this notion that the white corpuscleswhat is it that whats his namemetchnikoffcalls them  ridgeon phagocytes  sir patrick aye phagocytes yes yes yes well i heard this theory that the phagocytes eat up the disease germs years ago long before you came into fashion besides they dont always eat them  ridgeon they do when you butter them with opsonin  sir patrick gammon  ridgeon no its not gammon what it comes to in practice is this the phagocytes wont eat the microbes unless the microbes are nicely buttered for them well the patient manufactures the butter for himself all right but my discovery is that the manufacture of that butter which i call opsonin goes on in the system by ups and downsnature being always rhythmical you knowand that what the inoculation does is to stimulate the ups or downs as the case may be if we had inoculated jane marsh when her butter factory was on the upgrade we should have cured her arm but we got in on the downgrade and lost her arm for her i call the upgrade the positive phase and the downgrade the negative phase everything depends on your inoculating at the right moment inoculate when the patient is in the negative phase and you kill inoculate when the patient is in the positive phase and you cure  sir patrick and pray how are you to know whether the patient is in the positive or the negative phase  ridgeon send a drop of the patients blood to the laboratory at st annes and in fifteen minutes ill give you his opsonin index in figures if the figure is one inoculate and cure if its under point eight inoculate and kill thats my discovery the most important that has been made since harvey discovered the circulation of the blood my tuberculosis patients dont die now  sir patrick and mine do when my inoculation catches them in the negative phase as you call it eh  ridgeon precisely to inject a vaccine into a patient without first testing his opsonin is as near murder as a respectable practitioner can get if i wanted to kill s man i should kill him that way  emmy looking in will you see a lady that wants her husbands lungs cured  ridgeon impatiently no havnt i told you i will see nobodyto sir patrick i live in a state of siege ever since it got about that im a magician who can cure consumption with a drop of serum to emmy dont come to me again about people who have no appointments i tell you i can see nobody  emmy well ill tell her to wait a bit  ridgeon furious youll tell her i cant see her and send her away do you hear  emmy unmoved well will you see mr cutler walpole he dont want a cure he only wants to congratulate you  ridgeon of course shew him up she turns to go stop to sir patrick i want two minutes more with you between ourselves to emmy emmy ask mr walpole to wait just two minutes while i finish a consultation  emmy oh hell wait all right hes talking to the poor lady she goes out  sir patrick well what is it  ridgeon dont laugh at me i want your advice  sir patrick professional advice  ridgeon yes theres something the matter with me i dont know what it is  sir patrick neither do i i suppose youve been sounded  ridgeon yes of course theres nothing wrong with any of the organs nothing special anyhow but i have a curious aching i dont know where i cant localize it sometimes i think its my heart sometimes i suspect my spine it doesnt exactly hurt me but it unsettles me completely i feel that something is going to happen and there are other symptoms scraps of tunes come into my head that seem to me very pretty though theyre quite commonplace  sir patrick do you hear voices  ridgeon no  sir patrick im glad of that when my patients tell me that theyve made a greater discovery than harvey and that they hear voices i lock them up  ridgeon you think im mad thats just the suspicion that has come across me once or twice tell me the truth i can bear it  sir patrick youre sure there are no voices  ridgeon quite sure  sir patrick then its only foolishness  ridgeon have you ever met anything like it before in your practice  sir patrick oh yes often its very common between the ages of seventeen and twentytwo it sometimes comes on again at forty or thereabouts youre a bachelor you see its not seriousif youre careful  ridgeon about my food  sir patrick no about your behavior theres nothing wrong with your spine and theres nothing wrong with your heart but theres something wrong with your common sense youre not going to die but you may be going to make a fool of yourself so be careful  ridgeon i sec you dont believe in my discovery well sometimes i dont believe in it myself thank you all the same shall we have walpole up  sir patrick oh have him up ridgeon rings hes a clever operator is walpole though hes only one of your chloroform surgeons in my early days you made your man drunk and the porters and students held him down and you had to set your teeth and finish the job fast nowadays you work at your ease and the pain doesnt come until afterwards when youve taken your cheque and rolled up your bag and left the house i tell you colly chloroform has done a lot of mischief its enabled every fool to be a surgeon  ridgeon to emmy who answers the bell shew mr walpole up  emmy hes talking to the lady  ridgeon exasperated did i not tell you  emmy goes out without heeding him he gives it up with a shrug and plants himself with his back to the console leaning resignedly against it  sir patrick i know your cutler walpoles and their like theyve found out that a mans bodys full of bits and scraps of old organs he has no mortal use for thanks to chloroform you can cut half a dozen of them out without leaving him any the worse except for the illness and the guineas it costs him i knew the walpoles well fifteen years ago the father used to snip off the ends of peoples uvulas for fifty guineas and paint throats with caustic every day for a year at two guineas a time his brotherinlaw extirpated tonsils for two hundred guineas until he took up womens cases at double the fees cutler himself worked hard at anatomy to find something fresh to operate on and at last he got hold of something he calls the nuciform sac which hes made quite the fashion people pay him five hundred guineas to cut it out they might as well get their hair cut for all the difference it makes but i suppose they feel important after it you cant go out to dinner now without your neighbor bragging to you of some useless operation or other  emmy announcing mr cutler walpole she goes out  cutler walpole is an energetic unhesitating man of forty with a cleanly modelled face very decisive and symmetrical about the shortish salient rather pretty nose and the three trimly turned corners made by his chin and jaws in comparison with ridgeons delicate broken lines and sir patricks softly rugged aged ones his face looks machinemade and beeswaxed but his scrutinizing daring eyes give it life and force he seems never at a loss never in doubt one feels that if he made a mistake he would make it thoroughly and firmly he has neat wellnourished hands short arms and is built for strength and compactness rather than for height he is smartly dressed with a fancy waistcoat a richly colored scarf secured by a handsome ring ornaments on his watch chain spats on his shoes and a general air of the welltodo sportsman about him he goes straight across to ridgeon and shakes hands with him  walpole my dear ridgeon best wishes heartiest congratulations you deserve it  ridgeon thank you  walpole as a man mind you you deserve it as a man the opsonin is simple rot as any capable surgeon can tell you but were all delighted to see your personal qualities officially recognized sir patrick how are you i sent you a paper lately about a little thing i invented a new saw for shoulder blades  sir patrick meditatively yes i got it its a good saw a useful handy instrument  walpole confidently i knew youd see its points  sir patrick yes i remember that saw sixtyfive years ago  walpole what  sir patrick it was called a cabinetmakers jimmy then  walpole get out nonsense cabinetmaker be  ridgeon never mind him walpole hes jealous  walpole by the way i hope im not disturbing you two in anything private  ridgeon no no sit down i was only consulting him im rather out of sorts overwork i suppose  walpole swiftly i know whats the matter with you i can see it in your complexion i can feel it in the grip of your hand  ridgeon what is it  walpole bloodpoisoning  ridgeon bloodpoisoning impossible  walpole i tell you bloodpoisoning ninetyfive per cent of the human race suffer from chronic bloodpoisoning and die of it its as simple as abc your nuciform sac is full of decaying matterundigested food and waste productsrank ptomaines now you take my advice ridgeon let me cut it out for you youll be another man afterwards  sir patrick dont you like him as he is  walpole no i dont i dont like any man who hasnt a healthy circulation i tell you this in an intelligently governed country people wouldnt be allowed to go about with nuciform sacs making themselves centres of infection the operation ought to be compulsory its ten times more important than vaccination  sir patrick have you had your own sac removed may i ask  walpole triumphantly i havnt got one look at me ive no symptoms im as sound as a bell about five per cent of the population havnt got any and im one of the five per cent ill give you an instance you know mrs jack foljambe the smart mrs foljambe i operated at easter on her sisterinlaw lady gorran and found she had the biggest sac i ever saw it held about two ounces well mrs foljambe had the right spiritthe genuine hygienic instinct she couldnt stand her sisterinlaw being a clean sound woman and she simply a whited sepulchre so she insisted on my operating on her too and by george sir she hadnt any sac at all not a trace not a rudiment i was so taken abackso interested that i forgot to take the sponges out and was stitching them up inside her when the nurse missed them somehow id made sure shed have an exceptionally large one he sits down on the couch squaring his shoulders and shooting his hands out of his cuffs as he sets his knuckles akimbo  emmy looking in sir ralph bloomfield bonington  a long and expectant pause follows this announcement all look to the door but there is no sir ralph  ridgeon at last were is he  emmy looking back drat him i thought he was following me hes stayed down to talk to that lady  ridgeon exploding i told you to tell that ladyemmy vanishes  walpole jumping up again oh by the way ridgeon that reminds me ive been talking to that poor girl its her husband and she thinks its a case of consumption the usual wrong diagnosis these damned general practitioners ought never to be allowed to touch a patient except under the orders of a consultant shes been describing his symptoms to me and the case is as plain as a pikestaff bad bloodpoisoning now shes poor she cant afford to have him operated on well you send him to me ill do it for nothing theres room for him in my nursing home ill put him straight and feed him up and make him happy i like making people happy he goes to the chair near the window  emmy looking in here he is  sir ralph bloomfield bonington wafts himself into the room he is a tall man with a head like a tall and slender egg he has been in his time a slender man but now in his sixth decade his waistcoat has filled out somewhat his fair eyebrows arch goodnaturedly and uncritically he has a most musical voice his speech is a perpetual anthem and he never tires of the sound of it he radiates an enormous selfsatisfaction cheering reassuring healing by the mere incompatibility of disease or anxiety with his welcome presence even broken bones it is said have been known to unite at the sound of his voice he is a born healer as independent of mere treatment and skill as any christian scientist when he expands into oratory or scientific exposition he is as energetic as walpole but it is with a bland voluminous atmospheric energy which envelops its subject and its audience and makes interruption or inattention impossible and imposes veneration and credulity on all but the strongest minds he is known in the medical world as b b and the envy roused by his success in practice is softened by the conviction that he is scientifically considered a colossal humbug the fact being that though he knows just as much and just as little as his contemporaries the qualifications that pass muster in common men reveal their weakness when hung on his egregious personality  b b aha sir colenso sir colenso eh welcome to the order of knighthood  ridgeon shaking hands thank you b b  b b what sir patrick and how are we today a little chilly a little stiff but hale and still the cleverest of us all sir patrick grunts what walpole the absentminded beggar eh  walpole what does that mean  b b have you forgotten the lovely opera singer i sent you to have that growth taken off her vocal cords  walpole springing to his feet great heavens man you dont mean to say you sent her for a throat operation  b b archly aha ha ha aha trilling like a lark as he shakes his finger at walpole you removed her nuciform sac well well force of habit force of habit never mind neeever mind she got back her voice after it and thinks you the greatest surgeon alive and so you are so you are so you are  walpole in a tragic whisper intensely serious bloodpoisoning i see i see he sits down again  sir patrick and how is a certain distinguished family getting on under your care sir ralph  b b our friend ridgeon will be gratified to hear that i have tried his opsonin treatment on little prince henry with complete success  ridgeon startled and anxious but how  b b continuing i suspected typhoid the head gardeners boy had it so i just called at st annes one day and got a tube of your very excellent serum you were out unfortunately  ridgeon i hope they explained to you carefully  b b waving away the absurd suggestion lord bless you my dear fellow i didnt need any explanations id left my wife in the carriage at the door and id no time to be taught my business by your young chaps i know all about it ive handled these antitoxins ever since they first came out  ridgeon but theyre not antitoxins and theyre dangerous unless you use them at the right time  b b of course they are everything is dangerous unless you take it at the right time an apple at breakfast does you good an apple at bedtime upsets you for a week there are only two rules for antitoxins first dont be afraid of them second inject them a quarter of an hour before meals three times a day  ridgeon appalled great heavens b b no no no  b b sweeping on irresistibly yes yes yes colly the proof of the pudding is in the eating you know it was an immense success it acted like magic on the little prince up went his temperature off to bed i packed him and in a week he was all right again and absolutely immune from typhoid for the rest of his life the family were very nice about it their gratitude was quite touching but i said they owed it all to you ridgeon and i am glad to think that your knighthood is the result  ridgeon i am deeply obliged to you overcome he sits down on the chair near the couch  b b not at all not at all your own merit come come come dont give way  ridgeon its nothing i was a little giddy just now overwork i suppose  walpole bloodpoisoning  b b overwork theres no such thing i do the work of ten men am i giddy no no if youre not well you have a disease it may be a slight one but its a disease and what is a disease the lodgment in the system of a pathogenic germ and the multiplication of that germ what is the remedy a very simple one find the germ and kill it  sir patrick suppose theres no germ  b b impossible sir patrick there must be a germ else how could the patient be ill  sir patrick can you shew me the germ of overwork  b b no but why why because my dear sir patrick though the germ is there its invisible nature has given it no danger signal for us these germsthese bacilliare translucent bodies like glass like water to make them visible you must stain them well my dear paddy do what you will some of them wont stain they wont take cochineal they wont take methylene blue they wont take gentian violet they wont take any coloring matter consequently though we know as scientific men that they exist we cannot see them but can you disprove their existence can you conceive the disease existing without them can you for instance shew me a case of diphtheria without the bacillus  sir patrick no but ill shew you the same bacillus without the disease in your own throat  b b no not the same sir patrick it is an entirely different bacillus only the two are unfortunately so exactly alike that you cannot see the difference you must understand my dear sir patrick that every one of these interesting little creatures has an imitator just as men imitate each other germs imitate each other there is the genuine diphtheria bacillus discovered by loeffler and there is the pseudobacillus exactly like it which you could find as you say in my own throat           sir patrick and how do you tell one from the other  b b well obviously if the bacillus is the genuine loeffler you have diphtheria and if its the pseudobacillus youre quite well nothing simpler science is always simple and always profound it is only the halftruths that are dangerous ignorant faddists pick up some superficial information about germs and they write to the papers and try to discredit science they dupe and mislead many honest and worthy people but science has a perfect answer to them on every point           a little learning is a dangerous thing          drink deep or taste not the pierian spring  i mean no disrespect to your generation sir patrick some of you old stagers did marvels through sheer professional intuition and clinical experience but when i think of the average men of your day ignorantly bleeding and cupping and purging and scattering germs over their patients from their clothes and instruments and contrast all that with the scientific certainty and simplicity of my treatment of the little prince the other day i cant help being proud of my own generation the men who were trained on the germ theory the veterans of the great struggle over evolution in the seventies we may have our faults but at least we are men of science that is why i am taking up your treatment ridgeon and pushing it its scientific he sits down on the chair near the couch  emmy at the door announcing dr blenkinsop  dr blenkinsop is a very different case from the others he is clearly not a prosperous man he is flabby and shabby cheaply fed and cheaply clothed he has the lines made by a conscience between his eyes and the lines made by continual money worries all over his face cut all the deeper as he has seen better days and hails his welltodo colleagues as their contemporary and old hospital friend though even in this he has to struggle with the diffidence of poverty and relegation to the poorer middle class  ridgeon how are you blenkinsop  blenkinsop ive come to offer my humble congratulations oh dear all the great guns are before me  b b patronizing but charming how dye do blenkinsop how dye do  blenkinsop and sir patrick too sir patrick grunts  ridgeon youve met walpole of course  walpole how dye do  blenkinsop its the first time ive had that honor in my poor little practice there are no chances of meeting you great men i know nobody but the st annes men of my own day to ridgeon and so youre sir colenso how does it feel  ridgeon foolish at first dont take any notice of it  blenkinsop im ashamed to say i havnt a notion what your great discovery is but i congratulate you all the same for the sake of old times  b b shocked but my dear blenkinsop you used to be rather keen on science  blenkinsop ah i used to be a lot of things i used to have two or three decent suits of clothes and flannels to go up the river on sundays look at me now this is my best and it must last till christmas what can i do ive never opened a book since i was qualified thirty years ago i used to read the medical papers at first but you know how soon a man drops that besides i cant afford them and what are they after all but trade papers full of advertisements ive forgotten all my science whats the use of my pretending i havnt but i have great experience clinical experience and bedside experience is the main thing isnt it  b b no doubt always provided mind you that you have a sound scientific theory to correlate your observations at the bedside mere experience by itself is nothing if i take my dog to the bedside with me he sees what i see but he learns nothing from it why because hes not a scientific dog  walpole it amuses me to hear you physicians and general practitioners talking about clinical experience what do you see at the bedside but the outside of the patient well it isnt his outside thats wrong except perhaps in skin cases what you want is a daily familiarity with peoples insides and that you can only get at the operating table i know what im talking about ive been a surgeon and a consultant for twenty years and ive never known a general practitioner right in his diagnosis yet bring them a perfectly simple case and they diagnose cancer and arthritis and appendicitis and every other itis when any really experienced surgeon can see that its a plain case of bloodpoisoning  blenkinsop ah its easy for you gentlemen to talk but what would you say if you had my practice except for the workmens clubs my patients are all clerks and shopmen they darent be ill they cant afford it and when they break down what can i do for them you can send your people to st moritz or to egypt or recommend horse exercise or motoring or champagne jelly or complete change and rest for six months i might as well order my people a slice of the moon and the worst of it is im too poor to keep well myself on the cooking i have to put up with ive such a wretched digestion and i look it how am i to inspire confidence he sits disconsolately on the couch  ridgeon restlessly dont blenkinsop its too painful the most tragic thing in the world is a sick doctor  walpole yes by george its like a baldheaded man trying to sell a hair restorer thank god im a surgeon  b b sunnily i am never sick never had a days illness in my life thats what enables me to sympathize with my patients  walpole interested what youre never ill  b b never  walpole thats interesting i believe you have no nuciform sac if you ever do feel at all queer i should very much like to have a look  b b thank you my dear fellow but im too busy just now  ridgeon i was just telling them when you came in blenkinsop that i have worked myself out of sorts  blenkinsop well it seems presumptuous of me to offer a prescription to a great man like you but still i have great experience and if i might recommend a pound of ripe greengages every day half an hour before lunch im sure youd find a benefit theyre very cheap  ridgeon what do you say to that b b  b b encouragingly very sensible blenkinsop very sensible indeed im delighted to see that you disapprove of drugs  sir patrick grunts  b b archly aha haha did i hear from the fireside armchair the bowwow of the old school defending its drugs ah believe me paddy the world would be healthier if every chemists shop in england were demolished look at the papers full of scandalous advertisements of patent medicines a huge commercial system of quackery and poison well whose fault is it ours i say ours we set the example we spread the superstition we taught the people to believe in bottles of doctors stuff and now they buy it at the stores instead of consulting a medical man  walpole quite true ive not prescribed a drug for the last fifteen years  b b drugs can only repress symptoms they cannot eradicate disease the true remedy for all diseases is natures remedy nature and science are at one sir patrick believe me though you were taught differently nature has provided in the white corpuscles as you call themin the phagocytes as we call thema natural means of devouring and destroying all disease germs there is at bottom only one genuinely scientific treatment for all diseases and that is to stimulate the phagocytes stimulate the phagocytes drugs are a delusion find the germ of the disease prepare from it a suitable antitoxin inject it three times a day quarter of an hour before meals and what is the result the phagocytes are stimulated they devour the disease and the patient recoversunless of course hes too far gone that i take it is the essence of ridgeons discovery  sir patrick dreamily as i sit here i seem to hear my poor old father talking again  b b rising in incredulous amazement your father but lord bless my soul paddy your father must have been an older man than you  sir patrick word for word almost he said what you say no more drugs nothing but inoculation  b b almost contemptuously inoculation do you mean smallpox inoculation  sir patrick yes in the privacy of our family circle sir my father used to declare his belief that smallpox inoculation was good not only for smallpox but for all fevers  b b suddenly rising to the new idea with immense interest and excitement what ridgeon did you hear that sir patrick i am more struck by what you have just told me than i can well express your father sir anticipated a discovery of my own listen walpole blenkinsop attend one moment you will all be intensely interested in this i was put on the track by accident i had a typhoid case and a tetanus case side by side in the hospital a beadle and a city missionary think of what that meant for them poor fellows can a beadle be dignified with typhoid can a missionary be eloquent with lockjaw no no well i got some typhoid antitoxin from ridgeon and a tube of muldooleys antitetanus serum but the missionary jerked all my things off the table in one of his paroxysms and in replacing them i put ridgeons tube where muldooleys ought to have been the consequence was that i inoculated the typhoid case for tetanus and the tetanus case for typhoid the doctors look greatly concerned b b undamped smiles triumphantly well they recovered they recovered except for a touch of st vituss dance the missionarys as well today as ever and the beadles ten times the man he was  blenkinsop ive known things like that happen they cant be explained  b b severely blenkinsop there is nothing that cannot be explained by science what did i do did i fold my hands helplessly and say that the case could not be explained by no means i sat down and used my brains i thought the case out on scientific principles i asked myself why didnt the missionary die of typhoid on top of tetanus and the beadle of tetanus on top of typhoid theres a problem for you ridgeon think sir patrick reflect blenkinsop look at it without prejudice walpole what is the real work of the antitoxin simply to stimulate the phagocytes very well but so long as you stimulate the phagocytes what does it matter which particular sort of serum you use for the purpose haha eh do you see do you grasp it ever since that ive used all sorts of antitoxins absolutely indiscriminately with perfectly satisfactory results i inoculated the little prince with your stuff ridgeon because i wanted to give you a lift but two years ago i tried the experiment of treating a scarlet fever case with a sample of hydrophobia serum from the pasteur institute and it answered capitally it stimulated the phagocytes and the phagocytes did the rest that is why sir patricks father found that inoculation cured all fevers it stimulated the phagocytes he throws himself into his chair exhausted with the triumph of his demonstration and beams magnificently on them  emmy looking in mr walpole your motors come for you and its frightening sir patricks horses so come along quick  walpole rising goodbye ridgeon  ridgeon goodbye and many thanks  b b you see my point walpole  emmy he cant wait sir ralph the carriage will be into the area if he dont come  walpole im coming to b b theres nothing in your point phagocytosis is pure rot the cases are all bloodpoisoning and the knife is the real remedy byebye sir paddy happy to have met you mr blenkinsop now emmy he goes out followed by emmy  b b sadly walpole has no intellect a mere surgeon wonderful operator but after all what is operating only manual labor brainbrain remains master of the situation the nuciform sac is utter nonsense theres no such organ its a mere accidental kink in the membrane occurring in perhaps twoandahalf per cent of the population of course im glad for walpoles sake that the operation is fashionable for hes a dear good fellow and after all as i always tell people the operation will do them no harm indeed ive known the nervous shakeup and the fortnight in bed do people a lot of good after a hard london season but still its a shocking fraud rising well i must be toddling goodbye paddy sir patrick grunts goodbye goodbye goodbye my dear blenkinsop goodbye goodbye ridgeon dont fret about your health you know what to do if your liver is sluggish a little mercury never does any harm if you feel restless try bromide if that doesnt answer a stimulant you know a little phosphorus and strychnine if you cant sleep trional trional trion  sir patrick drily but no drugs colly remember that  b b firmly certainly not quite right sir patrick as temporary expedients of course but as treatment no no keep away from the chemists shop my dear ridgeon whatever you do  ridgeon going to the door with him i will and thank you for the knighthood goodbye  b b stopping at the door with the beam in his eye twinkling a little by the way whos your patient  ridgeon who  b b downstairs charming woman tuberculous husband  ridgeon is she there still  emmy looking in come on sir ralph your wifes waiting in the carriage  b b suddenly sobered oh goodbye he goes out almost precipitately  ridgeon emmy is that woman there still if so tell her once for all that i cant and wont see her do you hear  emmy oh she aint in a hurry she doesnt mind how long she waits she goes out  blenkinsop i must be off too every halfhour i spend away from my work costs me eighteenpence goodbye sir patrick  sir patrick goodbye goodbye  ridgeon come to lunch with me some day this week  blenkinsop i cant afford it dear boy and it would put me off my own food for a week thank you all the same  ridgeon uneasy at blenkinsops poverty can i do nothing for you  blenkinsop well if you have an old frockcoat to spare you see what would be an old one for you would be a new one for me so remember the next time you turn out your wardrobe goodbye he hurries out  ridgeon looking after him poor chap turning to sir patrick so thats why they made me a knight and thats the medical profession  sir patrick and a very good profession too my lad when you know as much as i know of the ignorance and superstition of the patients youll wonder that were half as good as we are  ridgeon were not a profession were a conspiracy  sir patrick all professions are conspiracies against the laity and we cant all be geniuses like you every fool can get ill but every fool cant be a good doctor there are not enough good ones to go round and for all you know bloomfield bonington kills less people than you do  ridgeon oh very likely but he really ought to know the difference between a vaccine and an antitoxin stimulate the phagocytes the vaccine doesnt affect the phagocytes at all hes all wrong hopelessly dangerously wrong to put a tube of serum into his hands is murder simple murder  emmy returning now sir patrick how long more are you going to keep them horses standing in the draught  sir patrick whats that to you you old catamaran  emmy come come now none of your temper to me and its time for colly to get to his work  ridgeon behave yourself emmy get out  emmy oh i learnt how to behave myself before i learnt you to do it i know what doctors are sitting talking together about themselves when they ought to be with their poor patients and i know what horses are sir patrick i was brought up in the country now be good and come along  sir patrick rising very well very well very well goodbye colly he pats ridgeon on the shoulder and goes out turning for a moment at the door to look meditatively at emmy and say with grave conviction you are an ugly old devil and no mistake  emmy highly indignant calling after him youre no beauty yourself to ridgeon much flustered theyve no manners they think they can say what they like to me and you set them on you do ill teach them their places here now are you going to see that poor thing or are you not  ridgeon i tell you for the fiftieth time i wont see anybody send her away  emmy oh im tired of being told to send her away what good will that do her  ridgeon must i get angry with you emmy  emmy coaxing come now just see her for a minute to please me theres a good boy shes given me halfacrown she thinks its life and death to her husband for her to see you  ridgeon values her husbands life at halfacrown  emmy well its all she can afford poor lamb them others think nothing of halfasovereign just to talk about themselves to you the sluts besides shell put you in a good temper for the day because its a good deed to see her and shes the sort that gets round you  ridgeon well she hasnt done so badly for halfacrown shes had a consultation with sir ralph bloomfield bonington and cutler walpole thats six guineas worth to start with i dare say shes consulted blenkinsop too thats another eighteenpence  emmy then youll see her for me wont you  ridgeon oh send her up and be hanged emmy trots out satisfied ridgeon calls redpenny  redpenny appearing at the door what is it  ridgeon theres a patient coming up if she hasnt gone in five minutes come in with an urgent call from the hospital for me you understand shes to have a strong hint to go  redpenny right o he vanishes  ridgeon goes to the glass and arranges his tie a little  emmy announcing mrs doobidad ridgeon leaves the glass and goes to the writingtable  the lady comes in emmy goes out and shuts the door ridgeon who has put on an impenetrable and rather distant professional manner turns to the lady and invites her by a gesture to sit down on the couch  mrs dubedat is beyond all demur an arrestingly goodlooking young woman she has something of the grace and romance of a wild creature with a good deal of the elegance and dignity of a fine lady ridgeon who is extremely susceptible to the beauty of women instinctively assumes the defensive at once and hardens his manner still more he has an impression that she is very well dressed but she has a figure on which any dress would look well and carries herself with the unaffected distinction of a woman who has never in her life suffered from those doubts and fears as to her social position which spoil the manners of most middling people she is tall slender and strong has dark hair dressed so as to look like hair and not like a birds nest or a pantaloons wig fashion wavering just then between these two models has unexpectedly narrow subtle darkfringed eyes that alter her expression disturbingly when she is excited and flashes them wide open is softly impetuous in her speech and swift in her movements and is just now in mortal anxiety she carries a portfolio  mrs dubedat in low urgent tones doctor  ridgeon curtly wait before you begin let me tell you at once that i can do nothing for you my hands are full i sent you that message by my old servant you would not take that answer  mrs dubedat how could i  ridgeon you bribed her  mrs dubedat i  ridgeon that doesnt matter she coaxed me to see you well you must take it from me now that with all the good will in the world i cannot undertake another case  mrs dubedat doctor you must save my husband you must when i explain to you you will see that you must it is not an ordinary case not like any other case he is not like anybody else in the world oh believe me he is not i can prove it to you fingering her portfolio i have brought some things to shew you and you can save him the papers say you can  ridgeon whats the matter tuberculosis  mrs dubedat yes his left lung  ridgeon yes you neednt tell me about that  mrs dubedat you can cure him if only you will it is true that you can isnt it in great distress oh tell me please  ridgeon warningly you are going to be quiet and selfpossessed arnt you  mrs dubedat yes i beg your pardon i know i shouldntgiving way again oh please say that you can and then i shall be all right  ridgeon huffily i am not a curemonger if you want cures you must go to the people who sell them recovering himself ashamed of the tone of his own voice but i have at the hospital ten tuberculous patients whose lives i believe i can save  mrs dubedat thank god  ridgeon wait a moment try to think of those ten patients as ten shipwrecked men on a rafta raft that is barely large enough to save themthat will not support one more another head bobs up through the waves at the side another man begs to be taken aboard he implores the captain of the raft to save him but the captain can only do that by pushing one of his ten off the raft and drowning him to make room for the new comer that is what you are asking me to do  mrs dubedat but how can that be i dont understand surely  ridgeon you must take my word for it that it is so my laboratory my staff and myself are working at full pressure we are doing our utmost the treatment is a new one it takes time means and skill and there is not enough for another case our ten cases are already chosen cases do you understand what i mean by chosen  mrs dubedat chosen no i cant understand  ridgeon sternly you must understand youve got to understand and to face it in every single one of those ten cases i have had to consider not only whether the man could be saved but whether he was worth saving there were fifty cases to choose from and forty had to be condemned to death some of the forty had young wives and helpless children if the hardness of their cases could have saved them they would have been saved ten times over ive no doubt your case is a hard one i can see the tears in your eyes she hastily wipes her eyes i know that you have a torrent of entreaties ready for me the moment i stop speaking but its no use you must go to another doctor  mrs dubedat but can you give me the name of another doctor who understands your secret  ridgeon i have no secret i am not a quack  mrs dubedat i beg your pardon i didnt mean to say anything wrong i dont understand how to speak to you oh pray dont be offended  ridgeon again a little ashamed there there never mind he relaxes and sits down after all im talking nonsense i daresay i am a quack a quack with a qualification but my discovery is not patented  mrs dubedat then can any doctor cure my husband oh why dont they do it i have tried so many i have spent so much if only you would give me the name of another doctor  ridgeon every man in this street is a doctor but outside myself and the handful of men i am training at st annes there is nobody as yet who has mastered the opsonin treatment and we are full up im sorry but that is all i can say rising good morning  mrs dubedat suddenly and desperately taking some drawings from her portfolio doctor look at these you understand drawings you have good ones in your waitingroom look at them they are his work  ridgeon its no use my looking he looks all the same hallo he takes one to the window and studies it yes this is the real thing yes yes he looks at another and returns to her these are very clever theyre unfinished arnt they  mrs dubedat he gets tired so soon but you see dont you what a genius he is you see that he is worth saving oh doctor i married him just to help him to begin i had money enough to tide him over the hard years at the beginningto enable him to follow his inspiration until his genius was recognized and i was useful to him as a model his drawings of me sold quite quickly  ridgeon have you got one  mrs dubedat producing another only this one it was the first  ridgeon devouring it with his eyes thats a wonderful drawing why is it called jennifer  mrs dubedat my name is jennifer  ridgeon a strange name  mrs dubedat not in cornwall i am cornish its only what you call guinevere  ridgeon repeating the names with a certain pleasure in them guinevere jennifer looking again at the drawing yes its really a wonderful drawing excuse me but may i ask is it for sale ill buy it  mrs dubedat oh take it its my own he gave it to me take it take them all take everything ask anything but save him you can you will you must  redpenny entering with every sign of alarm theyve just telephoned from the hospital that youre to come instantlya patient on the point of death the carriage is waiting  ridgeon intolerantly oh nonsense get out greatly annoyed what do you mean by interrupting me like this  redpenny but  ridgeon chut cant you see im engaged be off  redpenny bewildered vanishes  mrs dubedat rising doctor one instant only before you go  ridgeon sit down its nothing  mrs dubedat but the patient he said he was dying  ridgeon oh hes dead by this time never mind sit down  mrs dubedat sitting down and breaking down oh you none of you care you see people die every day  ridgeon petting her nonsense its nothing i told him to come in and say that i thought i should want to get rid of you  mrs dubedat shocked at the falsehood oh ridgeon continuing dont look so bewildered theres nobody dying  mrs dubedat my husband is  ridgeon pulling himself together ah yes i had forgotten your husband mrs dubedat you are asking me to do a very serious thing  mrs dubedat i am asking you to save the life of a great man  ridgeon you are asking me to kill another man for his sake for as surely as i undertake another case i shall have to hand back one of the old ones to the ordinary treatment well i dont shrink from that i have had to do it before and i will do it again if you can convince me that his life is more important than the worst life i am now saving but you must convince me first  mrs dubedat he made those drawings and they are not the bestnothing like the best only i did not bring the really best so few people like them he is twentythree his whole life is before him wont you let me bring him to you wont you speak to him wont you see for yourself  ridgeon is he well enough to come to a dinner at the star and garter at richmond  mrs dubedat oh yes why

well deary have you got round him  ridgeon yes attend to the door and hold your tongue  emmy thats a good boy she goes out with mrs dubedat  ridgeon alone consultation free cure guaranteed he heaves a great sigh     act ii  after dinner on the terrace at the star and garter richmond cloudless summer night nothing disturbs the stillness except from time to time the long trajectory of a distant train and the measured clucking of oars coming up from the thames in the valley below the dinner is over and three of the eight chairs are empty sir patrick with his back to the view is at the head of the square table with ridgeon the two chairs opposite them are empty on their right come first a vacant chair and then one very fully occupied by b b who basks blissfully in the moonbeams on their left schutzmacher and walpole the entrance to the hotel is on their right behind b b the five men are silently enjoying their coffee and cigarets full of food and not altogether void of wine  mrs dubedat wrapped up for departure comes in they rise except sir patrick but she takes one of the vacant places at the foot of the table next b b and they sit down again  mrs dubedat as she enters louis will be here presently he is shewing dr blenkinsop how to work the telephone she sits oh i am so sorry we have to go it seems such a shame this beautiful night and we have enjoyed ourselves so much  ridgeon i dont believe another halfhour would do mr dubedat a bit of harm  sir patrick come now colly come come none of that you take your man home mrs dubedat and get him to bed before eleven  b b yes yes bed before eleven quite right quite right sorry to lose you my dear lady but sir patricks orders are the laws oferof tyre and sidon  walpole let me take you home in my motor  sir patrick no you ought to be ashamed of yourself walpole your motor will take mr and mrs dubedat to the station and quite far enough too for an open carriage at night  mrs dubedat oh i am sure the train is best  ridgeon well mrs dubedat we have had a most enjoyable evening  walpole most enjoyable b b delightful charming unforgettable  mrs dubedat with a touch of shy anxiety what did you think of louis or am i wrong to ask  ridgeon wrong why we are all charmed with him  walpole delighted  b b most happy to have met him a privilege a real privilege  sir patrick grunts  mrs dubedat quickly sir patrick are you uneasy about him  sir patrick discreetly i admire his drawings greatly maam  mrs dubedat yes but i meant  ridgeon you shall go away quite happy hes worth saving he must and shall be saved  mrs dubedat rises and gasps with delight relief and gratitude they all rise except sir patrick and schutzmacher and come reassuringly to her  b b certainly certainly  walpole theres no real difficulty if only you know what to do  mrs dubedat oh how can i ever thank you from this night i can begin to be happy at last you dont know what i feel  she sits down in tears they crowd about her to console her  b b my dear lady come come come come very persuasively come come  walpole dont mind us have a good cry  ridgeon no dont cry your husband had better not know that weve been talking about him  mrs dubedat quickly pulling herself together no of course not please dont mind me what a glorious thing it must be to be a doctor they laugh dont laugh you dont know what youve done for me i never knew until now how deadly afraid i washow i had come to dread the worst i never dared let myself know but now the relief has come now i know  louis dubedat comes from the hotel in his overcoat his throat wrapped in a shawl he is a slim young man of 23 physically still a stripling and pretty though not effeminate he has turquoise blue eyes and a trick of looking you straight in the face with them which combined with a frank smile is very engaging although he is all nerves and very observant and quick of apprehension he is not in the least shy he is younger than jennifer but he patronizes her as a matter of course the doctors do not put him out in the least neither sir patricks years nor bloomfield boningtons majesty have the smallest apparent effect on him he is as natural as a cat he moves among men as most men move among things though he is intentionally making himself agreeable to them on this occasion like all people who can be depended on to take care of themselves he is welcome company and his artists power of appealing to the imagination gains him credit for all sorts of qualities and powers whether he possesses them or not  louis pulling on his gloves behind ridgeons chair now jinnygwinny the motor has come round  ridgeon why do you let him spoil your beautiful name like that mrs dubedat  mrs dubedat oh on grand occasions i am jennifer  b b you are a bachelor you do not understand these things ridgeon look at me they look i also have two names in moments of domestic worry i am simple ralph when the sun shines in the home i am beedledeedledumkins such is married life mr dubedat may i ask you to do me a favor before you go will you sign your name to this menu card under the sketch you have made of me  walpole yes and mine too if you will be so good  louis certainly he sits down and signs the cards  mrs dubedat wont you sign dr schutzmachers for him louis  louis i dont think dr schutzmacher is pleased with his portrait ill tear it up he reaches across the table for schutzmachers menu card and is about to tear it schutzmacher makes no sign  ridgeon no no if loony doesnt want it i do  louis ill sign it for you with pleasure he signs and hands it to ridgeon ive just been making a little note of the river tonight it will work up into something good he shews a pocket sketchbook i think ill call it the silver danube  b b ah charming charming  walpole very sweet youre a nailer at pastel  louis coughs first out of modesty then from tuberculosis  sir patrick now then mr dubedat youve had enough of the night air take him home maam  mrs dubedat yes come louis  ridgeon never fear never mind ill make that cough all right  b b we will stimulate the phagocytes with tender effusion shaking her hand goodnight mrs dubedat goodnight goodnight  walpole if the phagocytes fail come to me ill put you right  louis goodnight sir patrick happy to have met you  sir patrick night half a grunt  mrs dubedat goodnight sir patrick  sir patrick cover yourself well up dont think your lungs are made of iron because theyre better than his goodnight  mrs dubedat thank you thank you nothing hurts me goodnight  louis goes out through the hotel without noticing schutzmacher mrs dubedat hesitates then bows to him schutzmacher rises and bows formally german fashion she goes out attended by ridgeon the rest resume their seats ruminating or smoking quietly  b b harmoniously deelightful couple charming woman gifted lad remarkable talent graceful outlines perfect evening great success interesting case glorious night exquisite scenery capital dinner stimulating conversation restful outing good wine happy ending touching gratitude lucky ridgeon  ridgeon returning whats that calling me b b he goes back to his seat next sir patrick  b b no no only congratulating you on a most successful evening enchanting woman thorough breeding gentle nature refined  blenkinsop comes from the hotel and takes the empty chair next ridgeon  blenkinsop im so sorry to have left you like this ridgeon but it was a telephone message from the police theyve found half a milkman at our level crossing with a prescription of mine in its pocket wheres mr dubedat  ridgeon gone  blenkinsop rising very pale gone  ridgeon just this moment  blenkinsop perhaps i could overtake himhe rushes into the hotel  walpole calling after him hes in the motor man miles off you cangiving it up no use  ridgeon theyre really very nice people i confess i was afraid the husband would turn out an appalling bounder but hes almost as charming in his way as she is in hers and theres no mistake about his being a genius its something to have got a case really worth saving somebody else will have to go but at all events it will be easy to find a worse man  sir patrick how do you know  ridgeon come now sir paddy no growling have something more to drink  sir patrick no thank you  walpole do you see anything wrong with dubedat b b  b b oh a charming young fellow besides after all what could be wrong with him look at him what could be wrong with him  sir patrick there are two things that can be wrong with any man one of them is a cheque the other is a woman until you know that a mans sound on these two points you know nothing about him  b b ah cynic cynic  walpole hes all right as to the cheque for a while at all events he talked to me quite frankly before dinner as to the pressure of money difficulties on an artist he says he has no vices and is very economical but that theres one extravagance he cant afford and yet cant resist and that is dressing his wife prettily so i said bang plump out let me lend you twenty pounds and pay me when your ship comes home he was really very nice about it he took it like a man and it was a pleasure to see how happy it made him poor chap  b b who has listened to walpole with growing perturbation butbutbutwhen was this may i ask  walpole when i joined you that time down by the river  b b but my dear walpole he had just borrowed ten pounds from me  walpole what  sir patrick grunts  b b indulgently well well it was really hardly borrowing for he said heaven only knew when he could pay me i couldnt refuse it appears that mrs dubedat has taken a sort of fancy to me  walpole quickly no it was to me  b b certainly not your name was never mentioned between us he is so wrapped up in his work that he has to leave her a good deal alone and the poor innocent young fellowhe has of course no idea of my position or how busy i amactually wanted me to call occasionally and talk to her  walpole exactly what he said to me  b b pooh pooh pooh really i must say much disturbed he rises and goes up to the balustrade contemplating the landscape vexedly  walpole look here ridgeon this is beginning to look serious  blenkinsop very anxious and wretched but trying to look unconcerned comes back  ridgeon well did you catch him  blenkinsop no excuse my running away like that he sits down at the foot of the table next bloomfeld boningtons chair  walpole anything the matter  blenkinsop oh no a triflesomething ridiculous it cant be helped never mind  ridgeon was it anything about dubedat  blenkinsop almost breaking down i ought to keep it to myself i know i cant tell you ridgeon how ashamed i am of dragging my miserable poverty to your dinner after all your kindness its not that you wont ask me again but its so humiliating and i did so look forward to one evening in my dress clothes theyre still presentable you see with all my troubles left behind just like old times  ridgeon but what has happened  blenkinsop oh nothing its too ridiculous i had just scraped up four shillings for this little outing and it cost me oneandfourpence to get here well dubedat asked me to lend him halfacrown to tip the chambermaid of the room his wife left her wraps in and for the cloakroom he said he only wanted it for five minutes as she had his purse so of course i lent it to him and hes forgotten to pay me ive just tuppence to get back with  ridgeon oh never mind that  blenkinsop stopping him resolutely no i know what youre going to say but i wont take it ive never borrowed a penny and i never will ive nothing left but my friends and i wont sell them if none of you were to be able to meet me without being afraid that my civility was leading up to the loan of five shillings there would be an end of everything for me ill take your old clothes colly sooner than disgrace you by talking to you in the street in my own but i wont borrow money ill train it as far as the twopence will take me and ill tramp the rest  walpole youll do the whole distance in my motor they are all greatly relieved and walpole hastens to get away from the painful subject by adding did he get anything out of you mr schutzmacher  schutzmacher shakes his head in a most expressive negative  walpole you didnt appreciate his drawing i think  schutzmacher oh yes i did i should have liked very much to have kept the sketch and got it autographed  b b but why didnt you  schutzmacher well the fact is when i joined dubedat after his conversation with mr walpole he said the jews were the only people who knew anything about art and that though he had to put up with your philistine twaddle as he called it it was what i said about the drawings that really pleased him he also said that his wife was greatly struck with my knowledge and that she always admired jews then he asked me to advance him 50 pounds on the security of the drawings  b b  all  no no positively seriously walpole  exclaiming  what another fifty blenkinsop  together  think of that sir patrick   grunts  schutzmacher of course i couldnt lend money to a stranger like that  b b i envy you the power to say no mr schutzmacher of course i knew i oughtnt to lend money to a young fellow in that way but i simply hadnt the nerve to refuse i couldnt very well you know could i  schutzmacher i dont understand that i felt that i couldnt very well lend it  walpole what did he say  schutzmacher well he made a very uncalledfor remark about a jew not understanding the feelings of a gentleman i must say you gentiles are very hard to please you say we are no gentlemen when we lend money and when we refuse to lend it you say just the same i didnt mean to behave badly as i told him i might have lent it to him if he had been a jew himself  sir patrick with a grunt and what did he say to that  schutzmacher oh he began trying to persuade me that he was one of the chosen peoplethat his artistic faculty shewed it and that his name was as foreign as my own he said he didnt really want 50 pounds that he was only joking that all he wanted was a couple of sovereigns  b b no no mr schutzmacher you invented that last touch seriously now  schutzmacher no you cant improve on nature in telling stories about gentlemen like mr dubedat  blenkinsop you certainly do stand by one another you chosen people mr schutzmacher  schutzmacher not at all personally i like englishmen better than jews and always associate with them thats only natural because as i am a jew theres nothing interesting in a jew to me whereas there is always something interesting and foreign in an englishman but in money matters its quite different you see when an englishman borrows all he knows or cares is that he wants money and hell sign anything to get it without in the least understanding it or intending to carry out the agreement if it turns out badly for him in fact he thinks you a cad if you ask him to carry it out under such circumstances just like the merchant of venice you know but if a jew makes an agreement he means to keep it and expects you to keep it if he wants money for a time he borrows it and knows he must pay it at the end of the time if he knows he cant pay he begs it as a gift  ridgeon come loony do you mean to say that jews are never rogues and thieves  schutzmacher oh not at all but i was not talking of criminals i was comparing honest englishmen with honest jews  one of the hotel maids a pretty fairhaired woman of about 25 comes from the hotel rather furtively she accosts ridgeon  the maid i beg your pardon sir  ridgeon eh  the maid i beg pardon sir its not about the hotel im not allowed to be on the terrace and i should be discharged if i were seen speaking to you unless you were kind enough to say you called me to ask whether the motor has come back from the station yet  walpole has it  the maid yes sir  ridgeon well what do you want  the maid would you mind sir giving me the address of the gentleman that was with you at dinner  ridgeon sharply yes of course i should mind very much you have no right to ask  the maid yes sir i know it looks like that but what am i to do  sir patrick whats the matter with you  the maid nothing sir i want the address thats all  b b you mean the young gentleman  the maid yes sir that went to catch the train with the woman he brought with him  ridgeon the woman do you mean the lady who dined here the gentlemans wife  the maid dont believe them sir she cant be his wife im his wife  b b   in amazed remonstrance my good girl ridgeon you his wife walpole what whats that oh this is getting perfectly fascinating ridgeon  the maid i could run upstairs and get you my marriage lines in a minute sir if you doubt my word hes mr louis dubedat isnt he  ridgeon yes  the maid well sir you may believe me or not but im the lawful mrs dubedat  sir patrick and why arnt you living with your husband  the maid we couldnt afford it sir i had thirty pounds saved and we spent it all on our honeymoon in three weeks and a lot more that he borrowed then i had to go back into service and he went to london to get work at his drawing and he never wrote me a line or sent me an address i never saw nor heard of him again until i caught sight of him from the window going off in the motor with that woman  sir patrick well thats two wives to start with  b b now upon my soul i dont want to be uncharitable but really im beginning to suspect that our young friend is rather careless  sir patrick beginning to think how long will it take you man to find out that hes a damned young blackguard  blenkinsop oh thats severe sir patrick very severe of course its bigamy but still hes very young and shes very pretty mr walpole may i spunge on you for another of those nice cigarets of yours he changes his seat for the one next walpole  walpole certainly he feels in his pockets oh bother where suddenly remembering i say i recollect now i passed my cigaret case to dubedat and he didnt return it it was a gold one  the maid he didnt mean any harm he never thinks about things like that sir ill get it back for you sir if youll tell me where to find him  ridgeon what am i to do shall i give her the address or not  sir patrick give her your own address and then well see to the maid youll have to be content with that for the present my girl ridgeon gives her his card whats your name  the maid minnie tinwell sir  sir patrick well you write him a letter to care of this gentleman and it will be sent on now be off with you  the maid thank you sir im sure you wouldnt see me wronged thank you all gentlemen and excuse the liberty  she goes into the hotel they match her in silence  ridgeon when she is gone do you realize chaps that we have promised mrs dubedat to save this fellows life  blenkinsop whats the matter with him  ridgeon tuberculosis  blenkinsop interested and can you cure that  ridgeon i believe so  blenkinsop then i wish youd cure me my right lung is touched im sorry to say    ridgeon                       what your lung is going  bb                           my dear blenkinsop what do you                   all         tell me full of concern for                    together   blenkinsop he comes back from the                                balustrade  sir patrick                   eh eh whats that  walpole                       hullo you mustnt neglect this                                you know   blenkinsop putting his fingers in his ears no no its no use i know what youre going to say ive said it often to others i cant afford to take care of myself and theres an end of it if a fortnights holiday would save my life id have to die i shall get on as others have to get on we cant all go to st moritz or to egypt you know sir ralph dont talk about it  embarrassed silence  sir patrick grunts and looks hard at ridgeon  schutzmacher looking at his watch and rising i must go its been a very pleasant evening colly you might let me have my portrait if you dont mind ill send mr dubedat that couple of sovereigns for it  ridgeon giving him the menu card oh dont do that loony i dont think hed like that  schutzmacher well of course i shant if you feel that way about it but i dont think you understand dubedat however perhaps thats because im a jew goodnight dr blenkinsop shaking hands  blenkinsop goodnight siri meangoodnight  schutzmacher waving his hand to the rest goodnight everybody  walpole  b b  sir patrick  goodnight ridgeon   b b repeats the salutation several times in varied musical tones schutzmacher goes out  sir patrick its time for us all to move he rises and comes between blenkinsop and walpole ridgeon also rises mr walpole take blenkinsop home hes had enough of the open air cure for tonight have you a thick overcoat to wear in the motor dr blenkinsop  blenkinsop oh theyll give me some brown paper in the hotel and a few thicknesses of brown paper across the chest are better than any fur coat  walpole well come along goodnight colly youre coming with us arnt you b b  b b yes im coming walpole and blenkinsop go into the hotel goodnight my dear ridgeon shaking hands affectionately dont let us lose sight of your interesting patient and his very charming wife we must not judge him too hastily you know with unction g o o o o o o o o dnight paddy bless you dear old chap sir patrick utters a formidable grunt b b laughs and pats him indulgently on the shoulder goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight he goodnights himself into the hotel  the others have meanwhile gone without ceremony ridgeon and sir patrick are left alone together ridgeon deep in thought comes down to sir patrick  sir patrick well mr savior of lives which is it to be that honest decent man blenkinsop or that rotten blackguard of an artist eh  ridgeon its not an easy case to judge is it blenkinsops an honest decent man but is he any use dubedats a rotten blackguard but hes a genuine source of pretty and pleasant and good things  sir patrick what will he be a source of for that poor innocent wife of his when she finds him out  ridgeon thats true her life will be a hell  sir patrick and tell me this suppose you had this choice put before you either to go through life and find all the pictures bad but all the men and women good or to go through life and find all the pictures good and all the men and women rotten which would you choose  ridgeon thats a devilishly difficult question paddy the pictures are so agreeable and the good people so infernally disagreeable and mischievous that i really cant undertake to say offhand which i should prefer to do without  sir patrick come come none of your cleverness with me im too old for it blenkinsop isnt that sort of good man and you know it  ridgeon it would be simpler if blenkinsop could paint dubedats pictures  sir patrick it would be simpler still if dubedat had some of blenkinsops honesty the world isnt going to be made simple for you my lad you must take it as it is youve to hold the scales between blenkinsop and dubedat hold them fairly  ridgeon well ill be as fair as i can ill put into one scale all the pounds dubedat has borrowed and into the other all the halfcrowns that blenkinsop hasnt borrowed  sir patrick and youll take out of dubedats scale all the faith he has destroyed and the honor he has lost and youll put into blenkinsops scale all the faith he has justified and the honor he has created  ridgeon come come paddy none of your claptrap with me im too sceptical for it im not at all convinced that the world wouldnt be a better world if everybody behaved as dubedat does than it is now that everybody behaves as blenkinsop does  sir patrick then why dont you behave as dubedat does  ridgeon ah that beats me thats the experimental test still its a dilemma its a dilemma you see theres a complication we havnt mentioned  sir patrick whats that  ridgeon well if i let blenkinsop die at least nobody can say i did it because i wanted to marry his widow  sir patrick eh whats that  ridgeon now if i let dubedat die ill marry his widow  sir patrick perhaps she wont have you you know  ridgeon with a selfassured shake of the head ive a pretty good flair for that sort of thing i know when a woman is interested in me she is  sir patrick well sometimes a man knows best and sometimes he knows worst youd much better cure them both  ridgeon i cant im at my limit i can squeeze in one more case but not two i must choose  sir patrick well you must choose as if she didnt exist thats clear  ridgeon is that clear to you mind its not clear to me she troubles my judgment  sir patrick to me its a plain choice between a man and a lot of pictures  ridgeon its easier to replace a dead man than a good picture  sir patrick colly when you live in an age that runs to pictures and statues and plays and brass bands because its men and women are not good enough to comfort its poor aching soul you should thank providence that you belong to a profession which is a high and great profession because its business is to heal and mend men and women  ridgeon in short as a member of a high and great profession im to kill my patient  sir patrick dont talk wicked nonsense you cant kill him but you can leave him in other hands  ridgeon in b bs for instance eh looking at him significantly  sir patrick demurely facing his look sir ralph bloomfield bonington is a very eminent physician  ridgeon he is  sir patrick im going for my hat  ridgeon strikes the bell as sir patrick makes for the hotel a waiter comes  ridgeon to the waiter my bill please  waiter yes sir  he goes for it     act iii  in dubedats studio viewed from the large window the outer door is in the wall on the left at the near end the door leading to the inner rooms is in the opposite wall at the far end the facing wall has neither window nor door the plaster on all the walls is uncovered and undecorated except by scrawlings of charcoal sketches and memoranda there is a studio throne a chair on a dais a little to the left opposite the inner door and an easel to the right opposite the outer door with a dilapidated chair at it near the easel and against the wall is a bare wooden table with bottles and jars of oil and medium paintsmudged rags tubes of color brushes charcoal a small last figure a kettle and spiritlamp and other odds and ends by the table is a sofa littered with drawing blocks sketchbooks loose sheets of paper newspapers books and more smudged rags next the outer door is an umbrella and hat stand occupied partly by louis hats and cloak and muffler and partly by odds and ends of costumes there is an old piano stool on the near side of this door in the corner near the inner door is a little teatable a lay figure in a cardinals robe and hat with an hourglass in one hand and a scythe slung on its back smiles with inane malice at louis who in a milkmans smock much smudged with colors is painting a piece of brocade which he has draped about his wife  she is sitting on the throne not interested in the painting and appealing to him very anxiously about another matter  mrs dubedat promise  louis putting on a touch of paint with notable skill and care and answering quite perfunctorily i promise my darling  mrs dubedat when you want money you will always come to me  louis but its so sordid dearest i hate money i cant keep always bothering you for money money money thats what drives me sometimes to ask other people though i hate doing it  mrs dubedat it is far better to ask me dear it gives people a wrong idea of you  louis but i want to spare your little fortune and raise money on my own work dont be unhappy love i can easily earn enough to pay it all back i shall have a onemanshow next season and then there will be no more money troubles putting down his palette there i mustnt do any more on that until its bonedry so you may come down  mrs dubedat throwing off the drapery as she steps down and revealing a plain frock of tussore silk but you have promised remember seriously and faithfully never to borrow again until you have first asked me  louis seriously and faithfully embracing her ah my love how right you are how much it means to me to have you by me to guard me against living too much in the skies on my solemn oath from this moment forth i will never borrow another penny  mrs dubedat delighted ah thats right does his wicked worrying wife torment him and drag him down from the clouds she kisses him and now dear wont you finish those drawings for maclean  louis oh they dont matter ive got nearly all the money from him in advance  mrs dubedat but dearest that is just the reason why you should finish them he asked me the other day whether you really intended to finish them  louis confound his impudence what the devil does he take me for now that just destroys all my interest in the beastly job ive a good mind to throw up the commission and pay him back his money  mrs dubedat we cant afford that dear you had better finish the drawings and have done with them i think it is a mistake to accept money in advance  louis but how are we to live  mrs dubedat well louis it is getting hard enough as it is now that they are all refusing to pay except on delivery  louis damn those fellows they think of nothing and care for nothing but their wretched money  mrs dubedat still if they pay us they ought to have what they pay for  louis coaxing there now thats enough lecturing for today ive promised to be good havnt i  mrs dudebat putting her arms round his neck you know that i hate lecturing and that i dont for a moment misunderstand you dear dont you  louis fondly i know i know im a wretch and youre an angel oh if only i were strong enough to work steadily id make my darlings house a temple and her shrine a chapel more beautiful than was ever imagined i cant pass the shops without wrestling with the temptation to go in and order all the really good things they have for you  mrs dubedat i want nothing but you dear she gives him a caress to which he responds so passionately that she disengages herself there be good now remember that the doctors are coming this morning isnt it extraordinarily kind of them louis to insist on coming all of them to consult about you  louis coolly oh i daresay they think it will be a feather in their cap to cure a rising artist they wouldnt come if it didnt amuse them anyhow someone knocks at the door i say its not time yet is it  mrs dudebat no not quite yet  louis opening the door and finding ridgeon there hello ridgeon delighted to see you come in  mrs dudebat shaking hands its so good of you to come doctor  louis excuse this place wont you its only a studio you know theres no real convenience for living here but we pig along somehow thanks to jennifer  mrs dubedat now ill run away perhaps later on when youre finished with louis i may come in and hear the verdict ridgeon bows rather constrainedly would you rather i didnt  ridgeon not at all not at all  mrs dubedat looks at him a little puzzled by his formal manner then goes into the inner room  louis flippantly i say dont look so grave theres nothing awful going to happen is there  ridgeon no  louis thats all right poor jennifer has been looking forward to your visit more than you can imagine shes taken quite a fancy to you ridgeon the poor girl has nobody to talk to im always painting taking up a sketch theres a little sketch i made of her yesterday  ridgeon she shewed it to me a fortnight ago when she first called on me  louis quite unabashed oh did she good lord how time does fly i could have sworn id only just finished it its hard for her here seeing me piling up drawings and nothing coming in for them of course i shall sell them next year fast enough after my onemanshow but while the grass grows the steed starves i hate to have her coming to me for money and having none to give her but what can i do  ridgeon i understood that mrs dubedat had some property of her own  louis oh yes a little but how could a man with any decency of feeling touch that suppose i did what would she have to live on if i died im not insured cant afford the premiums picking out another drawing how do you like that  ridgeon putting it aside i have not come here today to look at your drawings i have more serious and pressing business with you  louis you want to sound my wretched lung with impulsive candor my dear ridgeon ill be frank with you whats the matter in this house isnt lungs but bills it doesnt matter about me but jennifer has actually to economize in the matter of food youve made us feel that we can treat you as a friend will you lend us a hundred and fifty pounds  ridgeon no  louis surprised why not  ridgeon i am not a rich man and i want every penny i can spare and more for my researches  louis you mean youd want the money back again  ridgeon i presume people sometimes have that in view when they lend money  louis after a moments reflection well i can manage that for you ill give you a chequeor see here theres no reason why you shouldnt have your bit too ill give you a cheque for two hundred  ridgeon why not cash the cheque at once without troubling me  louis bless you they wouldnt cash it im overdrawn as it is no the way to work it is this ill postdate the cheque next october in october jennifers dividends come in well you present the cheque it will be returned marked refer to drawer or some rubbish of that sort then you can take it to jennifer and hint that if the cheque isnt taken up at once i shall be put in prison shell pay you like a shot youll clear 50 pounds and youll do me a real service for i do want the money very badly old chap i assure you  ridgeon staring at him you see no objection to the transaction and you anticipate none from me  louis well what objection can there be its quite safe i can convince you about the dividends  ridgeon i mean on the score of its beingshall i say dishonorable  louis well of course i shouldnt suggest it if i didnt want the money  ridgeon indeed well you will have to find some other means of getting it  louis do you mean that you refuse  ridgeon do i mean letting his indignation loose of course i refuse man what do you take me for how dare you make such a proposal to me  louis why not  ridgeon faugh you would not understand me if i tried to explain now once for all i will not lend you a farthing i should be glad to help your wife but lending you money is no service to her  louis oh well if youre in earnest about helping her ill tell you what you might do you might get your patients to buy some of my things or to give me a few portrait commissions  ridgeon my patients call me in as a physician not as a commercial traveller  a knock at the door  louis goes unconcernedly to open it pursuing the subject as he goes  louis but you must have great influence with them you must know such lots of things about themprivate things that they wouldnt like to have known they wouldnt dare to refuse you  ridgeon exploding well upon my  louis opens the door and admits sir patrick sir ralph and walpole  ridgeon proceeding furiously walpole ive been here hardly ten minutes and already hes tried to borrow 150 pounds from me then he proposed that i should get the money for him by blackmailing his wife and youve just interrupted him in the act of suggesting that i should blackmail my patients into sitting to him for their portraits  louis well ridgeon if this is what you call being an honorable man i spoke to you in confidence  sir patrick were all going to speak to you in confidence young man  walpole hanging his hat on the only peg left vacant on the hatstand we shall make ourselves at home for half an hour dubedat dont be alarmed youre a most fascinating chap and we love you  louis oh all right all right sit downanywhere you can take this chair sir patrick indicating the one on the throne upzzz helping him up sir patrick grunts and enthrones himself here you are b b sir ralph glares at the familiarity but louis quite undisturbed puts a big book and a sofa cushion on the dais on sir patricks right and b b sits down under protest let me take your hat he takes b bs hat unceremoniously and substitutes it for the cardinals hat on the head of the lay figure thereby ingeniously destroying the dignity of the conclave he then draws the piano stool from the wall and offers it to walpole you dont mind this walpole do you walpole accepts the stool and puts his hand into his pocket for his cigaret case missing it he is reminded of his loss  walpole by the way ill trouble you for my cigaret case if you dont mind  louis what cigaret case  walpole the gold one i lent you at the star and garter  louis surprised was that yours  walpole yes  louis im awfully sorry old chap i wondered whose it was im sorry to say this is all thats left of it he hitches up his smock produces a card from his waistcoat pocket and hands it to walpole  walpole a pawn ticket  louis reassuringly its quite safe he cant sell it for a year you know i say my dear walpole i am sorry he places his hand ingenuously on walpoles shoulder and looks frankly at him  walpole sinking on the stool with a gasp dont mention it it adds to your fascination  ridgeon who has been standing near the easel before we go any further you have a debt to pay mr dubedat  louis i have a precious lot of debts to pay ridgeon ill fetch you a chair he makes for the inner door  ridgeon stopping him you shall not leave the room until you pay it its a small one and pay it you must and shall i dont so much mind your borrowing 10 pounds from one of my guests and 20 pounds from the other  walpole i walked into it you know i offered it  ridgeonthey could afford it but to clean poor blenkinsop out of his last halfcrown was damnable i intend to give him that halfcrown and to be in a position to pledge him my word that you paid it ill have that out of you at all events  b b quite right ridgeon quite right come young man down with the dust pay up  louis oh you neednt make such a fuss about it of course ill pay it i had no idea the poor fellow was hard up im as shocked as any of you about it putting his hand into his pocket here you are finding his pocket empty oh i say i havnt any money on me just at present walpole would you mind lending me halfacrown just to settle this  walpole lend you halfhis voice faints away  louis well if you dont blenkinsop wont get it for i havnt a rap you may search my pockets if you like  walpole thats conclusive he produces halfacrown  louis passing it to ridgeon there im really glad thats settled it was the only thing that was on my conscience now i hope youre all satisfied  sir patrick not quite mr dubedat do you happen to know a young woman named minnie tinwell  louis minnie i should think i do and minnie knows me too shes a really nice good girl considering her station whats become of her  walpole its no use bluffing dubedat weve seen minnies marriage lines  louis coolly indeed have you seen jennifers  ridgeon rising in irrepressible rage do you dare insinuate that mrs dubedat is living with you without being married to you  louis why not  b b  echoing him in  why not sir patrick  various tones of  why not ridgeon  scandalized  why not walpole  amazement  why not  louis yes why not lots of people do it just as good people as you why dont you learn to think instead of bleating and bashing like a lot of sheep when you come up against anything youre not accustomed to contemplating their amazed faces with a chuckle i say i should like to draw the lot of you now you do look jolly foolish especially you ridgeon i had you that time you know  ridgeon how pray  louis well you set up to appreciate jennifer you know and you despise me dont you  ridgeon curtly i loathe you he sits down again on the sofa  louis just so and yet you believe that jennifer is a bad lot because you think i told you so  ridgeon were you lying  louis no but you were smelling out a scandal instead of keeping your mind clean and wholesome i can just play with people like you i only asked you had you seen jennifers marriage lines and you concluded straight away that she hadnt got any you dont know a lady when you see one  b b majestically what do you mean by that may i ask  louis now im only an immoral artist but if youd told me that jennifer wasnt married id have had the gentlemanly feeling and artistic instinct to say that she carried her marriage certificate in her face and in her character but you are all moral men and jennifer is only an artists wifeprobably a model and morality consists in suspecting other people of not being legally married arnt you ashamed of yourselves can one of you look me in the face after it  walpole its very hard to look you in the face dubedat you have such a dazzling cheek what about minnie tinwell eh  louis minnie tinwell is a young woman who has had three weeks of glorious happiness in her poor little life which is more than most girls in her position get i can tell you ask her whether shed take it back if she could shes got her name into history that girl my little sketches of her will be bought by collectors at christies shell have a page in my biography pretty good that for a stillroom maid at a seaside hotel i think what have you fellows done for her to compare with that  ridgeon we havnt trapped her into a mock marriage and deserted her  louis no you wouldnt have the pluck but dont fuss yourselves i didnt desert little minnie we spent all our money  walpole all her money thirty pounds  louis i said all our money hers and mine too her thirty pounds didnt last three days i had to borrow four times as much to spend on her but i didnt grudge it and she didnt grudge her few pounds either the brave little lassie when we were cleaned out wed had enough of it you can hardly suppose that we were fit company for longer than that i an artist and she quite out of art and literature and refined living and everything else there was no desertion no misunderstanding no police court or divorce court sensation for you moral chaps to lick your lips over at breakfast we just said well the moneys gone weve had a good time that can never be taken from us so kiss part good friends and she back to service and i back to my studio and my jennifer both the better and happier for our holiday  walpole quite a little poem by george  b b if you had been scientifically trained mr dubedat you would know how very seldom an actual case bears out a principle in medical practice a man may die when scientifically speaking he ought to have lived i have actually known a man die of a disease from which he was scientifically speaking immune but that does not affect the fundamental truth of science in just the same way in moral cases a mans behavior may be quite harmless and even beneficial when he is morally behaving like a scoundrel and he may do great harm when he is morally acting on the highest principles but that does not affect the fundamental truth of morality  sir patrick and it doesnt affect the criminal law on the subject of bigamy  louis oh bigamy bigamy bigamy what a fascination anything connected with the police has for you all you moralists ive proved to you that you were utterly wrong on the moral point now im going to shew you that youre utterly wrong on the legal point and i hope it will be a lesson to you not to be so jolly cocksure next time  walpole rot you were married already when you married her and that settles it  louis does it why cant you think how do you know she wasnt married already too  bb  all  walpole ridgeon ridgeon  crying  this is beyond everything walpole  out  well damn me sir patrick  together  you young rascal  louis ignoring their outcry she was married to the steward of a liner he cleared out and left her and she thought poor girl that it was the law that if you hadnt heard of your husband for three years you might marry again so as she was a thoroughly respectable girl and refused to have anything to say to me unless we were married i went through the ceremony to please her and to preserve her selfrespect  ridgeon did you tell her you were already married  louis of course not dont you see that if she had known she wouldnt have considered herself my wife you dont seem to understand somehow  sir patrick you let her risk imprisonment in her ignorance of the law  louis well i risked imprisonment for her sake i could have been had up for it just as much as she but when a man makes a sacrifice of that sort for a woman he doesnt go and brag about it to her at least not if hes a gentleman  walpole what are we to do with this daisy  louis impatiently oh go and do whatever the devil you please put minnie in prison put me in prison kill jennifer with the disgrace of it all and then when youve done all the mischief you can go to church and feel good about it he sits down pettishly on the old chair at the easel and takes up a sketching block on which he begins to draw  walpole hes got us  sir patrick grimly he has  b b but is he to be allowed to defy the criminal law of the land  sir patrick the criminal law is no use to decent people it only helps blackguards to blackmail their families what are we family doctors doing half our time but conspiring with the family solicitor to keep some rascal out of jail and some family out of disgrace  b b but at least it will punish him  sir patrick oh yes itll punish him itll punish not only him but everybody connected with him innocent and guilty alike itll throw his board and lodging on our rates and taxes for a couple of years and then turn him loose on us a more dangerous blackguard than ever itll put the girl in prison and ruin her itll lay his wifes life waste you may put the criminal law out of your head once for all its only fit for fools and savages  louis would you mind turning your face a little more this way sir patrick sir patrick turns indignantly and glares at him oh thats too much  sir patrick put down your foolish pencil man and think of your position you can defy the laws made by men but there are other laws to reckon with do you know that youre going to die  louis were all going to die arnt we  walpole were not all going to die in six months  louis how do you know  this for b b is the last straw he completely loses his temper and begins to walk excitedly about  b b upon my soul i will not stand this it is in questionable taste under any circumstances or in any company to harp on the subject of death but it is a dastardly advantage to take of a medical man thundering at dubedat i will not allow it do you hear  louis well i didnt begin it you chaps did its always the way with the inartistic professions when theyre beaten in argument they fall back on intimidation i never knew a lawyer who didnt threaten to put me in prison sooner or later i never knew a parson who didnt threaten me with damnation and now you threaten me with death with all your talk youve only one real trump in your hand and thats intimidation well im not a coward so its no use with me  b b advancing upon him ill tell you what you are sir youre a scoundrel  louis oh i dont mind you calling me a scoundrel a bit its only a word a word that you dont know the meaning of what is a scoundrel  b b you are a scoundrel sir  louis just so what is a scoundrel i am what am i a scoundrel its just arguing in a circle and you imagine youre a man of science  b b iiii have a good mind to take you by the scruff of your neck you infamous rascal and give you a sound thrashing  louis i wish you would youd pay me something handsome to keep it out of court afterwards b b baffled flings away from him with a snort have you any more civilities to address to me in my own house i should like to get them over before my wife comes back he resumes his sketching  ridgeon my minds made up when the law breaks down honest men must find a remedy for themselves i will not lift a finger to save this reptile  b b that is the word i was trying to remember reptile  walpole i cant help rather liking you dubedat but you certainly are a thoroughgoing specimen  sir patrick you know our opinion of you now at all events  louis patiently putting down his pencil look here all this is no good you dont understand you imagine that im simply an ordinary criminal  walpole not an ordinary one dubedat do yourself justice  louis well youre on the wrong tack altogether im not a criminal all your moralizings have no value for me i dont believe in morality im a disciple of bernard shaw  sir patrick puzzled eh  bb waving his hand as if the subject was now disposed of thats enough i wish to hear no more  louis of course i havnt the ridiculous vanity to set up to be exactly a superman but still its an ideal that i strive towards just as any other man strives towards his ideal  b b intolerant dont trouble to explain i now understand you perfectly say no more please when a man pretends to discuss science morals and religion and then avows himself a follower of a notorious and avowed antivaccinationist there is nothing more to be said suddenly putting in an effusive saving clause in parenthesis to ridgeon not my dear ridgeon that i believe in vaccination in the popular sense any more than you do i neednt tell you that but there are things that place a man socially and antivaccination is one of them he resumes his seat on the dais  sir patrick bernard shaw i never heard of him hes a methodist preacher i suppose  louis scandalized no no hes the most advanced man now living he isnt anything  sir patrick i assure you young man my father learnt the doctrine of deliverance from sin from john wesleys own lips before you or mr shaw were born it used to be very popular as an excuse for putting sand in sugar and water in milk youre a sound methodist my lad only you dont know it  louis seriously annoyed for the first time its an intellectual insult i dont believe theres such a thing as sin  sir patrick well sir there are people who dont believe theres such a thing as disease either they call themselves christian scientists i believe theyll just suit your complaint we can do nothing for you he rises good afternoon to you  louis running to him piteously oh dont get up sir patrick dont go please dont i didnt mean to shock you on my word do sit down again give me another chance two minutes more thats all i ask  sir patrick surprised by this sign of grace and a little touched wellhe sits down  louis gratefully thanks awfully  sir patrick continuing i dont mind giving you two minutes more but dont address yourself to me for ive retired from practice and i dont pretend to be able to cure your complaint your life is in the hands of these gentlemen  ridgeon not in mine my hands are full i have no time and no means available for this case  sir patrick what do you say mr walpole  walpole oh ill take him in hand i dont mind i feel perfectly convinced that this is not a moral case at all its a physical one theres something abnormal about his brain that means probably some morbid condition affecting the spinal cord and that means the circulation in short its clear to me that hes suffering from an obscure form of bloodpoisoning which is almost certainly due to an accumulation of ptomaines in the nuciform sac ill remove the sac  louis changing color do you mean operate on me ugh no thank you  walpole never fear you wont feel anything youll be under an anaesthetic of course and it will be extraordinarily interesting  louis oh well if it would interest you and if it wont hurt thats another matter how much will you give me to let you do it  walpole rising indignantly how much what do you mean  louis well you dont expect me to let you cut me up for nothing do you  walpole will you paint my portrait for nothing  louis no but ill give you the portrait when its painted and you can sell it afterwards for perhaps double the money but i cant sell my nuciform sac when youve cut it out  walpole ridgeon did you ever hear anything like this to louis well you can keep your nuciform sac and your tubercular lung and your diseased brain ive done with you one would think i was not conferring a favor on the fellow he returns to his stool in high dudgeon  sir patrick that leaves only one medical man who has not withdrawn from your case mr dubedat you have nobody left to appeal to now but sir ralph bloomfield bonington  walpole if i were you b b i shouldnt touch him with a pair of tongs let him take his lungs to the brompton hospital they wont cure him but theyll teach him manners  b b my weakness is that i have never been able to say no even to the most thoroughly undeserving people besides i am bound to say that i dont think it is possible in medical practice to go into the question of the value of the lives we save just consider ridgeon let me put it to you paddy clear your mind of cant walpole  walpole indignantly my mind is clear of cant  b b quite so well now look at my practice it is what i suppose you would call a fashionable practice a smart practice a practice among the best people you ask me to go into the question of whether my patients are of any use either to themselves or anyone else well if you apply any scientific test known to me you will achieve a reductio ad absurdum you will be driven to the conclusion that the majority of them would be as my friend mr j m barrie has tersely phrased it better dead better dead there are exceptions no doubt for instance there is the court an essentially socialdemocratic institution supported out of public funds by the public because the public wants it and likes it my court patients are hardworking people who give satisfaction undoubtedly then i have a duke or two whose estates are probably better managed than they would be in public hands but as to most of the rest if i once began to argue about them unquestionably the verdict would be better dead when they actually do die i sometimes have to offer that consolation thinly disguised to the family lulled by the cadences of his own voice he becomes drowsier and drowsier the fact that they spend money so extravagantly on medical attendance really would not justify me in wasting my talentssuch as they arein keeping them alive after all if my fees are high i have to spend heavily my own tastes are simple a camp bed a couple of rooms a crust a bottle of wine and i am happy and contented my wifes tastes are perhaps more luxurious but even she deplores an expenditure the sole object of which is to maintain the state my patients require from their medical attendant theererersuddenly waking up i have lost the thread of these remarks what was i talking about ridgeon  ridgeon about dubedat  b b ah yes precisely thank you dubedat of course well what is our friend dubedat a vicious and ignorant young man with a talent for drawing  louis thank you dont mind me  b b but then what are many of my patients vicious and ignorant young men without a talent for anything if i were to stop to argue about their merits i should have to give up threequarters of my practice therefore i have made it a rule not so to argue now as an honorable man having made that rule as to paying patients can i make an exception as to a patient who far from being a paying patient may more fitly be described as a borrowing patient no i say no mr dubedat your moral character is nothing to me i look at you from a purely scientific point of view to me you are simply a field of battle in which an invading army of tubercle bacilli struggles with a patriotic force of phagocytes having made a promise to your wife which my principles will not allow me to break to stimulate those phagocytes i will stimulate them and i take no further responsibility he digs himself back in his seat exhausted  sir patrick well mr dubedat as sir ralph has very kindly offered to take charge of your case and as the two minutes i promised you are up i must ask you to excuse me he rises  louis oh certainly ive quite done with you rising and holding up the sketch block there while youve been talking ive been doing what is there left of your moralizing only a little carbonic acid gas which makes the room unhealthy what is there left of my work that look at it ridgeon rises to look at it  sir patrick who has come down to him from the throne you young rascal was it drawing me you were  louis of course what else  sir patrick takes the drawing from him and grunts approvingly thats rather good dont you think so lolly  ridgeon yes so good that i should like to have it  sir patrick thank you but i should like to have it myself what dye think walpole  walpole rising and coming over to look no by jove i must have this  louis i wish i could afford to give it to you sir patrick but id pay five guineas sooner than part with it  ridgeon oh for that matter i will give you six for it  walpole ten  louis i think sir patrick is morally entitled to it as he sat for it may i send it to your house sir patrick for twelve guineas  sir patrick twelve guineas not if you were president of the royal academy young man he gives him back the drawing decisively and turns away taking up his hat  louis to b b would you like to take it at twelve sir ralph  b b coming between louis and walpole twelve guineas thank you ill take it at that he takes it and presents it to sir patrick accept it from me paddy and may you long be spared to contemplate it  sir patrick thank you he puts the drawing into his hat  b b i neednt settle with you now mr dubedat my fees will come to more than that he also retrieves his hat  louis indignantly well of all the meanwords fail him id let myself be shot sooner than do a thing like that i consider youve stolen that drawing  sir patrick drily so weve converted you to a belief in morality after all eh  louis yah to walpole ill do another one for you walpole if youll let me have the ten you promised  walpole very good ill pay on delivery  louis oh what do you take me for have you no confidence in my honor  walpole none whatever  louis oh well of course if you feel that way you cant help it before you go sir patrick let me fetch jennifer i know shed like to see you if you dont mind he goes to the inner door and now before she comes in one word youve all been talking here pretty freely about mein my own house too i dont mind that im a man and can take care of myself but when jennifer comes in please remember that shes a lady and that you are supposed to be gentlemen he goes out  walpole well he gives the situation up as indescribable and goes for his hat  ridgeon damn his impudence  b b i shouldnt be at all surprised to learn that hes well connected whenever i meet dignity and selfpossession without any discoverable basis i diagnose good family  ridgeon diagnose artistic genius b b thats what saves his selfrespect  sir patrick the world is made like that the decent fellows are always being lectured and put out of countenance by the snobs  b b altogether refusing to accept this i am not out of countenance i should like by jupiter to see the man who could put me out of countenance jennifer comes in ah mrs dubedat and how are we today  mrs dubedat shaking hands with him thank you all so much for coming she shakes walpoles hand thank you sir patrick she shakes sir patricks oh life has been worth living since i have known you since richmond i have not known a moments fear and it used to be nothing but fear wont you sit down and tell me the result of the consultation  walpole ill go if you dont mind mrs dubedat i have an appointment before i go let me say that i am quite agreed with my colleagues here as to the character of the case as to the cause and the remedy thats not my business im only a surgeon and these gentlemen are physicians and will advise you i may have my own views in fact i have them and they are perfectly well known to my colleagues if i am neededand needed i shall be finallythey know where to find me and i am always at your service so for today goodbye he goes out leaving jennifer much puzzled by his unexpected withdrawal and formal manner  sir patrick i also will ask you to excuse me mrs dubedat  ridgeon anxiously are you going  sir patrick yes i can be of no use here and i must be getting back as you know maam im not in practice now and i shall not be in charge of the case it rests between sir colenso ridgeon and sir ralph bloomfield bonington they know my opinion good afternoon to you maam he bows and makes for the door  mrs dubedat detaining him theres nothing wrong is there you dont think louis is worse do you  sir patrick no hes not worse just the same as at richmond  mrs dubedat oh thank you you frightened me excuse me  sir patrick dont mention it maam he goes out  b b now mrs dubedat if i am to take the patient in hand  mrs dubedat apprehensively with a glance at ridgeon you but i thought that sir colenso  b b beaming with the conviction that he is giving her a most gratifying surprise my dear lady your husband shall have me  mrs dubedat but  b b not a word it is a pleasure to me for your sake sir colenso ridgeon will be in his proper place in the bacteriological laboratory i shall be in my proper place at the bedside your husband shall be treated exactly as if he were a member of the royal family mrs dubedat uneasy again is about to protest no gratitude it would embarrass me i assure you now may i ask whether you are particularly tied to these apartments of course the motor has annihilated distance but i confess that if you were rather nearer to me it would be a little more convenient  mrs dubedat you see this studio and flat are selfcontained i have suffered so much in lodgings the servants are so frightfully dishonest  b b ah are they are they dear me  mrs dubedat i was never accustomed to lock things up and i missed so many small sums at last a dreadful thing happened i missed a fivepound note it was traced to the housemaid and she actually said louis had given it to her and he wouldnt let me do anything he is so sensitive that these things drive him mad  b b ahhmhayessay no more mrs dubedat you shall not move if the mountain will not come to mahomet mahomet must come to the mountain now i must be off i will write and make an appointment we shall begin stimulating the phagocytes ononprobably on tuesday next but i will let you know depend on me dont fret eat regularly sleep well keep your spirits up keep the patient cheerful hope for the best no tonic like a charming woman no medicine like cheerfulness no resource like science goodbye goodbye goodbye having shaken handsshe being too overwhelmed to speakhe goes out stopping to say to ridgeon on tuesday morning send me down a tube of some really stiff antitoxin any kind will do dont forget goodbye colly he goes out  ridgeon you look quite discouraged again she is almost in tears whats the matter are you disappointed  mrs dubedat i know i ought to be very grateful believe me i am very grateful butbut  ridgeon well  hills dubedat i had set my heart your curing louis  ridgeon well sir ralph bloomfield bonington  mrs dubedat yes i know i know it is a great privilege to have him but oh i wish it had been you i know its unreasonable i cant explain but i had such a strong instinct that you would cure him i dont i cant feel the same about sir ralph you promised me why did you give louis up  ridgeon i explained to you i cannot take another case  mrs dubedat but at richmond  ridgeon at richmond i thought i could make room for one more case but my old friend dr blenkinsop claimed that place his lung is attacked  mrs dubedat attaching no importance whatever to blenkinsop do you mean that elderly manthat rather  ridgeon sternly i mean the gentleman that dined with us an excellent and honest man whose life is as valuable as anyone elses i have arranged that i shall take his case and that sir ralph bloomfield bonington shall take mr dubedats  mrs dubedat turning indignantly on him i see what it is oh it is envious mean cruel and i thought that you would be above such a thing  ridgeon what do you mean  mrs dubedat oh do you think i dont know do you think it has never happened before why does everybody turn against him can you not forgive him for being superior to you for being cleverer for being braver for being a great artist  ridgeon yes i can forgive him for all that  mrs dubedat well have you anything to say against him i have challenged everyone who has turned against himchallenged them face to face to tell me any wrong thing he has done any ignoble thought he has uttered they have always confessed that they could not tell me one i challenge you now what do you accuse him of  ridgeon i am like all the rest face to face i cannot tell you one thing against him  mrs dubedat not satisfied but your manner is changed and you have broken your promise to me to make room for him as your patient  ridgeon i think you are a little unreasonable you have had the very best medical advice in london for him and his case has been taken in hand by a leader of the profession surely  mrs dubedat oh it is so cruel to keep telling me that it seems all right and it puts me in the wrong but i am not in the wrong i have faith in you and i have no faith in the others we have seen so many doctors i have come to know at last when they are only talking and can do nothing it is different with you i feel that you know you must listen to me doctor with sudden misgiving am i offending you by calling you doctor instead of remembering your title  ridgeon nonsense i am a doctor but mind you dont call walpole one  mrs dubebat i dont care about mr walpole it is you who must befriend me oh will you please sit down and listen to me just for a few minutes he assents with a grave inclination and sits on the sofa she sits on the easel chair thank you i wont keep you long but i must tell you the whole truth listen i know louis as nobody else in the world knows him or ever can know him i am his wife i know he has little faults impatiences sensitivenesses even little selfishnesses that are too trivial for him to notice i know that he sometimes shocks people about money because he is so utterly above it and cant understand the value ordinary people set on it tell me did hedid he borrow any money from you  ridgeon he asked me for some once  mrs dubedat tears again in her eyes oh i am so sorryso sorry but he will never do it again i pledge you my word for that he has given me his promise here in this room just before you came and he is incapable of breaking his word that was his only real weakness and now it is conquered and done with for ever  ridgeon was that really his only weakness  mrs dubedat he is perhaps sometimes weak about women because they adore him so and are always laying traps for him and of course when he says he doesnt believe in morality ordinary pious people think he must be wicked you can understand cant you how all this starts a great deal of gossip about him and gets repeated until even good friends get set against him  ridgeon yes i understand  mrs dubedat oh if you only knew the other side of him as i do do you know doctor that if louis honored himself by a really bad action i should kill myself  ridgeon come dont exaggerate  mrs dubedat i should you dont understand that you east country people  ridgeon you did not see much of the world in cornwall did you  mrs dubedat naively oh yes i saw a great deal every day of the beauty of the worldmore than you ever see here in london but i saw very few people if that is what you mean i was an only child  ridgeon that explains a good deal  mrs dubedat i had a great many dreams but at last they all came to one dream  ridgeon with half a sigh yes the usual dream  mrs dubedat surprised is it usual  ridgeon as i guess you havnt yet told me what it was  mrs dubedat i didnt want to waste myself i could do nothing myself but i had a little property and i could help with it i had even a little beauty dont think me vain for knowing it i always had a terrible struggle with poverty and neglect at first my dream was to save one of them from that and bring some charm and happiness into his life i prayed heaven to send me one i firmly believe that louis was guided to me in answer to my prayer he was no more like the other men i had met than the thames embankment is like our cornish coasts he saw everything that i saw and drew it for me he understood everything he came to me like a child only fancy doctor he never even wanted to marry me he never thought of the things other men think of i had to propose it myself then he said he had no money when i told him i had some he said oh all right just like a boy he is still like that quite unspoiled a man in his thoughts a great poet and artist in his dreams and a child in his ways i gave him myself and all i had that he might grow to his full height with plenty of sunshine if i lost faith in him it would mean the wreck and failure of my life i should go back to cornwall and die i could show you the very cliff i should jump off you must cure him you must make him quite well again for me i know that you can do it and that nobody else can i implore you not to refuse what i am going to ask you to do take louis yourself and let sir ralph cure dr blenkinsop  ridgeon slowly mrs dubedat do you really believe in my knowledge and skill as you say you do  mrs dubedat absolutely i do not give my trust by halves  ridgeon i know that well i am going to test youhard will you believe me when i tell you that i understand what you have just told me that i have no desire but to serve you in the most faithful friendship and that your hero must be preserved to you  mrs dubedat oh forgive me forgive what i said you will preserve him to me  ridgeon at all hazards she kisses his hand he rises hastily no you have not heard the rest she rises too you must believe me when i tell you that the one chance of preserving the hero lies in louis being in the care of sir ralph  mrs dubedat firmly you say so i have no more doubt i believe you thank you  ridgeon goodbye she takes his hand i hope this will be a lasting friendship  mrs dubedat it will my friendships end only with death  ridgeon death ends everything doesnt it goodbye  with a sigh and a look of pity at her which she does not understand he goes     act iv  the studio the easel is pushed back to the wall cardinal death holding his scythe and hourglass like a sceptre and globe sits on the throne on the hatstand hang the hats of sir patrick and bloomfield bonington walpole just come in is hanging up his beside them there is a knock he opens the door and finds ridgeon there  walpole hallo ridgeon  they come into the middle of the room together taking off their gloves  ridgeon whats the matter have you been sent for too  walpole weve all been sent for ive only just come i havnt seen him yet the charwoman says that old paddy cullen has been here with b b for the last halfhour sir patrick with bad news in his face enters from the inner room well whats up  sir patrick go in and see b b is in there with him  walpole goes ridgeon is about to follow him but sir patrick stops him with a look  ridgeon what has happened  sir patrick do you remember jane marshs arm  ridgeon is that whats happened  sir patrick thats whats happened his lung has gone like janes arm i never saw such a case he has got through three months galloping consumption in three days  ridgeon b b got in on the negative phase  sir patrick negative or positive the lads done for he wont last out the afternoon hell go suddenly ive often seen it  ridgeon so long as he goes before his wife finds him out i dont care i fully expected this  sir patrick drily its a little hard on a lad to be killed because his wife has too high an opinion of him fortunately few of us are in any danger of that  sir ralph comes from the inner room and hastens between them humanely concerned but professionally elate and communicative  b b ah here you are ridgeon paddys told you of course  ridgeon yes  b b its an enormously interesting case you know colly by jupiter if i didnt know as a matter of scientific fact that id been stimulating the phagocytes i should say id been stimulating the other things what is the explanation of it sir patrick how do you account for it ridgeon have we overstimulated the phagocytes have they not only eaten up the bacilli but attacked and destroyed the red corpuscles as well a possibility suggested by the patients pallor nay have they finally begun to prey on the lungs themselves or on one another i shall write a paper about this case  walpole comes back very serious even shocked he comes between b b and ridgeon  walpole whew b b youve done it this time  b b what do you mean  walpole killed him the worst case of neglected bloodpoisoning i ever saw its too late now to do anything hed die under the anaesthetic  b b offended killed really walpole if your monomania were not well known i should take such an expession very seriously  sir patrick come come when youve both killed as many people as i have in my time youll feel humble enough about it come and look at him colly  ridgeon and sir patrick go into the inner room  walpole i apologize b b but its bloodpoisoning  b b recovering his irresistible good nature my dear walpole everything is bloodpoisoning but upon my soul i shall not use any of that stuff of ridgeons again what made me so sensitive about what you said just now is that strictly between ourselves ridgeon cooked our young friends goose  jennifer worried and distressed but always gentle comes between them from the inner room she wears a nurses apron  mrs dubedat sir ralph what am i to do that man who insisted on seeing me and sent in word that business was important to louis is a newspaper man a paragraph appeared in the paper this morning saying that louis is seriously ill and this man wants to interview him about it how can people be so brutally callous  walpole moving vengefully towards the door you just leave me to deal with him  mrs dubedat stopping him but louis insists on seeing him he almost began to cry about it and he says he cant bear his room any longer he says he wants to she struggles with a sobto die in his studio sir patrick says let him have his way it can do no harm what shall we do  b b encouragingly why follow sir patricks excellent advice of course as he says it can do him no harm and it will no doubt do him gooda great deal of good he will be much the better for it  mrs dubedat a little cheered will you bring the man up here mr walpole and tell him that he may see louis but that he mustnt exhaust him by talking walpole nods and goes out by the outer door sir ralph dont be angry with me but louis will die if he stays here i must take him to cornwall he will recover there  b b brightening wonderfully as if dubedat were already saved cornwall the very place for him wonderful for the lungs stupid of me not to think of it before you are his best physician after all dear lady an inspiration cornwall of course yes yes yes  mrs dubedat comforted and touched you are so kind sir ralph but dont give me much or i shall cry and louis cant bear that  b b gently putting his protecting arm round her shoulders then let us come back to him and help to carry him in cornwall of course of course the very thing they go together into the bedroom  walpole returns with the newspaper man a cheerful affable young man who is disabled for ordinary business pursuits by a congenital erroneousness which renders him incapable of describing accurately anything he sees or understanding or reporting accurately anything he hears as the only employment in which these defects do not matter is journalism for a newspaper not having to act on its description and reports but only to sell them to idly curious people has nothing but honor to lose by inaccuracy and unveracity he has perforce become a journalist and has to keep up an air of high spirits through a daily struggle with his own illiteracy and the precariousness of his employment he has a notebook and occasionally attempts to make a note but as he cannot write shorthand and does not write with ease in any hand he generally gives it up as a bad job before he succeeds in finishing a sentence  the newspaper man looking round and making indecisive attempts at notes this is the studio i suppose  walpole yes  the newspaper man wittily where he has his models eh  walpole grimly irresponsive no doubt  the newspaper man cubicle you said it was  walpole yes tubercle  the newspaper man which way do you spell it is it cubical or cle  walpole tubercle man not cubical spelling it for him tubercle  the newspaper man oh tubercle some disease i suppose i thought he had consumption are you one of the family or the doctor  walpole im neither one nor the other i am mister cutler walpole put that down then put down sir colenso ridgeon  the newspaper man pigeon  walpole ridgeon contemptuously snatching his book here youd better let me write the names down for you youre sure to get them wrong that comes of belonging to an illiterate profession with no qualifications and no public register he writes the particulars  the newspaper man oh i say you have got your knife into us havnt you  walpole vindictively i wish i had id make a better man of you now attend shewing him the book these are the names of the three doctors this is the patient this is the address this is the name of the disease he shuts the book with a snap which makes the journalist blink and returns it to him mr dubedat will be brought in here presently he wants to see you because he doesnt know how bad he is well allow you to wait a few minutes to humor him but if you talk to him out you go he may die at any moment  the newspaper man interested is he as bad as that i say i am in luck today would you mind letting me photograph you he produces a camera could you have a lancet or something in your hand  walpole put it up if you want my photograph you can get it in baker street in any of the series of celebrities  the newspaper man but theyll want to be paid if you wouldnt mind fingering the camera  walpole i would put it up i tell you sit down there and be quiet  the newspaper man quickly sits down on the piano stool as dubedat in an invalids chair is wheeled in by mrs dubedat and sir ralph they place the chair between the dais and the sofa where the easel stood before louis is not changed as a robust man would be and he is not scared his eyes look larger and he is so weak physically that he can hardly move lying on his cushions with complete languor but his mind is active it is making the most of his condition finding voluptuousness in languor and drama in death they are all impressed in spite of themselves except ridgeon who is implacable bb is entirely sympathetic and forgiving ridgeon follows the chair with a tray of milk and stimulants sir patrick who accompanies him takes the teatable from the corner and places it behind the chair for the tray b b takes the easel chair and places it for jennifer at dubedats side next the dais from which the lay figure ogles the dying artist b b then returns to dubedats left jennifer sits walpole sits down on the edge of the dais ridgeon stands near him  louis blissfully thats happiness to be in a studio happiness  mrs dubedat yes dear sir patrick says you may stay here as long as you like  louis jennifer  mrs dubedat yes my darling  louis is the newspaper man here  the newspaper man glibly yes mr dubedat im here at your service i represent the press i thought you might like to let us have a few words aboutabouterwell a few words on your illness and your plans for the season  louis my plans for the season are very simple im going to die  mrs dubedat tortured louisdearest  louis my darling im very weak and tired dont put on me the horrible strain of pretending that i dont know ive been lying there listening to the doctorslaughing to myself they know dearest dont cry it makes you ugly and i cant bear that she dries her eyes and recovers herself with a proud effort i want you to promise me something  mrs dubedat yes yes you know i will imploringly only my love my love dont talk it will waste your strength  louis no it will only use it up ridgeon give me something to keep me going for a few minutesone of your confounded antitoxins if you dont mind i have some things to say before i go  ridgeon looking at sir patrick i suppose it can do no harm he pours out some spirit and is about to add soda water when sir patrick corrects him  sir patrick in milk dont set him coughing  louis after drinking jennifer  mrs dubedat yes dear  louis if theres one thing i hate more than another its a widow promise me that youll never be a widow  mrs dubedat my dear what do you mean  louis i want you to look beautiful i want people to see in your eyes that you were married to me the people in italy used to point at dante and say there goes the man who has been in hell i want them to point at you and say there goes a woman who has been in heaven it has been heaven darling hasnt itsometimes  mrs dubedat oh yes yes always always  louis if you wear black and cry people will say look at that miserable woman her husband made her miserable  mrs dubedat no never you are the light and the blessing of my life i never lived until i knew you  louis his eyes glistening then you must always wear beautiful dresses and splendid magic jewels think of all the wonderful pictures i shall never paint  she wins a terrible victory over a sob well you must be transfigured with all the beauty of those pictures men must get such dreams from seeing you as they never could get from any daubing with paints and brushes painters must paint you as they never painted any mortal woman before there must be a great tradition of beauty a great atmosphere of wonder and romance that is what men must always think of when they think of me that is the sort of immortality i want you can make that for me jennifer there are lots of things you dont understand that every woman in the street understands but you can understand that and do it as nobody else can promise me that immortality promise me you will not make a little hell of crape and crying and undertakers horrors and withering flowers and all that vulgar rubbish  mrs dubedat i promise but all that is far off dear you are to come to cornwall with me and get well sir ralph says so  louis poor old b b  b b affected to tears turns away and whispers to sir patrick poor fellow brain going  louis sir patricks there isnt he  sir patrick yes yes im here  louis sit down wont you its a shame to keep you standing about  sir patrick yes yes thank you all right  louis jennifer  mrs dubedat yes dear  louis with a strange look of delight do you remember the burning bush  mrs dubedat yes yes oh my dear how it strains my heart to remember it now  louis does it it fills me with joy tell them about it  mrs dubedat it was nothingonly that once in my old cornish home we lit the first fire of the winter and when we looked through the window we saw the flames dancing in a bush in the garden  louis such a color garnet color waving like silk liquid lovely flame flowing up through the bay leaves and not burning them well i shall be a flame like that im sorry to disappoint the poor little worms but the last of me shall be the flame in the burning bush whenever you see the flame jennifer that will be

anyone else touch them  mrs dubedat you can trust me  louis then theres nothing more to worry about is there give me some more of that milk im fearfully tired but if i stop talking i shant begin again sir ralph gives him a drink he takes it and looks up quaintly i say b b do you think anything would stop you talking  b b almost unmanned he confuses me with you paddy poor fellow poor fellow  louis musing i used to be awfully afraid of death but now its come i have no fear and im perfectly happy jennifer  mrs dubedat yes dear  louis ill tell you a secret i used to think that our marriage was all an affectation and that id break loose and run away some day but now that im going to be broken loose whether i like it or not im perfectly fond of you and perfectly satisfied because im going to live as part of you and not as my troublesome self  mrs dubedat heartbroken stay with me louis oh dont leave me dearest  louis not that im selfish with all my faults i dont think ive ever been really selfish no artist can art is too large for that you will marry again jennifer  mrs dubedat oh how can you louis  louis insisting childishly yes because people who have found marriage happy always

devil  sir patrick come youve talked enough try to rest awhile  louis wearily yes im fearfully tired but i shall have a long rest presently i have something to say to you fellows youre all there arnt you im too weak to see anything but jennifers bosom that promises rest  ridgeon we are all here  louis startled that voice sounded devilish take care ridgeon my ears hear things that other peoples cant ive been thinkingthinking im cleverer than you imagine  sir patrick whispering to ridgeon youve got on his nerves colly slip out quietly  ridgeon apart to sir patrick would you deprive the dying actor of his audience  louis his face lighting up faintly with mischievous glee i heard that ridgeon that was good jennifer dear be kind to ridgeon always because he was the last man who amused me  ridgeon relentless was i  louis but its not true its you who are still on the stage im half way home already  mrs dubedat to ridgeon what did you say  louis answering for him nothing dear only one of those little secrets that men keep among themselves well all you chaps have thought pretty hard things of me and said them  b b quite overcome no no dubedat not at all  louis yes you have i know what you all think of me dont imagine im sore about it i forgive you  walpole involuntarily well damn me ashamed i beg your pardon  louis that was old walpole i know dont grieve walpole im perfectly happy im not in pain i dont want to live ive escaped from myself im in heaven immortal in the heart of my beautiful jennifer im not afraid and not ashamed reflectively puzzling it out for himself weakly i know that in an accidental sort of way struggling through the unreal part of life i havnt always been able to live up to my ideal but in my own real world i have never done anything wrong never denied my faith never been untrue to myself ive been threatened and blackmailed and insulted and starved but ive played the game ive fought the good fight and now its all over theres an indescribable peace he feebly folds his hands and utters his creed i believe in michael angelo velasquez and rembrandt in the might of design the mystery of color the redemption of all things by beauty everlasting and the message of art that has made these hands blessed amen amen he closes his eyes and lies still  mrs dubedat breathless louis are you  walpole rises and comes quickly to see whether he is dead  louis not yet dear very nearly but not yet i should like to rest my head on your bosom only it would tire you  mrs dubedat no no no darling how could you tire me she lifts him so that he lies on her bosom  louis thats good thats real  mrs dubedat dont spare me dear indeed indeed you will not tire me lean on me with all your weight  louis with a sudden half return of his normal strength and comfort jinny gwinny i think i shall recover after all sir patrick looks significantly at ridgeon mutely warning him that this is the end  mrs dubedat hopefully yes yes you shall  louis because i suddenly want to sleep just an ordinary sleep  mrs dubedat rocking him yes dear sleep he seems to go to sleep walpole makes another movement she protests shsh please dont disturb him his lips move what did you say dear in great distress i cant listen without moving him his lips move again walpole bends down and listens  walpole he wants to know is the newspaper man here  the newspaper man excited for he has been enjoying himself enormously yes mr dubedat here i am  walpole raises his hand warningly to silence him sir ralph sits down quietly on the sofa and frankly buries his face in his handkerchief  mrs dubedat with great relief oh thats right dear dont spare me lean with all your weight on me now you are really resting  sir patrick quickly comes forward and feels louiss pulse then takes him by the shoulders  sir patrick let me put him back on the pillow maam he will be better so  mrs dubedat piteously oh no please please doctor he is not tiring me and he will be so hurt when he wakes if he finds i have put him away  sir patrick he will never wake again he takes the body from her and replaces it in the chair ridgeon unmoved lets down the back and makes a bier of it  mrs dubedat who has unexpectedly sprung to her feet and stands dryeyed and stately was that death  walpole yes  mrs dubedat with complete dignity will you wait for me a moment i will come back she goes out  walpole ought we to follow her is she in her right senses  sir patrick with quiet conviction yes shes all right leave her alone shell come back  ridgeon callously let us get this thing out of the way before she comes  b b rising shocked my dear colly the poor lad he died splendidly  sir patrick aye that is how the wicked die        for there are no bands in their death       but their strength is firm       they are not in trouble as other men  no matter its not for us to judge hes in another world now  walpole borrowing his first fivepound note there probably  ridgeon i said the other day that the most tragic thing in the world is a sick doctor i was wrong the most tragic thing in the world is a man of genius who is not also a man of honor  ridgeon and walpole wheel the chair into the recess  the newspaper man to sir ralph i thought it shewed a very nice feeling his being so particular about his wife going into proper mourning for him and making her promise never to marry again  b b impressively mrs dubedat is not in a position to carry the interview any further neither are we  sir patrick good afternoon to you  the newspaper man mrs dubedat said she was coming back  b b after you have gone  the newspaper man do you think she would give me a few words on how it feels to be a widow rather a good title for an article isnt it  b b young man if you wait until mrs dubedat comes back you will be able to write an article on how it feels to be turned out of the house  the newspaper man unconvinced you think shed rather not  b b cutting him short good day to you giving him a visitingcard mind you get my name correctly good day  the newspaper man good day thank you vaguely trying to read the card mr  b b no not mister this is your hat i think giving it to him gloves no of course no gloves good day to you he edges him out at last shuts the door on him and returns to sir patrick as ridgeon and walpole come back from the recess walpole crossing the room to the hatstand and ridgeon coming between sir ralph and sir patrick poor fellow poor young fellow how well he died i feel a better man really  sir patrick when youre as old as i am youll know that it matters very little how a man dies what matters is how he lives every fool that runs his nose against a bullet is a hero nowadays because he dies for his country why dont he live for it to some purpose  b b no please paddy dont be hard on the poor lad not now not now after all was he so bad he had only two failings money and women well let us be honest tell the truth paddy dont be hypocritical ridgeon throw off the mask walpole are these two matters so well arranged at present that a disregard of the usual arrangements indicates real depravity  walpole i dont mind his disregarding the usual arrangements confound the usual arrangements to a man of science theyre beneath contempt both as to money and women what i mind is his disregarding everything except his own pocket and his own fancy he didnt disregard the usual arrangements when they paid him did he give us his pictures for nothing do you suppose hed have hesitated to blackmail me if id compromised myself with his wife not he  sir patrick dont waste your time wrangling over him a blackguards a blackguard an honest mans an honest man and neither of them will ever be at a loss for a religion or a morality to prove that their ways are the right ways its the same with nations the same with professions the same all the world over and always will be  b b ah well perhaps perhaps perhaps still de mortuis nil nisi bonum he died extremely well remarkably well he has set us an example let us endeavor to follow it rather than harp on the weaknesses that have perished with him i think it is shakespear who says that the good that most men do lives after them the evil lies interred with their bones yes interred with their bones believe me paddy we are all mortal it is the common lot ridgeon say what you will walpole natures debt must be paid if tis not today twill be tomorrow       tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow      after lifes fitful fever they sleep well      and like this insubstantial bourne from which      no traveller returns      leave not a wrack behind  walpole is about to speak but b b suddenly and vehemently proceeding extinguishes him       out out brief candle      for nothing canst thou to damnation add      the readiness is all  walpole gently for b bs feeling absurdly expressed as it is is too sincere and humane to be ridiculed yes b b death makes people go on like that i dont know why it should but it does by the way what are we going to do ought we to clear out or had we better wait and see whether mrs dubedat will come back  sir patrick i think wed better go we can tell the charwoman what to do  they take their hats and go to the door  mrs dubedat coming from the inner door wonderfully and beautifully dressed and radiant carrying a great piece of purple silk handsomely embroidered over her arm im so sorry to have kept you waiting  sir patrick  amazed all  dont mention it madam bb  together  not at all not at all ridgeon  in a confused  by no means walpole  murmur  it doesnt matter in the least  mrs dubedat coming to them i felt that i must shake hands with his friends once before we part today we have shared together a great privilege and a great happiness i dont think we can ever think of ourselves ordinary people again we have had a wonderful experience and that gives us a common faith a common ideal that nobody else can quite have life will always be beautiful to us death will always be beautiful to us may we shake hands on that  sir patrick shaking hands remember all letters had better be left to your solicitor let him open everything and settle everything thats the law you know  mrs dubedat oh thank you i didnt know sir patrick goes  walpole goodbye i blame myself i should have insisted on operating he goes  bb i will send the proper people they will know it to do you shall have no trouble goodbye my dear lady he goes  ridgeon goodbye he offers his hand  mrs dubedat drawing back with gentle majesty i said his friends sir colenso he bows and goes  she unfolds the great piece of silk and goes into the recess to cover her dead     act v  one of the smaller bond street picture galleries the entrance is from a picture shop nearly in the middle of the gallery there is a writingtable at which the secretary fashionably dressed sits with his back to the entrance correcting catalogue proofs some copies of a new book are on the desk also the secretarys shining hat and a couple of magnifying glasses at the side on his left a little behind him is a small door marked private near the same side is a cushioned bench parallel to the walls which are covered with dubedats works two screens also covered with drawings stand near the corners right and left of the entrance  jennifer beautifully dressed and apparently very happy and prosperous comes into the gallery through the private door  jennifer have the catalogues come yet mr danby  the secretary not yet  jennifer what a shame its a quarter past the private view will begin in less than half an hour  the secretary i think id better run over to the printers to hurry them up  jennifer oh if you would be so good mr danby ill take your place while youre away  the secretary if anyone should come before the time dont take any notice the commissionaire wont let anyone through unless he knows him we have a few people who like to come before the crowdpeople who really buy and of course were glad to see them have you seen the notices in brush and crayon and in the easel  jennifer indignantly yes most disgraceful they write quite patronizingly as if they were mr dubedats superiors after all the cigars and sandwiches they had from us on the press day and all they drank i really think it is infamous that they should write like that i hope you have not sent them tickets for today  the secretary oh they wont come again theres no lunch today the advance copies of your book have come he indicates the new books  jennifer pouncing on a copy wildly excited give it to me oh excuse me a moment she runs away with it through the private door  the secretary takes a mirror from his drawer and smartens himself before going out ridgeon comes in  ridgeon good morning may i look round as well before the doors open  the secretary certainly sir colenso im sorry catalogues have not come im just going to see about them heres my own list if you dont mind  ridgeon thanks whats this he takes up one the new books  the secretary thats just come in an advance copy of mrs dubedats life of her late husband  ridgeon reading the title the story of a king by his wife he looks at the portrait frontise ay there he is you knew him here i suppose  the secretary oh we knew him better than she did sir colenso in some ways perhaps  ridgeon so did i they look significantly at one another ill take a look round  the secretary puts on the shining hat and goes out ridgeon begins looking at the pictures presently he comes back to the table for a magnifying glass and scrutinizes a drawing very closely he sighs shakes his head as if constrained to admit the extraordinary fascination and merit of the work then marks the secretarys list proceeding with his survey he disappears behind the screen jennifer comes back with her book a look round satisfies her that she is alone she seats herself at the table and admires the memoirher first printed bookto her hearts content ridgeon reappears face to the wall scrutinizing the drawings after using his glass again he steps back to get a more distant view of one of the larger pictures she hastily closes the book at the sound looks round recognizes him and stares petrified he takes a further step back which brings him nearer to her  ridgeon shaking his head as before ejaculates clever brute she flushes as though he had struck her he turns to put the glass down on the desk and finds himself face to face with her intent gaze i beg your pardon i thought i was alone  jennifer controlling herself and speaking steadily and meaningly i am glad we have met sir colenso ridgeon i met dr blenkinsop yesterday i congratulate you on a wonderful cure  ridgeon can find no words makes an embarrassed gesture of assent after a moments silence and puts down the glass and the secretarys list on the table  jennifer he looked the picture of health and strength and prosperity she looks for a moment at the walls contrasting blenkinsops fortune with the artists fate  ridgeon in low tones still embarrassed he has been fortunate  jennifer very fortunate his life has been spared  ridgeon i mean that he has been made a medical officer of health he cured the chairman of the borough council very successfully  jennifer with your medicines  ridgeon no i believe it was with a pound of ripe greengages  jennifer with deep gravity funny  ridgeon yes life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh  jennifer dr blenkinsop said one very strange thing to me  ridgeon what was that  jennifer he said that private practice in medicine ought to be put down by law when i asked him why he said that private doctors were ignorant licensed murderers  ridgeon that is what the public doctor always thinks of the private doctor well blenkinsop ought to know he was a private doctor long enough himself come you have talked at me long enough talk to me you have something to reproach me with there is reproach in your face in your voice you are full of it out with it  jennifer it is too late for reproaches now when i turned and saw you just now i wondered how you could come here coolly to look at his pictures you answered the question to you he was only a clever brute  ridgeon quivering oh dont you know i did not know you were here  jennifer raising her head a little with a quite gentle impulse of pride you think it only mattered because i heard it as if it could touch me or touch him dont you see that what is really dreadful is that to you living things have no souls  ridgeon with a sceptical shrug the soul is an organ i have not come across in the course of my anatomical work  jennifer you know you would not dare to say such a silly thing as that to anybody but a woman whose mind you despise if you dissected me you could not find my conscience do you think i have got none  ridgeon i have met people who had none  jennifer clever brutes do you know doctor that some of the dearest and most faithful friends i ever had were only brutes you would have vivisected them the dearest and greatest of all my friends had a sort of beauty and affectionateness that only animals have i hope you may never feel what i felt when i had to put him into the hands of men who defend the torture of animals because they are only brutes  ridgeon well did you find us so very cruel after all they tell me that though you have dropped me you stay for weeks with the bloomfield boningtons and the walpoles i think it must be true because they never mention you to me now  jennifer the animals in sir ralphs house are like spoiled children when mr walpole had to take a splinter out of the mastiffs paw i had to hold the poor dog myself and mr walpole had to turn sir ralph out of the room and mrs walpole has to tell the gardener not to kill wasps when mr walpole is looking but there are doctors who are naturally cruel and there are others who get used to cruelty and are callous about it they blind themselves to the souls of animals and that blinds them to the souls of men and women you made a dreadful mistake about louis but you would not have made it if you had not trained yourself to make the same mistake about dogs you saw nothing in them but dumb brutes and so you could see nothing in him but a clever brute  ridgeon with sudden resolution i made no mistake whatever about him  jennifer oh doctor  ridgeon obstinately i made no mistake whatever about him  jennifer have you forgotten that he died  ridgeon with a sweep of his hand towards the pictures he is not dead he is there taking up the book and there  jennifer springing up with blazing eyes put that down how dare you touch it  ridgeon amazed at the fierceness of the outburst puts it down with a deprecatory shrug she takes it up and looks at it as if he had profaned a relic  ridgeon i am very sorry i see i had better go  jennifer putting the book down i beg your pardon i forgot myself but it is not yetit is a private copy  ridgeon but for me it would have been a very different book  jennifer but for you it would have been a longer one  ridgeon you know then that i killed him  jennifer suddenly moved and softened oh doctor if you acknowledge thatif you have confessed it to yourselfif you realize what you have done then there is forgiveness i trusted in your strength instinctively at first then i thought i had mistaken callousness for strength can you blame me but if it was really strengthif it was only such a mistake as we all make sometimesit will make me so happy to be friends with you again  ridgeon i tell you i made no mistake i cured blenkinsop was there any mistake there  jennifer he recovered oh dont be foolishly proud doctor confess to a failure and save our friendship remember sir ralph gave louis your medicine and it made him worse  ridgeon i cant be your friend on false pretences something has got me by the throat the truth must come out i used that medicine myself on blenkinsop it did not make him worse it is a dangerous medicine it cured blenkinsop it killed louis dubedat when i handle it it cures when another man handles it it killssometimes  jennifer naively not yet taking it all in then why did you let sir ralph give it to louis  ridgeon im going to tell you i did it because i was in love with you  jennifer innocently surprised in lo you elderly man  ridgeon thunderstruck raising his fists to heaven dubedat thou art avenged he drops his hands and collapses on the bench i never thought of that i suppose i appear to you a ridiculous old fogey  jennifer but surelyi did not mean to offend you indeedbut you must be at least twenty years older than i am  ridgeon oh quite more perhaps in twenty years you will understand how little difference that makes  jennifer but even so how could you think that ihis wifecould ever think of you  ridgeon stopping her with a nervous waving of his fingers yes yes yes yes i quite understand you neednt rub it in  jennifer butoh it is only dawning on me nowi was so surprised at firstdo you dare to tell me that it was to gratify a miserable jealousy that you deliberatelyoh oh you murdered him  ridgeon i think i did it really comes to that        thou shalt not kill but needst not strive       officiously to keep alive  i supposeyes i killed him  jennifer and you tell me that to my face callously you are not afraid  ridgeon i am a doctor i have nothing to fear it is not an indictable offense to call in b b perhaps it ought to be but it isnt  jennifer i did not mean that i meant afraid of my taking the law into my own hands and killing you  ridgeon i am so hopelessly idiotic about you that i should not mind it a bit you would always remember me if you did that  jennifer i shall remember you always as a little man who tried to kill a great one  ridgeon pardon me i succeeded  jennifer with quiet conviction no doctors think they hold the keys of life and death but it is not their will that is fulfilled i dont believe you made any difference at all  ridgeon perhaps not but i intended to  jennifer looking at him amazedly not without pity and you tried to destroy that wonderful and beautiful life merely because you grudged him a woman whom you could never have expected to care for you  ridgeon who kissed my hands who believed in me who told me her friendship lasted until death  jennifer and whom you were betraying  ridgeon no whom i was saving  jennifer gently pray doctor from what  ridgeon from making a terrible discovery from having your life laid waste  jennifer how  ridgeon no matter i have saved you i have been the best friend you ever had you are happy you are well his works are an imperishable joy and pride for you  jennifer and you think that is your doing oh doctor doctor sir patrick is right you do think you are a little god how can you be so silly you did not paint those pictures which are my imperishable joy and pride you did not speak the words that will always be heavenly music in my ears i listen to them now whenever i am tired or sad that is why i am always happy  ridgeon yes now that he is dead were you always happy when he was alive  jennifer wounded oh you are cruel cruel when he was alive i did not know the greatness of my blessing i worried meanly about little things i was unkind to him i was unworthy of him  ridgeon laughing bitterly ha  jennifer dont insult me dont blaspheme she snatches up the book and presses it to her heart in a paroxysm of remorse exclaiming oh my king of men  ridgeon king of men oh this is too monstrous too grotesque we cruel doctors have kept the secret from you faithfully but it is like all secrets it will not keep itself the buried truth germinates and breaks through to the light  jennifer what truth  ridgeon what truth why that louis dubedat king of men was the most entire and perfect scoundrel the most miraculously mean rascal the most callously selfish blackguard that ever made a wife miserable  jennifer unshaken calm and lovely he made his wife the happiest woman in the world doctor  ridgeon no by all thats true on earth he made his widow the happiest woman in the world but it was i who made her a widow and her happiness is my justification and my reward now you know what i did and what i thought of him be as angry with me as you like at least you know me as i really am if you ever come to care for an elderly man you will know what you are caring for  jennifer kind and quiet i am not angry with you any more sir colenso i knew quite well that you did not like louis but it is not your fault you dont understand that is all you never could have believed in him it is just like your not believing in my religion it is a sort of sixth sense that you have not got and with a gentle reassuring movement towards him dont think that you have shocked me so dreadfully i know quite well what you mean by his selfishness he sacrificed everything for his art in a certain sense he had even to sacrifice everybody  ridgeon everybody except himself by keeping that back he lost the right to sacrifice you and gave me the right to sacrifice him which i did  jennifer shaking her head pitying his error he was one of the men who know what women know that selfsacrifice is vain and cowardly  ridgeon yes when the sacrifice is rejected and thrown away not when it becomes the food of godhead  jennifer i dont understand that and i cant argue with you you are clever enough to puzzle me but not to shake me you are so utterly so wildly wrong so incapable of appreciating louis  ridgeon oh taking up the secretarys list i have marked five pictures as sold to me  jennifer they will not be sold to you louis creditors insisted on selling them but this is my birthday and they were all bought in for me this morning by my husband  ridgeon by whom  jennifer by my husband  ridgeon gabbling and stuttering what husband whose husband which husband whom how what do you mean to say that you have married again  jennifer do you forget that louis disliked widows and that people who have married happily once always marry again  the secretary returns with a pile of catalogues  the secretary just got the first batch of catalogues in time the doors are open  jennifer to ridgeon politely so glad you like the pictures sir colenso good morning  ridgeon good morning he goes towards the door hesitates turns to say something more gives it up as a bad job and goes
