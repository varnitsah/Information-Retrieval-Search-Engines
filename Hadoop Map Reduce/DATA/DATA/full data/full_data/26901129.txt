26901129	the box with broken seals  by  e phillips oppenheim  1919       chapter i   james crawshay englishman of the type usually described in transatlantic circles as some britisher lolled apparently at his ease upon the couch of the tooresplendent sitting room in the hotel magnificent chicago hobson his american fellow traveler on the other hand betrayed his anxiety by his nervous pacing up and down the apartment both men bore traces in their appearance of the long journey which they had only just completed  i think crawshay decided yawning that i shall have a bath i feel gritty and my collarheavens what a sight your trains hobson may be magnificent but your coal is filthy i will have a bath while your friend the policeman makes up his mind whether to come and see us or not  his companion treated the suggestion with scant courtesy  you will do nothing of the sort was his almost fierce objection weve got to wait right here until chief of police downs comes along theres something crooked about this business something i dont understand and the sooner we get to the bottom of it the better  the englishman pacified himself with a whisky and soda which a waiter had just brought in he added several lumps of ice and drained the contents of the tumbler with a little murmur of appreciation  it will be confoundedly annoying he admitted quietly if weve had all this journey for nothing  hobson moistened his dry lips with his tongue the whisky and soda and the great bucket of ice stood temptingly at his elbow but he appeared to ignore their existence he was a man of ample build with a big cleanshaven face a square jaw and deepset eyes a man devoted to and wholly engrossed by his work  see here crawshay he exclaimed if that dispatch was a fake if weve been brought here on a fools errand they havent done it for nothing if theyve brought it off against us you mark my words were leftwere bamboozledwere a couple of lost loons theres nothing left for us but to sell candy to small boys or find a job on a farm  youre such a pessimist the englishman yawned  pessimist was the angry retort ill just ask you one question my son wheres downs  i certainly think crawshay admitted that under the circumstances he might have been at the station to meet us  he wouldnt even talk through the phone hobson pointed out i had to explain who we were to one of his inspectors no one seemed to know a goldarned thing about us  they sent for him right away when you explained who you were crawshay reminded his companion  hobson found no comfort whatever in the reflection  of course they did he replied brusquely theres scarcely likely to be a chief of police of any city in the united states who wouldnt get a move on when he knew that sam hobson was waiting for a word i havent been in the secret service of this country for fifteen years for nothing hell come fast enough as soon as he knows im waiting but all the same what i want to know is if that dispatch was on the square why he wasnt at the station to meet us and if it wasnt on the square how the hell do we come out of this  their conversation was interrupted by the tinkle of the telephone which stood upon the table between them the instrument which both men had been watching anxiously hobson snatched up the receiver  police headquarters speaking right yes this is sam hobson im here with crawshay of the english secret service we got your dispatchwhats thatwellchief downs is on the way ehjust started good were waiting for him  hobson replaced the receiver upon the instrument  downs is coming right along he announced i tell you what it is mr crawshay he went on recommencing his walk up and down the apartment i dont feel happy to be so far away from the coast thats what scares me chicagos just about the place theyd land us if this is a hankypanky trick were twenty hours from new york and the city of boston sails tomorrow at five oclock  the englishman shook himself and rose from his recumbent position upon the sofa he was a man of youthful middleage colourless with pleasant face a somewhat discontented mouth but keen grey eyes he had been sent out from scotland yard at the beginning of the war to assist in certain work at the english embassy so far his opportunities had not been many or marked with any brilliant success and it seemed to him that the gloom of failure was already settling down upon their present expedition  you dont believe then any more than i do that when a certain box we know of is opened at the foreign office in london it will contain the papers we are after  no sir i do not was the vigorous reply i think they have been playing a huge game of bluff on us thats why i am so worried about this trip i wouldnt mind betting you the best dinner you ever ate at delmonicos or at your english savoy that that box with the broken seals they all got so excited about doesnt contain a single one of the papers that were after why those blasted teutons wanted us to believe it thats why some of the seals were broken and why the old man himself hung about like a hen thats lost one of its chickens they want us to believe that weve got the goods right in that box and to hold up the search for a time while they get the genuine stuff out of the country i admit right here mr crawshay that it was you who put this into my head at halifax i couldnt swallow it then but when downs didnt meet us at the depot here it came over me like a flash that you were right that we were being flimflammed  we ought perhaps to have separated the englishman ruminated i ought to have gone to new york and you come here on the other hand you must remember that all the evidence which we have managed to collect points to chicago as having been the headquarters of the whole organisation  sure the american admitted and theres another point about it too if this outsider who has taken on the job for them should really turn out to be jocelyn thew id have banked on his working the scheme from chicago he knows the back ways of the city or rather he used to like a rat gee it would be a queer thing if after all these years one were to get the bracelets on him  i dont quite see crawshay remarked how such a person as this jocelyn thew of whom you have spoken several times could have become associated with an affair of this sort both the germans and the austrians at washington had the name of being exceedingly particular with regard to the status of their agents and he must be entirely a newcomer in international matters from the dossier you handed me jocelyn thew reads more like a kind of modern swashbuckler spoiling for a fight than a person likely to make a success of a secret service job  dont you worry hobson replied jocelyn thew could hold his own at any court in europe with any of you embassy swaggerers theres nothing known about his family but they say that his father was an english aristocrat and he looks like it too  it was you yourself who called him a criminal the first time you spoke of him crawshay reminded his companion  and a criminal he is at heart without a doubt the american declared impressively  has he ever been in prison  he has had the luck of old harry hobson grumbled in new york they all believed that it was he who shot graves the pittsburg millionaire the treasury department will have it that he was the head of that fourteenth street gang of coiners and ive a pal down at baltimore who is ready to take his oath that he planned the theft of the vanderloon jewelsand brought it off too but i tell you this sir when the trouble comes whoever gets nabbed its never jocelyn thew hes the slickest thing that ever came down the pike  he is well off then  they say that he brought half a million from mexico hobson declared how he brought money out of that country neither i nor anybody else on the force can imagine but he did it i know the stockbroker downtown who handles his investmentsheres our man at last  the door was opened by the floor waiter who held it while a thin dark man dressed in civilian clothes of most correct cut passed in hobson gripped him at once by the hand  chief downs he said this is my friend mr crawshay who is connected with the english embassy over here you can shake hands with him later were on a job of business and the first thing before us is to get an answer from you to a certain question did you send this dispatch or did you not  hobson handed over to the newcomer the crumpled telegraph form which he had just produced from his pocket the latter glanced through it and shook his head  its a plant he announced im sorry if the use of my name has misled you in any way but it was quite unauthorised i know nothing whatever about the matter  hobson remained for a moment silent silent with sick and angry astonishment crawshay had glanced towards the clock and was standing now with his finger upon the bell  is it a big thing the chicago man enquired  its the biggest thing ever known in this country hobson groaned its what is known as the number three berlin plant  you didnt get the stuff at halifax then downs asked  we didnt hobson replied bitterly weve sent a representative over to sit on the box with the broken seals till they can open it at the foreign office in london but i never believed theyd find anything there im damned certain they wont now  a waiter had answered the bell  dont have our luggage brought up crawshay directed we are leaving for new york tonight thats so isnt it hobson he added turning to his companion  you bet was the grim reply id give a thousand dollars to be there now  the limiteds sold out the man told them there are two or three persons whove been disappointed staying on here till tomorrow  ill get you on the train downs promised i can do as much as that for you anyway ill stop and go on to the station with you from here im very sorry about this hobson he continued fingering the dispatch we shall have to get right along to the station but if theres anything i can do after youve left command me  you might wire new york hobson suggested as he struggled into his overcoat tell em to look out for the city of boston and to hold her up for me if they can ive got it in my bones that jocelyn thew is running this show and that he is on that steamer  those fellows at washington must have collected some useful stuff chief downs observed as the three men left the room and stepped into the elevator theyve been working on their job since before the war and there isnt a harbour on the east or west coast that they havent got sized up theyve spent a million dollars in graft since january and theres a rumour that the new navy department scheme for dealing with submarines which was only adopted last month is there among the rest  anything else crawshay asked indolently  the chief of police glanced first at his questioner and then at hobson  what else should there be he enquired  no idea the englishman replied secret service papers of the usual description i suppose bytheby i hear that this man jocelyn thew has stated openly that he is going to take all the papers he wants with him into germany and that there isnt a living soul can stop him  hobsons square jaw was set a little tighter and his narrow eyes flashed  thats some boast to make he muttered kind of a challenge isnt it what do you say mr crawshay  crawshay who had been gazing out of the window of the taxicab looked back again his tone was almost indifferent  if chief downs can get us on the limited he said and if we catch the city of boston i think perhaps we might have a chance of making mr jocelyn thew eat his words  the chief smiled the taxicab had turned in through the entrance gates of the great station  i have heard men as wellknown in their profession as you hobson and you too mr crawshay speak like that about jocelyn thew but when the game was played out they seem to have lost the odd trick either the fellow isnt a criminal at all but loves to haunt shady places and pose as one or he is just the cleverest of all the crooks who ever worked the states some of my best men have thought that they had a case against him and have come to grief  theyve never caught him with the goods because theyve never been the right way about it hobson declared confidently  and you think you are going to break his record downs asked with a doubtful smile if you find him on the city of boston you know the stuff youre after wont be in his pocketbook or in the lining of his steamer trunk  the three men were hurrying out to the platform now where the great train a blaze of light and luxury was standing upon the track captain downs made his way to where the pullman conductor was standing and engaged him in a brief but earnest conversation a car porter was summoned and in a few moments crawshay and hobson found themselves standing on the steps of one of the cars they leaned over to make their adieux to chief downs crawshay added a few words to his farewell  i quite appreciate all your remarks about jocelyn thew he said one is liable to be disappointed of course but i still feel that if we can catch that steamer it might be an exceedingly interesting voyage  if youre on time you may do it was the brief reply all the same  the gong had sounded and the train was gliding slowly out of the station crawshay leaned over the iron gate of the car  go on please he begged dont mind my feelings  chief downs waved his hand  im afraid he confessed that my money would be on jocelyn thew     chapter ii   at just about the hour when crawshay and hobson were receiving the visit of chief downs in the chicago hotel an english butler accepted with due respect the card of a very distinguishedlooking and exceedingly wellturnedout caller at the big brownstone beverley house in riverside drive new york  miss beverley is just back from the hospital sir the former announced if you will come this way i will see that your card is sent to her at once  the callermr jocelyn thew was the name upon the cardfollowed the servant across the white stone circular hall with its bankedup profusion of hothouse flowers and its air of elegant emptiness into a somewhat austere but very dignified apartment the walls of which were lined to the ceiling with books  i will let miss beverley have your card at once sir the man promised him again if you will be so kind as to take a seat for a few moments  the visitor left to himself stood upon the hearthrug with his hands behind his back waiting for news of the young lady whom he had come to visit at first sight he certainly was a most prepossessinglooking person his face if a little hard was distinguished by a strength which for the size of his features was somewhat surprising his chin was like a piece of iron and although his mouth had more sensitive and softer lines his darkblue eyes and jetblack eyebrows completed a general impression of vigour and forcefulness his figure was a little thin but lithe and his movements showed all the suppleness of a man who has continued the pursuit of athletics into early middlelife his hair only slightly streaked with grey was thick and plentiful his clothes were carefully chosen and well tailored he had the air of a man used to mixing with the best people to eating and drinking the best to living in the best fashion recognising nothing less as his due in life yet as he stood there waiting for his visitor listening intently for the sound of her footsteps outside he permitted himself a moment of retrospection and there was a gleam of very different things in his face a touch almost of the savage in the clenched teeth and sudden tightening of the lips one might have gathered that this man was living through a period of strain  the entrance of the young lady of the house after a delay of about ten minutes was noiseless and unannounced her visitor however was prepared for it she came towards him with an air of pleasant enquiry in her very charming facea young woman in the early twenties of little more than medium height with complexion inclined to be pale deep grey eyes and a profusion of dark brown almost coppercoloured hair she carried herself delightfully and her little smile of welcome was wonderfully attractive although her deportment and manner were a little serious for her years  you wish to see me she asked i am miss beverleymiss katharine beverley sometimes known as sister katharine her visitor remarked with a smile  more often than by my own name she assented do you come from the hospital  he shook his head and glanced behind her to be sure that the door was closed  please do not think that my coming means any trouble miss beverley he said but if you look at me more closely you will perhaps recognise me you will perhaps remembera promise  he stepped a little forward from his position of obscurity to where the strong afternoon sunlight found its subdued way through the holland blinds the politely interrogative smile faded from her lips she seemed to pass through a moment of terror a moment during which her thoughts were numbed she sank into the chair which her visitor gravely held out for her and by degrees she recovered her powers of speech  forgive me she begged the name upon the card should have warned mebut i had no ideai was not expecting a visit from you  naturally he acquiesced smoothly and i beg you not to discompose yourself my visit bodes you no harmneither you nor any one belonging to you  i was foolish she confessed i have been working overtime at the hospital latelywe have sent so many of our nurses to france my nerves are not quite what they should be  he bowed sympathetically his tone and demeanour were alike reassuring  i quite understand he said still some day or other i suppose you expected a visit from me  in a way i certainly did she admitted you must let me know presently please exactly what i can do dont think because i was startled to see you that i wish to repudiate my debt i have never ceased to be grateful to you for your wonderful behaviour on that ghastly night  please do not refer to it he begged your brother i hope is well  he is well and doing famously she replied i suppose you know that he is in france  in france he repeated no i had not heard  he joined the canadian flying corps she went on and he got his wings almost at once he finds the life out there wonderful i never receive a letter from him she concluded her eyes growing very soft that i do not feel a little thrill of gratitude to you  he bowed  that is very pleasant he murmured and now we come to the object of my visit your surmise was correct i have come to ask you to redeem your word  and you find me not only ready but anxious to do so she told him earnestly if it is a matterpardon meof money you have only to say how much if there is any other service you require you have only to name it  you make things easy for me he acknowledged but may i add that it is only what i expected the service which i have come to claim from you is one which is not capable of full explanation but which will cause you little inconvenience and less hardship you will find it without doubt surprising but i need not add that it will be entirely innocent in its character  then there seems to be very little left she declared smiling up at him from the depths of her chair but to name it i do wish you would sit down and are you quite sure that you wont have some tea or something  he shook his head gravely and made no movement towards the chair which she had indicated for some reason or other notwithstanding her manifest encouragement he seemed to wish to keep their interview on a purely formal basis  let me repeat he continued that i shall offer you no comprehensive explanations because they would not be truthful nor are they altogether necessary in ward number fourteen of your hospitalyou have been so splendid a patroness that every one calls st agness your hospitala serious operation was performed today upon an englishman named phillips  i remember hearing about it she assented the man is i understand very ill  he is so ill that he has but one wish left in life jocelyn thew told her gravely that wish is to die in england just as you are at the present moment in my debt for a certain service rendered so am i in his he has called upon me to pay he has begged me to make all the arrangements for his immediate transportation to his native country she nodded sympathetically  it is a very natural wish she observed so long as it does not endanger his life  it does not endanger his life her visitor replied because that is already forfeit i come now to the condition which involves you which explains my presence here this afternoon it is also his earnest desire that you should attend him so far as london as his nurse  the look of vague apprehension which had brought a questioning frown into katharine beverleys face faded away it was succeeded by an expression of blank and complete surprise  that i should nurse himshould cross with him to london she repeated why i do not know this man phillips i never saw him in my life i have not even been in ward fourteen since he was brought there  but he jocelyn thew explained has seen you he has been a visitor at your hospital before he was received there as a patient he has received from various doctors wonderful accounts of your skill besides this he is a superstitious man and he has been very much impressed by the fact that you have never lost a patient if you had been one of your own probationers the question of a fee would have presented no difficulties although he personally is i believe a poor man as it is however his strange craving for your services has become a charge upon me  it is the most extraordinary request i ever heard in my life katharine murmured if i had ever seen or spoken to the man i could have understood it better but as it is i find it impossible to understand  you must look upon it jocelyn thew told her as one of those strange fancies which comes sometimes to men who are living in the shadowland of approaching death there is one material circumstance however which may make the suggestion even more disconcerting for you the steamer upon which we hope to sail leaves at four oclock tomorrow afternoon  the idea in this new aspect was so ludicrous that she simply laughed at him  my dear mr jocelyn thew she exclaimed you cant possibly be in earnest you mean that you expect me to leave new york with less than twentyfour hours notice and go all the way to london in attendance upon a stranger especially in these awful times why the thing isnt reasonableor possible i have just consented to take the chairmanship of a committee to form field hospitals throughout the country and  may i interrupt for one moment her visitor begged  the stream of words seemed to fall away from her lips there was a touch of jocelyn thews other mannerperhaps more than a touch she looked at him and she shivered she had seen him look like that once before  your attitude is perfectly reasonable he continued but on the other hand i must ask you to carry your thoughts back some little time i shall beg you to remember that i have a certain right to ask this or any other service from you i admit it she confessed hastily butthere is something so outlandish in the whole suggestion there are a score of nurses in the hospital to any one of whom you are welcome who are all much cleverer than i what possible advantage to the man can it be especially if he is seriously ill to have a partiallytrained nurse with him when he might have the best in the world  i think he said i mentioned that this is not a matter for reasoning or argument it is you who are required and no one else i may remind you he went on that this service is a very much smaller one than i might have asked you and so far as you and i are concerned it clears our debt  clears our debt she repeated  for ever  she closed her eyes for several moments for some reason or other this last reflection seemed to bring her no particular relief when she opened them again her decision was written in her face  i consent of course she acquiesced quietly is there anything more to tell me  very little he replied only this you should send your baggage on board the city of boston as early as possible tomorrow morning every arrangement has been made for transporting phillips in his bed as he lies from the hospital to the boat the doctor who has been in attendance will accompany him to england but it is important that you should be at the hospital and should drive in the ambulance from there to the dock i shall ask very little of you in the way of duplicity what is necessary you will not i think refuse you will be considered to have had some former interest in phillips to account for your voyage and you will reconcile yourself to the fact that i shall not at any time approach the sick man or be known as an acquaintance of his on board the ship  his words disturbed her she felt herself being drawn under the shadow of some mystery  there is something in all this she said which reminds me of the time when richard was your protégé the time when we met before  he leaned towards her understanding very well what was in her mind  there is nothing criminal in this enterpriseeven in my share of it he assured her what there is in it which necessitates secrecy is political and that need not concern you you see he went on a little bitterly i have changed my role i am no longer the despair of the new york police i am the quarry of a race of men who if they could catch me would not wait to arrest that may happen even before we reach liverpool if it does it will not affect you your duty is to stay with a dying man until he reaches the shelter of his home you will leave him there and you will be free of him and of me  so far as regards our two selves she enquired do we meet as strangers upon the steamer  he considered the matter for a few moments before answering she felt another poignant thrill of recollection he had looked at her like this just before he had bent his back to the task of saving her brothers life and liberty looked at her like this the moment before the unsuspected revolver had flashed from the pocket of his dresscoat and had covered the man who had suddenly declared himself their foe she felt her cheeks burn for a moment there was something magnetic curiously troublous about his eyes and his faint smile  i cannot deny myself so much he said even if our opportunities for meeting upon the steamer are few i shall still have the pleasure of a new york acquaintance with miss beverley you need not be afraid he went on in this wonderful country of yours the improbable frequently happens i have before now visited at the houses of some whom you call your friends  why not she asked him i should look upon it as the most natural thing in the world that we were acquainted but why do you say your country are you not an american  he looked at her with a very faint smile a smile which had nothing in it of pleasantness or mirth  i have so few secrets he said the only one which i elect to keep is the secret of my nationality  she raised her eyebrows  then you can no longer she observed be considered what my brother and i once thought youa man of mysteriesfor with your voice and accent it is very certain that you are either english or american  if it affords you any further clue then he replied let me confide in you that if there is one country in this world which i detest it is england one race of people whom i abominate it is the english  she showed her surprise frankly but his manner encouraged no further confidence she touched the bell and he bowed over her fingers  my friend phillips he said in formal accents as the butler stood upon the threshold will never live i fear to offer you all the gratitude he feels but you are doing a very kind and a very wonderful action miss beverley and one which i think will bring its own reward  he passed out of the room leaving katharine a prey to a curious tangle of emotions she watched him almost feverishly until he had disappeared listened to his footsteps in the hall and the closing of the front door then she hurried to the window watched him descend the row of steps pass down the little drive and hail a taxicab it was not until he was out of sight that she became in any way like herself then she broke into a little laugh  heavens alive she exclaimed to herself now i have to find aunt molly and tell her that i am going to europe tomorrow with a perfect stranger     chapter iii   mr jocelyn thew descended presently from his taxicab outside one of the largest and most cosmopolitan hotels in new yorkor the world he made his way with the air of an habitué to the bar the precincts of which at that time in the late afternoon were crowded by a motley gathering he ordered a scotch highball and gently insinuated himself into the proximity of a group of newspaper men with whom he seemed to have some slight acquaintance it was curious how since his arrival in this democratic meetingplace his manners and deportment seemed to have slipped to a lower grade he seemed as though by an effort of will to have lost something of his natural air of distinction to be treading the earth upon a lower plane he saluted the barkeeper by his christian name listened with apparent interest to an exceedingly commonplace story from one of his neighbours and upon its conclusion drew a little nearer to the group  say he exclaimed confidentially if i felt in the humour for it i could hand you boys out a great scoop  they were on him like a pack of hungry though dubious wolves he pushed his glass out of sight accepted one of the drinks pressed upon him and leaned nonchalantly against the counter  what should you say he began to miss katharine beverley the new york society young lady  sister katharine of st agness one of them interrupted  daughter of old joe beverley the multimillionaire another exclaimed  both right jocelyn thew acquiesced what should you say to that young woman leaving her hospital and her house in riverside drive breaking all her engagements at less than twentyfour hours notice to take a sick englishman whom no one knows anything about back to liverpool on the city of boston tomorrow  the storys good enough a ferretfaced little man at his elbow acknowledged but is it true  jocelyn thew regarded his questioner with an air of pained surprise  its gospel he assured them all but you dont need to take my word you go right along up and enquire at the beverley house tonight and youll find that she is packing made up her mind just an hour ago im about the only one in the know  whos the man anyway one of the little group asked  nothing doing jocelyn thew replied mysteriously youve got to find that out for yourself boys all i can tell you is that hes an englishman and she has known him for a long timekind of love stunt i imagine she wasnt having any but now hes at deaths door she seems to have relented anyway she is breaking every engagement shes got giving up her chairmanship of the war hospitals committee and she isnt going to leave him while hes alive theres no other nurse going so itll be a night and day job for her  whats the matter with the chap anyway another questioner demanded  no one knows for sure was the cautious reply hes been operated upon for appendicitis but i fancy there are complications not much chance for him from what i have heard  the little crowd of men melted away jocelyn thew smiled to himself on his way out as he watched four of them climb into a taxicab  that establishes phillips all right as miss beverleys protégé he murmured as he turned into fifth avenue and now  he stopped short in his reflections his careful scrutiny of the heterogeneous crowd gathered together around the bar had revealed to him no unfamiliar type save the little man who at that moment was ambling along on the other side of the way jocelyn thew slackened his pace somewhat and watched him keenly he was short he wore a cheap readymade suit of some plain material and a straw hat tilted on the back of his head he had round cheeks he shambled rather than walked and his vacuous countenance seemed both goodnatured and unintelligent to all appearances a more harmless person never breathed yet jocelyn thew as he studied him earnestly felt that slight tightening of the nerves which came to him almost instinctively in moments of danger he changed his purpose and turned down fifth avenue instead of up the little man it appeared had business in the same direction jocelyn thew walked the length of several blocks in leisurely fashion and then entered an hotel studiously avoiding looking behind him he made his way into a telephone booth and looked through the glass door his follower in a few moments was visible making apparently some aimless enquiry across the counter jocelyn thew turned his back upon him and asked the operator for a number  number 238 park waiting the latter announced a few moments later  jocelyn thew reentered the box and took up the receiver  that you rentoul he asked  speaking was the guarded reply who is it  jocelyn thew say whats wrong with you dont go away  what is it speak quickly please  you seem rather nervy up there im off to europe tomorrow on the city of boston and i should like to see you before i go  there was a moments silence  why dont you come up here then  id rather not jocelyn thew observed laconically the fact of it is i have a friend around who doesnt seem to care about losing sight of me if you are going to be anywhere around near jimmys about seven oclock  that goes was the somewhat agitated reply ring off now theres some one else waiting to speak  jocelyn thew paid for his telephone call and walked leisurely out of the hotel with a smile upon his lips the stimulus of danger was like wine to him the little man was choosing a cigar at the stall as he leaned down to light it jocelyn thews practiced eye caught the shape of a revolver in his hip pocket  english he murmured softly to himself probably one of crawshays lot preparing a report for him when he returns from chicago  with an anticipatory smile he entered upon the task of shaking off his unwelcome follower he passed with the confident air of a member into a big club situated in an adjoining block left it almost at once by a side entrance found a taxicab drove to a subway station uptown and finally caught an express back again to fourteenth street here he entered without hesitation a small foreignlooking restaurant which intruded upon the pavement only a few yards from the iron staircase by which he descended from the station there were two faded evergreen shrubs in cracked pots at the bottom of the steps soiled muslin curtains drawn across the lower half of the windows dejectedlooking green shutters which had the appearance of being permanently nailed against the walls and a general air of foreign and tawdry profligacy jocelyn thew stepped into a room on the righthand side of the entrance and making his way to the window glanced cautiously out there was no sign anywhere of the little man then he turned towards the bar around which a motley group of italians and hungarians were gathered the linenclad negro who presided there met his questioning glance with a slight nod and the visitor passed without hesitation through a curtained opening to the rear of the place along a passage up a flight of narrow stairs until he arrived at a door on the first landing he knocked and was at once bidden to enter for a moment he listened as though to the sounds below then he slipped into the room and closed the door behind him  the apartment was everything which might have been expected save for the profusion of flowers the girl who greeted him however was different she was of medium height and dark with dark brown hair plaited close back from an almost ivorycoloured forehead her grey eyes were soft and framed in dark lines her eyebrows were noticeable her mouth full but shapely her discontented expression changed entirely as she held out both her hands to her visitor her welcome was eager almost passionate  mr thew she exclaimed  he held up his hand as though to check further speech and listened for a moment intently  how are things here he asked  quiet she assured him you couldnt have come at a better time every ones away is there anything wrong  i am being followed he told her and i dont like itjust now at any rate  any one else coming she enquired  rentoul he told her he is in a mortal fright at having to come they found his wireless and they are watching his house i must see him though before i go away  going away she echoed when when are you going  tomorrow he replied i sail for london  she seemed for a moment absolutely speechless consumed by a sort of silent passion that found no outlet in words she gripped a fancy mat which covered an ornate table by her side and dragged a begilded vase on to the floor without even noticing it she leaned towards him the little lines at the sides of her eyes were suddenly deepriven like scars her eyes themselves were smouldering with fire  you are going to england  that is what i propose he assented i am sailing on the city of boston tomorrow afternoon  but the risk she faltered i thought that you dared not set foot in england  there is risk he admitted it is not easy to amuse oneself anywhere without it i have been offered a hundred thousand pounds to superintend the conveyance of certain documents and a certain letter to berlin the adventure appeals to me and i have undertaken it until i found this man following me this afternoon i really believed that we had put every one off the track i know for a fact that most of the american officials believe that the papers for which they have searched so long and anxiously are in that trunk with the broken seals which they found at halifax  what about the englishman crawshay and sam hobson the girl asked  they are not quite so credulous he replied but at the present moment they are in chicago and if we get off at four oclock punctually tomorrow afternoon i scarcely think i shall be troubled with their presence on the city of boston i have been reading about the trunk the girl said is it really a fake  entirely he assured her there is not a single document in it which concerns either us or our friends everything that is of vital importance will be on the city of boston tomorrow and under my charge  she looked at him wonderingly  but mr thew she exclaimed you are clever i knoweven wonderfulbut what possible chance have you of getting those things throughon an american steamer too  i have to take my risks of course he admitted coolly but the game is worth it i cant live without excitement as you know and its getting harder and harder to find on this side of the ocean besides there is the money i can think of several uses for a hundred thousand pounds  she caught his wrist suddenly and leaned across the table  can i come with you she asked breathlessly  he shook his head  i shouldnt advise a sea voyage just now nora he said it isnt exactly a picnic nowadays besides if you come on the city of boston there will be more than one danger to be faced  danger she exclaimed contemptuously have i ever shown myself afraid have we any of usmy brother or father or ihesitated to run any possible risk when it was worth while this house has been yours and we in it to do what you will with it isnt a matter of dangeryou know that i come or go as you bid me he met the fierce enquiry of her eyes without flinching only his tone was a little kinder as he answered her  i think nora he said that you had better stay  there was a timid but persistent knocking at the door and in response to noras invitation a fat and bloated man entered the room hurriedly he sank into a chair and mopped the perspiration from his forehead jocelyn thew watched him with an air of contemptuous amusement  you seem distressed rentoul he remarked has anything gone wrong  but it is terrible this the newcomer declared anything gone wrong indeed listen the police have made themselves free of my house my beautiful wirelessit was only a hobbyit has gone they open my letters they will ruin me never did i think that this would arrive there has been some terrible bungling  and you jocelyn thew retorted seem to have been the arch bungler  i but what have i done rentoul demanded wringing his hands i have always obeyed orders even a hint has been enough i have spent a great deal of moneymuch more than i could afford what have i done wrong  you have talked too much for one thing was the cold reply but we havent time for recriminations now how did you get here  i came in my car you will perhaps say that it was not wise but i could not have stood the subway my nerves are all rotten jocelyn thews tone and gesture were smoothly disdainful  you are quite right he agreed you have lost what you call your nerve you had better send for the newspaper men give them plenty of champagne and explain what a loyal american citizen you are have you burnt everything  every scrap of paper in the house which concerns a certain matter is burnt rentoul declared  it would be  but i am in the right the agitated man protested vigorously for five years we have worked and with good result it is finished with us now for the present there is no one who would dare to continue five long years mind you mr jocelyn thew that is worth something eh  whatever it may be worth was the somewhat grim reply will be decided within the next fortnight that doesnt concern you though  you are not staying over here now that the war has come  not i but listen there is no need for you to know where i am going and i am not going to tell you there is no need for you to remember that you ever knew me in your life there is no need for you to remember any of the work in which you have been engaged your propaganda has developed a few strong men in this country and discovered a good deal of pulp you are part of the pulp there is only one other thing if you should be heard of rentoul shall we say telephoning or calling upon the police here offering to sellno by god you dont the mans furtive tug at his hip pocket was almost pathetic in its futility jocelyn thew had him by the throat holding him with one hand well away from him a quivering mass of discoloured terrified flesh  now you know he continued coolly why i sent for you rentoul now you know why i rather preferred to see you here to coming to your fifth avenue mansion i dont like trapsi dont like traitors  i give you my word the breathless man began my word of honour  neither would interest me the other interrupted grimly you are to be trusted just as far as you can be seen just as far as your own safety and welfare depend upon your fidelity you neednt be so terrified he went on as leaning over he took the revolver from rentouls pocket drew out the cartridges and threw it upon the table youve earned any ugly thing that might be coming to you but i should think it very probable that you will be able to go on overfeeding your filthy carcass for a few more years first of all though perhaps you had better tell me exactly why you have an appointment with mr harrison from police headquarters at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  rentoul was white to the lips  i wanted to explain about the wireless he faltered  that sounds very probable was the contemptuous reply what else  nothing  jocelyn thew shrugged his shoulders his victim cowered before him for the first time the girl moved she came a little nearer and there was fury in her eyes as she looked down upon the terrified man  we could keep him here she whispered ned grimes and some of the others will be in soon there are plenty of ways of getting rid of him for a time  it wouldnt be worth while thew said simply one doesnt commit crimes for such carrion  rentoul had struggled into a sitting posture he was dabbing feebly at his forehead with an overperfumed handkerchief  i wanted to make peace at headquarters he whined i want to be left alone i should not have told them anything  that may or may not be jocelyn thew replied all that i am fairly sure of is that you will keep your mouth shut now you know he went on his voice growing a shade more menacing that i never threaten where i do not perform i may not be over here myself but there will be a few men left in new york and one word from your lipseven a hintand your life will pay the forfeit within twentyfour hours you will be watched for a timeyou and a few others of your kidneywatched until the time has gone by when anything you could say or do would be of account  have you anything more to say to me the man stammered i feel faint  his persecutor threw open the door  nothing get into your car and drive home keep out of sight and hearing for a time you are no particular ornament nor any use to any country but remember that everything you have done you have done when the country of your birth was in trouble and the country of your adoption was at peace the situation is altered the country of which you are a naturalised citizen is now at war you had better remember it and decide for yourself where your duty lies  they listened to his heavy footsteps as he descended the stairs then the girl turned to her companion  mr thew she began you are not a german or an austrian yet you are doing their work risking your life every day is it for money  no he replied in a general way it is not for money  what is it then she asked curiously  he stood looking out across the roofs and at the distant skyscrapers she watched him without speaking she knew very well that his eyes saw nothing of the landscape he was looking back into some world of his own fancy back perhaps into the shadows of his own life concerning which no word that she or any one else in the city had ever heard had passed his lips     chapter iv   the two mencrawshay and sam hobsonstill a little breathless stood at the end of the dock gazing out towards the river around them was a slowly dispersing crowd of sightseers friends and relations of the passengers on board the great american liner ploughing her way down the river amidst the shrieks and hoots of her attendant tugs out on the horizon beyond the statue of liberty two long grey sinister shapes were waiting hobson glanced at them gloomily  guess those are our destroyers going to take the city of boston some of the way across he observed to think with all this fuss about that she must go and start an hour before her time  its filthy luck the englishman muttered  the crowd grew thinner and thinner yet the two men made no movement towards departure it seemed to crawshay impossible that after all they had gone through they should have failed the journey in the fast motor car after a breakdown of the chicago limited rushing through the night like some live monster tearing now through a plain of level lights as they passed through some great city vomiting fire and flame into the black darkness of the country places it was like the ride of madmen and more than once they had both hung on to their seats in something which was almost terror how are we going crawshay had asked perpetually  still that infernal halfhour was the continual reply we are doing seventy but we dont seem to be able to work it down  a powerful automobile had taken them through the streets of new york and lay now a wreck in one of the streets a mile from the dock they had finished the journey in a taxicab and the finish had been thishalf an hour late yet they lingered with their eyes fixed upon the disappearing ship  i guess theres nothing more we can do hobson said at last grudgingly we can lay it up for them on the other side and we can talk to her all the way to liverpool on the wireless but if there is any scoop to be made the othersll get itnot us  if only we could have got on board crawshay muttered its no use thinking of a tug i suppose  the american shook his head  shes too far out he replied gloomily theres nothing to be hired that could catch her  crawshays hand had suddenly stolen to his chin there was a queer light in his eyes he clutched at his companions arm  youre wrong hobson he exclaimed there is come right along with me we can talk as we go  are you crazy the american demanded  not quite the other answered hurry up man  where to to new jersey ive got government orders endorsed by your own secretary of war its a hundred to one they wont listen to me but weve got to try it  he was already dragging his companion down the wooden way his whole expression had changed his face was alight with the joy of an idea already hobson upon whom the germ of that idea had dawned began to be infected with his enthusiasm  its a gorgeous stunt he acknowledged as he followed his companion into a taxicab if we bring it off its going to knock the movies silly  katharine weary at last of waving her hand to the indistinct blur of faces upon the dock picked up the great clusters of roses which late arrivals had thrust into her arms at the last moment and descended to her stateroom upon the saloon deck she spent only a few minutes looking at the arrangement of her things and then knocked at the door of the stateroom exactly opposite a thickbrowed heavylooking man sombrely and professionally dressed opened the door  are you wanting me doctor gant she asked  the doctor shook his head  the patient is asleep he announced in a whisper  katharine stepped inside and stood looking down upon the pale almost ghastly face of the man stretched at full length upon the bed  why i remember him perfectly she exclaimed he was in number three ward for some time surely he was a clerk at one of the drygoods stores downtown  the doctor nodded  very likely  i remember the case katharine continuedappendicitis followed by pneumonia and complicated by angina pectoris  you have it precisely  katharines eyes were full of perplexity  but the man is in very poor circumstances she remarked how on earth can he afford a trip like this he was on the free list at the hospital  the doctor frowned  that is not my business he said my fees are paid and the steamer tickets appear to be in order he probably has wealthy friends  katharine looked down once more at the sleeping man his face was insignificant his expression peevish his features without the animation of any high purpose  i really cannot understand she murmured how he became a frienda friend  a friend of whom the doctor enquired  katharine reflected and shook her head  perhaps i was indiscreet she confessed i dare say you know as much about him as i do at what time would you like me to come and help you change the bandages  i shall change them alone the doctor replied  i prefer to  katharine glanced up in surprise  surely you are not in earnest she asked what else am i here for i suppose you realise that i am fully qualified  the doctor unbent a little  i am perfectly well aware of that miss beverley he said and it may be that there are times when i shall be glad of your help and in any case he went on i shall have to ask you to take a share in the night watching but the surgical part of the case has been a great responsibility and i couldnt afford to have the slightest thing in the world happen to one of my bandages  katharine nodded  you are thinking of nurse lynn she observed but really i am very careful  i am sure of it the doctor acknowledged but so long as i am here with nothing else to do and a very heavy fee if by any chance i bring my man through i may just as well see to these things myself at any moment i might need your help and i am very happy miss beverley to think that i shall have some one like you to fall back upon my great hope he went on is that we may get him across without a touch of the angina  will he ever get well she asked  the doctor shook his head doubtfully  one can never tell he said it is just one of these cases which are very close to the borderland with luck he may pull through may even become a fairly strong man again but he doesnt look as though he had much of a physique sometime or other the day will come when life or death for him will depend entirely upon his will  she nodded and moved away my stateroom is just opposite if you want me at any time doctor she said  he bowed and closed the door after her katharine made her way into her cabin sat on her steamer trunk and looked around a little helplessly the confusion of thought in which she had come on board was only increased by this introduction to doctor and patient a presentiment of strange and imminent happenings kept her seated there long after the dressing bugle had sounded  the city of boston was four hours out of harbour with her course set direct for liverpool the passengers of whom there were only a very moderate number had taken possession of their staterooms examined their lifebelts eaten their first meal and were now at eight oclock on a fine june evening mostly strolling about the deck or reclining in steamer chairs there was none of the oldtime feeling that a sixdays holiday was before them a sixdays freedom from all anxiety and care even in these first few hours of their enterprise a certain strain of suppressed excitement was almost universally noticeable there was no escaping from grim facts and the facts were brought home to them all the time by those two businesslike destroyers flying the stars and stripes and whose decks were swept continually by a deluge of green salt water amongst the few people who conversed there was but one subject of conversation a subject which every one affected to treat lightly and yet which no one managed to discuss without signs of anxiety  this thing will get on all our nerves before we are over brand a breezy newspaper man from the west observed what with boat drill three times a day and lifebelt parade going on all the time on the deck one doesnt get a chance to forget that we are liable to get a torpedo in our side at any moment  oh these little gnats of uncle sams will look after us a more cheerful confrère observed come into the smoking room and ill buy you a drink  a good deal of courage seemed to be sought in that direction and presently although the afterglow of the sunset was still brilliant the decks were almost deserted on the starboard side only a man and a woman remained and gradually as though with a certain unwillingness they drifted closer together the woman who wore a black and white check coat over her blue serge steamer dress and a small black hat from which she had pushed back the veil was leaning over the side of the steamer her head supported by her hand looking steadily into the mass of red and orange clouds the man who was smoking a cigar with both hands in his ulster pockets seemed as though he would have passed her but without turning her head she held out her hand and beckoned him to her side  i was beginning to wonder whether you were an absentee katharine remarked  i have been making friends with the captain jocelyn thew replied  please arrange my chair she begged i should like to sit down  he did as he was asked arranging her rugs with the care of an old traveler all his movements were very deliberate even the searching way in which his eyes swept the long row of empty chairs on either side of them and the care with which he fastened two open portholes above their heads finally he accepted her invitation and sat by her side  i have seen you once before she observed just before we started  yes he murmured  you were standing on the upper deck she continued a little away from the others you had your glasses glued to your eyes and you watched the dock you had the air of one looking for a late arrival do you know of any one who has missed the boat  i think so  a friend  no an enemy he answered equably  she turned her head a little it was obvious that he was speaking the truth  so you have enemies  a great many he acknowledged one in particular just now perhaps he went on i should say an opponent  if that is so she remarked after a moments pause you should be glad that he missed the boat  jocelyn thew smiled  i am he admitted it was part of my plan that he should miss it  she moved uneasily in her chair  so you havent finished with adventures yet  not just yet  there was a brief silence then she turned her head a little leaning it still on the back of the chair but watching him as she spoke  i have seen my patient she told him i have also had some conversation with the doctor  well  i am beginning to think she continued that you must be a philanthropist  why  you hinted she went on that your friend was in poor circumstances you did not tell me though that you were paying the whole expenses of this trip just so that the man should see his home and his family before he died  i told you that the care of him was a charge upon me jocelyn thew reminded her that amounts to the same thing doesnt it i was clever enough anyhow to get a good nurse at a small fee  i am not at all sure she replied that i shall not charge you something outrageous you are probably a millionaire  whatever you charge me he promised i shall try to pay  the two journalists refreshed and encouraged by their libation strolled past arm in arm  queer sort of voyage this for a man on the point of death the westerner observed they brought a chap on here an hour before we sailed in an ambulance with a doctor and a hospital nurse had to be carried every foot of the way  whats wrong with him the other enquired  he was only operated upon for appendicitis a fortnight ago and they say that he has angina pectoris amongst other complications they brought him straight from the hospital seems hes crazy to get back to england to die  the two men passed out of hearing jocelyn flicked the ash from the cigarette which he had lighted  sounds a queer sort of story the way they tell it he observed glancing at his companion  oh i dont know she replied men have done this sort of thing beforebut it isnt often she went on that a man has done it for the sake of another man  he smiled  you have the oldfashioned idea of mans devotion to woman cant you believe that there may be ties between two men stronger even than between a man and the woman he loves  i can believe that she assented but the men must have something in common i should find it hard to believe for instance that they existed between you and the man downstairs  he shrugged his shoulders very slightly  you forget he observed that a man does not look at his best after such an illness as phillips has had you find him perhaps a little insignificant you are probably aware of his vocation and station in life  i am  and these things he went on make it difficult for you to believe that there is any great tie between us two yet it is the exception which proves the rule you know i will not say that your patient has ever saved my life or performed any immortal action yet believe me he has courage and a grit you would scarcely believe in and i am speaking seriously when i tell you that not only i but others are under deep obligations to him  he rose to his feet with the air of one who has closed the subject katharine also threw off her rugs  you are going to walk she asked please take me with you i dont know why but i feel restless this evening  they paced side by side up and down the deck pausing now and then to watch the destroyers and indulging in a very spasmodic conversation at their fourth promenade as they reached the stern extremity of their deck the woman paused and holding to the railing with one hand looked steadily back towards new york the colour was fading slowly from the sky now but it was still marvellously clear  are you homesick for what lies beneath those clouds he enquired lightly  she took no immediate account of his words her eyes were fixed upon one spot in that distant curtain of sky suddenly she pointed with her finger  whats that she asked no the masts dipping nowyou cant see therethe other side  he followed her outstretched finger and slowly his fine black eyebrows grew closer and closer together far away at a certain spot in the clear evening sky was a little speck of black hidden every now and then by the mast of the ship as she rolled but distinctly there all the time a little smudge in an amber setting too small for a cloud yet a visible and tangible object katharine felt her companions arm tighten upon hers and she saw his face grow like a piece of marble  its a seaplane he muttered coming from the new jersey coast  through that mysterious agency by means of which news travels on board ship as though supernaturally conveyed the deck was crowded in a very few moments by practically every passenger and most of the officers every form of telescope and fieldglass was directed towards the now clearly visible seaplane speculations were everywhere to be heard  come to warn us of a submarine was the first suggestion  theyd use the wireless was the prompt reminder  but seaplanes can spot the submarines under the sea one of the journalists reminded the bystanders theyre a better escort than any destroyer  she cant come all the way across the atlantic though brand observed  its some new device of uncle sams they are testing perhaps his friend suggested gee you can hear her now quite plainly there are two of them in the cara pilot and an observer wonder what the captain thinks about it  the captain on the bridge was talking to his chief officer fragments of their conversation were apparently overheard for it was soon rumoured around that the captain had expressed his opinion that this was simply part of some maneuvres they were carrying out from the new jersey aviation station jocelyn thew watched the blue fire about the mast  i wonder whether thats she talking to us he observed one would have to be pretty nippy with ones fingers to work aboard on one of those small things  do you suppose she is bringing us a message katharine asked  he shook his head  they could do that by wireless from the shore he replied hullo were slowing down  the little crowd was now bubbling over with excitement the speed of the steamer had without a doubt been slackened and a boat was being lowered brand and his companion immensely happy were already dotting down their notes for the wireless the seaplane was gently skimming the water almost alongside and barely fifty yards away the pilot and his companion were clearly visible the passengers lined the whole length of the steamer leaning over to watch the dénouement of this strange scene  its a newspaper scoop one man suggested  the idea was not favourably entertained  no newspaper would be allowed to make use of a government seaplane brand pointed out apart from that they wouldnt dare to stop a steamer out here  theres the boat some one else exclaimed pointing to one of the ships lifeboats which had shot out towards the plane she must be going to pick one of the men up  the steamer was merely drifting now and its strange visitor had alighted upon the water rushing along a little way in front and leaving two long milky paths of white foam behind both the pilot and the passenger were drenched by every wave they watched the latter as he was taken off and their eyes followed the return of the lifeboat almost immediately afterwards the plane increasing its speed rushed across the surface of the water and rose again  prettiest sight i ever saw in my life brand declared enthusiastically  we live in wonderful times his friend agreed looking longingly at the wireless office i guess we must get a look at this chap anyway he added hes the first man who has overtaken an american liner so far from land like this before  the man who clambered a few minutes later up the ladder of the steamer had not the appearance of one who has performed a heroic action his clothes had shrunk upon his body and the sea water was oozing from him in all directions his face was blue with cold and almost unrecognisable nevertheless jocelyn thew who was one of the most eager of the sightseers attained a certain measure of conviction as he shut up his glasses with a snap and turned to his companion  an englishman he observed  do you know him she asked curiously  i cant go so far as that he admitted but  but he was the man for whom you were looking before the steamer started she declared confidently  seems a little rough luck to be caught up like this out in the ocean he grumbled i dont know that the mans likely to do me any particular harm he added but id just as soon he wasnt on board  meanwhile the captain had hurried his belated passenger into his room and the ship saw no more of him that night by degrees the excitement simmered down jocelyn escorted his companion to the gangway and bade her good night  i am not at all sure she protested that i am ready to go down yet  you must show a little interest in your patient he insisted  but the doctor has already as good as told me to keep away  gant is a peculiar fellow he told her by this time he has probably changed his mind and needs your help besides i am anxious to hear what they say in the smoking room concerning this extraordinary visitor  she looked around they were absolutely alone  who is he she asked and what does his coming mean to you  his name is crawshay jocelyn replied he is an exscotland yard man who came over here to work for the english secret service  what does he want here she whispered a little hoarsely  jocelyn raised his cap as he turned away  me he answered hell probably be disappointed though     chapter v   crawshay found himself a popular hero when at a few minutes before eleven oclock the next morning he made his appearance on deck with little regard to the weather which was fine and warm he was clad in a thick grey suit and a voluminous overcoat the fact that his borrowed hat was several sizes too large for him detracted a little from the dignity of his appearance a misfortune for which he endeavoured to atone by a distinct aloofness of manner the newspaper men however were not to be denied  say mr crawshay brand began stopping him as soon as he had emerged from the companionway id like to shake hands with you my names brand im a newspaper man  crawshay shook hands although he showed no particular enthusiasm about the proceeding  and i am clark of the minneapolis record the small dark man who was generally by brands side added put it there sir  crawshay put it there with an incipient reluctance which the two men were not slow to note  kind of shock to you yesterday no doubt brand began it was a fine plucky thing to do sir ever flown before  never crawshay confessed the sensation waserentirely new to me i found the descent upon the water most uncomfortable soaked your shore clothes eh brand observed  i was not attired for the proceeding crawshay admitted i was in fact very inappropriately dressed i was wearing a thin flannel suit which was completely ruined and i do not think that i shall ever be warm again  mr brand glanced longingly at his wrist watch and sighed  i make it a rule sir he said never to drink before twelve oclock but there is no rule without an exception if you think that a double jigger of gin with a little lemon and  stop crawshay begged i have no sympathy with the weird compounds produced by your bartenders as a matter of fact i take nothing at all except with my meals i am going to sit in this sunshine and try and recover my normal temperature  there are a few of the boys on board brand continued insinuatingly who would like to join in our little chat if you wouldnt mind their stepping round  i have no desire for a chat with any one crawshay objected i came up on deck to rest kindly ask me what you want to know and leave me alone for a time  then what in thunder sent you here after an american liner on a seaplane brand demanded thats about the long and short of what were aching to know i think  youve hit it ned as usual mr clark of the minneapolis record acquiesced crawshay drew his rug about him a little peevishly  my name he said is charles reginald crawshay  we got that from the captain brand replied very nice name too  i have been attached crawshay went on to the british embassy at washington  you dont say brand murmured  i am returning home crawshay continued because i intend to join the british army i was unfortunate enough to miss the boat and being in company with a person of authority and influence he suggested partly in joke that i should try to persuade one of the pilots of your new seaplanes at jersey to bring me out he further bet me five hundred dollars that i would not attempt the flight i am one of those sort of people crawshay confessed meditatively who rise to a bet as to no other thing in life i suppose it comes from our inherited sporting instincts i accepted the bet and here i am  in time to save the british army eh brand observed  in time to take my rightful place amongst the defenders of my country was the dignified rebuke incidentally i have won a hundred pounds  would you do it again for the same money clark asked guilefully  the englishman coughed  i must confess he said that it is not an experience i am anxious to repeat  brand rose to his feet  well sir he concluded i offer you my congratulations on your trip we shall just dot a few words together concerning it for the new york newspapers anything youd like to add  crawshay stroked his upper lip  you can say he pronounced with dignity that i found the trip most enjoyable and bytheby you had better put a word in about the skill of the pilotlieutenant t johnson i believe his name was i have no experience in such matters and i found him once or twice a little unsympathetic when i complained of bumps but the young man did his bestof that i am convinced  mr brands tongue slowly crept round the outside of his mouth he met the eye of his friend mr clark and indulged in a wink he had the air of a man who felt relieved by the operation  we are very much obliged to you mr crawshay he declared you have done something to brighten this trip anyway  a little later crawshay announced either just before your luncheon or dinner hour if you and your friends would meet me in the smoking room i should be delighted to remember in the customary fashion that i have won a rather considerable wager  come thats bully brand declared with a little real feeling in his tone i tell you clark he added as they made their way along the deck to the writing room youve got to prick these damned britishers pretty hard but theyve generally got a bit of the right feeling somewhere tucked away hell have a swollen head for the rest of this voyage though crawshay watched the two men disappear out of the corner of his eye then he rose to his feet and commenced a little promenade about the sunny portion of the deck after two or three turns he found himself face to face with jocelyn thew who had just issued from the companionway  good morning mr late passenger the latter exclaimed  crawshay paused and looked him up and down  do i know you sir he asked  i am not so sure that you do jocelyn replied but after yesterday the whole world knows mr reginald crawshay  very kind of you i am sure crawshay murmured what i did really wasnt worth making a fuss about  you had an uncomfortable ride i fear jocelyn continued  i was most unsuitably attired crawshay hastened to explain if instead of asking me very absurd questions at the aerodrome they had provided me with some garments calculated to exclude the salt water i should be able to look back upon the trip with more pleasurable feelings  pity you had to make it wasnt it jocelyn observed falling into step with him  i scarcely follow you mrought i to know your name i have a shocking memory  my name is jocelyn thew  mr jocelyn thew crawshay concluded  i mean that it was a pity you missed the boat you and hobson wasnt it what was the weather like in chicago hot crawshay replied i was hotter there than i ever expect to be again in this world  a long tiring journey too from halifax  not only that sir crawshay agreed but a dirty journey i like to travel with the windows downcold water and fresh air you know for us english peoplebut the soft coal you burn in your engines is the most appalling uncleanly stuff i have ever met  still you got here jocelyn reminded him  i got here crawshay agreed with an air of satisfaction  and you can take a bath three times a day if you feel like it on board jocelyn continued im afraid you wont find much else to do  one can never tell crawshay sighed i have started on ocean trips sometimes which promised absolutely nothing in the way of entertainment and i have discovered myself before the end of the journey thoroughly interested and amused  nothing like looking on the bright side of things jocelyn observed  crawshay turned his head and contemplated his companion for a few moments jocelyn thew notwithstanding his fine slim figure his wellcut clothes and lean handsome face carried always with him some nameless unanalysable air of the man who has played the explorer who has peered into strange places who has handled the reins which guide the white horse of life as well as the black horse of death  i am quite sure he said in a tone of kindly approval that i shall find you a most interesting companion on this trip you and i must have a little further conversation together i have won a considerable sum of money i may say by myerexploit and i have invited some of these newspaper fellows to take a drink with me before luncheon in the smoking room i hope you will join us  i shall be delighted jocelyn accepted a drink with a friend and a little mutual toast is always a pleasure  crawshay paused they were standing outside the entrance to the captains cabin  i quite agree with you he said exercise your ingenuity mr jocelyn thew and think out a toast that we can both drink sincerely you will excuse me i am going in to talk to the captain for a few minutes there are a few matters concerning my personal comfort which need his attention i find the purser he added dropping his voice an excellent fellow no doubt but just a trifle unsympathetic eh  i have no doubt you are right jocelyn agreed we will meet again then just before one oclock     chapter vi   crawshay knocked at the door of the captains room received a stentorian invitation to enter and sank a little plaintively into a vacant easychair the purser who had been in close confabulation with his chief hastily took his leave  good morning sir the visitor said languidly  good morning mr crawshay the captain replied feeling a little stronger this morning i hope  crawshay sighed  the memory of that experience he began settling down in his chair  well well you ought to have got over that by this time the captain interrupted what can i do for you mr crawshay i have been yarning with the purser a little longer than usual this morning and i have some rounds to do  i must not stand in the way of your daily avocation the newcomer said gloomily i really dropped in chiefly to see if by any chance you had had a wireless message about me  not a word  no message eh now do you know that seems to me exceedingly strange crawshay ruminated  i dont see why it should was the somewhat brusque reply i have no doubt that the new york papers have some wonderful headlineshow an englishman catches the steamer or an english diplomatist eager to fightand all that sort of thing but apart from the spectacular side of it i dont suppose they consider your adventure of national interest  on the contrary it is the development of a new era crawshay replied with dignity just consider what actually happened i miss the steamer owing to the breakdown of the chicago limited and a subsequent automobile accident i arrive at the dock whilst you are in the shadow of the statue of liberty what do i do what no one else has ever done before i fly after you romance has never pictured such a thing i am a pioneer captain  the captain grinned  youve been pretty sorry for yourself ever since he observed  i must confess that i made up my mind to the heroic deed in a rash moment crawshay acknowledged i am a person of strong and unconquerable impulses you see that exceedingly disagreeable american policeman who was sent up to halifax on a fools errand with me and who subsequently led me on another to chicago bet me five hundred dollars as we stood upon the dock that i couldnt catch that steamer now if there is one thing he went on crossing his legs which excites my interest more than another it is a bet  that and your accent the captain said smiling are two of your most prominent british traits mr crawshay the latter took out his eyeglass and polished it  i have others he retorted but never mind i understood you to say i think that you have heard nothing by wireless about me  not a word  the captain glanced at his clock and showed some signs of impatience his visitor however remained blandly imperturbable  i see that you have only one operator in the wireless room he remarked  how do you know that  i happened to be walking by last night and i glanced in  we are shorthanded the captain explained  quite naturally crawshay replied now with reference to this young man i watched him coming down the steps from his office this morning you may be surprised to hear captain that i found him unprepossessingin fact i might almost say that i took a dislike to him  i am sure he would be very much disturbed if he knew your opinion was the faintly sarcastic reply he happens to be a young man with exceptionally good credentials  credentials crawshay observed blandly in which i have no faithno faith whatever  the captain turned his head suddenly there was a new expression in his face as he looked keenly at his visitor  what do you mean mr crawshay  nothing much i see you have been smoking a pipe captain you will forgive me if i light one of these perfectly damnable cigarettes which are all i have been able to buy on boardthank youi talk better when i smoke  it seems to me that you talk a great deal of nonsense the captain declared bluntly  intermingled at times the other insisted with a word or two of sense now i am going to repeat that i have very little faith in this wireless operator of yours at three oclock this morningi dont wish to tie myself down captain so i will say in the vicinity of that hourhe received a messagea long one i should imagine i put it to you sirwas that dispatch for you  no the captain admitted i had no message at that hour or since  verywell then crawshay continued loosening a little muffler at his throat i suppose you can ascertain from the purser if any message was delivered to any one of your passengers  i certainly can the captain admitted but to tell you the truth sir i scarcely see how this concerns you  i am endeavouring his visitor replied with a little wave of his hand to justify my statement enquire of the purser i beg you it will do no harm  the captain shrugged his shoulders touched the bell and despatched his steward for mr dix the purser who happening to be on the deck outside made an immediate appearance  mr dix the captain asked him can you tell me if you have received any wireless message intended for any one of the passengers at or since three oclock this morning not one sir  crawshays smile was beatific and triumphant he relit his cigarette which had gone out and crossing his legs made himself a little more comfortable  very well then he said what i should like to know is what became of that message which made very pretty illuminations around your conductor or whatever you call it for at least a quarter of an hour this morning  the message may merely have been an intercepted one the purser pointed out it may not have been fur us at all  i had an idea crawshay persisted with bland and officious precision that even intercepted messages especially in time of war were referred to some person of authority on board apart from that however the message i refer to was written down and delivered to one of your passengers i happened to see your operator leave his office with an envelope in his hand  at three oclock in the morning the captain observed incredulously  at about a quarter of an hour past that time the other assented  and what on earth were you doing about on deck  i have strange habits crawshay confessed on board ship i indulge them i like to sleep when i feel like it and to wander about when i feel inclined after my extraordinary my remarkable experience of yesterday i was not disposed for slumber it appears to me sir the purser intervened that on board this ship you seem to do a great deal of walking about considering you have only been with us for a little more than twelve hours  liver crawshay explained confidentially i suffer intensely from my liver gentle and continual exercise is my greatest help  the captain turned towards his junior officer  mr dix he suggested perhaps it will clear this little matter up if we send for robins you might just step out yourself and bring him round  crawshay extended an eager hand  i beg that you will do nothing of the sort he pleaded  but why not the captain demanded you have made a definite charge against a wireless operator on the ship he ought to be placed in the position to be able to refute it if he can  there is no doubt crawshay agreed that in course of time he will be given that opportunity at present it would be indiscreet  and why  because there will be other messages and one is driven to the conclusion that it would be exceedingly interesting to lay hands on one of these messages no record of which is kept of which the purser is not informed and which are delivered secretly to  well to whom the captain demanded  to a passenger on board this steamer  the captain shook his head his whole expression was one of disapproval  nonsense he exclaimed if robins has failed in his duty which i still take the liberty of doubting i must crossquestion him at once  crawshay assumed the air of a pained invalid whose wishes have been thwarted  you must really oblige me by doing nothing of the sort he begged i am sure that my way is best besides you make me feel like an eavesdroppera common informer and that sort of thing you know  i am afraid that i cannot allow any question of sentiment to stand between me and the discipline of my ship was the somewhat uncompromising reply  crawshay sighed and with languid fingers unbuttoned his overcoat and coat then from some mysterious place in the neighbourhood of his breast pocket he produced an envelope containing a single halfsheet of paper  read that sir if you please he begged  the captain accepted the envelope with some reluctance straightened out its contents read the few words it contained several times and handed back the missive he stood for a moment like a man in a dream crawshay returned the envelope to his pocket and rose to his feet  well ill be getting along he observed well have another little chat captain later on i must take my matutinal stroll or i know how i shall feel about luncheon time besides there are some exuberant persons on board who are expecting me to offer them refreshment about one oclock out of my winnings and attached to your wonderful country as i am captain i must admit that cocktails do not agree with me one has to get used to them the captain murmured absently  i am most unfortunate too in the size of my feet crawshay continued dolefully looking down at them if there is one thing i thoroughly dislike it is being on board ship without rubber overshoesa product of your country captain which i must confess that i appreciate more than your cocktails good morning sir i hope i havent kept you from your rounds dear me he added in a tone of vexation as he passed through the door i believe that i have been sitting in a draught all the time i feel quite shivery  he shambled down the deck the purser lingered behind with an enquiring expression in his eyes but his chief did not take the hint  dix he said solemnly as he put on his cap and started out on his rounds i was right this is going to be a very queer voyage indeed     chapter vii   crawshay walked slowly along the deck until he found a completely sheltered spot then he summoned the deck steward and superintended the arrangement of his deck chair which was almost hidden under a heap of rugs he had just adjusted a pair of spectacles and was preparing to settle down when katharine in her nurses uniform issued from the companionway and stood for a moment looking about her crawshay at once raised his cap  good morning miss beverley he said you do not recognise me of course but my name is crawshay i had the pleasure of meeting you once at washington  i remember you quite well mr crawshay she replied glancing with some amusement at his muffledup state besides you must remember that you are the hero of the ship i suppose i ought to congratulate you upon your wonderful descent upon us yesterday  pray dont mention it crawshay murmured the chance just came my way ier he went on gazing hard at her uniform i was not aware that you were personally interested in nursing  that shows how little you know about me mr crawshay i have heard he admitted of your wonderful deeds of philanthropy also that you entirely support a large hospital in new york but i had no idea that you interested yourself personally in theermay i say most feminine and charming avocation of nursing  i have been a probationer she told him in my own hospital and i am at the present moment in attendance upon a patient on board this steamer  you amaze me he exclaimed youdid i understand you to say that you were in personal attendance upon a patient  that is so mr crawshay  well well forgive my astonishment he continued i had no idea at any rate i am glad that your patients state of health permits you to leave him for a time  her expression became a little graver  as a matter of fact she sighed my patient is very ill indeed i am afraid however the doctor shares the responsibility with me and he is staying with him now for half an hour  may i in that case he begged share your promenade  with pleasure she acquiesced without enthusiasm you will have to take off some of your coats though  i am suffering from chill he explained i sometimes think that i shall never be warm again after my experience of yesterday  he divested himself however of his outside coat arranged his muffler carefully thrust his hands into his pockets and fell into step by her side i am interested he observed in illness what exactly is the matter with your charge  he has had a bad operation she replied and there are complications  dear me dear me crawshay exclaimed in a shocked tone and in such a state he chooses to make a perilous voyage like this  that is rather his affair is it not she said drily  precisely her companion agreed precisely i should not perhaps have made the remark sickness however interests me very much i have the misfortune not to be strong myself and my own ailments occupy a good deal of my attention  she looked at him curiously  you suffer from nerves dont you she enquired  hideously he assented  and yet she continued still watching him in a puzzled fashion you made that extraordinary voyage through the air to catch this steamer that doesnt seem to me to be at all the sort of thing a nervous person would do  it was for a bet he explained confidentially the only occasion upon which i forget my nerves is when there is a bet to be lost or won at the time he went on my deportment was i think all that could have been desired the sensations of which i was undoubtedly conscious i contrived to adequately conceal the aftershock however has i must admit been considerable  was it really so terribly important she enquired that you should be in london next week  the war office made a special point of it he assured her got to join up you know directly i arrive  do you think she enquired after a brief pause that you will enjoy soldiering better than pseudodiplomacy i dont exactly know how to refer to your work i only remember that when we were introduced i was told that you had something to do with the secret service  they were leaning over the side of the steamer and she glanced curiously at his long rather sunken face at the uncertain mouth and at the eyes carefully concealed behind a pair of green spectacles he seemed somehow to have aged since they had first met a year ago in washington  to tell you the truth he confided i am a little tired of my job neither fish nor fowl dont you know i took an observation course at scotland yard but i suppose i am too slowwitted for what they call secretservice work over here  america wouldnt provide you with many opportunities would it she observed  you are quite right he replied i am much more at home upon the continent the secret service in america as we understand it does not exist one finds oneself continually in collaboration with police inspectors and people who naturally do not understand ones point of view at any rate he concluded with a little sigh if i have any talents they havent come to the front in washington i dont believe that dear old sir richard was at all sorry to see the last of me and you think you will prefer your new profession  soldiering well i shall have to train up a bit and see beastly ugly work they seem to make of it nowadays i dont mind roughing it up to the extent of my capacity but i do think that the advice of ones medical man should be taken into consideration  she laughed at him openly  do you know she said i cant picture you campaigning in france  to tell you the truth i cant picture it myself he confessed frankly the stories i have heard with reference to the absence of physical comforts are something appalling bytheby he went on as though the idea had suddenly occurred to him i cant think how your patient can rest anyhow after an operation on beds like there are on this steamer i call it positively disgraceful of the company to impose such mattresses upon their patrons my bones positively ache this morning  mr phillips has his own mattress she told him or rather one of the hospital ones he was carried straight into the ambulance from the ward  mrerphillips crawshay repeated have i ever met him  i should think not  he is of course a very great friend of yours  i dont know why you should suppose that  come come he remonstrated i suppose i am an infernally curious prying sort of chap but when one thinks of you a society belle of america you know and further the patroness of that great hospital crossing the atlantic yourself in charge of a favoured patient one cant helpcan one  can one what she asked coolly  scenting a romance or a mystery he replied in any case mr phillips must be a man of some determination to risk so much just for the sake of getting home  she turned and recommenced their promenade  i wonder whether you realise that it isnt etiquette to question a nurse about her patient she reminded him  im sure i am very sorry he assured her i didnt imagine that my questions were in any way offensive i told you from the first that i was always interested in invalids and cases of illness  she turned her head and looked at him her glance was reproving her manner impatient  really mr crawshay she said i think that you are one of the most inquisitive people i ever met  it really isnt inquisitiveness he protested its just obstinacy i hate to leave a problem unexplained  then to prevent any further misunderstanding mr crawshay she concluded a little coldly let me tell you that there are private reasons which make any further questioning on your part concerning this matter impertinent  crawshay lifted his cap he had the air of a man who has received a rebuff which he takes in ill part  i will not risk your further displeasure miss beverley he said stopping by his steamer chair i trust that you will enjoy the remainder of your promenade good morning  he summoned the deck steward to arrange his rugs and lay back in his steamer chair eating broth which he loathed and watching jocelyn thew and katharine beverley through spectacles which somewhat impaired his vision the two had strolled together to the side of the ship to watch a shoal of porpoises go by  i see that you are acquainted with our hero of the seaplane jocelyn thew remarked  she nodded  i met him once at washington and once at the polo games  tell me what you think of him  she smiled  well she confessed i scarcely know how to think of him i must say though that in a general way i should think any profession would suit him better than diplomacy  you find him stupid  i do she admitted and in a particularly british way  jocelyn glanced thoughtfully across at crawshay who was contemplating his empty cup with apparent regret  you will not think that i am taking a liberty miss beverley if i ask you a question  why should i is it so very personal  as a matter of fact it isnt personal at all i was only going to ask you if you would mind telling me what our friend mr crawshay was talking to you about just now are you really interested she asked with an air of faint surprise well if you must know he was asking questions about my patient he appears to be something of a hypochondriac himself and he is very interested in illnesses  he has the air of one who takes care of himself jocelyn observed with a faint smile however one mustnt judge he may be delicate  i think he is an old woman she remarked carelessly  he rather gives one that impression doesnt he jocelyn agreed bytheby there wasnt much you could tell him about your patient was there  there really isnt anything at all she replied i just mentioned his condition and as mr crawshay still seemed curious i reminded him that it was not etiquette to question a nurse about her patients  most discreet jocelyn declared as a matter of fact he went on i have scarcely thought it worth while to mention it to you because i knew exactly the sort of answer you would make to any too curious questions but there is a reason and a very serious reason why my friend phillips wishes to avoid so far as possible all manner of notice and questions  you call him your friend phillips she remarked yet you dont seem to have been near him since we started  nor do i intend to he replied that is the other point concerning which i wish to speak to you you may think it very extraordinary and i offer no explanation but i do not wish it known tosay mr crawshay or any other casual enquirer that i have any acquaintance with or interest in phillips  the subject is dismissed she promised lightly i am not in the least an inquisitive person i understand perfectly and my lips are sealed  his little smile of thanks momentarily transformed his expression her eyes became softer as they met his  now please walk with me for a little time she begged and let us leave off talking of these grizzly subjects youve really taken very little notice of me so far and i have been rather looking forward to the voyage you have traveled so much that i am quite sure you could be a most interesting companion if you wished to be  he obeyed at once falling easily into step with her and talking lightly enough about the voyage their fellow passengers and other trifling subjects her occasional attempts to lead the conversation into more serious channels even to the subject of his travels he avoided however with a curious persistency once she stopped short and forced him to look at her  mr jocelyn thew she complained tell me why you persist in treating me like a child  then for the first time his tone became graver  i want to treat you and think of you he said in the only way that is possible for me  explain please she begged  he led her again to the side of the ship the sea had freshened and the spray flew past them like salt diamonds  since it has pleased you to refer to the subject miss beverley he said seriously i will explain so far as i am able i suppose that i have committed nearly every one of the crimes which our abbreviated dictionary of modern life enumerates if the truth were known about me and i were judged by certain prevailing laws not only my reputation but my life might be in serious danger but there is one crime which i have not committed and which i do not intend to commit one pain which i have avoided all my life myself and avoided inflicting upon others i think you must know what i refer to  i can assure you that i do not she told him frankly in any case i hate ambiguity do please tell me exactly what you mean  i was referring to my attitude towards your sex he replied  there was a faint twinkle in her eyes  that sounds so ponderous she murmured dont you like us then  there are circumstances in my life he said which prevent my even considering the subject  she turned and looked him full in the eyes her very sweet mouth was suddenly pathetic her eyes were full of gentle resentment  i do not believe she said firmly that you have done a single thing in life of which you ought to be ashamed i do not believe one of the hard things you have said about yourself i am not a child i am a womantwentysix years oldand i like to choose my own friends i should like you to be my friend mr thew  he murmured a few words entirely conventional nothing in his expression responded in the least to the appeal of her words his face had grown like granite he turned to the purser who was strolling by as though unconsciously the finer qualities of his voice had gone as he engaged the latter in some trivial conversation     chapter viii   that night at dinner time a stranger appeared at the captains table a dark thickbrowed man in morning clothes of professional cut was shown by one of the saloon stewards to a seat which had hitherto been vacant crawshay whose place was nearly opposite leaned across at once with an air of interest  good evening doctor he said  good evening sir was the somewhat gruff reply  glad to see that you are able to come in and join us crawshay continued unabashed you are i believe the physician in attendance on mr phillips i am very interested in illnesses as a matter of fact i am a great invalid myself  the doctor contented himself with a muttered monosyllable which was not brimful of sympathy  this is a very remarkable expedition of yours crawshay went on i am a man of very little sentiment myselfone place to me is very much like anotherso i do not understand this wild desire on the part of an invalid to risk his life by undertaking such a journey it is a great feat however it shows what can be accomplished by a man of determination even when he is on the point of death who said that my patient was on the point of death the doctor demanded brusquely  it is common report crawshay assured him besides as you know the new york press got hold of the story before you started and the facts were in all the evening papers  what facts  didnt you read them most interesting crawshay continued they all took the same line and agreed that it was an absolutely unprecedented occurrence for a man to embark upon an ocean voyage only a few days after an operation for appendicitis with double pneumonia behind and angina pectoris intervening almost as unusual crawshay concluded with a little bow as the fact of his being escorted by the most distinguished amateur nurse in the world and a physician of such distinction as doctordoctordear me how extraordinary for the moment i must confess that your name has escaped me  the heavybrowed man leaned forward a little deliberately towards his visàvis his was not an attractive personality his features were large and of bulldog type his forehead was low and his eyes which gave one the impression of being clear and penetrating were concealed by heavy spectacles his hands only which were wellshaped and cared for might have indicated his profession  my name he said is gantdoctor james h gant you are not i presume a medical man yourself  crawshay shook his head  a most admirable profession he declared but one which i should never have the nerve to follow  you do not therefore appreciate the fact doctor gant continued that a medical man especially one connected with a hospital of such high standing as st agness does not discuss his patients ailments with strangers  no offence doctorno offence crawshay protested across the table mine is just the natural interest in a fellow sufferer of a man who has known most of the ailments to which we weak humans are subject  i suppose as we have the pleasure of your company this evening the captain intervened miss beverley will be an absentee  miss beverley at the present moment is taking my place the doctor replied she insisted upon it personally i am used to eating at all times and in all manner of places  there was a brief silence during which crawshay discussed the subject of inoculation for colds in the head with his neighbour on the other side and the doctor showed a very formidable capacity for making up for any meals which he might have missed by too rigid an attention to his patient the captain presently addressed him again  have you met our ships doctor yet he enquired  i have had that honour doctor gant acknowledged he was good enough to call upon me yesterday and offer his assistance should i require it  a very clever fellow i believe the captain observed  he impressed me some the other confessed if any further complications should arise it will be a relief for me to consult him  the subject of the sick man dropped crawshay walked out of the saloon with the captain and left him at the bottom of the stairs  ill take the liberty of paying you a short call presently captain if i may he said i just want to fetch my wraps and bytheby did i tell you that i have been fortunate enough to find a pair of rubbers that just fit me at the barbers one of the greatest blessings on board ship captain believe me is the barbers shop its like a bijou harrods or whiteleysanything you want from an elephant to a needle you know in about ten minutes captain if i shant be disturbing you  the captain found the purser on deck and took him into his cabin  i saw you speaking to doctor gant in the gangway the former observed i wonder what he really thinks about his patient  i think i can tell you that sir without betraying any confidences the purser replied unless a miracle happens therell be a burial before we get across poor fellow it seems too bad after such an effort  the captain nodded sympathetically  after all i can understand this hankering of a man to die in his own country he said i had a brother once the same way they brought him home from australia dying all the way as they believed but directly he set foot in england he seemed to take on a new lease of lifelived for years afterwards is that so the purser remarked well this fellow ought to have a chance its a short voyage and he has his own doctor and nurse to look after him  lets hope theyll keep him alive then i hate the burial service at sea  the captain turned aside and filled his pipe thoughtfully  dix he continued as you know i am not a superstitious man but there seems to be something about this trip i cant fathom  meaning sir  well theres this wireless business first of all we shall close it up in about thirtysix hours you know and in the meantime i have been expecting half a dozen messages not one of which has come through  young fellow of the highest character robins the purser remarked drily  that may be the captain agreed and yet i cant get rid of my premonition i wouldnt mind laying you anything you like dix that we dont sight a submarine and shouldnt even if we hadnt our guns trained  thats one comfort anyway being a family man sir  yes i know all about your family dix the captain interrupted irritably but just at the present moment i am more interested in what is going on in my ship i begin to believe that mr crawshays voyage through the air wasnt altogether a piece of bravado after all  the purser smiled a little incredulously he sent round this evening to know if i could lend him some flannel pyjamas he saidsays all the things that have been collected together for him are too thin that man makes me tired sir  he makes me wonder  hows that sir  because i cant size him up the captain declared there isnt a soul on board who isnt laughing at him and saying what a sissy he is they say he has smuggled an extra lifebelt into his cabin and spends half his time being seasick and the other half looking out for submarines  thats the sort of fellow he seems to me anyway the purser observed  i cant say that ive quite made up my mind the captain pronounced i suppose you know dix that he was connected with the secret service at the english embassy  i didnt know it dix replied but if he has been lord help us no wonder the germans have got ahead of us every time  i dont think he was much of a success the other continued and as a matter of fact he is on his way back to england now to do his bit of soldiering all the same dix he gave me a turn the other day  hows that sir  showed me an order signed by a person i wont name the captain went on lowering his voice requesting me to practically run the ship according to his directionsmaking him a kind of almighty boss  mr dix opened his lips and closed them again his eyes were wide open with astonishment there was an indecisive knock at the door which at a gesture from the captain he opened wrapped in a huge overcoat with a cap buttoned around his ears and a scarf nearly up to his mouth crawshay stood there seeking admittance                                       i am exceedingly fortunate to find you both here the newcomer observed as he removed his cap captain may i have a few minutes conversation with you and mr dix  delighted the captain acquiesced so long as you dont keep me more than twenty minutes i am due on the bridge at nine oclock  i will endeavour not to be prolix crawshay continued carefully removing his rubbers unfastening his scarf and loosening his overcoat a damp night i fear that we may have fog  this all comes off the twenty minutes the captain reminded him  crawshay smiled appreciatively  into the heart of things then let me tell you that i suspect a conspiracy on board this boat  of what nature the captain asked swiftly  it is my opinion crawshay said deliberately that the result of the whole accumulated work of the german secret service compiled since the beginning of the war by means of secret service agents criminals and patriotic germans and austrians resident in the states is upon this ship  hell the purser murmured without reproof from his chief  it was believed crawshay continued that these documents together with a letter of vital importance were on the steamer which conveyed the personnel of the late german ambassador to europe the steamer was delayed at halifax and a more or less complete search was made i was present on behalf of the english embassy but i did not join personally in the search you have all heard that the seals of a tin chest belonging to a neutral country had been tampered with the chiefs of my department and the head of the american secret service firmly believe that the missing papers are in that chest and will be discovered when the chest is opened in london that is not a belief which i share  and your reasons mr crawshay the captain asked  first because hobson and i were decoyed to chicago by a bogus telegram evidently with the idea that we should find it impossible to catch or search this steamer secondly because there is on board just the one man whom i believe capable of conceiving and carrying out a task as difficult as this one would be  who is he the captain demanded  a very inoffensive wellmannered and exceedingly wellinformed individual who is travelling in this steamer under i believe his own namemr jocelyn thew  jocelyn thew the captain murmured  thew the purser repeated  now i tell you that i have definite suspicions of this man crawshay continued because i know that for some reason or other he hates england although he has the appearance of being an englishman i know that he has been friendly with enemy agents in new york and i know that he has been in recent communication with enemy headquarters at washington therefore as i say i suspect mr jocelyn thew i also suspect robins the wireless operator because i am convinced that he has received messages of which he has taken no record i now pass on to the remainder of my suspicions for which i frankly admit that i have nothing but surmise i suspect mr phillips doctor gant and miss katharine beverley  the last shock proved too much for the captain for the first time there was distinct incredulity in his face  look here mr crawshay he protested supposing you are right and that you are on the track of a conspiracy how do you account for a physician from the finest hospital in new york and one of the bestknown young ladies in america being mixed up in it  crawshay acknowledged the difficulties of the supposition  as regards the physician he said thoughtfully i must confess that i am without information concerning him a fact which increases my suspicion of robins for i should have had his dossier and also that of the man phillips by wireless twentyfour hours ago  what about miss beverley then the captain enquired her family is not only one of the oldest in america but they are real puritan anglosaxon stock white through and through she has a dozen relatives in congress who have all been working for war with germany for the last two years she also has as she told me herself a brother and four cousins fighting on the french frontthe brother in the canadian flying corps and the cousins in the english army  there i must confess that you have me crawshay admitted what you say is perfectly true that is one of the mysteries no plot would be worth solving you know if it hadnt a few mysteries in it  if you will allow me a word mr crawshay the purser intervened i think you will have to leave doctor gant and his patient and miss beverley out of your speculations i have our own ship doctors word for it that mr phillips condition is exactly as has been stated mr jocelyn thew may or may not be a suspicious character anything you suggest in the way of watching him can be done but as regards the other three i trust that you will not wish their comfort interfered with in any respect  beyond the search to which every one on board will have to be subjected crawshay replied i shall not interfere in any respect with the three people in question mr jocelyn thew however is different he is a man who has led a most adventurous life he seems to have travelled in every part of the globe wherever there was trouble brewing or a little fighting to be done  why do you connect him with the present enterprise the captain asked  because crawshay answered the wireless message of which your man robins took no record and concerning which you have kept silence at my request was delivered to mr jocelyn thew because too he went on it is my very earnest belief that at somewhere in the small hours of this morning there will be another message and mr jocelyn thew will be on deck to receive it  the captain knocked out the ashes of his pipe a little apprehensively  if half what you suspect is true mr crawshay he said you will forgive my saying so but jocelyn thew is not a man you ought to tackle without assistance  there was a peculiar glitter in crawshays deepset eyes for a single moment a newborn strength seemed to deepen the lines in his facea transforming change  you neednt worry captain he remarked coolly i am not taking too many chances and if our friend mr jocelyn thew should turn out to be the man i believe him to be i would rather tackle him alone  why mr dix demanded should anything in the shape of violence take place the ship can be searched every article of baggage ransacked and every passenger made to run the gauntlet  crawshay smiled  the search you speak of is already arranged for mr dix he said long cables from my friend hobson have already reached liverpoolbut the efficacy of such a proposed search would depend a little would it not upon whether we reach liverpool but if we were submarined the captain pointed out the papers would go to the bottom  crawshay leaned forward and whispered one word in the captains ear the latter sat for a moment as though paralysed  whats to prevent that fellow robins bringing her right on to our track crawshay demanded that is the reason i spent last night listening for the wireless its the reason im going to do the same tonight  the captain sprang to his feet  well run no risks about this he declared firmly well dismantle the apparatus id never hold up my head again if the von blucher got us  crawshay held out his hand  forgive me captain he said but we want proof leave it to me and if things are as i suspect well have that proofprobably before tomorrow morning he added glancing at the chart  there was a call down the deck a knock at the door the captain took up his oilskins regretfully  you will remember crawshay enjoined that little mandate i showed you  the captain nodded grimly  i am in your hands he admitted dont forget that the safety of the ship may be in your hands too  perhaps crawshay whispered even more than the safety of the ship     chapter ix   robins the wireless operator bent closer over his instrument and the blue fires flashed from the masthead of the steamer cutting their way through the darkness into the black spaces beyond the little room was lit by a dull oil light the door was fastclosed and locked away into the night sped one continual message  steamship city of boston lat long lying four points to northward of usual course reply  a time came when the young man ceased from his labours and sat up with a yawn he stretched out his hand and lit a cigarette walked to the little round window which commanded the deck gazed out of it steadily and turned back once more to his chair before the instrument then something happened a greater shock than any that lay in the blue lightning which he had been generating was awaiting him his right hand was suddenly gripped and held on to the table he found himself gazing straight down the black bore of a small but uncommonly uglylooking revolver a voice which seemed remarkable for its convincing qualities addressed him  if you speak a word robins move or show signs of any attempt to struggle i shall shoot you i have the right and the power robins a young man of nerve whose name stood high on an official list of those who might be relied upon for any desperate enterprise sat like a numbed thing dim visions of the face of this man only a few feet away from his own assailed him under some very different guise it was crawshay the man stripped for action whose lean strong fingers were gripping the butt of that revolver and whose eyes were holding him like gimlets  now if you are wise answer me a few questions crawshay began id have brought the captain with me but i thought we might do better business alone youve been advertising the ships whereabouts why  ive only been giving the usual calls the young man muttered  dont lie to me was the grim reply your wireless was supposed to be silent from yesterday midday except for the purpose of receiving calls i ask you again why and to whom were you advertising our whereabouts and course  robins looked at the revolver looked at crawshay and was dimly conscious of a damp feeling about his forehead nevertheless his lips were screwed together and he remained silent  come crawshay went on well have a commonsense talk i am an agent of the british secret service i have unlimited powers upon this ship power to put a bullet through your head if i choose and not a soul to question it the games up so far as you are concerned you have received messages on this steamer of which you have kept no record but which you have delivered secretly to a certain passenger of that i may or may not speak later on at present i am more interested in your operations of tonight you are signalling the information of our whereabouts for some definite reason what is it were you trying to pick up the blucher  i wasnt trying to pick up anybody the young man faltered  crawshays fingers gripped him by the shoulder his very determinedlooking mouth had suddenly become a ring of steel  if you dont give me a different answer in ten seconds robins ill blow your brains all over the cabin  the young man broke  i was trying to pick up the blucher he acknowledged  thats exactly what i thought crawshay muttered thats the game without a doubt what are you an englishman  i am not was the almost fierce reply blast england  crawshay looked into the black eyes suddenly lit with an ugly fire and nodded  i understand he said robins your name eh any relation to the young sinn feiner who was shot in dublin a few months ago  brother  that may save your life later on crawshay observed coolly now you can do one of three things you can come with me to the captain be put in irons and shot as soon as we landor before if the blucher finds us or you can send the message which i shall give you or you can end your days where you sit  what message the young man demanded  you will send out a general call as before repeating the latitude and longitude with a difference of exactly three points and you will repeat the altered course only you will substitute the word south for the word north  the young mans eyes suddenly gleamed as he turned towards the instrument but crawshay smiled with grim understanding  let me tell you that i understand the wireless he said impressively you will give the message exactly as i have told you or we finish things up on the spot i think you had better its a matter of compulsion you knowin fact ill explain matters to mr jocelyn thew if you like  the young mans eyes were round with amazement  jocelyn thew he repeated  precisely you neednt look so terrified it isnt you who have given away now what are you going to do  the young man swung round to his instrument crawshay released his hand stepping a little back  you are going to send the message then  yes was the sullen reply  capital crawshay exclaimed cautiously subsiding into a chair now youll go on every ten minutes until i tell you to stop  robins bent over his task and again the crackling waves broke away from their prison once his finger hesitated he glanced surreptitiously at crawshay four degrees south crawshay repeated softly  the night wore on every ten minutes the message was sent then there followed a brief silence spent generally by robins with his head drooped upon his clasped arms by crawshay in unceasing vigil just as the first faint gleam of daylight stole into the little turret chamber came the longwaitedfor reply the young man wrote down the few lines and passed them over crawshay who had risen to his feet glanced at them nodded and thrust the paper into his pocket  that seems quite satisfactory he said coldly now ask the blucher her exact course  robins sat for a moment motionless he felt crawshays presence towering over him felt again the spell of his softlyspoken command  dont waste any time please do as i tell you  robins obeyed in less than a quarter of an hour he handed over another slip of paper crawshay thrust it into his pocket  that concludes our business he said now let me see if i remember enough of this apparatus to put it out of action  he bent over the instrument removed some plugs turned some screws and finally placed in his pocket a small concealed part of the mechanism then he turned towards robins  you can leave here now he directed i shall lock the place up  robins had in some measure recovered himself he was a quiet holloweyed young person with thick black hair and a thin frame about which the uniform of the ship hung loosely you are the man who boarded the steamer from a seaplane arent you and pretended afterwards to be such a ninny  i am crawshay acknowledged  how did you get on to this  crawshay raised his eyebrows  sorry he replied that is a matter concerning which i fear that you will have to restrain your curiosity  how did you get in here  by means of a duplicate key which i obtained from the purser i hid in your bunk there and drew the curtains quite a comfortable mattress yours youll have to change your sleeping quarters though  what is going to happen to me the young man enquired  probably nothing extreme you were philosophical enough to accept the situation if crawshay went on more slowly you had falsified a single word of those messages your end would have been somewhat abrupt and your destination according to your past life as it is you can go where you choose now and report to the captain later on in the morning after i have had a talk with him  my kit is all in here  crawshay laid his hand upon the operators shoulder in peremptory fashion  then you will have to do without it for the present he replied coolly outside  the young man turned on his heel and disappeared without a word crawshay glanced once more at the dismantled instrument then followed robins on to the deck carefully locking the door behind him a grey stormy morning was just breaking with piles of angry clouds creeping up and showers of spray breaking over the ship on the weather side he chose a sheltered spot and stood for a few moments breathing in the strong salt air notwithstanding his success he was unaccountably depressed as far as he could see across the grey waste of waters there was no sign of any passing ship but the eastern horizon was blurred by a lowhanging bank of sinisterlooking clouds suddenly a voice rang out hailing him it was the captain descending from the bridge  come and have a cup of coffee with me in my room mr crawshay he invited  crawshay felt himself suddenly back again in the world of real happenings his depression passed as though by magic after all he had won the first trick and the next move was already forming up in his mind     chapter x   the captain sank into his easychair a little wearily it had been a long and rather trying vigil his steward filled two cups with coffee and at a sign from his master withdrew  any news  i have been compelled crawshay announced stirring his coffee to dismantle your wireless  the devil you have  also to speak words of wisdom to young robins i detected him signalling our location to the blucher  the captain set down his coffee cup  mr crawshay he said this is a very serious accusation  it isnt an accusation at allits a fact crawshay replied luckily he hadnt picked her up when i got there he signalled our exact location and our course a dozen times or more without response then i took a hand in the game  exactly what happened the captain enquired  well i borrowed a key from mr dix and whilst the young man was down at his supper i concealed myself in his bunk i listened to him for a short time and then i intervened  did he make any trouble  he had no chance crawshay explained a little grimly i was first off the mark on this piece of paper he added smoothing it out you will find robins calculations as to our whereabouts which i took as being correct these you understand were not picked up lower down you will see the message which he sent under my superintendence later on  superintendence the captain interrupted  at the point of my revolver crawshay explained this message was picked up by the blucher  the captain scanned the calculations eagerly  wish youd given us a little more room he muttered however it will be all right unless we get fog we might blunder into one another then  this little incident crawshay continued crossing his legs confirms certain impressions with which i came on board i think that the scheme was to get the documents on board this steamer and then in order to avoid the inevitable search at liverpool i fancy it was arranged that the blucher should be on the lookout for us and take over the messenger whoever he may be and the documents its a straightforward simple little scheme which we have now to look at from our own point of view in the first place the blucher is now very much less likely to capture us in the second place i would suggest that in case the blucher should happen to blunder across us we make the search at once instead of in liverpool  what search every one on board the captain asked  suspected persons only  exactly who are they first and foremost mr jocelyn thew  and afterwards  crawshay hesitated  mr phillips and his entourage  what the man who is supposed to be dying  i will admit crawshay said that this is more or less guesswork but i suspect every one with whom jocelyn speaks  great heavens you are not thinking of miss beverley the captain exclaimed  i fail utterly to understand her acquaintance with jocelyn thew crawshay confided i do not propose however that you interfere with these people for the moment what i do ask is that jocelyn thews effects are searched and at once  its a thing thats never happened before on any steamer ive commanded the captain said reluctantly but if it has to be done i will do it myself  what chance of fog is there his companion enquired  we shall get some within twentyfour hours for certain its coming up from the west now  then the sooner you make a start with mr jocelyn thew the better crawshay suggested i dont think theres one chance in a hundred that hed have those documents in any place where we should be likely to find them by any ordinary search but you can never tell the cleverest men often adopt the most obvious methods  the captain yawned  ill have two hours sleep he decided then dix and i will tackle the job i dont suppose you want to be in it i should prefer not crawshay replied ill follow your example he added rising to his feet  the habits of mr jocelyn thew on shore were doubtless most regular but on board ship he had developed a proclivity for sleeping until long after the first breakfast gong about halfpast eight that morning he was awakened from a sound sleep by a tap on his door and instead of the steward with his hot water no less a person entered than the captain followed by the purser jocelyn sat up in his bunk and rubbed his eyes  good morning gentlemen he said anything wrong  the captain undid the catch of the door and closed it behind him  are you sufficiently awake to listen to a few words from me on a subject of importance mr thew he asked  certainly was the prompt reply  very well then the captain proceeded i shall commence by taking you into my confidence there is an impression on the part of the british and american secret services that an attempt is being made to convey documents of great importance and containing treasonable matter to europe by some one on board this ship  jocelyn thew who was attired in silk pyjamas of very excellent quality swung himself out of the bunk and sat upon the side of it the captain was an observant man and of somewhat luxuriant tastes himself and he fully appreciated the texture and quality of the suspected mans night apparel this sounds remarkably interesting jocelyn said very kind of you captain i am sure to come and tell me about it  my visit the captain continued a little drily had a more definite object it is my duty to explain to you that the circumstances of this voyage are unprecedented we are going to take liberties with our passengers which in normal times would not be dreamed of  jocelyn thew pushed the knob with his left hand and let some cold water run into his basin then he dabbed his eyes for several moments with his fingers  yes i seem to be awake he remarked tell me about these liberties captain  to begin with i am going to search your stateroom and baggageor rather they are going to be searched under my supervision your trunk from the hold has already been brought up and is in the gangway  it seems to me jocelyn said sitting as mr dix expressed it afterwards like a tiger about to spring that youve been listening to that crazy loon crawshay  i am not at liberty the captain rejoined to divulge the source from which my information came i am only able to acquaint you with my intentions and to trust that you will offer no obstruction  the obstruction which i could offer against the captain of a ship and his crew would be a waste of energy jocelyn observed with fine sarcasm at the same time i protest most bitterly against my things being touched any search you deemed necessary could be undertaken at liverpool by the customs officers in the usual way i consider that this entrance into my stateroom on the high seas and this arbitrary resolve of yours to acquaint yourself with the nature of my belongings is indefensible and a gross insult  i am sorry that you take it this way mr thew the captain regretted any complaints you feel it right to make can be addressed to the companys agents in liverpool at present i must proceed with what i conceive to be my duty do you care to hand mr dix your keys  i will see mr dix damned first jocelyn assured him  the captain shrugged his shoulders called to the steward who was waiting outside and the search commenced they opened drawers they turned up the carpet they invited jocelyn thew to sit upon the couch whilst they ripped open the bed and they invited him to return to the bed whilst they ripped up the couch his personal belongings his dressingcase and his steamer trunk were gone through with painstaking care his trunk which was then dragged in was ransacked from top to bottom in due course the search was concluded and except that his wearing apparel seemed chosen with extraordinary care and taste nothing in any way suspicious was discovered the captain made haste to acknowledge the fact  well mr thew he announced i have done my duty and you are out of it with a clean sheet have you any objection to answering a few questions every objection in the world jocelyn thew replied  the purser ventured to intervene  come mr thew he said youre an englishman arent you  a light flashed in thews eyes  i shall break the promise i made to the captain just now he declared and answer that one question at any rate i thank god i am not  both men were a little startled jocelyns cold clear voice his manner and bearing were all so essentially saxon the captain however recovered himself quickly  if the tone of your voice is any index to your feelings mr thew he said you appear to have some grudge against england in that case you can scarcely wonder at the suspicions which have attached themselves to you  suspicions jocelyn repeated sarcastically well present my compliments to the wonderful mr crawshay i presume that i am at liberty now to take my bath  in one moment mr thew even though you do not choose to answer them there are certain questions i intend to ask the first is are you prepared to produce the marconigram which you received last evening  how do you know that i received one  the fact has come to my knowledge the captain said drily  you had better ask the operator about it  the operator is at the present moment under arrest was the terse reply if the news were a shock to thew he showed it in none of the ordinary ways his face seemed to fall for a moment into harder lines his mouth tightened and his eyes flashed  under arrest he repeated more of crawshays tomfoolery i suppose  more of mr crawshays tomfoolery the captain acknowledged robins is accused of having received a marconigram of which he took no note and which he handed to a passenger he is also accused of attempting to communicate with an enemy raider  a peculiar smile parted jocelyns lips  you seem to wish to make this steamer of yours the miseenscene of a dime novel captain he observed i accept the part of villain with resignationbut i should like to have my bath  you dont propose to tell me then his questioner persisted the contents of that message  i have no recollection of having received one jocelyn replied coolly you are making me very late for breakfast  they left him with a brusque word of farewell to which he did not reply jocelyn in a darkgreen silk dressing gown with a huge sponge and various silvertopped bottles departed for the bathroom the captain and the purser strolled up on deck  what do you make of that fellow dix the former asked  the purser coughed  if you ask me sir he replied i think that mr crawshay has got hold of the wrong end of the stick     chapter xi   katharine came on deck that morning in a somewhat disturbed frame of mind it was beginning to dawn upon her that her position as sick nurse to mr phillips was meant to be a sinecure she was allowed to sit by the sick mans side sometimes whilst the doctor took a promenade or ate a meal in the saloon but apart from that the usual exercise of her duties was not required from her she was forced to admit that there was something mysterious about the little stateroom the suffering man and the doctor who watched him speechlessly night and day  she was conscious presently that crawshay who had been walking up and down the deck had stopped before the chair on which she lay extended she greeted him without enthusiasm  are you taking one of your health constitutionals mr crawshay she enquired  not altogether he replied may i sit down for a moment  of course i dont think any one sits in that chair  he took his place by her side deliberately removed his muffler and unfastened his overcoat it struck her from the first moment she heard his voice that his manner was somehow altered she was altogether unprepared however for the almost stern directness of his first question miss beverley he began will you allow me to ask you how long you have known mr jocelyn thew  she turned her head towards him and remained speechless for a moment it seemed to her that she was looking into the face of a stranger the little droop of the mouth had gone the halfvacuous halfbored expression had given place to something altogether new the lines of his face had all tightened up his eyes were hard and bright she found herself quite unable to answer him in the manner she had intended  are you asking me that question seriously mr crawshay  i am he assured her i have grave reasons for asking it  i am afraid that i do not understand you she replied stiffly  you must change your attitude if you please miss beverley crawshay persisted believe me i am not trying to be impertinent i am asking a question the necessity for which i am in a position to justify  you bewilder me she exclaimed  that is simply because you looked upon me as a different sort of person to tell you the truth i should very much have preferred that you continued to look upon me as a different sort of person during this voyage but i cannot see my way clear to keep silence on this one point i wish to inform you if you do not know it already that mr jocelyn thew is a dangerous person for you to know or for you to be associated with in any shape or form she would have risen to her feet but he stopped her  please look at me he begged  she obeyed half against her will  i want you to ask yourself he went on whether you do not believe that i am your wellwisher what i am saying to you i am saying to save you from a position which later on you might bitterly regret  she was conscious of a quality in his tone and manner entirely strange to her and she found any form of answer exceedingly difficult the anger which she would have preferred to have affected seemed in the face of his earnestness out of place  it seems to me she said that you are assuming something which does not exist i am not on specially intimate terms with mr jocelyn thew i have not talked to him any more than to any other casual passenger  is that quite honest he asked quietly isnt it true that jocelyn thew is interested in your mysterious patient  she started  what do you mean  just what i say he replied i happen also to have very grave suspicions concerning the presence on this ship of mr phillips and his doctor  her fingers gripped the side of her deck chair she leaned a little towards him  what concern is all this of yours she demanded  never mind he answered i am risking more than i should like to say in telling you as much as i have told you i cannot believe that you would consciously associate yourself with a disgraceful and unpatriotic conspiracy that is why i have chosen to risk a great deal in speaking to you in this way tell me what possible consideration was brought to bear upon you to induce you to accept your present situation  katharine sat quite still the thoughts were chasing one another through her brain then she was conscious of a strange thing her companions whole expression seemed suddenly to have changed without her noticing any movement his monocle was in his left eye his lip had fallen a little he was looking querulously out seaward  i dont believe he declared that the captain has any idea about the weather prospects look at those clouds coming up i dont know how you are feeling miss beverley but i am conscious of a distinct chill  jocelyn thew had come to a standstill before them he was wearing no overcoat and was bareheaded  i guess that chill is somewhere in your imagination mr crawshay he observed you are pretty strong in that line arent you  crawshay struggled to his feet  i have some ideas he confessed modestly i spend my idle moments even here weaving a little fiction  and recounting it i dare say jocelyn ventured  i am like all artists crawshay sighed i love an audience i must express myself to something i will wish you good evening miss beverley i feel inclined to take a little walk in case it becomes too rough later on  he shuffled away once more the perfect prototype of the malade imaginaire jocelyn thew watched him in silence until he had disappeared then he turned and seated himself by the girls side  i find myself he remarked ruminatively still a little troubled as to the precise amount of intelligence which our friend mr crawshay might be said to possess i wonder if i might ask without your considering it a liberty what he was talking to you about  about you she answered  ah  warning me against you  dear me arent you terrified  i am not terrified she replied but i think it best to tell you that he also has suspicions absurd though it may seem of phillips and the doctor  why not the purser and captain while hes about it jocelyn said coolly every one on this boat seems to have got the nerves they searched my stateroom this morning  searched your stateroom she repeated do you mean while you were out  not a bit of it he replied they dragged me up at halfpast eight this morningthe captain purser and a stewardfetched up my trunk and searched all my possessions  what for she asked with a sudden chill  he smiled at her reassuringly something they didnt find something he added after a slight pause which they never will find  towards midday jocelyn thew abandoned a game of shuffleboard and leaning against the side of the vessel gazed steadily up at the wireless operating room the lightnings had been playing around the mast for the last ten minutes without effect he turned towards one of the ships officers who was passing  anything gone wrong with the wireless he enquired  the operators ill sir was the prompt reply weve only one on board as it happens so we are rather in a mess  jocelyn strolled away aft considering the situation he found crawshay seated in an elaborate deck chair and immersed in a novel  i hear the wireless has gone wrong he remarked stopping in front of him  crawshay glanced up blandly  whats that he demanded wireless why its been going all the morning  there has been no one there to take the messages though if anything happens to us we shall be in a nice pickle  crawshay shivered  i wish you people wouldnt suggest such things he said a little testily i was just trying to get all thought of this most perilous voyage out of my mind with the help of a novel here from which do you seriously consider we have most to fear he went on mines submarines or predatory vessels of the type of the blucher  the latter i should think jocelyn replied they say that submarines are scarcely venturing so far out just now  there was a brief silence jocelyn thew was apparently engaged in trying to fit a cigarette into his holder  specially hard luck on you he remarked presently if anything happened when youve taken so much trouble to get on board  it would be exceedingly annoying crawshay declared with vigour added to which i am not in a state of health to endure a voyage in a small boat i have been this morning to look at our places in case of accident i find that i am expected to wield an oar long enough to break my back  jocelyn thew smiled the other mans peevishness seemed too natural to be assumed  i expect youll be glad enough to do your bit if anything does happen to us he observed  bytheby crawshay asked i wonder what will become of that poor fellow downstairsthe man who is supposed to be dying i meanif trouble comes  i heard them discussing it at breakfast time jocelyn thew replied i understand that he has asked specially to be allowed to remain where he is there would of course be not the slightest chance of saving his life the doctor who is with himgant i think his name istold us that anything in the shape of a rough sea even would mean the end of him he quite understands this himself crawshay assented gravely  it seems a little brutal but it is common sense he declared in times of great stress too one becomes primitive and the primitive instinct is for the strong to save himself i am not ashamed to confess he concluded that i have secured an extra lifebelt  jocelyn glanced for a moment scornfully down at the man who had now picked up his novel again and was busy reading crawshay represented so much the things that he despised in life it was impossible to treat or consider him in any way as a rival to be feared he passed down the deck and made his way below to the doctors room he found the latter in the act of starting off to see a patient  i came around to ask after robins the young marconi man jocelyn explained i hear that he was taken ill last night  the doctor looked at his questioner keenly  that is so he admitted  whats wrong with him  i have not thoroughly diagnosed his complaint as yet was the careful reply i can tell you for a certainty though that he will not be able to work for two or three days  it seems very sudden jocelyn thew persisted  as a matter of fact i had some slight acquaintance with him and i always thought that he was a remarkably strong young fellow  the doctor who had completed his preparations for departure picked up his cap and politely showed his visitor out you wouldnt care the latter suggested to let me go down and have a look at him i cant call myself a medical man but i know something about sickness and i am quite interested in young robins  i dont think that i shall need a second opinion at present thank you the doctor rejoined a little drily if you wish to see him later on you must get permission from the captain good morning mr thew  jocelyn thew strolled thoughtfully away found a retired spot upon the promenade deck behind a boat lit a very black cigar and drawing his fieldglasses from his pocket searched the horizon carefully there was no sign of any passing steamer not even the faintest wisp of black smoke anywhere upon the horizon it was wednesday today and they had left new york on saturday he drew a sheet of paper from his pocket and made a few calculations it was the day and past the time upon which things were due to happen  the day wore on very much as most days do on an atlantic voyage in early summer the little handful of passengers who seemed for the moment to have cast all anxieties to the winds played shuffleboard and quoits lunched with vigorous appetites drank tea out on deck and indulged in strenuous beforedinner promenades the sun shone all day the sea remained wonderfully calm not a trace of any other steamer was visible from morning until early nightfall and jocelyn thew walked restlessly about with a grim look upon his face at dinner time the captain hinted at fog and looked doubtfully out of the open porthole at the oilylooking waste of waters  another night on the bridge for me i think he remarked  jocelyn thew leaned forward in his place  bytheby captain he asked now that the shipping is so reduced do you alter speed for fog  the captain filled his glass from the jug of lemonade which was always before him  do we alter our speed eh he repeated you must remember he went on that we have miss beverley on board we couldnt afford to give miss beverley a fright  jocelyn accepted the evasion with a slight bow katharine who had come in to dine a little late and seemed graver than usual smiled at the captain  am i the most precious thing on this steamer she asked  gallantry the captain replied compels me to say yes  only gallantry have we such a wonderful cargo then  there are times was the cautious reply when not even the captain knows exactly what he is carrying  you remind me jocelyn thew observed of a voyage i once made from port elizabeth to new york with halfadozen idbs on board and as many detectives watching them day and night  the captain nodded  what happened he enquired  oh the detectives arrested the lot of them i think got hold of them on the last day the captain rose from his place  queer thing he remarked but the law generally does come out on top  jocelyn followed his example a few minutes later and katharine purposely joined him on the way out she led her companion to the corner where her steamer chair had been placed and motioned him to sit by her side they were on the weather side of the ship with a slight breeze in their faces and a canopy over their heads which deadened sound she leaned a little forward  smoke please she begged i mean itsee  she lit a cigarette and he followed suit  not a cigar  he shook his head  i keep them for my hard thinking times  then you were thinking very hard this morning  i was he admitted  and gazing very earnestly out of those fieldglasses of yours  quite true  mr thew she said abruptly it is my impression although for some reason or other i am scarcely allowed to go near him that mr phillips is dying  one knew of course that there was that risk jocelyn thew reminded her  i do not think that he can possibly live for twentyfour hours she continued i was allowed to sit with him for a short time early this morning he is beginning to wander in his mind to speak of his wife and a sum of money jocelyns fine eyebrows came a little closer together  well  nothing in his appearance or speech indicate the man of wealth or even of birth i begin to wonder whether i know the whole truth about this frantic desire of his to reach england before he dies  i think jocelyn thew said thoughtfully that you have been talking again to mr crawshay  yes she admitted and he has been warning me against you  i suppose jocelyn ruminated the man has a certain amount of puppydog intelligence  i do not understand mr crawshay at all she confessed my acquaintance with him before we met on this steamer was of the slightest but his manner of coming certainly led one to believe that he was a man of courage and determination since then he has crawled about in an overcoat and rubber shoes and groaned about his ailments until one feels inclined to laugh at him last night he was different again he was entirely serious and he spoke to me about you  do you need to be warned against me he asked grimly have i ever sailed under false colours  dont she begged looking at him with a little quiver of the lips and a wonderfully soft light in her eyes you have never deceived me in any way except if at all as regards this voyage i made up my mind this evening that i would ask you if you cared to tell me to take me into your confidence about this man who is dying down below and his strange journey i need scarcely add that i should respect that confidence  i am sorry he answered you ask an impossibility  then there is some sort of conspiracy going on she persisted let me ask you a straightforward question is it not true that you have made me an unknowing participator in an illegal act  it is he admitted i was very sorry to have to do so but it was necessary without your assistance i should never have been allowed to bring phillips across the atlantic  what difference do i make she asked  you lend an air of respectability and credibility to the whole thing he told her you are a person of repute of distinguished social position and the object of a good deal of admiration in your own country the doctor who accompanies you comes from your own hospital no one would believe it possible that either of you could be concerned in any sort of conspiracy if that ass crawshay had not got on board i am convinced that there would never have been a breath of suspicion  she shivered a little  is it quite kind to bring me into an affair of this sort she asked  it is a world he declared cruelly in which we fight always for our own hand or go under i am fighting for mine and if i have occasionally to sacrifice a friend as well as an enemy i do not hesitate  what has the world done to you she demanded that you should speak so bitterly better not ask me that  how will the man phillips death affect your plans  it will make very little difference either way he assured her we rather expected him to die  and you wont take me any further into your confidence  no further your task will be completed at liverpool so long as you leave this steamer in company with the doctor and the ambulance if phillips is still alive you will be free to return home whenever you please  very well she said you see i accept my position i shall go through with what i have promised whatever mr crawshay may say wont you in return treat me if not as a confederate as a friend  he turned and looked at her met the appealing glance of her soft eyes for a moment and looked suddenly away  i do not belong to the ranks of those miss beverley from whom it is well for you to choose your friends  but why should i not make my own choice she insisted i have always been my own mistress i have lived with my own ideas i have declined to be subject to any ones authority i am an independent person cant you treat me as such  there are facts he said which can never be ignored you belong to the world of wealthy gently born men and women who comprise what is called society i belong and have belonged all my life to a race of outcasts dont she begged  it is true he repeated doggedly  but what do you mean by outcasts  criminals if you like it better i have broken the law more than once there is an unexecuted warrant out against me at the present moment you may even see me marched off this steamer at liverpool between two policemen  but why she asked passionately why what is the motive of it all is it money  i am not in need of money he told her but i have a great and sacred use for all i can lay my fingers on if i succeed in my present enterprise i shall receive a hundred thousand pounds  i value jerrys life and future at more than that she declared will you make a fresh start mr jocelyn thew with twice that sum of money to your credit  he shook his head but there was a curious change creeping into his face for the first time she saw how soft a mans darkblue eyes may sometimes become the slight trembling of his parted lips too seemed to unlock all the cruel hard lines of his face he had suddenly the appearance of a person of temperamenta poet even a dreamer  i could not take money from you miss beverley he said or from any other woman in the world  upon no conditions she whispered softly  upon no conditions he repeated  the breeze had dropped and twilight had followed swiftly upon the misty sunset there was something a little ghostly about the light in which they sat i am stifled she declared abruptly come and walk  they paced up and down the deck once or twice in silence then he paused as they drew near their chairs  miss beverley he said in case this should be the last time that we talk confidentiallyso that we may put a seal in fact upon the subject of which we have spoken tonighti would like to tell you that you have made me feel during this last halfhour an emotion which i have not felt for many years and i want to tell you this i am a lawbreaker when i told you that there was a warrant out against me at the present moment i told you the truth the charge against me is a true one and the penalty is one i shall never pay i must go on to the end and i shall do so because i have a driving impulse behind a hate which only action can soothe but all my sins have been against men and the doings of men you will understand me will you not when i say that i can neither take your money nor accept your friendship after this voyage is over you on your side can remember that you have paid a debt  she sank a little wearily into her chair and looked out through the gathering mists it seemed part of her fancy that they gathered him in for she heard no sound of retreating footsteps yet when she spoke his name a few moments later she found that she was alone     chapter xii   throughout the night reigned an almost sepulchral silence and when the morning broke the city of boston at a scarcely reduced speed was ploughing her way through great banks of white fog the decks the promenade rails every exposed part of the steamer were glistening with wet up on the bridge three officers besides the captain stood with eyes fixed in grim concentration upon the dense curtains of mist which seemed to shut them off altogether from the outer world jocelyn thew and crawshay met in the companionway a few minutes after breakfast  i can see no object in the disuse of the hooter crawshay declared querulously nothing at sea could be worse than a collision we are simply taking our lives in our hands tearing along like this at sixteen knots an hour  isnt there supposed to be a german raider out the other enquired  i think it is exceedingly doubtful whether there is really one in the atlantic at all the english gunboats patrol these seas besides we are armed ourselves and she wouldnt be likely to tackle us  jocelyn thew had leaned a little forward he was listening intently at the same time one of the figures upon the bridge his hand to his ear turned in the same direction  theres some one who doesnt mind letting their whereabouts be known he whispered after a moments pause cant you hear a hooter  crawshay listened but shook his head  cant hear a thing he declared laconically ive a cold in my head coming on and it always affects my hearing  jocelyn thew stepped on tiptoe across the deck as far as the rail and returned in a few minutes  theres a steamer calling away on the starboard bow he announced she seems to be getting nearer too i wonder we dont alter our course  well i suppose its the captains business whether he chooses to answer or not crawshay remarked i shall go down to my cabin this gazing at nothing gets on my nerves  jocelyn thew returned to his damp vigil leaning over the wet wooden rail he drew a little diagram on the back of an envelope and worked out some figures then he listened once more the slight frown upon his forehead deepening finally he tore up his sketch and made his way to the doctors room the doctor was seated at his desk and glanced up enquiringly as his visitor entered  i just looked in to see how young robins was getting on jocelyn explained  i am afraid he is in rather a bad way was the grave reply  what is the nature of his illness  the doctor shrugged his shoulders his manner became a little vague  i must remind you mr thew he said that a doctor is not always at liberty to discuss the ailments of his patients on board ship this custom becomes more even than mere etiquette it is in fact against the regulations of the company for us to discuss the maladies of any passenger upon the steamer  i recognise the truth of all that you say jocelyn thew agreed but it happens that i know the young man and his people naturally therefore i take an interest in him and i am sure they would think it strange if travelling upon the same steamer i did not make these very ordinary enquiries  you know his people do you the doctor repeated where does he come from mr thew  somewhere over new jersey way was the glib reply but i used to meet his father often in new york there can be no mystery about his illness can there doctorno reason why i should not go and see him  i have placed the young man in quarantine was the brief explanation and until he is released no one can go near him  something catching eh  something that might turn out to be catching  jocelyn thew shrugged his shoulders and accepted what amounted almost to a little nod of dismissal he ascended the staircase thoughtfully and came face to face with katharine beverley issuing from the music room she greeted him with a little exclamation of relief  mr thew she exclaimed i have been looking for you everywhere doctor gant thinks she added lowering her voice that if you wish to see his patient alive you had better come at once there is a change in his condition then  yes she told him gravely  he stood for a moment thinking rapidly the girl shivered a little as she watched the change in his face her hospital training had not lessened her awe and sympathy in the face of death and it was so entirely obvious that jocelyn thew was considering only what influence upon his plans this event might have finally he turned and descended the stairs by her side  i am not at all sure that it is wise of me to come he said however if he is asking for me i suppose i had better  they made their way into the commodious stateroom upon the saloon deck which had been secured for the sick man he lay upon a small hospital bed nothing of him visible save his haggard face with its illgrown beard his eyes were watching the door and he showed some signs of gratification at jocelyns entrance gant who was standing over the bed turned apologetically towards the latter  its the money he whispered he is worrying about that i was obliged to send for you he called out your name just now and the ships doctor was hanging around  the newcomer drew a stool to the side of the bed opened a pocketbook and counted out a great wad of notes the dying man watched him with every appearance of interest  five thousand dollars the former said at last that should bring in about eleven hundred and fifty pounds now watch me phillips  he took an envelope from his pocket thrust the notes inside gummed down the flap and drawing a fountain pen from his pocket wrote an address the dying man watched him and nodded feebly  these jocelyn continued are for your wife the packet shall be delivered to her within twelve hours of our landing in liverpool you can keep it under your pillow and hand it over to miss beverley here you trust her  the man on the bed nodded feebly and turned slightly towards katharine she bent over him  i shall see myself she promised that the money is properly delivered  phillips smiled and closed his eyes it was obvious that he had no more to say jocelyn thew stole softly out followed a moment later by katharine  the doctor thinks i am better away she whispered he wont speak again poor fellow  jocelyn stepped softly up the stairs and drew a little breath of relief as they reached the promenade deck without meeting any one both seemed to feel the desire for fresh air and they stepped outside for a moment there were tears in katharines eyes  of course she said a little timidly i dont understand this at all but it is terribly tragic do you think that he would have lived if he had not undertaken the journey  it was absolutely impossible her companion assured her he was a dying man from the moment the operation was finished  will he be buried at sea  i think not he was exceedingly anxious to be buried at his home near chester it isnt a pleasant thing to talk about jocelyn went on but they brought his coffin on board with him its lying in the companionway now covered over with a rug  she shivered  its a horrible day altogether she declared looking out into the seemingly endless banks of mist  entirely my opinion miss beverley a voice said in her ear i find it most depressingand unhealthy and listendo you hear that  they all listened intently again they could hear the hooting of a steamer in the distance  between ourselves crawshay went on confidentially the captain seems to me rather worried that steamer has been following us for hours she is evidently waiting for the fog to lift to see who we are  how does she know about us katharine asked we havent blown our hooter once  we dont need to was the fractious reply thats where we are being overcareful she can hear our engines distinctly  who does the captain think she is then  crawshays voice was dropped to a mysterious pitch but though he leaned towards the girl his eyes were fixed upon her companion  he doesnt go as far as to express a definite opinion but he thinks that it might be that german raiderthe blucher isnt it she can steal about quite safely in the fog and she can tell by the beat of the engines whether she is near a manofwar or not  not a muscle of jocelyns face twitched but there was a momentary gleam in his eyes of which crawshay took swift note he glanced aft to where the two seamen were standing by the side of their guns  if it really is the german raider he remarked they might as well fire off a popgun as that thing she is supposed to be armed with four sixinch guns and two torpedo tubes  crawshay nodded  so i told the captain we might have a go at a submarine but the raider would sink us in two minutes if we tried to tackle her what a beastly voyage this is he went on in a depressed tone i cant get over the fact that i risked my life to get on board too  jocelyn thew with a little word of excuse had swung around and disappeared katharine looked at her companion curiously  do you believe that it really is the raider mr crawshay she enquired  he hesitated in jocelyns absence his manner seemed to undergo some subtle change his tone to become crisper and less querulous  we had some reason to hope he said cautiously that she was on a different course it is just possible however that in changing it she might have struck this bank of fog and preferred to hang about for a time  what will happen if she finds us  that depends entirely upon circumstances  i have an idea katharine continued that you know more about this matter than you feel inclined to divulge  perhaps he admitted nowadays every one has to learn discretion  is it necessary with me it is necessary with any friend of mr jocelyn thew he told her didactically  what a suspicious person you are she exclaimed a little scornfully you are just like all your countrymen you get hold of an idea and nothing can shake it mr jocelyn thew i dare say possesses a past i know for a fact that he has been engaged in all sorts of adventures during his life butat your instigation i supposethey have already searched his person his stateroom and every article of luggage he has after that why not leave him alone  because he is an extremely clever person  then you are not satisfied yet  not yet  am i may i ask under suspicion she enquired with faint sarcasm  i should not like to say he replied glibly that you were altogether free from it  she laughed heartily  i should not worry about the army if i were you she advised i am quite sure that secretservice work is the natural outlet for your talents  i shouldnt be surprised he confided if headquarters didnt insist upon my taking it up permanently it will depend a little of course upon what success i have during this voyage  she laughed in his face and turned away  i will tell you what i find so interesting about you mr crawshay she said you must be either very much cleverer than you seem or very much more foolish you keep me continually guessing as to which it is     chapter xiii   towards six oclock that evening without any apparent change in the situation captain jones descended from the bridge and signalled to crawshay whom he passed on the deck to follow him into his room the great ship was still going at full speed through a sea which was as smooth as glass  getting out of it arent we crawshay enquired  the captain nodded his hair and beard were soaked with moisture and there were beads of wet all over his face otherwise he seemed little the worse for his long vigil in his eyes however was a new anxiety  another five miles he confided should see us in clear weather  steamers still following us isnt she  sticking to us like a leech was the terse reply she is not out of any american port she must have just picked us up she isnt any ordinary cargo steamer either or she couldnt make the speed  ive worked it out by your chart crawshay declared and it might very well be the blucher i dont think i made the altered course wide enough and she might very well have been hanging about a bit when she struck the fog and heard our engines  the captain lit a pipe i am not in the habit as you may imagine of discussing the conduct of my ship with any one mr crawshay he said but you come to me with very absolute credentials and its rather a comfort to have some one standing by with whom one can share the responsibility you see my couple of guns they are about as useful as catapults against the blucher whereas on the other hand she could sink us easily with a couple of volleys  just so crawshay agreed what about speed captain  if our reports are trustworthy we might be able to squeeze out one more knot than she can do was the doubtful reply but you see shell follow us out of this last bank of fog practically within rifle range ive altered my course three or four times so as to get a start but she hangs on like grim death thats what makes me so sure that its the blucher  want my advice crawshay asked  thats the idea the captain acquiesced  stoke her up then and drive full speed ahead take no notice of any signals make for home with the last ounce you can squeeze out of her  thats all very well captain jones observed but there will be at least half an hour during which we shall be within effective range she might sink us a dozen times over  yes but i dont think she will  why not  if the theory upon which i started this wildgoose chase is correct crawshay explained there is something on board this ship infinitely more valuable than the ship itself to germany that is why i think that she will strain every nerve to try and capture you of course but she will never sink you because if she did she would lose everything her secret service have worked for in germany ever since and even before the commencement of the war  its an idea the captain admitted with a gleam in his eyes  its common sense crawshay urged when i left halifax i was ready to take twentyfive to one that wed been sold i wouldnt mind laying twentyfive to one now that what we are in search of is somewhere on board this steamer if that is so the blucher will never dare to sink you because there will still remain the chance of the person on board who is in charge of the documents getting away with them at the other end whereas down at the bottom of the atlantic they would be of no use to any one  i see your point of view the other agreed  then youd better take my tip crawshay continued there isnt a passenger on board who didnt know the risk they were running when they started and im sure no one will blame you for not surrendering your ship like a dummy directly youre asked theyre a pretty sporting lot in the saloon you know all those newspaper men are real good fellows  the captains face brightened  next to fighting her he soliloquised stroking his beard  the idea of fighting her is ridiculous crawshay interrupted look here you havent any time to lose send to the engineer and let him give it to them straight down below ill give a tenner apiece to the stokers if we get clear and if my advice turns out wrong ill see you through it anyway  we can leg it at a trifle over nineteen knots captain jones declared as he picked up his cap and anyway anythings better than having one of those shorthaired smoothtongued blustering germans on board  he hurried off and crawshay followed him on deck to watch developments already through what seemed to be an opening in the walls of fog there was a vision in front of clear blue sea on which a still concealed sun was shining soon they passed out into a new temperature of pleasant warmth with a skyline ahead hard and clear the passengers came crowding on deck every one leaned over the starboard rail looking towards the place whence the sound of the hooting was still proceeding suddenly a steamer crept out of the fog mountain and drew clear barely half a mile away the first glimpse at her was final she had cast off all disguise her false forecastle was thrown back and the sun glittered upon three exceedingly formidablelooking guns trained upon the city of boston a row of signals already hoisted were fluttering from her mast  its the blucher by god sam west muttered  were nabbed his little friend groaned  wonder what theyll do with us  every eye was upturned now to the mast for the answering signals to the universal surprise none were hoisted the captain stood upon the bridge with his glass focussed upon the raider he gave no orders only the black smoke was beginning to belch now from the funnels and little pieces of smut and burning coal blew down the deck jocelyn thew who was standing a little apart frowned to himself he had seen crawshay and the captain come out of the latters cabin together  the blue lightnings were playing now unchecked about the top of the marconi room another more imperative signal flew from the pirate ship a minute later there was a puff of white smoke a loud report and a shell burst in the sea fifty yards ahead crawshay edged up to where jocelyn thew was standing  this is a damned unpleasant affair he said  it is was the grim reply  you know its the blucher  no doubt about that  what on earth are we up to crawshay continued in a dissatisfied tone we havent even replied to her signals  it appears to me jocelyn thew pronounced irritably that we are going to try and get away i never heard of such lunacy they can blow us to pieces if they want to  crawshay shivered  i think he protested that some one ought to remonstrate with the captain look theres another shell coming damned ugly things  there was another puff of white smoke and this time the projectile fell within a steamers length of them sending a great fountain of water into the air they are giving us plenty of warning jocelyn thew observed coolly i suppose we shall get the next one amidships  i find it most upsetting his companion declared i am going down to the cabin to get my lifebelt  he turned away presently there was another line of signals more shots some across the bows of the steamer some right over her a few aft nevertheless the city of boston stood on her course and the distance between the two steamers gradually widened katharine who had come up on deck stood by jocelyn thews side  is this really the way that they shoot she asked or arent they trying to hit us  they are not trying he told her if they were every shot they fired at this range would be sufficient to send us to the bottom  why arent they trying she persisted  theres a reason for that which i cant at the moment explain was the gloomy reply they want to capture us not sink us what i cant understand though is how the captain here found that out  how is it that you are so wellinformed katharine asked curiously  you had better not enquire miss beverley its just as well not to know too much of these things heres mr crawshay he added perhaps hell tell you  crawshay appeared hugging his lifebelt on which he seated himself gingerly  cant imagine what the captains up to he complained a chap who understands those little flags has just told me that theyve threatened to blow us to pieces if we go onhere comes another shell he groaned two to one theyve got us this timeugh  they all ducked to avoid a shower of spray when they stood upright again katharine studied the newcomer for a minute critically there was a certain air of strain about most of the passengers even jocelyn thews firm hand had trembled a moment ago as he had lowered his glasses crawshay seated upon his lifebelt with a mackintosh buttoned around him his eyeglass firmly adjusted his mouth querulous was not exactly an impressivelooking object yet she wondered  give me your hand she asked suddenly  he obeyed at once the fingers were cool and firm  why do you pretend to be afraid she demanded you arent in the least  amateur theatricals he replied tersely coupled with a certain amount of selfcontrol i am a cooltempered fellow at most timesjove this ones meant for us i believe  they all ducked instinctively the shell however fell short crawshay measured the distance between the two steamers with his eyes  dashed if i dont believe were giving them the slip he exclaimed i wonder why in thunder theyre letting us off like this the captain must have known something  jocelyn thew turned around and looked reflectively at the speaker for a single moment crawshays muscles tingled with the apprehension of danger there was a smouldering light in the others eyes such a light as might gleam in the tigers eyes before his spring crawshays hand slipped to his hip pocket so for a moment they remained then jocelyn thew shrugged his shoulders and the tense moment was past  there seems to be some one on this ship he said quietly who knows more than is good for him     chapter xiv   the city of boston passed through the danger zone in safety and dropped anchor in the mersey only a few hours later than the time of her expected arrival towards the close of a somewhat uproarious dinner during which many bottles of champagne were emptied to various toasts captain jones quite unexpectedly entered the saloon and waving his hand in response to the cheers which greeted him made his way to his usual table from which he addressed the little company  ladies and gentlemen he said i have an announcement to make to which i beg you will listen with patience both the english and the american police whether with reason or not as we may presently determine have come to the conclusion that a large number of very important documents collected in america by the agents of a foreign power have been smuggled across the atlantic upon this ship in the hope that they may eventually reach germany in a quarter of an hours time a number of plainclothes policemen will be on board i am going to ask you as loyal british and american subjects to subject yourselves without resistance or complaint to any search which they may choose to make i may add that my own person luggage and cabin will be the first object of their attention the captain having delivered his address left the saloon again amidst a little buzz of voices there had probably never been a voyage across the atlantic in which a matter of forty passengers had been treated to so many rumours and whispers of strange happenings sam west got up and spoke a few words counselling the ready assent of every one there to submit to anything that was thought necessary he briefly commented upon their unexplained but fortuitous escape from the raider and heaped congratulations upon their captain very soon after he had resumed his seat the shrill whistle of a tug alongside indicated the arrival of visitors a steward passed back and forth amongst the passengers with a universal requestall were asked to repair to their staterooms twentyseven exceedingly alertlooking men thereupon commenced their task  seated upon the couch in her room with a cup of coffee by her side and a cigarette between her lips katharine listened to the conversation which passed in the opposite room the one which had been tenanted by phillips for some reason the end of the voyage instead of bringing her the relief which she had expected had only increased her nervous excitement she was filled with an extraordinary prescience of some coming crisis she found herself trembling as she listened to doctor gants harsh voice and the smooth accents of his interlocutor  well that completes our search of your belongings doctor gant the latters voice observed now i want to ask a few questions with reference to the mr phillips who i understand died the day before yesterday under your charge that is so doctor gant agreed he had no luggage as we only made up our minds to undertake the journey with him at the last moment the few oddments he used on the voyage we burned  and the body i understand  you can examine it at once if you will the doctor interrupted we have purposely left the coffin lid only partly screwed down i should like to say however that before arranging the deceased for burial i asked the ships doctor to make an examination with me of the coffin and the garments which i used he signed the certificate and he will be ready to answer any questions  that seems entirely satisfactory the detective confessed i will just have the coffin lid off for a few moments and will see the doctor before i leave the ship  the men left the room together and were absent some ten minutes presently the detective returned to katharines room and with him came crawshay katharine had discarded the nurses costume which she had usually worn on board ship and was wearing the black tailormade suit in which she had expected to land in the dim light her pallor and nervous condition almost startled crawshay  you will forgive my intrusion he said i have just been explaining your presence here to mr brightman the detective and i dont think he will trouble you for more than a few minutes  please treat me exactly as the others she begged  the search proceeded for a few moments in silence then the detective looked up from the dressing case which he was examining in his hand he held the envelope addressed to mrs phillips  do you mind telling me what this is miss beverley he asked  it is a roll of bills she replied that belonged to mr phillips i promised to see them handed over to his wife  brightman glanced at the address and balanced the envelope on the palm of his hand  it is against the law he told her for a passenger to be the bearer of any sealed letter  katharine shrugged her shoulders  i am very sorry she said but the packet which you have did not come from america at all it was sealed up on board this ship at the time when i accepted the charge of its delivery there is no letter or communication of any sort inside  you will not object the detective enquired to my opening it  she frowned impatiently  i can assure you she repeated that i saw the notes put inside an empty envelope mr crawshay will tell you that my word is to be relied upon  implicitly miss beverley crawshay pronounced emphatically but under the circumstances i think no harm would be done if you allowed our friend just to glance inside the notes can easily be sealed up in another envelope  just as you like she acquiesced coolly you will find nothing but bills there  brightman tore open the envelope and glanced inside as though he did not intend further to disturb it suddenly his face changed he shook out the contents upon the little table they all three looked at the pile of papers with varying expressions in katharines face there was nothing but blank bewilderment in crawshays something of horror in the detectives a faint gleam of triumph he pressed his finger down on the heading of the first sheet of paper  i am not much of a german scholar he observed how do you translate that mr crawshay  crawshay was silent for several moments then in a perfectly mechanical tone he read out the heading  list of our agents in new york and district who may be absolutely trusted for any enterprise  there was another dead silence a silence on katharines part of complete mental paralysis crawshays face had lost all its smooth petulance he was like a man who had received a blow  but i dont understand katharine faltered at last that packet has not been out of my possession and i saw the notes put into it  by whom crawshay demanded  by mr phillips she declared steadfastly by mr phillips and doctor gant together  the detective turned the envelope over in his hand  the bills seem to have disappeared he observed  they were in that envelope katharine persisted i have never seen those papers before in my life  brightmans face remained immovable one by one he slipped the papers back into the envelope thrust them into his breast pocket and turning round locked the door  you must forgive me if the rest of our investigations may seem unnecessarily severe miss beverley he said  katharine sank back upon the sofa she was utterly bewildered by the events of the last few minutes the search of her belongings was now being conducted with ruthless persistence her head was buried in her hands she did not even glance at the contents of her trunk which were now overflowing the room suddenly she was conscious of another pause in the proceedings a halfspoken exclamation from the detective she looked up from within the folds of an evening gown he had withdrawn a small officiallooking dispatch box of black tin tied with red tape and with great seals hanging from either end  what is this he asked  katharine stared at it with wideopen eyes  i have never seen it before she declared  there was another painful significant silence crawshay bent forward and examined the seals through his glass  this he announced presently is the official seal of a neutral embassy you see how the packet is addressed  i see the detective admitted but considering the way in which we have found it you are not suggesting i hope that we should not open it  opened it certainly must be crawshay admitted but not by us in this manner when you have finished your search i should be glad if you will bring both packets with you to the captains room  brightman silently resumed his labours nothing further however was found the two men stood up together  miss beverley brightman began gravely  crawshay laid his hand upon the mans arm  wait for a moment he begged i wish to have a few words with you outside we shall be back before long miss beverley  the two men disappeared katharine with a sinking of the heart heard the key turn on the outside of her stateroom she watched the lock slip into its place with an indescribable sense of humiliation she had been guiltyof what  she lost count of time but it was certain that only a few minutes could have passed before a strange thing happened the sight of that lock which seemed somehow to shut her off from the world of reasonable honest men and women had fascinated her she was sitting watching it her chin resting upon her hands something of the horror still in her eyes when without sound or any visible explanation she saw it glide back to its place the door was opened and closed jocelyn thew was standing in her stateroom  you she exclaimed  i am not disappointed in you i am sure he said softly you will keep still you will not say a word i have risked the whole success of a great enterprise to come and say these few words to you i am ashamed and sorry for what you are suffering but i want to tell you this nothing serious will happennothing serious can happen to you everything is not as it seems will you believe that look at me will you believe that  she raised her eyes once more there was that change in his face which had seemed so wonderful to her the blue of his eyes was soft his mouth almost tremulous she answered him almost as though mesmerised  i will believe it she promised  as silently and mysteriously as he had come he turned and left her she watched the latch she saw the lock creep silently once more into its place she heard no movement outside but jocelyn thew had gone  during the few remaining minutes of her solitude katharine felt a curious change in the atmosphere of the little disordered stateroom in her own dazed and bruised feelings she seemed somehow to be playing a part in a little drama which had nothing to do with real life all her fears had vanished she rose from her place smoothed her disordered hair carefully bathed her temples with eaudecologne adjusted her hat and veil and turning on the reading lamp opened a novel she actually managed to read a couple of pages before there was a knock at the door and the two men reappeared she laid down her book and greeted them quite coolly  well have you come to pronounce sentence upon me she asked  our authority scarcely goes so far brightman replied i am going on shore now miss beverley to fetch the consul of the country to which this packet is addressed it will be opened in his presence in the meantime mr crawshay has given his parole for you you will therefore be free of the ship but it will be i am afraid my duty to ask you to come with me to the police station for a further examination on my return  i am sure i shall like to come very much she said sweetly but if you go on asking me questions forever i am afraid you wont come any nearer solving the problem of how that box got into my trunk or how those bills got changed into those queerlooking little slips of papers however that of course is your affair  the detective departed with a stiff bow crawshay however lingered  arent you going with your friend she asked him  he ignored the question  miss beverley he said you will forgive me saying that i find the present position exceedingly painful  why she demanded i dont see how you are suffering by it  it was at my instigation he went on that suspicion was first directed against your travelling companions i am convinced that the first idea was to get these documents off the ship upon the person of phillips if alive or in his coffin if dead the instigators of this abominable conspiracy have taken fright and have made you their victim certainly he went on it was a shrewd idea i myself suggested to brightman that your things might remain undisturbed but for the finding of that envelope your trunk would certainly not have been opened you see the position i have placed myself in i am driven to ask you a question did you know of the presence of those papers and dispatch box amongst your belongings  i had no idea of it she answered fervently  he drew a little breath of relief  you realise of course he went on that there is only one man who could have placed them there  and who is that she enquired  jocelyn thew  and why do you single him out  because crawshay told her patiently we had evidence in america to show that he was working with our enemies it is true that he has not been associated to any extent with the german espionage system in america but he has been wellknown always as a reckless adventurer ready to sell his life in any doubtful cause so long as it promised excitement and profit it was known to us that he had come into touch with a certain man in washington who has been looking after the interests of his country in america it was to shadow jocelyn thew that i came on this steamer his friends cleverly fooled hobson and me and landed us in chicago too late as they thought to catch the boat that is why i made that somewhat melodramatic journey after you on the seaplane do please consider this matter reasonably miss beverley it was perfectly easy for him to slip across and place these things in your luggage as soon as he found that his original scheme was likely to go wrong you were the one person on the steamer whom he reckoned would be safe from suspicion you were part of his plot from the very first and no more than that  i cannot believe this she said slowly  crawshays face darkened  it is no business of mine miss beverley he declared but if you will forgive my saying so you must be infatuated by this man the evidence is perfectly clear you are a prominent citizeness of a great country and you have been made an accessory to an act of treason against that country yet with plain facts in my hands it seems impossible for me to shake your faith in this person what is the reason of it what hold had he upon you that he should have induced you to leave your work and your home and betray your country  he has no hold upon me at all she replied indignantly since you are so persistent i will tell you the truth i once saw him do a splendid thing a deed which saved me from great unhappiness  there we have it then at last crawshay exclaimed eagerly you are under obligations to him  i certainly am she acknowledged  and he has taken advantage of it crawshay continued to make you his tool  whatever he has done she replied rests between jocelyn thew and me i am not in the least disposed to excuse myself or to beg for mercy from you if you represent the law directly or indirectly i do not ask for any favours i shall be perfectly ready to go to your police station whenever i am sent for there was a knock at the door they both turned around in reply to katharines mechanical come in jocelyn thew entered  i beg your pardon he said was i mistaken or did i hear my name  we were speaking of you crawshay admitted turning towards him but i do not think that either miss beverley or i have anything to say to you at the moment  thats rather a pity was the cool reply because you may not see me again i was looking for miss beverley in fact to say goodby we are docking in half an hour and those who have been searched can go on shore if they like to leave their hold luggage as i have been searched twice in the most thorough and effective fashion i have my pass out  you mean that you are going away altogether tonight katharine exclaimed  only so far as the adelphi he told her i have some friends to see who live near liverpool so i shall probably stay there for two or three days  i was coming to look for you on deck presently crawshay intervened but if your departure is so imminent i will say what i have to say to you here  that would seem advisable jocelyn thew agreed  i think it is only right that you should know sir crawshay continued that a very serious position has arisen here in which miss beverley is unfortunately involved incriminating documents have been found in her luggage placed there obviously by some unscrupulous person who was in search of a safe hidingplace  is this true jocelyn thew asked looking past crawshay to katharine  i am afraid that it is she assented  the person who placed them there crawshay proceeded the anger gathering in his tone may believe for the present that he has been able to escape from his dangerous position by this dastardly attempt to incriminate a woman he may on the other hand find that his immunity will last but a very short time  jocelyn thew nodded in calm acquiescence  i am at a loss he said to account for your somewhat melodramatic tone but i really do not think that miss beverley has very much to fear  there i agree with you crawshay declared she has not so much to fear as the criminal who is responsible for what has happened he may think that he has escaped by saddling his crime upon a womans shoulders on the other hand he may discover that this attempt which only aggravates his position will turn out to be futile  jocelyn thew held out his hand towards katharine  really he said the tone of this conversation takes one back to the atmosphere of the dear old drury lane melodrama i feel somehow or other he went on looking into katharines eyes that our friend here has cast me for the part of the villain and you for the injured heroine i am wondering whether i dare ask you for a farewell greeting  katharine did not hesitate for a moment her shapely ringless hand was grasped firmly by his brown lean fingers she felt the pressure of a signet ring the slight tightening of his grip as he leaned a little towards her again she was conscious of that feeling of exuberant life and complete confidence which had transformed her whole and humiliating situation so short a time ago  the injured heroine is always forgiving she declaredeven though she may have nothing to forgive goodby mr thew and good fortune to you     chapter xv   the morninggrey slightly wetbroke upon liverpool docks the ugliest place in the ugliest city of europe a thin stream of people descended at irregular intervals down the gangway from the city of boston to the dock and disappeared in various directions amongst the first came a melancholy little processiona coffin carried by two ships stewards with doctor gant in solitary attendance behind after the passengers came a sprinkling of the ships officers all very smart and in a great hurry then there was a pause of several hours about midday two menbrightman and a strangercame down the covered way into the dock and boarded the steamer they were shown at once into the captains room where crawshay and captain jones were awaiting them  this brightman said introducing his companion is mr andelsen i was fortunate enough to find him on the point of leaving for london  mr andelsen shook hands and accepted a chair upon the table in front of the captain was the sealed dispatch box crawshay had a suggestion to make  i think he said that miss beverley should be here herself when this is opened  i have no objection brightman assented  the captain rang for his steward and sent down a message mr andelsena tall thin man dressed in a sombre grey suithandled the seals for a moment looked at the address of the box and shook his head  i could not take upon myself the responsibility of opening this he declared it is certainly the seal of the embassy of my country but the box is addressed specifically to our foreign secretary at the capital  we quite appreciate that crawshay admitted the captain i believe is not asking you to break it we simply wish you to be present while we do so in order to prove that no disrespect is intended to your country and in order that you yourself may have an opportunity of taking a note of the contents  so long as it is understood that i am only here as a witness the consul acquiesced a little doubtfully i am quite willing to remain  katharine was presently ushered in she was dressed for landing in a smart tailormade suit and her appearance was entirely cheerful crawshay stepped forward and handed her a chair  dear me she said this all seems very formidable am i under arrest or anything  the captain is about to open the dispatch box found in your trunk miss beverley crawshay explained in the presence of mr andelsen here who represents the country whose seals are attached i have already expressed my opinion that this box has been surreptitiously placed amongst your belongings and although of course our chief object was to gain possession of it i regret very much the position in which you are placed  you are very kind mr crawshay she rejoined without much feeling it is certainly a fact that i never saw the box before it was dragged out of my trunk yesterday  the captain broke the seals untied the tape and with a chisel and hammer knocked the top off the box they all with the exception of katharine gathered around him breathlessly as he shook out the contents on to the table they were all sharers in the same shock of surprise as the neatly folded packets of ordinary writing paper were one by one disclosed crawshay seized one and dragged it to the light the captain kept on picking them up and throwing them down again brightman mechanically followed his example  the whole things a bluff crawshay exclaimed these sheets of paper are all blank there isnt any trace even of invisible ink  the consul rose to his feet with a heavy frown  this is a very obvious practical joke he said angrily it seems a pity that i should have been compelled to miss my train to town  a practical joke the captain repeated if it is im damned if i understand the point of it  give me the envelope which held the notes crawshay demanded  the captain unlocked his safe and produced it crawshay glanced through some of the documents hastily  these are all bogus too he exclaimed there are no such streets as this in new yorkno such names the whole things a sell  but what thewhat in thunder does it all mean the captain demanded pulling himself up as he glanced towards katharine  brightman who had scarcely spoken a word leaned across the table  probably he said drily it means that some one a little cleverer than us has got away with the real stuff whilst we played around with this rubbish  but how crawshay expostulated not a soul has left this ship who hasnt been searched to the skin the luggage in the hold is going out trunk by trunk after every cubic foot has been ransacked we have had a guard at every gangway since we were docked  there was a knock at the door the ships doctor entered he glanced at the little company and hesitated  i beg your pardon captain he said could i have a word with you  the captain moved towards the threshold  ships business doctor  its just a queer idea of mine about these papers the doctor confessed its perhaps scarcely worth mentioning  youd better come in and tell us about it the captain insisted thats what were all talking about at the present moment  crawshay closed the door behind the newcomer whose manner was still to some extent apologetic  its really rather a mad idea the latter began and i understand you found a part of what you were searching for at any rate but you know the man phillips whod been operated upon for appendicitisyour patient miss beverley who died during the voyage  what about him the captain demanded  just one thing the doctor continued there was no doubt whatever that he had been operated upon for appendicitis there was no doubt about the complications there was no doubt about his death i helped doctor gantwho seemed a very reasonable person and who is known to me as one of the physicians at miss beverleys hospitalin various small details and at his request i went over the clothing of the dead man and even knocked the coffin to see that it hadnt a double bottom doctor gant appeared to welcome investigation in every shape and form and yet now that its all over there is one curious thing which rather bothers me  get on with it man the captain admonished cant you see that were all in a fever about this business  the doctor produced from his pocket a small strip of very fine quality bandaging  its just this he explained they left this fragment of bandaging in the stateroom phillips was bound up with it around the wound as was quite natural but it isnt ordinary stuff you see its made double like a tube with silk inside he must have had a dozen yards of this around his leg and side which of course was not disturbed its a horrible idea to a layman i know he went on turning apologetically to katharine  captain will you send at once for the steward crawshay interrupted who carried the coffin out  the captain sent a message to the lower deck katharine was leaning a little forward intensely interested  perhaps miss beverley you can throw some light upon this the former enquiredin your capacity as nurse i mean  she shook her head  i am sorry that i cannot she replied as a matter of fact i was never allowed to touch the bandages doctor gant did all that himself  have you ever seen any bandaging of this sort brightman asked showing her the fragment which he had taken from the doctors fingers  never  crawshay drew a little breath between his teeth he was on the point of speech when a steward knocked at the door the captain called him in  harrison he asked were you one of the stewards who was looking after doctor gant  yes sir the man replied  you helped to carry the coffin out didnt you  thats so sir we were off at six oclock this morning  was there a hearse waiting  the steward shook his head  there was a big motor car outside sir we put the coffin in that and the doctor drove off with itsaid he was to take it down to the place where the man had lived for burial  do you know where that was  no idea sir  the captain glanced towards brightman  do you want to ask the man any questions  questions no sir the detective replied bitterly weve been donethats all there is about it never mind theyve only got six hours start well have that car traced and  does any one know what time mr jocelyn thew left the steamer crawshay interrupted  he got away last night the steward replied there were three or four of them went up to the adelphi to sleep some of them came back for their baggage this morning but i havent seen mr jocelyn thew  katharine rose to her feet her tone and expression were impenetrable  am i still suspect she asked  crawshay glanced at brightman who shook his head  there is no charge against you miss beverley he admitted stiffly so far as i am concerned you are at liberty to leave the ship whenever you please  she held out her hand to the captain  i cant make up my mind captain she said smiling at him delightfully as to what sort of a voyage i have had on this steamer but i do congratulate you on that escape from the raider goodby  crawshay walked with her along the deserted deck as far as the gangway  i am afraid i cannot offer my escort any further miss beverley he regretted i must have a little conversation with brightman here  of course she answered i quite understand perhaps we may meet in london it seems a pity doesnt it she went on sympathetically that that wonderful voyage of yours was taken for nothing some one on this ship has been very clever indeed  some one has crawshay replied bitterly and you and i both know who it is miss beverley but he went on holding the gangway railing as she turned to descend its only the first part of the game thats over our friend has won on the sea but i have an idea that we shall have him on land we shall have him yet and well catch him redhanded if i have anything to do with it will you wish us luck  she turned and looked at him her lips parted as though she were about to speak instead she broke into a little laugh and turning away descended the gangway from the dock she looked up again at crawshay  do come and look me up if you are in town she begged i shall stay at claridges and i shall be interested to hear how you get on     chapter xvi   the city of boston docked in liverpool on sunday night on tuesday at five oclock in the afternoon crawshay who had been waiting at euston station for a quarter of an hour or so almost dragged brightman out of the long train which drew slowly into the station  well take a taxi somewhere the former said its the safest place to talk in any other luggage  only the bag im carrying the detective replied i have got some more stuff coming up if you want me to keep on this job  i think i shall crawshay told him i want to hear how you got on i gathered from your first telegram that you were on the track where did you mean to stay  ive no choice  the savoy then crawshay decided jocelyn thew is staying there and you may be able to keep an eye on him here we are taxisavoynow brightman  you dont want me to make a long story of it sir brightman observed as they drove off  just the things that count thats all  well we got on the track of the car all right the detective began and traced it to a small village called frisby the other side of chester and to the house of a mrs phillips a woman in poor circumstances who had just removed from liverpool she was the widow all right she showed us letters and plenty of them from her husband in new york it appears that gant alone had brought the coffin which was left at the cemetery and the funeral will have taken place t his afternoon mrs phillips was full of his praises and it seems that he had paid her over the whole of the money you spoke aboutfive thousand dollars  there was no chicanery so far then crawshay observed the man was dead of course  absolutely brightman declared and his death seems to have taken place exactly according to the certificate here comes the point however with the aid of the local police and the doctor whom we called in the bandage around the wound was removed we found in its place a perfectly fresh one bought in liverpool not in the least resembling the silklined fragment which the ships doctor brought into the cabin  crawshay looked gloomily out of the window  well i imagine that that settles the question of how the papers got into england he sighed  our job i suppose the detective reminded him is to see that they dont get out again  precisely  in a sense brightman continued that is a toughish job isnt it because whoever has them now can make as many copies as he chooses and one set would be certain to get through  as against that crawshay explained some of the most valuable documents are signed letters of which only the originals would be worth anything there are also some exceedingly complicated diagrams of new york harbours a plan of all the battleships in existence and projected a wonderful submarine destroyer and a new heavy gun these things are very complicated and to carry conviction must be in the original besides that he added dropping his voice there is the one most important thing of all but of which as yet no one has spoken and of which i dare scarcely speak even to you  is it in the shape of a drawing brightman asked  it is not was the whispered reply it is a letter written by the greatest man in one of the greatest countries in the world to the greatest personage in europe there is a secret reward offered of half a million dollars for the return of that letter alone  the affair seems worth looking into brightman remarked stroking his little black moustache  i can promise you that the governments on both sides will pay handsomely crawshay assured him i have had my chance but let it slip you know i had my training at scotland yard but out in the states i found that i simply had to forget all that i knew their methods are entirely different from ours and you see what a failure i have made of it i have let them get away with the papers under my very nose  i cant see that you were very much to blame mr crawshay the detective observed it was a unique trick and very cleverly worked out  they had turned off the main thoroughfare and were now brought to a standstill in the courtyard leading to the savoy suddenly crawshay gripped his companion by the arm and directed his attention to a man who was buying some roses in the florists shop  you see that man he said watch him carefully ill tell you why when we get inside  the eyes of mr brightman and jocelyn thew met over the gorgeous cluster of red roses which the girl was in the act of removing from the window and from that moment the struggle which was to come assumed a different character brightmans thin mouth seemed to have tightened until the line of red had almost disappeared there was a flush upon his sallow cheeks the hand which was gripping his walking stick went white about the knickles but in jocelyn thew there was no change save a little added glitter in the eyes there was nothing else to indicate that the recognition was mutual  well what about him brightman asked as their taxicab moved on what does he call himself  mr jocelyn thew is his name crawshay replied he was on the steamer it is he and not gant whom we have to make for the plot which we have to unravel which gant and phillips and unwittingly miss beverley carried through was of his scheming  mr jocelyn thew the detective repeated as they passed through the swing doors so that is how he calls himself now  you know him  know him brightman repeated bitterly the last time i saw him i could have sworn that i had him booked for sing sing prison he got out of it as he always has done some one else paid it was the greatest failure i had when i was in the states so he is in this thing is he  he is not only very much in it crawshay replied but he is the brains of the whole expedition he is the man to whom gant delivered those documents some time last night  they found two easychairs in the smoking room and ordered cocktails mr brightman sat forward in his chair he was one of those men whose individuality seems to rise to any call made upon it he was indifferently dressed by no means goodlooking and he had started life as a policeman just now however he seemed to sink quite naturally into his surroundings nothing about his appearance seemed worthy of note except the determination of his very dogged mouth  i accepted your commission a short time ago mr crawshay he said with the interest which one always feels in government business of a remunerative character i tell you now that i would have taken it on eagerly if there had not been a penny hanging to it i cant tell you exactly why i feel so bitterly about him but if i can really get my hands on to the man who calls himself jocelyn thew it will be one of the happiest days of my life  you really know something about him then he really is a bad lot crawshay asked eagerly  the worst that ever breathed brightman declared the bravest coolest bestbred scoundrel who ever mocked the guardians of the law mind you i am not saying that he hasnt done other things he has travelled and fought in many countries but when he comes back to civilisation he cant rest the world has to hear of him things move in new york underground the moment he takes rooms at the carltonritz things happen in a way that they have never happened before and we know that theres genius at the back of it all and jocelyn thew smiles in our faces i tell you that if anything could have kept me in america although i very much prefer liverpool the chance of laying my hands on this man would have done it  through the swing doors almost as brightman had concluded his speech came jocelyn thew he was dressed in light tweeds carefully fashioned by an english tailor his tie and collar his grey homburg hat with its black band his beautifully polished and not too new brown shoes were exactly according to the decrees of bond street he seemed to be making his way to the bar but at the sight of them he paused and strolled across the room towards them  getting your land legs mr crawshay he enquired  pretty well thank you you finished your business in liverpool quickly i see  more urgent business brought me to london i dined and spent last evening bytheby with doctor gantthe doctor who was in attendance upon that poor fellow who died on the way over  a very ingenious gentleman crawshay observed drily  ah you appreciate that do you jocelyn thew replied with a faint smile you should go and cultivate his acquaintance he is staying over at the regent palace hotel  one doesnt always attach oneself to the wrong person mr thew  even the stupidest people in the world jocelyn thew agreed can scarcely make mistakes all the time can they by the way he went on turning towards the detective is it my fancy or have i not had the pleasure of meeting mr brightman in america i fancied so when i saw him board the steamer in the mersey on sunday but it did not fall to my lot to receive the benefit of his offices  i was just telling mr crawshay that i had had the pleasure of professional dealings with you brightman said drily i was also lamenting the fact that they had not ended according to my desires  mr brightman was always ambitious the newcomer observed with gentle satire he is i am sure a most persevering and intelligent member of his profession but he flies high  i am much obliged for your commendation brightman said bluntly as regards professions i was just explaining to mr crawshay that you were almost at the top of the tree in yours  if you have discovered my profession jocelyn thew replied you have succeeded where my dearest friends have failed pray do not make a secret of it mr brightman  i have heard you called an adventurer was the prompt reply  it is a term with which i will not quarrel jocelyn declared i certainly am one of those who appreciate adventures who have no pleasure in sitting down in these greywalled foghung cities and crawling about with ones nose on the pavements like a dog following an unclean smell no that has not been my life i have sought fortune in most quarters of the globe sometimes found it and sometimes lost it sometimes with one weapon in my hand and sometimes with another so perhaps you are right mr brightman when you call me an adventurer  these very uncomfortable times crawshay remarked rather limit the sphere in which one may look for stirring events  you are wrong believe me jocelyn thew replied earnestly the stories of the arabian nights would seem tame if one had the power of seeing what goes on around us in the most unsuspected places but we are digressing mr brightman and i were speaking together it occurred to me from what he said that he has not quite the right idea as to my aspirations as to the place i desire to fill in life i shall try to give him an opportunity to form a saner judgment  it will give me the utmost pleasure to accept it the detective confessed with illconcealed acerbity  jocelyn thew sighed lightly he had seated himself upon the arm of a neighbouring easychair and was resting his hand upon the head of a cane he was carrying  if our friend brightman here has a fault he said in the execution of his daily duties it is that he brings to bear into his task a certain amount of prejudice from which the mind of the ideal detector of crime should be free now you would scarcely believe it mr crawshay i am sure to judge from his amiable exterior but mr brightman is capable of very strong dislikes of one of which alas i am the object now this is not as it should be you see what might happen supposing mr brightman were engaged to watch a little coterie or in plainer parlance a little gang of supposed misdemeanants if by any possible stretch of his imagination he could connect me with them i should be the one he would go for all the time and although i perhaps carry my fair burden of those peccadilloes to which the law rightly or wrongly takes exception still in this particular instance i might be the innocent one and in mr brightmans too great eagerness to fasten evil things upon me the real culprit might escapethank you mr crawshay he added accepting the cocktail which the waiter had presented let us drink a little toast together shall we say success to mr brightmans latest enterprise whatever it may be  crawshay glanced at his companion  i think we can humour our friend by drinking that toast brightman he said  i shall drink it with great pleasure the detective agreed  they set down their empty glasses jocelyn thew rose regretfully to his feet  i fear he said that i must tear myself away we shall meet again i trust and mr brightman a word with you if you are in town for a holiday if you have no business to worry you just at present why not practise on me for a time watch me find out the daily incidents of my life see what company i keep where i spend my spare timeyou knowand all the rest of it i can assure you that although i am not the great criminal you fancy me i am a most interesting person to study take my advice mr brightman keep your eye upon me  they watched him on the way to the doora little languid but exceedingly pleasant to look upon exceedingly distinguished and prepossessing a look of half unwilling admiration crept into brightmans face  whatever that man really may be he declared he is a great artist  the swing door leading from the room into the café was pushed open and a woman entered she stood for a moment looking around until her eyes fell upon jocelyn thew crawshay suddenly gripped the detectives arm  is there anything for us in this my friend he whispered watch jocelyn thews face     chapter xvii   for a few seconds jocelyn thew was certainly taken aback his little start his look of blank astonishment were coupled with a certain loss of poise which crawshay had been quick to note but after all the interlude was brief enough  exactly what does this mean nora he demanded  her vivid brown eyes were fastened upon his face eager to understand his attitude a little defiant a little appealing there was nothing to be gathered from his expression however after that first moment he was entirely himselfwellmannered unemotional cold  i came over on the baltic she explained i guessed id find you here fourteenth street was getting a little sultry the old man hopped it to san francisco the day you left  sit down he invited  they found places on a lounge and were served with cocktails the girl sipped hers disapprovingly  rum stuff this she declared i guess ill have to get my shaker out  you are staying here then he enquired  why not she replied with a faint note of truculence in her tone you know im not short of money and i guessed it was where i should find you  he raised his eyebrows  that is very nice and companionable of you he said and naturally i shall be very glad to be of any assistance possible whilst you are over here but i hope you will remember nora that i did not encourage you to come  im wise enough about that she admitted i never expected you to care two pins whether you ever saw me again or not and i know quite well she went on hastily that i havent any right to follow you or anything of that sort but honestly mr thew we were being watched down there and new york wasnt exactly healthy  he nodded  yes he assented no doubt you are right they have awkward methods of crossexamination there although i dont think theyd get much out of you nora  id no fancy to have them try she admitted besides ive never had that trip to europe that uncle and i were always talking about and it seemed to me that if i wanted to see the old country whole now or never was the time you may all be a german colony over here by next year  i have no right or any desire he told her quietly to interfere in any way with your plans but i must warn you that just at present i am living in the utmost jeopardy i have no friends to whom i can introduce you nor any of my own time or attentions to offer unless you choose to exercise tact i might find your presence here not only embarrassing but a positive hindrance to my plans  i guess i can lie close she replied looking at him through halfclosed eyes just how am i to size that up though  he looked at her appraisingly a little cruelly the effect of her beautiful figure was almost ruined by the cheap and unbecoming clothes in which she was attired her hat with its huge hatpins and ultrafashionable height was hideous she exuded perfumes her silk stockings and suede shoes were the only reasonable things about her the former she was displaying with some recklessness as she leaned back upon the settee  i once told you he said calmly that there was no woman in the world for whom i felt the slightest affection  well  that is no longer the case  her eyes glittered  who is she  it is not necessary for you to know he answered coldly she happens however to be concerned in the business which i have on hand she has been of great assistance to me and she may yet be the means of helping me to final success i cannot afford to have her upset by any false impressions  she looked at him almost wonderingly  if youre not the limit she exclaimed nothing matters to you except to succeed you tell me in one breath that you care for a woman for the first time in your life and in the next you speak of using her as your tool  you perhaps find that incomprehensible he observed i do not blame you at present however i have only one object in life and that is to succeed in the business i have on hand whatever i may find it necessary to do to attain my ends i shall do  she had gone a little pale and her white teeth were holding down her full under lip  buy me another cocktail she demanded  he obeyed and she drank it at a gulp  so you are not going to be nice to me she asked in a low tone  that depends upon what you call nice he answered i am rather up against a blank wall even if i succeed i remain in this country at very considerable personal danger i am not sure that even for your sake nora it is well for you to associate with me why not go home youll find some of your people still thereand an old sweetheart or two very likely  it isnt a very warm welcome she remarked a little wistfully  you have taken me by surprise he reminded her i had not the slightest idea of your coming  i know that she sighed i suppose i ought not to have hoped for anything more youve never been any different to me than to any of the others you treat us all men and women just alike you are gracious or cold just according to how much we can help i sometimes wonder mr jocelyn thew whether you have a heart at all  for a single moment he looked at her kindly his hand even patted hers it was a curious revelation he was a kindly ordinary human being  ah nora he said i am not quite so bad as that but for many years i have had a great driving impulse inside me and at the back of it the most wonderful incentive in all the world you know what that is noraor perhaps you dont to a woman it would be love i suppose to a man it is hate  she drew a little further away from him as though something which had flamed in his eyes for a moment had frightened her  yes she murmured you are like that  jocelyn thew was himself again almost at once  since we understand one another nora he said a little more kindly let me tell you that i am really very glad to see you although you did give me rather a shock just now i want you if you will to turn your head to the left you see those two menone seated in the easychair and the other on its arm  i see them  they are the two men he continued who are out to spoil my show if they can you may see them again under very different circumstances  i shant forget she murmured the dark one looks like brightman the detective you were up against in that fall river businessthe man who believed that you were the high priest of crime in new york  you have a good memory he remarked it is the same man  and the other she continued with a sudden added interest in her tonewhy thats the englishman who had me turned off from the hotel in washington dont you remember i went there for a month on trial as telephone operator just before the election you remember why that englishman was always dropping in used to bring me flowers now and then but i felt certain from the first he was suspicious he got me turned off just as things were getting interesting  right again jocelyn thew told her his name is crawshay he is the man who was sent out from scotland yard to the english embassy he crossed with me on the steamer we had our first little bout there  who won  the first trick fell to me he acknowledged grimly  and so will the second and the third she murmured he may be brainy though he doesnt look it with that monacle and the peering way he has but youre too clever for them all jocelyn thew youll win  he smiled very faintly  well he said this time i have to win or throw in my chips now if you like well have some lunch and afterwards if youll forgive my taking the liberty of mentioning it you had better buy some clothes  you dont like this black silk she asked wistfully i got it at a store uptown and they told me these sort of skirts were all the rage over here  well you can see for yourself they arent he remarked a little drily london is a queer place in many ways especially about clothes youre either right or youre wrong and youve got to be right nora well see about it presently  they left the room together crawshay looked after them with interest  this affair he told his companion grows hourly more and more interesting youve been up against jocelyn thew you tell me well i am perfectly certain that that girl whose coming gave him such a start was a young woman i had turned away from an hotel in washington she was in the game thenmore locally perhaps but still in the same game i used to sit and talk to her in the afternoons sometimes finest brown eyes i ever saw in my life i wonder if there is anything between her and jocelyn thew he added looking through the door with a faintly disapproving note in his tonea note which a woman would have recognised at once as jealousy  if you ask me i should say no the other answered ive kept tabs on jocelyn thew for a bit and ive had his dossier theres never been a womans name mentioned in connection with himdont seem as though hed ever moved round or taken a meal with one all the time he was in new york to tell you the truth mr crawshay thats just what makes it so difficult to get your hands on a man you want nine times out of ten its through the women we get home the man who stands clear of them has an extra chance or twosay what time this evening  come to my rooms at 178 st jamess street at seven oclock crawshay directed ive a little investigation to make before then     chapter xviii   crawshay took a taxicab from the savoy to claridges hotel sent up his card and was conducted to katharine beverleys sitting room on the first floor she kept him waiting for a few moments and he felt a sudden instinct of curiosity as he noticed the great pile of red roses which a maid had only just finished arranging when she came in he looked towards her in surprise she appeared to have grown thinner and there were dark rims under her eyes her words of greeting were colourless she seemed almost afraid to meet his steady gaze  i ought to apologise for calling in the morning he said but i ventured to do so hoping that you would come out and have some lunch with me  i really dont feel well enough she replied london is not agreeing with me at all  you are ill he exclaimed with some concern  she looked at the closed door through which the maid had issued  not exactly ill i have some anxieties she answered it is kind of you to keep your promise and come please tell me exactly what happened you know how interested i am  i have unfortunately nothing to report but failure he replied everything seems to have happened exactly as the doctor on the ship suggested the detectives at liverpool were quite smart we were able to trace the car without much difficulty and the body of your patient phillips was found at his home the other side of chester we obtained permission to make an examination and we found that just as we expected fresh bandages had been put on only a few hours previously  and doctor gant  he is at an hotel in london he is watched night and day but he seems to divide his time between genuine sightseeing and trying to arrange for his passage home naturally the whole of his effects have been searched but without the slightest result  andand mr jocelyn thew  his business in liverpool seems to have detained him a very short time he is staying now at the savoy hotel needless to say his effects too have been thoroughly searched without result  you know that he sent me these she asked glancing towards the roses  i saw him buying them  her fingers had strayed over one of the blossoms and he noticed that while they talked she was convulsively crushing it into pulp  were these detectives from liverpool she asked able to keep any watch upon doctor gant and mr jocelyn thew afterchester  to some extent there is no doubt that jocelyn thew spent the first night in liverpool after that he travelled to london and took up his residence at the savoy here doctor gant who had travelled up from chester called upon him late in the afternoon of the day of his arrival they spent some time together and subsequently the doctor took a room at the regent palace hotel the two men dined together at the savoy grill and took a box at the alhambra musichall where they spent the evening they appear to have returned to jocelyn thews rooms had a whisky and soda each and separated there is no record of their having spoken to any other person or visited any other place  and their rooms have been searched  by the most skilled men we have  she pulled another of the roses to pieces  so it comes to this she said all these documents of whose existence both you and the american police knew have been brought from america to england and even now you cannot locate them  at present we cannot he confessed drily but i am not prepared to admit for a single moment that they are ever likely to reach their destination  jocelyn thew is very clever she reminded him calmly  i am tired of being told so he replied with a touch of irritation in his tone  she smiled  you probably need your luncheon if you care to come downstairs with me she invited we can finish our conversation  i shall be only too pleased  katharine beverleys table was in a quiet corner and she sat with her back to the window but even under such circumstances the change in her during the last few days was noticeable there was a frightened light in her eyes her cheeks were entirely colourless her hands seemed almost transparent such a change in so short a time seemed almost incredible crawshay found himself unable to ignore it  i am very sorry to see you looking so unwell he observed sympathetically i am afraid the shock of your voyage across the atlantic has been too much for you  i am terribly disturbed she confessed i am disappointed too in mr jocelyn thew one hates to be made use of so flagrantly  you really knew nothing then until those things were discovered in your stateroom  that question she replied i am not going to answer  but the main part of the plot he persisted the bandages  doctor gant never allowed me to touch them that is what i found so inexplicablewhat first set me wondering  the whole scheme was very cleverly thought out crawshay pronounced but if you will forgive my repeating a previous speculation miss beverley the greatest mystery about it all to me is how you miss katharine beverley whose name and reputation in new york stands so high were induced to leave your work your social engagements and your home at a time like this when your country really has claims upon you to act as ordinary sick nurse to a new york clerk of humble means who turns out to have been nothing but the tool of jocelyn thew  i am still unable to explain that she told him  he realised the state of tension in which she was and suddenly abandoned the whole subject he spoke of the theatres asked of her friends in town discussed the news of the day and made no further allusion of any sort to the mystery which surrounded them it was not until after they had been served with their coffee in the lounge that he reverted to more serious matters  miss beverley he said for your own sake i am exceedingly unwilling to leave you like this i may seem to you to be an inquisitor but believe me i am a friendly one i cannot see that you have anything to lose in being frank with me i wish to help you i wish to relieve the anxiety from which i know that you are suffering give me your confidence  you ask a very difficult thing she sighed  difficult but not impossible he insisted i can quite understand that your discovery of the fact that you had been made use of to assist in the bringing to england of treasonable documents is of itself likely to be a severe shock to you but if you will permit me to say so it is not sufficient to account for your present state of nerves  you dont know all that is happening she replied in some agitation there is a very astute lady detective who has a room near mine and a man who shadows me every time i come in or go out i am expecting every moment that the manager will ask me to leave the hotel  that is all very annoying of course he acknowledged sympathetically and yet i believe that at the back of your head there is still something else troubling you  you are very observant she murmured  in your case he replied close observation is scarcely necessary why it is only four days since we left the steamer and you look simply the wreck of yourself  a great deal has happened since then she confessed  he seized upon the admission  you see i was rightthere is something else miss beverley i am your friend you must confide in me  it would be useless she assured him sadly  you cannot be sure of that he insisted if this espionage gets on your nerves i believe that i have influence enough to have it removed provided that you will let me bring a friend of mine to see you here and ask you a few questions  she shook her head  it is not the espionage alone she declared i am confronted with something altogether different something about which i cannot speak  is this man jocelyn thew connected with it in any way he demanded  she winced  why should you ask that question  because it is perfectly clear he continued that jocelyn thew exercises some sort of unholy influence over you an influence i may add which it is my intention to destroy  she smiled bitterly  if you can destroy anything that jocelyn thew means to keep alive she began  oh please dont believe that jocelyn thew is infallible he interrupted i have had a long experience of diplomatists and plotters and even criminals and i can assure you that no man breathing is possessed of more than ordinary human powers jocelyn thew has brought it off against us this time but then you see one must lose a trick now and then it is the next step which counts  oh the next step will be all right she replied with a hard little laugh he has brought his spoils to england although there must have been twenty or thirty detectives on board and you wont be able to stop his disposing of them exactly as he likes  i dont agree with you he assured her confidently that however is not what i want to talk about you are in a false position in the struggle which is going on now your heart and soul should be with us and against jocelyn thew  her eyes were lit with a momentary terror  you dont suppose for a moment she said that my sympathies are not with my own country and our joint cause  i dont he replied on the other hand your actions should follow upon your sympathies there is something sinister in your present state i want you to tell me just what the terror is that is sitting in your heart that has changed you like this jocelyn thew has some hold upon you if so you need a man to stand by your side cant you treat me as a friend  she softened at his words for a moment she sat quite silent  i can only repeat to you what i told you once before she said if you are picturing jocelyn thew to yourself as a blackmailer or anything of that sort you are wrong i am under the very deepest obligations to him  but surely he protested you have paid your debt whatever it was  he admits it  and yet the terror remains  it remains she repeated sadly  crawshay meditated for a moment  look here miss beverley he said i have a friend who is chief in this country of a department which i will not name will you dine with me tonight and let me invite him to meet you  she shook her head  it is a very kind thought she declared but i am engaged mr jocelyn thew is dining here  crawshays face for a moment was very black indeed he rose slowly to his feet  i know that you mean to be kind she continued and i fear that i must seem very ungrateful believe me i am not i am simply faced with one of those terrible problems which must be solved and yet which admit of no help from any living person  crawshays attitude had grown perceptibly stiffer  i am very sorry indeed miss beverley he said that you cannot give me your confidence i am very sorry for my own sake and i am sorry for yours  is that a threat she asked  you know the old proverb he answered as he bowed over her fingers those who are not on my side are against me  you are going to treat me as an enemy  until you prove yourself to be a friend     chapter xix   at a quarter to eight that evening a young man who had made fitful appearances in the lounge of claridges restaurant during the last halfhour went to the telephone and rang up a certain west end number  are these mr crawshays rooms he asked  mr crawshay speaking was the reply  brightman there  crawshay turned away from the telephone and handed the receiver to the detective  what news henshaw the latter enquired  miss beverley dines at her usual table sir at eight oclock was the reply the table is set for three  for three brightman exclaimed  for three crawshay echoed turning from the sideboard where he had been in the act of mixing some cocktails  you are quite sure the third place isnt a mistake brightman asked  quite sure sir was the prompt reply i am acquainted with one of the head waiters here and i understand that two gentlemen are expected  anything else  nothing sir miss beverley sent away two parcels this afternoon which were searched downstairs they were quite unimportant  i shall expect to hear from you again brightman directed within half an hour if the third person is a stranger try and find out his name  ill manage that all right mr brightman the young lady has just come down ill be getting back into the lounge  brightman turned around to crawshay who was in the act of shaking the cocktails  a third party he observed  interesting crawshay declared very interesting perhaps the intermediary it might possibly be doctor gant though  the detective shook his head  three quarters of an hour ago he said doctor gant went into gattis for a chop he was quite alone and in morning clothes  crawshay poured the ambercoloured liquid which he had been shaking into a frosted glass handed it to his companion and filled one for himself  heres hell to jocelyn thew anyway he exclaimed with a note of real feeling in his tone  if i thought brightman declared that drinking that toast would bring him any nearer to it i should become a confirmed drunkard as it is sirmy congratulations a very excellent mixture  he set down his glass empty and crawshay turned away to light a cigarette  no he decided i dont think that it would be doctor gant jocelyn thew has finished with him all right he did his job well and faithfully but he was only a hired tool speculation however is useless we must wait for henshaws news perhaps this third guest whoever he may be may give us a clue as to jocelyn thews influence over miss beverley  the telephone rang a few minutes later crawshay this time took up the receiver and brightman the spare one which hung by the side it was henshaw speaking  miss beverley has just gone in to dinner he announced she is accompanied by mr jocelyn thew and a young officer in the uniform of a flight commander  what is his name crawshay asked  i have had no opportunity of finding out yet was the reply i believe that he is staying in the hotel and he seems to be on very intimate terms with miss beverley  on no account lose sight of the party crawshay directed and try and find out the young soldiers name wasnt he introduced to jocelyn thew  not a bit of it was the prompt reply they shook hands very much like old friends  go back and watch crawshay directed i must know his name the sooner you can find out the better i want to get away within a few minutes if i can  they left the instrument crawshay who seemed a little nervous took a cigarette from an open box which he passed across to his companion and strolled up and down the room for a few moments with his hands in his pockets  a young officer he remarked presumably english known to both miss beverley and jocelyn thew seems rather a puzzle he may be the connecting link i hope to goodness your man wont be long brightman  are you in a hurry the detective asked  crawshay nodded  i want to get round to the savoy he announced  brightman smiled slightly  were you thinking about the young lady sir he asked  i thought it might be useful to renew my acquaintance with her crawshay explained a little laboriously i shouldnt think shed go out alone  she has probably made some friends by this time brightman observed  crawshay dropped his eyeglass and polished it  from my experience of the young lady he said a little stiffly i should think it improbable i happened to meet her twice in new york and she struck me as being an extraordinarily wellbehaved and in her natural way very attractive person  do you suppose that she came to europe after jocelyn thew brightman asked  oh damn jocelyn thew crawshay replied i should think it most unlikely you and i have both seen the mans dossier most coldblooded person alive  the telephone broke in once more upon their conversation crawshay took up the receiver it was henshaw speaking  i made a mistake about the uniform sir he announced the young man is in the canadian flying corps and he is the young ladys brother he is called captain beverley  her brother crawshay exclaimed  the connecting link brightman murmured  meanwhile the little dinner at claridges of which sketchy tidings were being conveyed to the two occupants of crawshays flat by henshaw was settling down so far as the two men were concerned into a cheery enough meal there had been a little strangeness at first but jocelyn thews hearty welcome of his young friend and his genuine pleasure at seeing him had quickly broken the ice katharine however although she had a shade more colour than earlier in the day had sometimes the air of a banquo at the feast she listened almost feverishly to jocelyn thew whenever he seemed inclined to turn the conversation into a certain channel and she watched her brother a little anxiously as the waiter filled up his glass unchecked every few minutes the likeness between the two was apparent enough although marked by certain differences beverley was tall of exceedingly powerful build and with a fresh strong face which would have been remarkably attractive but for the weak mouth and the slightly puffy cheeks  i cant conceive anything more fortunate than this meeting jocelyn thew declared as he inspected the cigars which had been brought round to him with the air of a connoisseur quite an extraordinary coincidence too that you should turn up in london on five days leave the very day that your sister arrives from the states tell me are you right up at the front  right beyond it most days was the cheerful reply we spend most of our time over the german lines  lucky fellow jocelyn thew sighed you are getting now what a few years ago one had to defy the law forreal thrilling sensations its a life for men yours  the young mans hand shook a little as he raised his glass he looked towards jocelyn thew almost appealingly  its a splendid life he assented talking rapidly and with the air of one who wishes to stifle conversation i had hard work to get my wings but i guess im all right now the engine part of it never gave me any trouble but i suffered from a kind of sickness the first few times i went up its a gorgeous sensation flying the worst of it is we never know when those cunning germans arent coming out with something fresh they stung us up last week with a dozen planes of an entirely new pattern two hundred and fifty horsepower engines on a small frame gee they gave some of our elderly machines a touching up i can tell you  so you fly over the german lines most days eh jocelyn thew ruminated  we dropped a few thousand copies of the presidents speech last monday the young man told them that ought to give them something to think about they only know just what they are told the last batch of prisoners that were brought in firmly believed that one of their armies had landed in england and that london was on the point of falling  all war jocelyn thew said didactically is carried on under a cloud of misconception  the young man stretched himself out he had dined well and his courage was returning he asked a question which up till then he had felt inclined to shirk  what licks me he declared suddenly is finding you two over here what ever brought you across katharine  there was a brief silence katharine seemed uncertain how to answer it was jocelyn thew who took up the challenge  a little over a fortnight ago he explained i called upon your sister in new york i begged her to perform a certain service for me she consented the execution of that service brought her across from new york on board the city of boston  but have you two been seeing anything of one another then you never mentioned thew in any of your letters katharine  your sister and i have not met since a certain memorable occasion jocelyn thew replied  the young man shivered and drained his glass  what was this service he enquired  your sister played sick nurse upon the steamer to a person in whom i was interested and who was operated upon in her hospital jocelyn thew explained he was an englishman and very anxious to reach his own country before he died  i cant quite catch on to it beverley admitted  jocelyn thew glanced carelessly around his manner was the reverse of suspicious but he only resumed his speech when he was sure that not even a waiter was within hearing  it happened to form part of an important plan of mine he said that a man who was dangerously ill should be brought over to england without raising any suspicion as to his bona fides i made use of your sisters name and social position to ensure this there has been as i think you have often acknowledged beverley a debt owing from you to me half of that debt your sister has paid  you havent been getting katharine mixed up in any crooked business her brother demanded excitedly  your sister ran no risk whatever jocelyn thew assured him she performed her share of the bargain excellently it is just possible he continued with a glint of fire in his eyes and a peculiar cold emphasis creeping into his words that it may fall to your lot to wipe out the remainder of the debt  beverley moved in his chair uneasily  you will remember he said that things have changed i am not a free agent now i entered upon this fighting business as an adventure but my god thew its got into my blood ive seen things felt things i dont want anything to come between me and the glorious life i live day by day  jocelyn thew nodded approvingly  thats the proper spirit beverley he declared i always knew you had pluck quite the proper spirit your sister showed the same courage when the necessity came  oh dont bring me into this please she interrupted  you seem to have been brought into it her brother observed grimly and im not sure that i am satisfied i can pay my own debts  there was a note of rising anger in his tone katharine laid her fingers upon his hand  dont imagine things please dick she begged it is my own foolishness if i am disturbed i really had nothing to do mr thew has been most considerate  in any case jocelyn thew went on i think that the matter had better be discussed another time when we are alone we might have to make reference to things which are best not mentioned in a public place  for a moment the young mans eyes challenged his then they fell he shivered a little  why ever speak of them he demanded  ah well well see jocelyn thew observed now what about an hour or two at a musichall i have a box at the alhambra  katharine rose at once to her feet they all made their way into the lounge whilst they waited for her to fetch her cloak beverley swung round to his companion  look here he said for myself it doesnt matteryou know thatbut what game are you playing i dont know much about your life of course before those few days but on your own showing you were out for big things are you known here is it anythinganything against the law this business youre on i dont care for myselfyou know that its katharine im thinking of  jocelyn thew knocked the ash from his cigar he smiled deprecatingly at his companion certainly there was no man in that very fashionable restaurant who looked less like a criminal  my dear beverley he expostulated you must remember that i am an exceedingly clever person i am suspected of any number of misdemeanours i will not say that there are not one or two of which i have not been guilty but i have never left behind me any proof i dare say the english police over here look on me sometimes just as hungrily as the new york ones they feel in their hearts that i am an adventurer they feel that i have been connected with some curious enterprises both in the states and various other countries of the globe they know very well that where there has been fighting and loot and danger i have generally followed under my own flag they know all this but they can prove nothing against me they can only watch me and that they do wherever i am they are watching me now every hour of the day  it isnt the young man commenced with a sudden break in his tone  jocelyn shook his head  no my young friend he said the curtain fell upon that little episode i doubt whether there is even a police record of it it isnt the lives of individuals i am juggling with today its the life of a nation  are you a spy beverley asked him hoarsely  your sister jocelyn thew pointed out is waiting for us     chapter xx   crawshay having the good fortune to find as he issued from his rooms a taxicab whose drivers ideas of speed were in accordance with his own impatience managed to reach the savoy at a few minutes before eight he entered the hotel by the court entrance an insignificantlooking young man with a fair moustache and watery eyes touched him on the shoulder as he passed through the court lobby crawshay glanced lazily around and assured himself that they were unobserved  anything fresh he asked laconically  nothing we have searched miss shareys rooms thoroughly and two of our men have been over thews apartments again  miss sharey upstairs  the young man shook his head  hasnt been up for some hours he reported  crawshay nodded and strolled on he left his coat and hat in charge of the attendant and entered the grill room here however he met with disappointment the place was crowded but his search was methodical there was no sign there of nora sharey he climbed the few stairs and entered the smoking room seated in an armchair reading a novel he discovered the young lady of whom he was in search  he crossed the room at a slow saunter as though on his way to the bar and paused before the girls chair she laid down her book and looked up at him her smile at once assured him of a welcome  i am glad that i am not altogether forgotten miss sharey he said holding out his hand which she promptly accepted i suppose it still is miss sharey is it i hope so  i guess the names all right she replied glad to see you dont bear any illwill against me mr crawshay you englishmen sometimes get so peevish when things dont go quite your way and you werent saying nice things to me last time we met  crawshay smiled and glanced at the seat by her side she made room for him and he subsided into the vacant space with a little sigh of content  a mans profession he confided sometimes makes large and repugnant demands upon him  if that means you are sorry you were rude to me last time we met down in fourteenth street she said i guess i may as well accept your apology you were a trifle disappointed then werent you  we acted crawshay explained with studied laboriousnessmy friends and i acted that is to sayupon inconclusive information america at that time you see was a neutral power and the facilities granted us by the new york police were limited in their character my department was thoroughly convinced that theerrestaurant of which your father was the proprietor was something more than the ordinary meeting place of that section of your countrypeople who carried their enmity towards my country to an unreasonable extent  she looked at him admiringly  say you know how to talk she observed what about getting an innocent girl turned out of a job at washington though  crawshay stroked his long chin reflectively  you dont suppose he began  oh dont yarn she interrupted im not squealing you knew very well that id no need to take a post as telephone operator and you did your duty when you got me turned off it was very clever of you she went on to tumble to me  crawshay accepted the compliment with a smile  if you will permit me to say so miss sharey he declared you are what we call in this country a good sportsman  oh i can keep on the tracks all right she assented i guess i am a little easier to deal with for instance than your friend mr jocelyn thew  crawshay frowned his expression became gloomier  i am bound to confess miss sharey he sighed that your friend mr jocelyn thew has been the disappointment of my life  some brains eh  he has brains courage and luck crawshay pronounced against these three things it is very hard work to bring offshall i say a coup  the man who gets the better of jocelyn thew she declared with a little laugh deserves all the nuts he is a sure winner every time youre up against him now arent you  more or less crawshay confessed i crossed on the steamer with him  i bet that didnt do you much good  i lost the first game crawshay confessed candidly i see that you know all about it  no need to put me wiser than i am the girl observed carelessly jocelyn thews no talker  not unless it serves his purpose it is astonishing crawshay went on reflectively how the science of detection has changed during the last ten years when i was an apprentice at itand though you may not think it miss sharey i am a professional not an amateur although i am generally employed on government businesssecrecy was our watchword we hid in corners we were stealthy we always posed as being something we werent we should have denied emphatically having the slightest interest in the person under surveillance in these days however everything is changed we play the game with the cards upon the tableall except the last two or three perhapsand curiously enough i am not at all sure that it doesnt add finesse to the game  her eyes flashed appreciatively  youre dead right she acknowledged take us two for instance you know very well that jocelyn thew is a pal of mine you know very well that i shall see him within the next twentyfour hours you know very well that youre out to hunt him to the death and you know that i know it every question you ask me has a purpose yet we talk here just as chance acquaintances mighti a girl whom you rather like the look ofyou do like the look of me dont you mr crawshay  crawshay had no need to be subtle his eyes and tone betrayed his admiration  i have thoroughly disliked you ever since you were too clever for me in new york he confessed and i have been in love with you all the time  and you she continued with a little gleam of appreciation in her eyes are a very pleasantlooking smart agreeable englishman who looks as though he knew almost enough to ask a poor girl out to dinner  crawshay glanced at his wrist watch  it is you who have the science of detection he declared you have read my thoughts do you wish to change your clothes first or shall we turn in at a grill room  she rose promptly to her feet  im all for the glad rags she insisted i bought a heap of clothes in bond street this afternoon and i dont know how many chances i shall have of wearing them i am a quick dresser and i shant keep you more than a quarter of an hour but just one moment first  crawshay stood attentively by her side  i am at your service he murmured  its all in the game she went on for you to take me out to dinner of course but i guess i neednt tell you that theres nothing doing in the information way youve fixed it up in your mind i dare say that i am mad with jocelyn thew i may be or i may not but that doesnt make me any the more likely to come in on your side of the game  mr crawshays gesture was entirely convincing  my dear miss sharey he said softly i am going to take a holiday business is one thing and pleasure is another for this evening i am going to put business out of my mind the sentiment at which i hinted a few moments ago has i can assure you a very real existence  hinted she laughed guess there wasnt much hint about it you said you were in love with me  i am crawshay sighed  her eyes danced joyously  you shall tell me all about it over dinner she declared ive got a peach of a black gownyou wont mind if i am twenty minutes  i shall mind every moment that you are away crawshay replied but i can pass the time i will telephone and have a cocktail  she leaned towards him  i can guess whom you are going to telephone to  perhapsbut not what i am going to say  you are going to telephone to that chap with the dark moustachebrightman isnt it i can hear you on the wire say boys youll begin im on to a good thing everythings looking lovely im taking little nora sharey of fourteenth street out to dinegirl who came over to europe after jocelyn thew you know good business eh  crawshay laughed tolerantly the girls humour pleased him  you are wrong he declared if i told them that theyd expect something from me which i know i shant get you are right about the person though i am going to telephone to brightman  what are you going to say she challenged him  i am just going to tell him crawshay confided that jocelyn thew is dining with miss beverley and her brother more red roses and a corner table in the restaurant and  well what else  crawshay hesitated  perhaps he said if i went on i might put just one card too many on the table eh  well let it go at that then she decided after all you know i am not coming exactly like a lamb to the slaughter there are a few things youd like to get to know from me about jocelyn thew but there are also a few things i should like to worm out of you well see which wins and mr crawshay  miss sharey he murmured bending down to her as he held the door open  i dont mind confessing that it depends a great deal upon what brand of champagne you fancy  mum cordon rouge he suggested  she made a little grimace as she turned away  i am rather beginning to fancy your chance she declared     chapter xxi   crawshay about half an hour later piloted his companion to the table which he had engaged in the restaurant with all the savoir faire of a redoubtable man about town she was in her way an exceedingly striking figure in a black satin gown on which was enscrolled one immense cluster of flowers her neck and arms very fully visible were irreproachable her blueblack hair simply arranged but magnificent triumphed over the fashions of the coiffeur the transition from fourteenth street to her present surroundings seemed to have been accomplished without the slightest hitch she leaned forward to smell the great cluster of white roses which he had ordered in from the adjoining florists  the one flower i love she sighed i always fall for white roses  crawshays eyes twinkled as he took his place  do you remember your english history he asked this is perhaps destined to become a battle of red and white rosesred roses at claridges and white roses here  which wonin history she asked indifferently  that i wont tell you he said in case you should be superstitious at the same time i am bound to confess that if we could both of us hear exactly what jocelyn thew is saying tonight across those red roses i think perhaps that i should back the house of york  so thats the stunt is it she remarked coolly you want to make me jealous of katharine beverley  the cleverest and hardest men in the world crawshay observed generally meet with their waterloo at the hands of your sex so far as i am concerned i am myself in distress i am jealous of jocelyn thew  youre bearing up  i am bearing up crawshay rejoined because i am hoping that with kindness and consideration and with opportunity to prove to you what a domestic and faithful person i am you will perceive that of the two men i am the more worthy  think something of yourself dont you she observed  i have cultivated this confidence he told her in my younger days i was overdiffident  guess youre older than i thought you then  i am thirtyseven years old he declared and i was well brought up  jocelyn thew she said reflectively is forty  i did not bring you here he declared to discuss the age of my unworthy rival i brought you to tell me whether you consider that this lobster americaine reminds you at all of delmonicos and to prove to you that we can if we put our minds to it and speak plain and simple words to the sommelier serve our champagne as iced even as you like it  nora was not wanting in appreciation  its the best thing ive had to eat since i left new york and for some time before that she assured him there hasnt been much delmonicos for me during the last few months too many of your lot poking about fourteenth street  he nodded  after all he said that was bound to come to an end when america declared war you people did the only wise thingbrother to san francisco eh your father to chicago and you over here  you do know things she laughed  i am a perfect dictionary as to your movements he assured her  have you anything to do with the fact that my rooms have been searched by the police she asked abruptly  indirectly i fear so he confessed you see up to the present we havent the least idea as to what has become of all those documents and plans which mr jocelyn thew so very cleverly brought over to this country  dont know where hes tucked them away eh she enquired  thats a fact crawshay confessed we discovered a trifle too late how they were brought over but what has become of them since jocelyn thews arrival in london we do not know every one concerned has been searched no deposit has been made at any hotel or in any of the ordinary places where one might conceal securities they have momentarily vanished  the girls eyes twinkled  well she exclaimed he does put it over you doesnt he i wonder whether you think that i am going to be any use to youthat youll trap jocelyn thew through me  not now he answered i used to think so once  why have you changed your mind  because he told her bluntly i used once to think that you and he cared for one another  and now  i have changed my mind he admitted you know him so well that i need not remind you that where women are concerned he seems to have shown few signs of weakness personally i have a theory that the time has come when he is likely to go the way of all other men  she leaned across the table those wonderful brown eyes of hers were lit with an indescribable interest crawshay for a moment lost the thread of his thoughts they were certainly the most beautiful eyes he had ever looked into  you think there is anything between those twokatharine beverley and him  the consideration of that point crawshay continued resuming his usual manner although it lies off the track of my present investigation presents some points of interest she can be of no further use to him in his present scheme she certainly would not aid him in the concealment of any of his spoils nor could she become an intermediary in forwarding them to their destination yet he has sent her roses every day she has been in england and dined with her two nights following you who know him better than i do will agree that such a course is unusual with him  but dick beverley is with them tonight you told me she reminded him  that scarcely alters the situation crawshay pointed out because his coming was quite unexpected if anything it rather strengthens my point of view beverley is very much a young man of the world and he probably knows jocelyn thews reputation he certainly would not consent to meet him in this friendly fashion in company with his sister unless the latter insisted  she doesnt need to insist nora said watching the champagne poured into her glass unless youre kidding me you dont seem to be able to see much further than your nose katharine beverley didnt come across the atlantic for her health and dick beverley didnt join that little dinner party for nothing tonight they both of them did as they were told and they had to do it  this i must confess crawshay murmured smoothly and mendaciously puzzles me your idea is then that jocelyn thew has some hold over them  she laughed at him a little contemptuously  you are not going to make me believe she said that you are not wise about that it isnt clever you know to treat me as a simpleton  i am afraid he confessed humbly that it is i who am the simpleton you think then that the red roses are more emblematic of warfare than of love  nora shrugged her shoulders and was silent for several moments her companion changed the subject abruptly pointed out to her several theatrical celebrities told her an entertaining story and talked nonsense until the smile came back to her lips it was nora herself who returned to the subject of the beverleys reopening it with a certain abruptness which showed that it had never been far from her thoughts  see here mr crawshay she said you seem to me to be wasting a lot of time worrying round a subject when i dont know whether a straightforward question wouldnt clear it up for you if you want to know what there is between those three jocelyn thew and the two beverleys i dont know that i mind telling you its probably what you asked me to dine with you for anyway  my dear miss sharey crawshay protested with genuine earnestness i can assure you that i had only one object in asking you to spend the evening with me  she smiled at him over the glass which she had just raised to her lips  and that  the pleasure of talking to youof being with you  youre easily satisfied  perhaps not so easily as i seem he whispered leaning a little forward in his place if only i were sure that you were not in love with jocelyn thew  if you think that i am she observed why are you always slinging that beverley girl at me  perhaps he said coolly to make you jealous alls fair in love and war you know  i see then what you really want is to make love to me yourself im sitting here and taking notice go right ahead  crawshay let himself go for a few moments and his companion listened to him approvingly  it sounds quite like the real thing she sighed but i never trust you englishmen you seem to acquire the habit of talking love to us girls just as easily as you drink a cocktail you know that if i were to put my little hand in yours this moment across the table you wouldnt know what to do with it  try me crawshay begged  she held it outa long rather thin capable womans hand manicured a few hours ago in the latest fashion but ringless crawshay promptly raised it to his lips she snatched it away half amused half vexed and glanced furtively around  if you did that in an american restaurant she told him youd stand some chance of getting yourself laughed at  its quite the custom over here and on the continent he assured her equably it meanswell just as much as you want it to mean  she sighed and looked at her fingers reflectively  what youd like me to tell you then she suggested raising her eyes and looking at him thoughtfully is that ive never wasted a thought on jocelyn thew but that mr reginald crawshay is it with a capital i  it would make me very happy he assured her with much conviction  she laughed at him very softly little sparks seemed to flash from her eyes and her teeth were wonderful  youre very nice anyway she declared although i am not sure that i believe in you as much as id like to ill just tell you as much as i know it really doesnt amount to anything it was just after jocelyn thew had come back from nicaragua and dick beverley was having a flareup of his own in new york they came together those two when dick was in a tight corner i dont know the story but i know that jocelyn thew played the white man dick beverley owes him perhaps his life perhaps only his liberty and his sister knows it thats how those three stand to one another  i ought to have puzzled that out myself crawshay said humbly  i am not so sure she retorted drily that you didnt long ago  surmises are of very little interest by the side of facts he reminded her i like to have something solid to build upon  she smiled at him appreciatively  if i were a sentimental sort of girl she declared i could take a fancy to you mr crawshay  now youre laughing at me he protested however im going right on with it and then we will dismiss all serious subjects miss beverley has certainly quit herself of any obligation to jocelyn thew richard beverley is no longer free besides he has only a couple of days in england so theres very little chance of his being of use yet he continued impressively i happen to know that every hour just now is of the greatest importance to jocelyn thew why does he spend another entire evening with these two  say which of us is the detectiveyou or me she demanded  professionally i suppose i am he admitted just now however i consider myself as indulging in the relaxation of private life  she leaned across the table towards him her chin supported by her clenched hands  then relax all you want to she begged with a smile of invitation well drop the other stunt if you dont mind and please remember though ive never enjoyed a dinner more in my life that we dont want to be too late for the empire  crawshay returned to his rooms about one oclock the next morning with his hat a little on the back of his head and wearing very much against his prejudice a white rose in his buttonhole brightman who was awaiting him there looked up eagerly at his entrance  any luck mr crawshay  crawshay laid his hat and coat upon the table and mixed himself a whisky and soda  i am not sure he replied thoughtfully are you any good at english history brightman  i won an exhibition in my younger days the detective replied i used to consider myself rather great on history  who won the wars of the roses  the lancastrians of course  crawshay nodded  they were the chaps with the red roses werent they he observed brightman i fancy we are going to reverse that i am laying five to one that ive found out how jocelyn thew counts on getting his spoils into germany     chapter xxii   the dinner of the red roses as though in emulation of its rival entertainment seemed on its way to complete success jocelyn thew from whose manner there seemed to have departed much of the austerity of the previous evening had never been a more brilliant companion he who spoke so seldom of his own doings told story after story of his wanderings in distant countries until even katharine lost her fears of the situation and abandoned herself to the enjoyment of the moment his tone was kindlier and his manner more natural he spoke with regret of richard beverleys departure in a couple of days and only once did he hint at anything in the least disturbing  wonderful feat that of you flying men he remarked dropping ten thousand copies of wilsons speech over the german lines i am not sure that it isnt rather a dangerous precedent though  why dangerous katharine enquired  because he answered coolly it might suggest a possible means of communication with germany to a person say like myself  but you are not a flying man katharine reminded him  he smiled  it would not be necessary he observed for me to be my own messenger  there was a brief and rather a blank silence the shadow of a new fear had arisen in katharines heart the brother and sister exchanged quick glances  i believe i am right their host went on a few minutes later in presuming that you have told richard here the details of our little adventure upon the city of boston  i have told him everything katharine acknowledged you dont mind that do you i felt that i had to  you were quite right jocelyn thew assented there is no reason for you to keep anything secret from richard  the young man was conscious of a sudden recrudescence of anger the flaming up again of his first resentment  the whole thing was a rotten business thew he declared i should never have resented your making use of me in any way you wished but to make a tool of katharine  my dear fellow jocelyn thew interrupted smoothly but with a dangerous glitter in his eyes please dont go on i have an idea that you were going to say something offensive better not your sister came to no real harm she never ran any real risk  it depends upon the way you look at these things the young man replied gloomily katharine tells me that she is watched at her hotel day and night and that she has come under the suspicion of the government for being concerned in this affair  that really isnt of much account the other assured him you yourself he went on came very nearly under suspicion once for something infinitely more serious  it was a chill note in the warmth of their festivities katharine glanced reproachfully at her host and he seemed to realise at once his lapse  forgive me both of you he begged i fear that i am a little irritable tonight this constant espionage gets on ones nerves look at them all around uscrawshay in the corner trying his best to get something incriminating out of nora sharey brightman smoking a cigar out there with his eyes wandering all the time through the glass screen towards this table and the young man who seemed to haunt your hotel miss beverleyhenshaw i believe his name isyou see him dining there with his back turned ostentatiously towards us and a little pocket mirror by his side there are three pairs of eyes that scarcely ever leave us i dont know whether they expect me to produce my spoils from my pocket and lay them upon the table or whether one of them is a student of the lip language and hopes to learn the secrets of our conversation bah they are very stupid this professional potpourri of secretservice agents and detectives cant you hear them how they will whisper in the lobby after we have left jocelyn thew is entertaining a young flying corps man on leave from the front the brother of miss beverley who has already helped him what does that mean then they will put their fingers to their noses and you too will probably be watched dick they will congratulate themselves upon possessing the subtlety of the devil they will see through my scheme they will saythis young man is to drop the documents behind the german lines dont be alarmed richard if you find a secret service man in your bedroom when you get home tonight  katharine laughed almost joyously  then youre not going to ask dick to do anything of that sort she demanded her tone indicating an immense relief  he smiled  i am not going to ask your brother to do anything which is so palpably obvious he replied his help i am certainly going to engage but in a manner which is very unlikely to bring trouble upon him i promise you that  she suddenly leaned across the table the cloud had passed from her features the dull weight from her heart her eyes were more eloquent even than her tremulous lips  mr thew she said do you know that i have always had one conviction about you and that is that all these strange adventures in which you have taken partsome of them as you yourself have acknowledged more creditable than othersyou have entered into chiefly from that spirit of adventure just the spirit in which dick here she added with a little shiver made his mistake why cant you satisfy that part of your nature as dick is doing this war upon which we americans looked so coldly at first has become almost a holy war a twentiethcentury crusade why dont you join one of these irregular forces and fight  then they both witnessed what they had never before seen in jocelyn thew they saw his eyes blaze with a sudden concentrated fury they saw his lips part and something that was almost a snarl transform and disfigure his mouth  fight for england he exclaimed bitterly i would sooner cut off my right hand  his words left them at first speechless he too after his little outburst seemed shaken lacking in his usual sangfroid it was katharine who first recovered herself  but you are english she protested wonderingly  am i he replied will you forgive me if i beg you to change the subject  the subject was effectually changed for them by the advent of some of richard beverleys brothers in arms it was some time before they passed on then a little note almost of tragedy concluded the feast a tall and elderly man gaunt with sunken cheeks silverwhite hair complexion curiously waxen and big dark eyes left the table where he had been sitting with a few americans and came over towards them his advance was measured almost abnormally slow his manner would have been melodramatic but for its intense earnestness he stood at their table for a few seconds before speaking his eyes fixed upon jocelyn thews in a curious almost unnatural stare  you will forgive me he said i must be speaking to sir denis cathley  neither of the two young people who were filled with wonder at the strange appearance of the newcomer noticed jocelyn thews sudden grip of the tablecloth the tightening of his frame the ominous contraction of his eyebrows as for a moment he sat there speechless then he was himself again he shook his head courteously  i am afraid he replied that you must be making some mistake my name is jocelyn thew  and mine the stranger announced is michael dilwyn is that name known to you  perfectly well jocelyn thew acknowledged i was present at the production of your last play in new york i have since read with much regret he went on courteously of the losses you have sustained  the old mans wonderful eyes flashed for a moment  they are losses i am proud to endure sir he said but i did not come to speak of myself i came to speak to sir denis cathley  jocelyn thew shook his head  it is a likeness which deceives you he declared  a likeness the other repeated nine weeks ago i stood in a ruined mansionso dilapidated in fact that one corner of it is open to the skies i listened to the roar of the atlantic as i heard it in the same place fifty years ago a herdsman and his wife perhaps a girl or two live somewhere in the back quarters the only apartment in any sort of preservation is the one sometimes called the picture gallery and sometimes the banqueting hall you should visit this ruined mansion sir you should visit it before you give me the lie when i call you sir denis cathley  jocelyn thews hand for a moment shielded part of his face as though he found the electric light a little strong from behind the shelter of his palm his eyes met the eyes of his visitor the latter suddenly turned and bowed to katharine  you will forgive an old man he begged courteously who has seen much trouble lately for his ill manners perhaps your friend here your friend whose name is not sir denis cathley can explain to you why i felt some emotion at the sight of so wonderful a likeness  he bowed murmured some broken words in reply to katharines kindly little speech and moved away jocelyn thews eyes watched him with a curious softness  yes he acknowledged i can tell you why if he really saw a likeness in me to the person he spoke of it might remind him of strange things you know him by name of coursemichael dilwyn  he wrote the wonderful sinn fein play the new green didnt he katharine asked eagerly i heard you mention it to him my aunt and i were there at the first night  he wrote that and some more wonderful poetry he has spent more than half his life working for the cause of ireland he was the father and patriarch of the last rising one of his sons was shot at dublin  and who is sir denis cathley  the cathleys are another socalled revolutionary family jocelyn thew explained the late sir denis the father of the man whom he supposed me to be was michael dilwyns closest friend they too have paid a heavy price for their patriotism or their rebellious instincts whichever way you choose to look at the matter  i think katharine declared that mr dilwyn is the most picturesquelooking man i ever saw i dont believe that even now he is altogether convinced as to your identity  he has probably reached an age was the cool reply when his memory begins to sufferah i see our friend crawshay is taking counsel with henshaw they are looking in this direction richard my young friend you are in a bad way suspicion is beginning to fasten upon you believe me one of my parasites will be on your track tonight i can almost convince myself as to their present subject of conversation they are preening themselves upon having seen through my subtle scheme i am very sure they are asking themselveswhen is the transfer of documents to take place  it may all seem very humorous to you the young man remarked a little sullenly but it leaves a sort of nasty flavour in ones mouth all the same if they were to suspect me of trying to drop documents over the german lines except under instructions it would mean a courtmartial even though they were unable to prove anything and a firing party in five minutes if they were  take heart my young friend jocelyn thew advised him and do not refuse the courvoisier brandy which our saintly friend with the chain is proffering if it is not indeed a relic of the napoleonic era it is at least drinkable and listenthis may help you to drink it with zesti am not going to ask you to drop any documents over the german lines  the thankfulness in katharines face was reflected in her brothers  thank god for that he exclaimed helping himself liberally to the brandy you know id find it hard to refuse you anything thew but there are limits besides you are never really out of sight there we go out in squadrons and from the height we fly at nothing i could drop would be very likely to reach its destination  jocelyn thew smiled coldly  my dear richard he said i am not going to make you an unwilling partner in any foolhardy scheme such as you are thinking of because that is just the obvious thing that our friends who take so much interest in us would expect and prepare for all the same there is just a trifling commission which i will ask you to undertake for me and which i will explain to you later when do you leave  ten oclock train from charing cross on monday night the young man replied i have to fly on tuesday morning  then if it pleases you we will all dine here that night jocelyn thew suggested and i will take you on to the alhambra for an hour doctor gant and i were there our first night in town and we found the performance excellent you will honour me miss beverley  i shall be delighted she answered but i am not at all sure that you will be able to get seats at the alhambra  why not he asked  there is a great benefit performance there on monday night she told him the house is closed now for rehearsals all the stalls have gone already and the boxes are to be sold by auction at the theatrical fête  jocelyn thew was for a moment grave  i am very glad that you told me this he said but i think that i can nevertheless promise you the stage box for monday night i have a call on it we must all meet once more it is just possible that i may have a pleasant surprise for both of you  do give us an idea what it is she begged  he shook his head somehow since the coming of michael dilwyn a tired look had crept into his eyes he seemed to have lost all his old vivacity he had paid the bill some time before and they strolled together now into the lounge katharine was carrying half a dozen of the roses which the waiter had pressed into her hand  tonight she said looking up into his face and dropping her voice a little i am feeling so much happierhappier than i have felt for a long time why do you keep us both mr thew in such a state of uneasiness you give us so little of your real confidence so little of your real self sometimes it seems as though you deliberately try to make yourself out a harder crueller person than you really are why do you do that  for a moment she fancied that the impossible had happened that she had penetrated the armour of that steadfast and studied indifference  we are all just a little the fools of circumstance he sighed a will to succeed sometimes if it is strong enough crushes out things we would like to keep alive  she thrust one of the blossoms which she was carrying through his buttonhole  i know you will hate that she whispered but you can take it out the moment you have gotten rid of us dick and i are going on now you know to the esholt house dance shall i thank you for your dinner  or i you for your company he murmured bowing over her fingers  they took their leave and jocelyn thew almost as though against his will walked back into the foyer after a few minutes of hesitation and sat there twirling the rose between his fingers with his eyes fixed upon the interior of the restaurant he had the air of one waiting     chapter xxiii   crawshay was awakened the next morning a little before the customary hour by his servant who held out a card  gentleman would like a word with you at once sir the latter announced  crawshay glanced at the card slipped out of bed and attired in his dressing gown and slippers made an apologetic entrance into the sitting room the young man who was waiting there received him kindly but obviously disapproved of the pattern of his dressing gown  chief wants a word with you sir he announced he is keeping from ten to tenthirty  i will be there crawshay promised on the stroke of ten  then i need not detain you further his visitor remarked making a graceful exit  crawshay bathed shaved and breakfasted and at five minutes before ten entered an imposinglooking building and sent up his card to a very great man who had a fancy for being spoken of in his department as mr brown after a very brief delay he was admitted to the august presence mr brown waved his secretaries from the room shook hands kindly with crawshay and motioned him to a chair close to his own  mr crawshay he said this is the first time i have had the pleasure of meeting you but we have received at various times excellent reports as to your work at washington  i am very pleased to hear it sir  from what i gather as to the present situation however the great man continued i imagine that you were more successful in the conventional secret service work than you have been in the very grave business i have sent for you to discuss  i should like to point out sir crawshay begged that that foolish journey to halifax was undertaken entirely against my convictions i protested at the time neither had i any confidence in the summons to chicago  mr brown took the circumstance into gracious consideration  i am glad to hear that he said and i must admit that your recovery was almost brilliant a sense of humour he went on sometimes obtrudes itself into the most serious incidents and the idea of your boarding that steamer from a seaplane and then getting to work upon your investigations will always remain to me one of the priceless unrecorded incidents of the war but to put the matter into plain words our enemies got the better of you  absolutely was the honest confession  there is no doubt the right honourable gentleman continued that the person who took charge of this affair is exceedingly clever he appears to have resource and daring personally i like you never believed for a moment that the whole of the records of german espionage in america for the last three years would be found upon the same steamer as that by which the departing ambassadorial staff travelled however i can quite see that under the circumstances you had to yield to the convictions of those who were already in charge of the affair  you have had full reports sir i suppose crawshay asked you know the manner in which the documents were brought into this country  a ghastly business mr brown acknowledged ingenious but ghastly yes mr crawshay he went on i think i have been kept pretty well posted up till now i have sent for you because i am not sure whether one point has been sufficiently impressed upon you as you are of course aware there are many documents and details connected with this propaganda which are of immense value to the police of new york but there is just onea letter written in a moment of impulse by one great personage to another and stolenwhich might do the cause of the allies incalculable harm if it were to fall into the wrong hands  i had a hint of this sir mason knew of it too his idea was that they would be quite willing to destroy all the rest of the treasonable stuff they have if they could be sure of getting this one letter through  the documents have been in england now mr brown observed for some days have you formed any theory at all as to where they may be concealed  to be perfectly frank crawshay confessed i have not doctor gant jocelyn thew a young woman called nora sharey and miss beverley are the four people possibly implicated in their disappearance although of these two i consider miss sharey and miss beverley out of the question nevertheless their rooms and every scrap of property they possess have been searched thoroughly and their movements since they arrived in london are absolutely tabulated not one of them has written a letter or dispatched a parcel which has not been investigated nor have they made a call or even entered a shop without being watched it seems absolutely impossible that they can have taken any steps towards the disposal of the documents since jocelyn thew arrived in london  have they given any indication of their future plans  doctor gant crawshay replied has booked a passage back in the american boat which sails for liverpool early tomorrow morning we shall escort him there and his effects will be searched once more in liverpool otherwise we have no intention of detaining him he and miss beverley were simply the tools of the other man  and the other man  he has shown no signs of making any move whatsoever he lives to all appearance the perfectly normal life of a man of leisure i understand that he is entirely a newcomer to this sort of business but he is without a doubt the most modern thing in secret service he lives quite openly at a small suite in the savoy court he never makes the slightest concealment about any of his movements we know how he has spent every second of his time since we first took up the search and i can assure you that there is not a single suspicious incident recorded against him  you are satisfied mr brown asked with the aid which you are getting from scotland yard  absolutely crawshay declared brightman toothe man who came down with me from liverpoolhas done excellent work  and notwithstanding all this was the somewhat grave criticism you have not the slightest idea where these documents are to be found  not the slightest crawshay confessed all that i do feel convinced of is that they have not left the country  the great man leaned back a little wearily in his chair there were some decoded cables lying under a paper weight by his side imploring him in the strongest possible terms to make use of every means within his power to solve this mysterya personal appeal from a man whose good will might sway the balance of the future he was used to wonderful service in every department he controlled his present sense of impotence was galling  tell me mr crawshay he asked how long was the gap of time between your losing sight of jocelyn thew and when you picked him up in london  very short indeed was the emphatic reply jocelyn thew must have left the city of boston at about eight oclock on monday morning he met gant at five oclock that evening at crewe station gant had come direct from frisby the little village near chester where he had left the body of phillips it is obvious therefore that gant had the papers with him when he joined jocelyn thew they travelled to london together but parted at euston gant going to a cheap hotel in the vicinity of regent street whilst thew drove to the savoy gant called at the savoy hotel at nine oclock that evening and the two men dined together in the grill room and took a box at a music hallthe alhambra up to this time neither of them had received a visitor or dispatched a messagethew in fact had spent more than an hour in the barbers shop they returned from the alhambra together went up to thews rooms had a drink and separated half an hour later this of course is in a sense posthumous information but scotland yard have it tabulated down to the slightest detail and we are unable to find a single suspicious circumstance in connection with the movements of either man at four oclock the following morning when both men were asleep in their rooms the cordon was drawn around them since then they havent had a chance  the fact that the papers are not in the possession of either of them mr brown said reflectively proves that they made some move of which you have no record  precisely crawshay agreed but it must have been a move of so slight a character that chance may reveal it to us at any moment  describe jocelyn thew to me mr brown begged  he has every appearance crawshay declared of being a man of breeding he is scarcely middleagedtall and of athletic build he dresses well speaks well and i should take him anywhere for an english public school and college man  did new york give you his record  in a cloudy sort of way he seems to have had a most interesting career ranching out west fighting in mexico fighting in several of the central american states and fighting i shrewdly suspect against england in south africa he seems to have been a sort of stormy petrel and to have turned up in any place where there was trouble in new york the police always suspected him of being connected with some great criminal movements but they were never able to lay even a finger upon him he lived at one of the best hotels in the city disappeared sometimes for days sometimes for weeks sometimes for a year but always returned quite quietly with apparently any amount of money to spend and that queer look which comes to a man who has been up against big things  he is an englishman i suppose  he must be his accent and manners and appearance are all unmistakable  how long was he suspected of being in the pay of our enemies before this thing transpired  only a very short time there was a little gang in new yorkrentoul the man who had the wireless in fifth avenue was in itand they used to meet at a place in fourteenth street belonging to an old man named sharey thats where miss sharey comes into the business there were some queer things done there but they dont concern this business and new york has the records of them  jocelyn thew mr brown repeated slowly to himself where did you say he was staying  at the savoy court  mr brown looked fixedly at the cables fluttering a little in the breeze which blew in through the halfopen window  all this isnt very encouraging mr crawshay he sighed  up to the present no the former admitted yet i can promise you one thing sir those papers shall not leave the country  i am glad to hear you speak with so much confidence mr brown observed drily mr jocelyn thew seems at any rate to have managed to secrete them without difficulty  that may be so crawshay acknowledged and yet i am convinced of one thing they are disposed of in some perfectly obvious way and within the next fortyeight hours he will make some effort to repossess himself of them if he does he will fail  mr brown glanced at his watch  i am very much obliged to you for coming to see me he said you are doing your best i know and i beg you mr crawshay never for a moment to let your efforts relax the mechanical side of the watch that is being kept upon these people i know we can rely upon but you must remember that you are the brains of this enterprise your little band of watchers will be quiet enough to see the things that happen and the things that exist it is you who must watch for the things which dont happen  crawshay smiled slightly as he rose to take his leave  i do not as a rule suffer from overconfidence sir he said but i think i can promise you that by wednesday night not only will the papers be in our hands but mr jocelyn thew will be so disposed of that he will be no longer an object of anxiety to us  get on with the good work then was mr browns laconic farewell  late on the following afternoon jocelyn thew and gant paced the long platform at euston by the side of which the special for the american boat was already drawn up curiously enough in their immediate vicinity mr brightman was also seeing a friend off and on the outskirts of the little throng mr henshaw was taking an intelligent interest in the scene  perhaps after all jocelyn thew declared you are right to go you have been very useful and you have without a doubt earned your thousand pounds  it was easy money the other admitted but even now i am nervous i shall be glad to be back once more in my own country  you are certainly right to go the other repeated if you had been different if you had been one of those men after my own heart jocelyn thew went on resting his hand for a moment upon gants shoulder one of those who apart from thought of gain or hope of profit love adventure for its own sake i should have begged you to stay with me i would have sent you on bogus errands to mysterious places i would have twisted the brains of those who have fastened upon us in a hundred different fashions but alas my friend you are not like that  i am not gant admitted gruffly but heartily i have done a job for you and you have paid me very well i am glad to have done it because i love germany and i do not love england apart from that my work is finished i like to go home i am happiest with my wife and family  quite so his companion agreed i know your type gantin fact i chose you because of it you like as you say to do your job and finish with itand you have finished  the doctor turned for a moment deliberately round and looked at his companion he was a heavybrowed unimaginative quietliving man the things which passed before his eyes counted with him and little else the thousand pounds which he was taking home was more than he had been able to save throughout his life to him it represented immense things he would probably not spend a dollar more or indulge in a single luxury yet the money was there in the background a warm comforting thing  you have still he said a desperate part to play can you tell me honestly that you enjoy it that you have no fear  jocelyn thew repeated the word almost wonderingly  fear do you really know me so little my friend of few perceptions listen and i will confess something i have fought for my life at least a dozen times fought against odds which seemed almost hopeless i have seen death with hungry outstretched arms within a few seconds reach of me but i have never felt fear i do not know what it is the length of ones life is purely a relative thing it will come in ten or twenty years if not tomorrow why not tomorrow  if you put it like that gant grunted why not today  or at any moment if you will i am quite ready as ready as i ever shall be if i fail to bring off what i desire within the next few days there will be an end of me do i look as though i were worrying about that  you dont indeed the doctor agreed you ought to have been in my profession you might have become the greatest surgeon in the world  jocelyn thew shrugged his shoulders  even that is possible he admitted unfortunately there was a cloud over my early days a cloud heavy enough even to prevent my offering my services to the world through the medium of any of the recognized professions so you see gant i had to invent one of my own what would you call it i wonderbuccaneer adventurer explorer perhaps my enemies would find a more unkind wordnow you had better step in and take your seat behold the creatures of our friend brightman and the satellites of the aristocratic crawshay close in upon us they listen for farewell words is this your carriage very well here comes your porter hungry for remuneration shall i give them a hint gant  there flashed in the hunted mans eyes for a moment a gleam of almost demoniacal humour  gant glowered at him you are mad he exclaimed  not i my dear friend jocelyn thew assured him as he gripped his hand in a farewell salute believe me it is not i who am mad it is these stupid people who search for what they can never find they lift up the stars and stripes and find nothing they lift up the union jack again nothing they try the tricolour rien de tout but if they have the sense to try the crescenteh gantwell a safe voyage to you man sleep in your waistcoat and remember me to every one in new york i cant promise when i shall be back i have taken a fancy to england still one never knowsgoodby  thew watched the long train crawl out of the station waved his hand in farewell forced a greeting upon the reluctant brightman whom he passed examining the magazines upon a bookstall and summoning a taxi was duly deposited at the alhambra theatre he made his way to the box office  i have called he explained to the young man to see you about box a on monday night i understand that there is a benefit performance  quite so sir the young man replied and i ought to have explained the matter to you at the time when you engaged the box if you will remember although you took it for a week you only paid for five nights i omitted to tell you that for monday night the box is not ours to dispose of  it isnt yet sold i hope  not yet sir the boxes will be disposed of by auction tomorrow afternoon at the theatrical garden party mr bobby is going to act as auctioneer  i see jocelyn thew said thoughtfully the performance is i believe on behalf of the red cross  that is so  in that case supposing i offer you now one hundred guineas for the box  very generous indeed sir the young man admitted but we are pledged to allow all the boxes to be sold by mr bobby i think that if you are prepared to go to that sum you will have no difficulty in securing it  jocelyn thew frowned slightly  i wasnt thinking of going to the theatrical garden party he remarked  you could perhaps get a friend to bid for you sir the young man suggested we hope to get fifty guineas for the large boxes but i should think an offer such as yours would secure any one of them  i rather dislike the publicity of an auction jocelyn thew observed as he turned to take his leave however if charity demands it i suppose one must waive ones prejudices  he strolled out and hesitated for a moment on the pavement a curious change had taken place in what a few hours ago had seemed to be a perfect summer day the clouds were thick in the sky a few drops of rain were already falling and a cold wind like the presage of a storm was bending the trees in the square for a single moment he was conscious of an unsuspected weakness a wave of depression swept in upon him an unreasoning premonition of failure laid a cold hand upon his heart he met the careless gaze of an apparent loiterer who was studying the placards without derision almost with apprehension then he ground his heel into the pavement and reentered his taxicab  savoy he directed     chapter xxiv   captain richard beverley on his way through the hotel smoking room to the savoy bar stopped short he looked at the girl who had half risen from her seat on the couch with a sudden impulse of half startled recognition her little smile of welcome was entirely convincing  why its nora sharey he exclaimed nora  well i am glad youve recognised me at last she said laughing i tried to make you see me last night in the restaurant but you wouldnt look  he seemed a little dazed even after he had saluted mechanically held her hand for a moment and sank into the place by her side  nora sharey he repeated why it was really you then dining last night with that fellow crawshay  of course it was she replied and i recognised you at once even in your uniform  you know that jocelyn thew is here you saw him with us last night  yes i know  stop a moment richard beverley went on let me think nora jocelyn thew must have seen you dining with crawshay how does that work out  he doesnt mind she replied let that stuff alone for a time i want to look at you youre fine dick but what does it all mean  i couldnt stick the ranch after the war broke out he confessed i moved up into canada and took on flying  you are fighting out there in france  have been for six months some sport i can tell you nora ive got a little machine gun thats a perfect daisy gee ive got to pull up the hardest work we fellows have sometimes is to remember that we mustnt talk about our job they used to call me undisciplined im getting it into my bones now thoughwhy nora this is queer i guess were going to have a cocktail together arent we  she nodded he called to a waiter and gave an order then he turned and looked at her appreciatively  youre looking fine he declared  she smiled with pleasure at the undoubted admiration in his tone in the new and fashionable clothes which she had purchased during the last few days the artistically coiffured hair the smart hat and carefullythoughtout details of her toilette she was a transformed being in no way different from the half a dozen other young ladies who were gathered with their escorts at the further end of the room  i am glad you think so she replied seems to me ive had nothing else to do since i got here but buy frocks and things  he looked at her in a puzzled fashion  you didnt come over with jocelyn thew did you nora of course i didnt she answered indignantly if you want to know the truth it looked as though there was going to be trouble at fourteenth street dad made a move out west and i had a fancy for making a little trip this way  kind of lonesome isnt it he asked  in a way she sighed still i am going on presently to where i fancy i shall meet a few friends  and meanwhile he remarked you are still friendly with jocelyn thew and you dined last night didnt you with the man who has sworn to hunt him down  she shrugged her shoulders  you know what i think of jocelyn thew she said im crazy about him and always shall be but ive never seen him look twice at a woman yet in his life and never expect to dick  yes nora  may i ask you a questionstraight  of course  dont think i mean to say a word against jocelyn thew hes a white man through and through and i think if there was any woman in the world he cared for she would be his slave but hes a desperate man even now the police are trying to draw their net around him it was all very well for you when you were painting new york red to choose your friends where it pleased you but your sistershes different isnt shewhat they call over on our side a society belle i am not saying that there is a single person in the world too good for jocelyn thew to sit down with but at the present momentwell hes hard up against it things might happen to him you know dick  for a moment the young man was silent his eyes seemed to look through the walls of the room seemed to conjure up some spectre from which a moment later he shrank  you see nora he explained dropping his voice a little there was just one time when jocelyn thew stood by me like a brick i was hard up against it and he saved me  she leaned a little closer to him  i have often wondered she murmured that was the affair down at the murchison country house wasnt it  richard beverley assented silently  guess well drink these cocktails he said watching the waiter approach flying takes something out of you all the time you know nora and although when i am up my nerves are like a rock i sometimes feel a little shaky at leave time  drink she asked tersely  ive quit that more or less he assured her still i have been taking some these last few days finding katharine over here with jocelyn thew hanging around gave me kind of a shock  you werent best pleased to see them together i should think were you  no he admitted a little sullenly  youre angry with him arent you  kind of he confessed i wouldnt have complained at anything hed asked me to do but it was a lowdown trick to get katharine into this trouble his eyes shone out with a dull anger she watched him curiously  dick youre not the boy you were she sighed guess youre sorry you ever came to that supper party at the knickerbocker arent you  he turned and looked at her he was only twentytwo years old but there were things in his face from which a man might have shrunk  yes i am sorry he confessed i am not blaming anybody but i shall be sorry all my life  jocelyn thew treated you very much as he did me she went on he carried you off your feet you thought him the most wonderful thing that ever lived it was the same with me he has never given as much of himself as his little finger never even looked at me as though i were a human being but id have scrubbed floors for him a month after we first met it was just the same with you only you were a man youd have committed murder for his sake a week after that party  murder  he gave a sudden start a start that amazed her his hand was upon her shoulder his eyes red with fury were blazing into hers  whats that youre saying nora whats that  she was speechless paralysed by that little staccato cry a group of people near looked around she laughed shrilly to cover the intensity of the moment  no need to get excited she exclaimed pull yourself together she went on under her breath waiter two more cocktails he recovered himself almost at once but the strained look was there about his mouth  nerves you see he muttered i shall be all right again when i get back to france  she laid her hand gently upon his arm  dick she said you are often upon my conscience you were such a nice boy back in those days everything thats happened to you seems to have happened since you met jocelyn thew that night he has got some sort of a hold hasnt he what is it  the young man moistened his dry lips the waiter brought their cocktails and he drank his greedily  ill tell you nora he promised perhaps itll do me good to listen how the story sounds as i tell it first of all let us have the thing straight jocelyn thew never helped me into trouble i was in it right up to the neck when i met him  you kept it to yourself she murmured curiously  because i was a fool he answered and because i believed i could pull things straight but anyway i was owing dan murchison seventy thousand id lost at poker he was kind of shepherding me he was a rough sort dan and he had an ambitious wife and i had a name he liked well he was giving a weekend party down at that place of his on the hudson he asked me or rather he ordered me down i was only too glad to go then mrs murchison chipped inwanted my sister wanted to put it in the paper katharine kicked of course so did i murchison for the first time showed his teethand we both went jocelyn thew was another of the guests  tough wasnt it  hell on the way downi dont know why but i was feeling pretty desperatei told jocelyn thew how i stood with murchison he listened but he didnt say much he never does it was a rotten partycommon people one or two professional gamblers a lot of florid noisy overdressed giggling women after the women were supposed to have gone to bed we sat down to what dan murchison called a friendly gamea hundred dollars ante and a thousand rise jocelyn thew played three other men and murchison after about an hour of it id lost over twenty thousand dollars the others had it between them except jocelyn and about his play there was a very curious thing he put in his ante regularly when it came to him but he never made a single bet murchison turned to him once  say you must be having rotten cards mr thew he said  jocelyn shook his head very deliberately i can hear his reply even now kind of quiet it was and deliberate  i dont fancy my chances of winning at this game  i knew what he meant later i didnt tumble to it at the time we played till two oclock god knows how much id lost then murchison called the game off he locked up his winnings in a little safe let into the wall i was standing by him drinking and i saw the combination jocelyn thew was sitting quite by himself as though deep in thoughtwe all got up to bed somehow i sat for some hours at the open window pretty soon i got sober and i began to realise what had happened and all the time i thought of that safe chock full of money and the combination ready set i heard katharine moving about in her room and i knew that she was waiting for me to go and say good night i wouldnt i put on a short jacket instead of my dress coat and i took an electric torch out of my dressing case and i went downstairs id made up my mind nora i meant to rob that safe  she was carried away by his narrative he had let himself go now speaking in short quick sentences yet his plain words seemed to paint with a marvellous vividness the story he told it seemed to her that she could see it all could realise what he went through  go on dick she whispered i understand  well i got down into the room all right and i got the safe open and there was the money and right facing me my letters and bonds and pretty well a hundred thousand dollars in cash and then i saw the lights flare up and murchison was there in his shirt and trousers  so thats your game is it richard beverley he said  there were two of the others with him whod been playing cards there they were three strong men and i was a thief i felt limp i hadnt an ounce of resistance in me murchison stood there showing his ugly teeth his small eyes full of anger  so youre a thief are you richard beverley he went on  i couldnt speak at that moment they could have done just what they liked with me and then the door opened very quietly and closed again jocelyn thew came in i saw murchisons face i tell you nora it was something you wouldnt forget in a hurry  is anything wrong jocelyn thew asked calmly  one of the guests pointed to murchison and me  we heard footsteps he explained dan called me and i followed him down young beverley there was at the safe  probably helping himself jocelyn said in that same smooth dangerous tone to his own money  to what murchison cried  to his own money jocelyn repeated coming a little nearer you know murchison well enough what i meanyou and your two confederates here youre nothing more nor less than common card sharpers i took a pack of your cards upstairs i neednt say anything more i think youd better give the boy back his money i meant to wait until tomorrow fate seems to have anticipated me how much did you lose richard  dan murchison strode up to him and i saw one of the other men go for his hip pocket  will you take that back murchison demanded  not on your life thew replied  murchison went for him but he hadnt a dogs chance i never saw such a blow in my life jocelyn hit him on the point of the chin and he went over like a logcut his head against the fender he lay there groaning and ii swear to you nora that im not a coward but i couldnt movemy knees were shaking the two of them went for jocelyn and before they could get there the door opened and a third man came injake hannaway the most dangerous of the lot jocelyn kept the other two off and half turned his head towards me where i was standing like a gibbering nerveless lunatic  i think youd better take a hand richard he said  nora gasped a little and laid her hand upon his sleeve  dont dick she beggednot for a moment i cant bear it just a moment  she clutched at the side of the settee richard beverley simply sat still looking through the walls of the room there was not the slightest change in his face he just waited until nora whispered to him then he went on  i wont tell you about the fight he said i wasnt much use at first jocelyn was there taking two of them on and butting in sometimes against hannaway whod tackled me then i began to get my strength back and i think i should have settled hannaway but the door opened softly and i saw katharines face she gave a little shriek and jake hannaway got me just at the back of the head i was pretty well done in but thew suddenly swung round and caught jake hannaway very nearly where he had hit murchison down he went like a log i stood there swaying i can see the room nowa table overthrown glasses and flower vases all over the floor and those two men looking as though they meant to murder thew they rushed at him together he dodged one but his strength was going then for the first time he sprang clear of them got his back to the walli wont spin it outhe shot one of them through the shoulder the other one had had enough and tried to bolt jocelyn thew was just too quick for him he flung a heavy candlestick and got him somewhere on the neck there they all were nowmurchison sitting up and dabbing his face half conscious one of the others groaning and streaming with blood the other lyingjust as though he were dead jocelyn turned and spoke to katharinei can hear his voice nowi swear nora there wasnt a quaver in it  i am afraid miss beverley he said that your brother has unwittingly brought you into a den of thieves i had my suspicions and my car instead of being at the garage is under the shrubs there one moment  he stepped out into the hall brought a coat and threw it around her then he turned to me  empty the safe richard he ordered  i obeyed him there was all the money i owed murchison there and a lot of other stuff we stepped out of the french windows jocelyn moved the leg of one of those men on one side and held the window open for katharine to pass through i tell you he set the switch and started his car without a tremor katharine was nearly fainting i was still fogged he drove us into new york with scarcely a word it was daylight when we reached our house in riverside drive he drove up to the front door  perhaps if you dont mind richard he said you could lend me an overcoat people are quite content to accept us as night joyriders but i am scarcely respectable for anything in the shape of a close examination  then i saw that he was all over blood on one side katharine took him away and sponged him although he laughed at it then he had me in the study and together we went through the stuff wed brought away he made me keep what murchison had done me out of and the rest he made into a packet addressed ready for posting and left it on the table  for anything else that may happen dick he said we must take our chance i have had my suspicions of that man murchison for a long time my own opinion is that we shall hear nothing more about the matter  nora turned and looked at her companion with big startled eyes  but it was jake hannaway she exclaimed whom they accused of making a row  he stopped her without impatience but firmly  jake hannaway died the next day he said i must have hit him harder than i thoughtor jocelyn did he had no relatives no friends murchison put the whole trouble down to him admitted that there was a row over a game of cards and a free fight the other two swore to exactly the same story our namesmine and jocelyns were never brought in murchison never came near me again i have never seen him since thats the whole story  what about the police examination she asked curiously i know no more than you do he replied i expect murchison had a pull and he was terrified of jocelyn thew ii went to jake hannaways funeral the young man went on with a slight quiver in his tone ive seen his face nora up in the clouds ive seen it when ive been flying ten thousand feet up suddenly a little piece of black sky would open and id see him looking down at me  there was a brief silence from somewhere through the repeatedly opened swing doors came the rise and fall of music played from a distant orchestra there were peals of laughter from a cheerful party at the other end of the little room nora patted her companions arm gently and his eyes and manner became more natural  its done me good to tell you this he said half apologetically katharines the only other living creature ive dared to speak to about it and she was thereshe saw nora that man can fight like a tiger  hush she whispered here he comes  the swing door was opened and jocelyn thew back from his visit to the box office at the alhambra entered the room he raised his eye brows a little as he saw the pair then he advanced towards them  do you know for the moment i had quite forgotten he confided as he sank into an easychair by their side of course you two are old acquaintances  nora murmured something richard beverley rose to his feet  well id better be getting along he said its been fine to see you again nora he added taking her hand in his see you later thew  he nodded with something of his old jauntiness and swung out of the room they both watched him in silence  not quite the young man he was jocelyn thew observed thoughtfully is it my fancy i wonder or does he drink a few too many cocktails when he is on leave  richard beverleys all right nora answered he is more sensitive than he seems and theres an ugly little corner in his life to live down he is doing the best he can to atone jocelyn she went on with a sudden earnestness in her tone youre going to leave him alone arent you you havent any scheme in your head for making use of him  one never knows was the cool reply  she looked at him curiously  jocelyn she said youre a hard man you set your hand to a task and you dont care whom in the world you sacrifice to gain your end you were a fine friend to richard beverley once but surely his sister has done her best to pay his debt dont do anything that will make him ashamed of the uniform he wears  very pretty he murmured approvingly but i must take you back to your own wordsthey were true enough when i have a task to perform when i pledge myself to a certain thing i do it and i must make use of those whom fate puts in my way richard beverley and his sister are a very attractive couple but if circumstances decree that they are the pawns by means of which i can win the game then i must make use of themdear me he added my friend crawshay i fear that i shall be de trop  nora turned to greet the newcomer and thew sauntered away with a little bow of farewell quite courteous even gracious with the handle of the door in his hand however he paused and came back  my friend crawshay he said one word with you  crawshay turned around  with pleasure  those henchmen of yoursthey are so stupid so flagrantly obvious i am a goodtempered person but they irritated me this afternoon at euston  what can i do crawshay asked however you must not let them get on your nerves they follow you about only as a matter of form we must keep up the old legends you know when he added dropping his eyeglass and polishing it slowly when we really come to the end of this most fascinating little episode i do not fancy that you will have cause to complain of our methods  jocelyn thew smiled  your cryptic words have struck the right note he confessed the thrill of fear is in my veins one more word though miss nora sharey is an old friend of mine there is a tie between us at which you could not guess lavish your attentions on her in the hope of hearing something which will prove to your advantage but do not trifle with her affections if you do i shall constitute myself her guardian and there will be trouble crawshaytrouble  once more he turned away with a smile at nora and a little nod to crawshay he passed through the door and disappeared erect lithe and graceful nora looked after him and her eyes were filled with admiration  i think she sighed although i am getting fonder of you every moment mr crawshay she added as she saw from underneath the tissue paper the huge bunch of white roses he was carrying that my money will go on jocelyn thew     chapter xxv   about threethirty on the following afternoon in the grounds devoted to the much advertised red cross sale that eminent comedian mr joseph bobby mounted to the temporary rostrum which had been erected for him at the rear of one of the largest tents amidst a little storm of half facetious applause he repaid the general expectation by gazing steadfastly at a few friends amongst the audience in his usual inimitable fashion and by indulging in a few minutes of gagging chaff before he proceeded to business a little way off a military band was playing popular selections the broad avenues between the marquees were crowded with streams of pretty women in fancy dresses and mankind with a little money in his pocket was having a particularly uneasy time there was nothing to distinguish this from any other of the red cross fêtes of the season except perhaps its added magnificence  ladies and gentlemen the comedian began i am here to sell by auction the boxes at the alhambra theatre for tonight when as you know there will be the greatest performance ever given by the largest number of star artistesmyself included owing to a slight difference of opinion with the management who as you are probably aware ladies and gentlemen are the thickestheaded set of blighters in existence loud cries of no from the managing director in the front row  i have only the four large boxes to dispose of i shall start with box b who will make me an offer for box b who will offer me say twentyfive guineas to start the bidding  halfadozen offers were immediately made and box b was disposed of for thirtyfive guineas boxes c and d fetched a little more  we now come the auctioneer concluded impressively to the pièce de résistance if i may so call it box a iswell you all know box a ladies and gentlemen so i will simply say that it is the best box in the house it will hold all the friends any man breathing has any use for it would hold the largest family who ever received the queens bounty box a is one of those elastic boxes ladies and gentlemen which have no limit you can fill it chock full and if the right person knocks at the door there will still be room for another who will start the bidding at forty guineas  i will give you fifty jocelyn thew said promptly raising his hand  the auctioneer leaned forward expecting to see a familiar face he saw instead a very distinguishedlooking and remarkably wellturnedout stranger smiling pleasantly at him from the front row of the audience  you are a man sir the former declared warmly you are giving me a good push off fifty guineas is bidden ladies and gentlemen for box a  ill go to fiftyfive a wellknown racing man called out from the rear not a penny more joe so dont get faking the bidding  the comedian assumed an air of grieved surprise  that from you i did not expect mr mason he said however that you may have no cause for complaint i am prepared to knock box a down to you for fiftyfive guineas barring any advance  sixty jocelyn thew bid  the auctioneer noted the advance with thanks then he looked towards the betting man who shook his head the auctioneer who was rather wanting to get away raised his hammer with an air of finality  going at sixty guineas then  sixtyfive a new bidder intervened  the comedian with his hammer already poised in the air paused in some surprise a cleanshaven man in dark grey clothes and a bowler hat a man who had somehow the air of being a little out of his element in this galaxy of pleasure seekers caught his eye  sixtyfive you said sir very good going at sixtyfive  seventy jocelyn thew bid  seventyfive  eighty  eightyfive  ninety  ninetyfive  one hundred guineas jocelyn thew bid turning with a goodnatured smile to glance at his opponent  the auctioneer drew himself up the contest had begun to interest him every one in the room was standing on tiptoe to watch  one hundred guineas is bid by my friend in the front he declared a very princely offer shall i knock it down at that  one hundred and twenty was promptly bidden by the newcomer jocelyn thew smiled up at the auctioneer  well he said ive invited my party so i suppose ill have to stick to it ill make it a hundred and fifty  a hundred and sixty  a hundred and seventyfive  two hundred  two hundred and fifty  the comedians flow of badinage had ceased an intense silence reigned in the marquee he in common with many of the others was beginning to recognise a note of something unusual in this duel  two hundred and fifty guineas is a very handsome sum for the box he said leaning forward perhaps some arrangement could be made mr   my name is jocelyn thew the two hundred and fifty guineas bid is mine i have the notes here ready  the auctioneer turned towards the other bidder appealingly  i am acting under instructions the latter said and i am not at liberty to make any arrangements to share the box  in that case the bid against you at the present moment is two hundred and fifty guineas the auctioneer told him of course the more money we get the betterthe red cross can do with itbut it seems to me that the present bid is adequate if no arrangement is possible however i must continue the auction  two hundred and seventyfive guineas  three hundred jocelyn thew replied coolly one moment mr bobby  he leaned forward and whispered in the comedians ear the latter nodded and turned to the rival bidder  do you understand sir he enquired that this is strictly a cash affair i must have notes for the amount at the conclusion of the sale  you will have to wait until i get them then was the anxious reply i only brought two hundred and fifty with me  the comedian shook his head  there can be no question of waiting he decided if two hundred and fifty guineas is all that you have with you then the box must go to the other gentleman for three hundred guineas  if wed only thought of mentioning the matter of cash before jocelyn thew said pleasantly it seems to me that i might have saved a little money however i dont grudge it to the cause  there was a little murmur of applause and before any further word could be said the auctioneers hammer dropped jocelyn thew stepped up to his side and counted out three hundred guineas in notes receiving in return the admission ticket for the box the comedian shook hands with him  a very generous contribution sir he declared i shall do myself the pleasure of remembering it tonight  jocelyn thew made some suitable reply and strolled leisurely off his eyes searching everywhere for his unsuccessful rival he found him at last in the main avenue on his way to the principal exit and touched him on the shoulder  one moment sir he begged  the young man paused when he saw who his interlocutor was however he attempted to hurry on  you will excuse me he began i am pressed for time  i will walk with you as far as the gate jocelyn thew said i am very curious concerning your bidding for box a cant you let me know for whom you were trying to buy it it is possible that i might feel inclined to resell  my instructions were to buy the box by auction and to go up to five hundred pounds for it was the somewhat hesitating reply i am unfortunately not in a position to divulge the name of my client  you can at least tell me your own name or the name of the firm whom you represent  the young man quickened his pace  i can tell you nothing he said firmly good afternoon  jocelyn thew strolled thoughtfully back made a few purchases wherever he was accosted but had always the air of a man who is seeking to solve some problem issuing from one of the tents he came suddenly face to face with katharine and her brother  you are too late for the auction the latter declared as they shook hands and you wouldnt have got your box anyhow do you know what it fetched  three hundred guineas jocelyn thew replied with a smile i bought it at that  they both stared at him  for three hundred guineas richard repeated  i was rather lucky to get it at that there was an anonymous bidder who fortunately hadnt got the cash with him or i gathered that he was willing to go to a great deal more  they stood for a moment in silence katharine laughed a little nervously  what does it mean she asked  a little obstinacy on the part of a millionaire i suppose jocelyn thew replied carelessly bytheby if it suits you we will meet at the theatre this evening instead of dining i know that you will like to have a little time alone with your brother as he is off tonight miss beverley and i have a business friend coming in to see me about dinner time i shall be in the box awaiting you say at halfpast eight youll be close to charing cross wont you richard and you wont have to leave until ten oclock  thats all right the young man agreed its a jolly good sendoff for me  jocelyn thew made his farewells and strolled down one of the narrow avenues which led to the exit about halfway down he came suddenly face to face with nora and crawshay they all three stood together talking for a few moments suddenly crawshay who appeared to see some one in the crowd turned away will you excuse me for one moment miss sharey he said perhaps mr thew will take care of you  perhaps jocelyn thew observed as he watched crawshay disappear you need some taking care of eh nora  she shrugged her shoulders her eyes sought his she looked at him defiantly  well she exclaimed londons a dull place all alone sos life  i am not interfering in your choice of residence or companionship he replied although it seems strange that you whom i think i may call my friend should choose to amuse yourself with the one person in life who is my open enemy the one man who has sworn to bring about my downfall  there isnt any man in the world will ever do that she declared and you know it you are afraid of no one youve no cause to be  that may be true he agreed but since we have the opportunity of these few moments conversation nora there is one thing i wish to say to you i place no embargo upon your friendship with mr crawshay i do not presume to dictate to you even as to the subjects of your conversation with him tell him what pleases you talk to him about me if you willyou will find him always interested but there is one thing if your lips should ever breathe a word of that other name of mine or of those other things connected with my personal history of which you know i warn you nora that it will be a very bad day for you it will be the one unforgivable thing and i never forgive nora shivered although the afternoon sun was streaming down upon them her cheeks were a little paler  no she murmured i know that you would never forgive you are as hard as the rocks all the time since i have known you i have tried to soften you ever so little just because i was fool enough to like you fool enough to believe that it was just suffering which had made you what you are that belongs to the past when i think of you now my heart is like a stone because i know that there is no love in you nor any of those other things for which a woman craves i should be very sorry indeed jocelyn thew for any woman who ever cared for you and for her own sake i pray very much that there is no one at the present moment who does  a light breeze was blowing over the place they were standing a little apart in the shadow of a tree and the hum of conversation and laughter the noisy appeals of the vendors of flowers and other trifles the strident voices from a distant stage the faroff strains of swaying music seemed blended together in an insistent and not inharmonious chorus jocelyn thew stood as though listening to them for a moment his eyes were following a tall figure in white walking a little listlessly by her brothers side when he spoke his tone was unusually soft  i always told you what you seem to have discovered nora he said i always told you that behind the driving force of my life was much hate but no love nor any capacity for love that may not have been my fault if we were in another place he went on i somehow feel that i might tell you what i have never told anybody elsethe real story that lay behind the things you know of things the memory of which was brought back to me only last night even now that may come but for the present nora remember what you know of me that lies behind that curtain must never pass your lips  i promise she murmured here comes mr crawshay  jocelyn thew raised his hat smiled at nora and strolled away he smiled also a little to himself but not so pleasantly the man from whom crawshay had just parted and with whom he had been in close conversation was the man who had been bidding against him for box a at the alhambra that night     chapter xxvi   from six oclock until half an hour before the time fixed for the commencement of the performance a steady crowd of people elbowed and pushed their way that night into the cheaper parts of the alhambra musichall soon afterwards the earliest arrivals presented themselves at the front of the house brightman and crawshay arrived together and made their way at once to the managers office the former noticing with a little glint of recognition which amounted to scarcely more than a droop of the eyes two or three sturdy looking men who had the appearance of being a little unused to their evening clothes and who were loitering about in the vestibule  the manager greeted his two visitors without enthusiasm he was a small worriedlooking man with pale face hooked nose and shiny black hair he had recently changed his name from jonas to joyce without materially affecting the impression which he made upon the stranger  this is mr crawshay brightman began who has charge from the government point of view of the little matter you and i know about  the manager shook hands limply  glad to meet you mr crawshay he said but a little disturbed at the cause i must say that i hope you will find your impressions illfounded i dont like things of this sort happening in my house  might happen anywhere mr brightman declared with an attempt at cheerfulness bytheby mr joyce i hope you got my note  the manager nodded  yes he assented ive made all the arrangements you wished and the box has not been entered except by the cleaner  mr thew himself then has made no attempt to visit it crawshay enquired  not to my knowledge was the brusque reply  the two men took their leave strolled along the vestibule glanced at the closed door of the box and made their way down into the stalls  our friend must be exceedingly confident brightman remarked musingly  or else we are on the wrong tack crawshay put in  as to that we shall see i dont like to seem oversanguine brightman went on but my impression is that he is rather up against it  all i can say is that he is taking it very coolly then  to all appearance yes but whereas it is quite true that he has made no attempt to get at the box joyce didnt tell usas a matter of fact i dont suppose he knowsthat three times jocelyn thew has visited the theatre under some pretext or other and spotted my men about from halfanhour after his bid at the fete that box has been as inaccessible to him as though it had been walled up  they took their seats in the stalls which were now rapidly filling about five minutes later jocelyn thew arrived alone the box opener brought him from the vestibule and an amateur programme seller accepted his sovereignboth in view of the many rumours floating about the place regarding him with much curiosity without any appearance of hurry he entered the muchdiscussed box divested himself of his coat and hat and stood for a moment in full view looking around the house his eyes rested for a moment upon the figures of the two men below and a very grim smile parted his lips he stepped a little into the background and remained for some time out of sight brightmans interest became intense  from this moment he is our man he whispered all the same i should have liked to have seen where he has hidden the papers i went round the box myself without finding a thing  jocelyn thew had hung up his coat and hat upon one of the pegs and for a few seconds remained as though listening then he turned the key of the door and taking the heavy curtain up in his hand searched it for a few moments until he arrived at a certain spot in one of the bottom folds with a penknife which he drew from his pocket he cut through some improvised stitches thrust his hand into the opening and drew out a small packet which he buttoned up in his pocket in less than a minute he had let the curtain fall again and unlocked the door almost immediately afterwards there was a knock  come in he invited  katharine and her brother entered the former in a gown of black net designed by the greatest of french modistes and richard in active service uniform  we are abominably early of course katharine declared as they shook hands but i love to see the people arrive and as it is dicks last evening he couldnt bear the thought of losing a minute of it  jocelyn thew busied himself in establishing his guests comfortably he himself remained standing behind katharines chair a little in the background  we are going to have a great performance tonight he observed exactly what time does your train go richard  ten oclock from charing cross  jocelyn thew thrust his hand into his pocket and richard rising to his feet stepped back into the shadows of the box something passed between them katharine turned her head and clutched nervously at the programme which lay before her she was looking towards them and her face was as pale as death her host stepped forward at once and smiled pleasantly down at her  you will not forget he whispered that we are likely be the centre of observation tonight i see that our friends brightman and crawshay are already amongst the audience  katharine picked up her program and affected to examine it if only tonight were over she murmured  it is strange that you should feel like that he observed drawing his chair up to the front of the box and leaning towards her in conversational fashion now to me half the evils of life lie in anticipation when the time of danger actually arrives those evils seem to take to themselves wings and fly away take the case of a great actress on her first night an emotional and temperamental woman besieged by fears until the curtain rises and then carried away by her genius even unto the heights our curtain has risen miss beverley all we can do is to pray that the gods may look our way  she studied him thoughtfully for a moment it was obvious that he was not exaggerating his granitelike face had never seemed more immovable his tone was perfectly steady his manner the manner of one looking forward to a pleasant evening yet he knew quite well what she too guessedthat his enemies were closing in around him that the box itself was surrounded that notwithstanding all his ingenuity and all his resource a crisis had come which seemed insuperable she was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of the pity of it all the admiration she had ever felt for his strange insouciance his almost bravadolike coolness his mastery over events seemed suddenly to resolve itself into more definite and more clearlycomprehended emotion it was the great pity of it all which suddenly appealed to her she leaned a little forward  you have called this our last evening she whispered tell me one thing wont you tell me why it must be  the softness in her eyes was unmistakable and his own face for a moment relaxed wonderfully again there was that gleam almost of tenderness in his deepblue eyes nevertheless he shook his head  whether i succeed or whether i fail he said simply tonight ends our associations dont you understand he went on that if i pass from the shadow of this danger there is another more imminent more certain  he hesitated for a single moment and his voice which had grown softer became suddenly almost musical katharine who was listening intently realised like a flash that for the first moment the mask had fallen away  i have lived for many years with that other danger he went on it has lain like a shadow always in front of my path perhaps that is why i have become what i am why i have never dared to hope for the other things which are dear to every one  her hand suddenly gripped his they sat there for a moment in a strange disturbing silence then the orchestra ceased the curtain was rung up the performance which was in the nature of a musichall show with frequent turns and changes commenced popular favourites from every department of the theatrical world each in turn claimed attention and applause katharine watched it all with an interest always strained a gaiety somewhat hysterical jocelyn thew with the measured pleasure of a critic richard with uproarious if sometimes a little unreal merriment the time slipped by apparently unnoticed suddenly richard glanced at his wristwatch and stood up  i must go he declared i had no idea that it was so late katharines fingers clutched the program which lay crumpled up in her hand she looked at her brother with almost frightened eyes their host too had risen to his feet and downstairs in the stalls two men had slipped out of their places jocelyn thew threw back his head with a little familiar gesture the light of battle was in his eyes  richard is right he observed it is twenty minutes to ten  my servant will meet me down there with my kit and get me a seat the young man said i shall have plenty of time but i think i had better make a start  katharine came into the back of the box and threw her arms around her brothers neck he stooped and kissed her on the lips and forehead  cheer up katharine he begged there is nothing to worry about  nothing whatever jocelyn thew echoed the most serious contingency that i can see at present is that you may have to find your way home alone  the number of the car is twenty beverley said handing a ticket to his sister ill send you a wire from folkestone  jocelyn thew suddenly held out his hand his eyes were still flashing with the light of anticipated battle but there was something else in his face reminiscent of that momentary softening  mine i fear he murmured may be but a wireless message but i hope that you will get it  they departed and katharine drawing her chair into the back of the box faced many anxious moments of solitude the two men made their way in leisurely fashion along the vestibule and turned upstairs towards the refreshment room halfway up however jocelyn thew laid his hand upon his companions arm  dick he said i think if i were you i wouldnt have another youve only just time to catch your train as it is  must have a farewell glass old fellow the young man protested  his companion was firm however and beverley turned reluctantly away they walked arm in arm down the broad entrance lounge towards the glass doors it seemed to have become suddenly evident that jocelyn thews words were not without point richard stumbled once and walked with marked unsteadiness just before they reached the doors brightman with a tall stalwartlooking friend slipped past them on the right another man fell almost into line upon the left and jostled the young officer as he did so the latter glanced at both of them a little truculently  say dont push me he exclaimed threateningly you keep clear  neither of the men took any notice the nearer one in fact closed in and almost prevented beverleys further progress brightman leaned across  i am sorry captain beverley he said but we wish to ask you a question will you step into the box office with us  im damned if i will the young man answered i have a matter of ten minutes to catch my train at charing cross and im not going to break my leave for you blighters  crawshay who had been lingering in the background drew a little nearer  forgive my intervention captain beverley he said but the matter will be explained to the military authorities if by chance you should miss your train i am afraid that we must insist upon your acceding to our request  then followed a few seconds most wonderful pandemonium jocelyn thews efforts seemed of the slightest yet mr brightman lay on his back upon the floor and his stalwart companion although he himself was not ignorant of oriental arts lay on his side for a moment helpless richard if not so subtle was equally successful his great fist shot out and the man whose hand would have gripped his arm went staggering back caught his foot in the edge of the carpet and fell over upon the tesselated pavement there were two swing doors and richard with a spring went for the righthand one the commissionaire guarding the other rushed to help his companion bar the exit the two plainclothes policemen whose recovery was instantaneous scrambled to their feet and dashed after him followed by crawshay jocelyn thew scarcely accelerating his walk strolled through the lefthand door crossed the pavement of the strand and vanished  fortune was both kind and unkind to richard in those next few breathless minutes an old football player his bent head and iron shoulder were sufficient for the commissionaires and plunging directly across the pavement and the street he leapt into a taxi which was crawling along in the direction of charing cross  give you a sovereign to get to charing cross in three minutes he cried out and the man accepting the spirit of the thing thrust in his clutch eagerly for a moment it seemed as though temporarily at any rate richard would get clear away in about fifty yards however there was a slight block the door of the taxicab was wrenched open and one of the men who were chasing him essayed to enter richard sent him without difficulty crashing back into the street only to find that simultaneously the other door had been opened and that his hands were held from behind in a grip of iron at the same time he looked into the muzzle of crawshays revolver  sit down the latter commanded  brightman too was in the taxicab and one of the other men had his foot upon the step with a shrug of the shoulders the young man accepted the inevitable and obeyed brightman leaned out of the window gave a direction to the driver and the taxicab was driven slowly in through the assembling crowd richard leaned back in his corner and glared at his two companions  say this is nice behaviour to an officer he exclaimed truculently i am on my way to catch the leave train how dare you interfere with me  perhaps crawshay remarked we may consider that the time has arrived for explanations  then youd better out with them quick richard continued angrily i am an officer in his britannic majestys service come over to fight for you because you cant do your own job do you get that crawshay  i am listening  i am on my way to catch the ten oclock train from charing cross richard went on if i dont catch it my leave will be broken  i feel sure crawshay remarked drily that the authorities will recognise the fact that you made every effort to do so as a matter of fact there will be a supplementary train leaving at tenfortyfive which it is possible that you may be able to catch explanations such as i have to offer are not to be given in a taxicab i have therefore directed the man to drive to my rooms i trust that you will come quietly if the result of our conversation is satisfactory as i remarked before you can still catch your train  richard glanced at the man seated opposite to hima great strong fellow who was obviously now prepared for any surprise at brightman who lithe and tense seemed watching his every movement at the little revolver which crawshay although he kept it out of sight was still holding  seems to me im up against it he muttered youll have to pay for it afterwards you fellows i can tell you that  they accepted his decision in silence and a few minutes later they descended outside the little block of flats in which crawshays rooms were situated richard made no further attempt to escape stepped into the lift of his own accord and threw himself into an easychair as soon as the little party entered crawshays sitting room there was a gloomy frown upon his forehead but the sight of a whisky decanter and a sodawater syphon upon the sideboard appeared to cheer him up  i think he suggested tentatively that after the excitement of the last halfhour  you will allow me to offer you a whisky and soda crawshay begged mixing it and bringing it himself when you have drunk it i have to tell you that it is our intention to search you  what the devil for the young man demanded with the tumbler still in his hand  we suspect you of having in your possession certain documents of a treasonous nature  documents richard jeered dont talk nonsense and treasonous to whom i am an american citizen  that crawshay reminded him is entirely contrary to your declaration when a commission in his majestys flying corps was granted to you the immediate question however is are you going to submit to search or not  richard glanced at that ominous glitter in crawshays right hand glanced at brightman and at the giant who was standing barely a yard away and shrugged his shoulders  i suppose you must do what you want to he acquiesced sullenly but youll have to answer for iti can tell you that its a damnable liberty  he drank up his whisky and soda and set down the empty glass the search which proceeded took a very few moments soon upon the table was gathered the usual collection of such articles as a man in richards position might be expected to possess and last of all from the inside of his vest next to his skin was drawn a long blue envelope fastened at either end with a peculiar green seal crawshays heart beat fast as he watched it placed upon the table richard seemed to have lost much of his truculence of manner  that packet he declared is my personal property it contains nothing of any moment whatever nothing which would be of the least interest to you  in that case brightman promised it will be returned to you mr crawshay he added turning towards him i must ask you as you represent the government in this matter to break these seals and acquaint yourself with the nature of the contents of this envelope which i have reason to suppose was handed to captain beverley by jocelyn thew a few minutes ago  crawshay took the envelope into his hands  i am sorry captain beverley he declared but i must do as mr brightman has suggested this man jocelyn thew with whom you have been in constant association is under very grave suspicion of having brought to england documents of a treasonable nature  i suppose richard said defiantly you must do as you dd well please my time will come afterwards  crawshay broke the seal thrust his hand into the envelope and drew out a pile of closely folded papers one by one he laid them upon the table and smoothed them out even before he had glanced at the first one a queer presentiment seemed suddenly to chill the blood in his veins his eyes became a trifle distended they were all there now a score or more of sheets of thin foreign note paper covered with handwriting of a distinctly feminine type the two men readrichard beverley watched them scowling  what the mischief little may boswells letters have to do with you fellows i cant imagine he muttered go on reading you bounders much good may they do you  there were minutes of breathless silence then crawshay as the last sheet slipped through his fingers glanced stealthily into brightmans face saw him bite through his lips till the blood came and strike the table with his clenched fist  my god he exclaimed snatching up the telephone receiver jocelyn thew has done us again  and you let him walk out crawshay groaned  well find him brightman shouted here central give me scotland yard scotland yard quick johnson you take a taxi to the savoy  unnoticed richard beverley had risen to his feet and helped himself to another whisky and soda  if you are now convinced he said turning towards them that i am carrying nothing more treasonable than the love letters of my best girl i should be glad to know what you have to say to me on the subject of my detention  crawshay for once forgot his manners  damn your detention he replied get off and catch your train     chapter xxvii   on the extreme edge of a stony and widespreading moor jocelyn thew suddenly brought the ancient motorcar which he was driving to a somewhat abrupt and perilous standstill he stood up in his seat unrecognisable transformed from his face had passed the repression of many years his lips were gentle and quivering as a womans his eyes seemed to have grown larger and softer as they swept with a greedy passionate gaze the view at his feet all that was hard and cruel seemed to have passed suddenly from his face he was like a poet or a prophet gazing down upon the land of his desires  behind him lay the rolling moor cloven by that one ribbonlike stretch of uneven road broken here and there with great masses of lichencovered grey rock by huge clumps of purple heather long glittering streaks of yellow gorse the morning was young and little shrouds of white mist were still hanging around his own clothes were damp little beads of moisture were upon his face but below where the atlantic billows came thundering in upon a rockstrewn coast the sun slowly gathering strength seemed to be rolling aside the feathery grey clouds downwards split with great ravines the road now sloped abruptly to a little plateau of farmland on the seaward edge of which stood the ruins of a grey castle dotted here and there about that pastoral strip and on the opposite hillside were a few whitewashed cottages beyond these no human habitation no other sign of life  the traveller gazed downwards till he suddenly found a new mist before his eyes nothing was changed everywhere he looked upon familiar objects there was the little harbour where he had moored his boat scarcely more than a pool surrounded by those huge masses of jagged rocks the fields where he had played the cave in the cliffs where he had sat and dreamed this was his own little corner the land which his forefathers had sworn to deliver the land for which his father had died for which he had become an exile to which he returned with the price of death upon his head  after a while he slipped down from the car examined the brakes mounted to his seat and commenced the precipitous descent skilful driver though he was more than once he was compelled to turn into the cliff side of the road in order to check his gathering speed at last however he reached the lowlands in safety on the lefthand side now was the rockstrewn beach and the almost deafening roar of the atlantic on the right and in front fields no longer like patchwork but showing some signs of cultivation here and there indeed the stooping forms of labourersmen drabcoloured unnoticeable women in bright green and scarlet shawls and short petticoats he passed a little row of whitewashed cottages from whose doorways and windows the children and old people stared at him with strange eyes one old man who met his gaze crossed himself hastily and disappeared jocelyn thew looked after him with a bitter smile upon his lips he knew so well the cause of the terror  he came at last to the great gates leading to the ruined castle gates whose pillars were surmounted by huge griffins he looked at the deserted lodges the coat of arms nothing of which remained but a few drooping fragments he shook the iron gates which still held together in vain finally he drove the car through an opening in the straggling fence and up the long grassgrown avenue until he reached the building itself here he descended walked along the weedframed flags to the arched front door by the side of which hung the rusty and broken fragments of a bell at which he pulled for some moments in vain to all appearances the place was entirely deserted no one answered his shout or the wheezy summons of the cracked and feeble bell he passed along the front barely out of reach of the spray which a strong west wind was bringing from seaward looked in through deserted windows till he came at last to a great crack in the walls through which he stepped into a ruined apartment it was thus that he entered the home in which he had been born  he made his way into a stone passage along which he passed until a door on his right yielded to his touch in front of him now were what had been the state apartments stretching along the whole front of the castle save the little corner where he had entered here was dilapidation supreme complete the white stoneflagged floor knew no covering save here and there a strip of torn matting the walls were stained with damp at long intervals were tables and chairs of jetblack oak in all sorts and states of decay on one or two remained the fragments of some crimson velveton the back of one remnants of a coat of arms and here entirely in keeping with the scene of desolation were the first signs of human lifean old man with a grey beard leaning upon a stick who walked slowly back and forth mumbling to himself  a new light broke across jocelyn thews face as he listened and the tears stood in his eyes the man was reciting gaelic verses verses familiar to him from childhood the whole desolate picture seemed to envisage thoughts which he had never been able to drive from his mind seemed in the person of this old man to breathe such incomparable unalterable fidelity that he felt himself suddenly a traitor who had slipped unworthily away and hidden from a righteous doom better that his blood had been spilt and his bones buried in the soil of the land than to have become a fugitive to have placed an ocean between himself and the voices to which this old man had listened day by day and night by night through the years  jocelyn thew stole softly out of the shadows  timothy he called quietly  the old man paused in his walk then he came forward towards the speaker and dropped on one knee his face showed no surprise though his eyes were strange and almost terribly brilliant  the cathley he exclaimed god is good  he kissed his masters hand which he had seized with almost frantic joy jocelyn thew raised him to his feet  you recognised me then timothy  there is no cathley in the world the old man answered passionately would ever rise up before me and call himself by any other name  am i safe here timothy for a day or two  the old mans scorn was a wonderful thing  safe he repeated safe there is just a dozen miles or so of the kingdom of ireland where the stranger who came on evil business would disappear and its our pride that we are the centre of it  theyve held on then in these parts  hold on why the fire that smouldered has become a blaze was the eager response ireland is our country here whyyou know  know what jocelyn thew demanded you must treat me as a stranger timothy i have been living under a false name news has failed me for years  dont you know the old man went on eagerly that they meet here in the castle the men who counthagen the poet matlaske the lawyer indewick michael dilwyn harrison and the great oclory himself  i thought oclory was in prison since the sinn fein rising  in prison aye but they darent keep him there was the fierce reply they had a taste then of the things that are ablaze through the country the oclory and the others will be here tonight under your own roof aye and the guard will be out and therell be no englishman dare come within a dozen miles  jocelyn thew walked away to one of the great windows and looked out seaward the old servant limped over to his side  your honour he said his voice shaking even as the hands which clasped his stick this is a wonderful daysure a wonderful day  for me too timothy  youve been a weary time gone maybe youve lain hidden across the seas thereyouve heard nothing  ive heard little enough timothy his master told him sadly there came a time when i put the newspapers away from me i did it that i might keep sane  youve missed much then sir denis there has been cruelty and wickedness treason and murder afoot but the spirit of the dear land has never even flickered in these parts the arms we sent to dublin were landed in yonder bay and there was none to stop them either though they laid hands on that poor madman who wellnigh brought us all to ruin theres strange craft rides there now where your honours looking  a silence fell between the two men presently the steward withdrew  ill be seeing after your honours room he murmured and theres others to tell theres a drop of something left too in the cellars thank god  jocelyn thew listened to the retreating footsteps and then for a moment pushed open the window there was the old roar once more which seemed to have dwelt in his ears the salt sting the scream of the pebbles the cry of a wheeling gull there was the headland round which he had sailed his yacht the moorland over which he had wandered with his gun the meadow round which he had tried the wild young horses in those few seconds of ecstatic joy he seemed for the first time to realise all that he had suffered during his long exile  more and more unreal seemed to grow the world in which sir denis jocelyn cathley passed that day time after time the great hall in which he had played when a boy draughty now but still moderately weathertight had echoed to the roars of welcome from old associates but the climax of it all came later on when he sat at the head of the long black oak table presiding over what was surely the strangest feast ever prepared and given to the strangest gathering of guests the tablecloth of fine linen was patched and mendedhere and there still in holes some of the dishes were of silver and others of kitchen china there were knives and forks beautifully shaped and fashioned mingled with the hornhandled ware of the kitchen silver plate and common pewter side by side priceless glass and common tumblers fragments of beautiful china and here and there white delf borrowed from a neighbouring farm the fare was simple but plentiful the only drink whisky and some ancient marsala in dustcovered bottles produced by timothy with great pride and served with his own hand the roar which had greeted the first drinking of sir denis health had scarcely died away when michael dilwyn led the way to the final sensation  denis my boy he said theres a trifle of mystery about you yet will you tell me then why when i spoke to you at the savoy restaurant the other night you denied your own identity told me your name was thew or something like it and i your fathers oldest friend and your own too  a sudden flood of recollection unlocked some of the fears in denis cathleys breast  i have not used the name of cathley for many years he said was it likely that i should own to it there in the heart of london with a price upon my head and half a dozen people within earshot i came back to england at the risk of my life on a special errand i scarcely dared to hope that i might meet any of you i just wanted twelve hours here  stop lad dilwyn interrupted whats that about a price on your head youve missed none of our letters by any chance  letters sir denis repeated i have had no word from this country not even from timothy here for over three years and a half  there was a little murmur of wonder the truth was beginning to dawn upon them  itll be the censor maybe michael dilwyn murmured tell us denis cathley what brought you back then what was this special errand you spoke of  nothing i can discuss even with you was the grim answer it was a big risk in more ways than one but if tonight keeps calm ill bring it off  youve had no letters for three years michael dilwyn repeated why dn it boy he exclaimed striking the table with his fist maybe you dont know then you havent heard of it  heard of what sir denis demanded  your pardon  mywhat  your pardon was the hoarse reply signed and sealed a year ago before the dublin matter things arent as bad as they were theres a different spirit abroadpass him the madeira hagan sure this has unnerved him  sir denis drank mechanically drank until he felt the fire of the old wine in his veins he set the glass down empty  my pardon he muttered  its true hagan assured him you were one of a dozen i wrote you with my own hand to the last address we had from you somewhere out on the west coast of america dilwyns right enough england has a government at last there are men there who want to find the truth they know what we are and what we stand for you can judge what i mean when i tell you that we speak as we please here openly and no one ventures to disturb us denis theyve begun to see the truth dilwyn here will tell you the same thing he was in downing street only last week  i was indeedi michael dilwyn the outlawand they listened to me  the days are coming hagan continued for which weve pawned our lands our relatives and some of us our liberty please god there isnt one here that wont see a free ireland weve hammered it into their dull saxon brains its been a long drear night but the dawns breaking  and i am pardoned sir denis repeated wonderingly  where have you been to these three years man that youve heard nothing michael dilwyn asked  in mexico cuba nicaragua uraguay youre right ive been out of the world i crept out of it deliberately when i left here nothing seemed so hopeless as the thought that a time of justice might come i cut myself off even from news i have lived without a name and without a future  maybe for the best hagan declared cheerfully remember that its but twelve months ago since your pardon was signed and youd have done ill to have found your way back before thenbut what about this mission you spoke of  sir denis looked down the table of servants there was only old timothy at the sideboard and of those who were gathered around his board there was not one whom he could doubt  i will tell you about that he promised leaning a little forward you have read of the documents and the famous stolen letter which were supposed to have been brought over to england in a certain trunk protected by the seal of a neutral country  why sure michael dilwyn murmured under his breath the box was to have been opened at downing street but one heard nothing more of it  the stolen letter hagan remarked was supposed to have been indiscreet enough to have brought about the ruin of a great man in america  sir denis nodded  youve got the story all right he said well those papers never were in that trunk i brought them over myself in the city of boston i brought them over under the nose of a secret service man and although the steamer and all of us on board were searched from head to foot in the mersey before we were permitted to land  and where are they now michael dilwyn asked  sir denis drew a long envelope from his pocket and laid it upon the table before him almost as he did so another little sensation brought them all to their feet they hurried to the window from about a mile out seaward a blue ball followed by another had shot up into the sky sir denis watched for a moment steadily then he pointed to a bonfire which had been lighted on the beach  that he pointed out is my signal and there is the answer the documents you have all read about are in that envelope  there was a queer protracted silence a silence of doubt and difficulty  it will be a german submarine that michael dilwyn declared she has come to pick up your papers maybe  thats true was the quiet answer i was to light the fire on the beach the moment i arrived the blue balls were to be my answer  the oclory a big silent man leaned over and laid his hand on his hosts shoulder  what are you going to do about it he demanded  for the moment i do not know sir denis confessed advise me all of you i undertook this enterprise partly because of its danger partly for a great sum of money which i should have handed over to our cause partly because if i succeeded it would hurt england now i have come back and i find you all moved by a different spirit  there isnt a man in this island michael dilwyn said slowly who has hated england as i have she has been our oppressor for generations and in return we have given her the best of our sons their lifeblood their genius their souls and yet with it all there is a bond our children have married theirs and when weve looked together over the side weve seen the same things weve made use of germans denis but i tell you frankly i hate them there are two things every irishman lovesjustice and courageand england went into this war in the great manner she has done big things and i tell you in a sneaking sort of way were proud i am honest with you you see denis you can guess from what ive said what id do with that packet  sir denis turned to the oclory  and you he asked  my boy was the reply sure michaels right ive hated england ive shouldered a rifle against her ive talked treason up and down the country and ive known the inside of a prison ive spat at her authority ive said in plain words what i think of herfat commerceridden smug selfish ive watched her bleed and been glad of it but at the bottom of my heart id have liked to have seen her outstretched hand denis lad thats coming weve got to remember that we too are a proud obstinate pigheaded race weve got to meet that hand halfway and when the moment comes id like to be the first to raise the boys round here and give the germans hell  another blue ball shot up into the sky sir denis took the packet of papers from the table and stood by the great open stone hearth michael dilwyn moved to his side a gaunt impressive figure  youre doing the right thing denis he declared what fighting weve done and any that we may still have to do with england well do it on the surface i was down at queenstown when they brought in some of the bodies from the lusitania to hell with such tricks theres no irishman yet has ever joined hands with those who war against women and babies  denis drew a log of burning wood out on to the hearth and laid the packet deliberately upon it he stood there watching the smoke curl upwards as the envelope shrivelled and the flames crept from one end to the other  that seems a queer thing to do he observed with a dry little laugh ive carried my life in my hands for those papers and theres a hundred thousand pounds waiting for them not a mile away  bloodmoney boy the oclory reminded him and anyway theres a touch of the evil thing about strangers goldeh but whos this  a large motorcar had suddenly flashed by the window with the instinct of past dangers the little gathering of men drew close together there was the sound of an impatient voice in the hall the door was opened hurriedly and crawshay stepped in it is a gentleman in a great hurry your honour timothy explained  crawshay dour and threatening came a little further into the room behind him in the hall was a vision of his escort sir denis looked up from the hearth with a poker in his hand  my friend he observed it seems to be your unfortunate destiny to be always five minutes too late in life  crawshays outstretched hand pointed denouncingly through the window towards the bay  if i am too late this time he declared then an act of treason has been committed you know what it means i suppose to communicate with the enemy  denis shook his head  as yet he said we have held no communication with our visitors if you doubt my word come down on your knees with me and examine these ashes  crawshay with a little exclamation crossed the floor and crouched down by the others side a word or two in the topmost document stared at him the seal of the envelope had melted and a little thread of green wax had made a strange pattern upon the stones  is this the end then he demanded in bewilderment  it is the end was the solemn reply perhaps if you take the ashes away with you you will be able to consider that honours are divided  you burnt themyourself crawshay muttered still wondering every gentleman in this room denis replied is witness of the fact that i destroyed unopened the packet which i brought from america barely five minutes ago  crawshay stood upright once more he was convinced but puzzled  will you tell me what induced you to do this he asked  we will tell you presently as for the submarine outside well as you see he is still sending up blue lights  crawshay gathered the ashes together and thrust them into an envelope  your friend will be trying some of our irish whisky denis michael dilwyn invited we are hoping to make the brand more popular in england before long     chapter xxviii   one by one the next morning in all manner of vehicles the guests left the castle sir denis bade them farewell parting with some of them in the leaky hall of his ancestors and with others out in the stoneflagged courtyard crawshay alone lingered with the obvious air of having something further to say to his host the two men strolled down together seaward to where the great rocks lay thick upon the stormy beach  these sir denis pointed out are supposed to be the marbles with which the great giant cathley used to play tradition is a little vague upon the subject but according to some of the legends he was actually an ancestor and according to others a kind of patron saint just look at my house crawshay what would you do with a place like that  they turned and faced its crumbling front majestic in places squalid in others one whole wing open to the rain and winds one great turret still as solid and strong as the rocks themselves  it would depend very much crawshay replied upon the extremely sordid question of how much money i had to spend if i had enough i should certainly restore it its a wonderful situation  the eyes of its owner glowed as he swept the outline of the stormbattered country and passed on to the rich strip of walledin fields above  it is my home he said simply i shall live in no other place if this matter which we discussed last night should indeed prove to have a solid foundation if this even should be the beginning of the end of the great struggle  but it is crawshay interrupted how can you doubt it if you have read the papers during the last six months  i have scarcely glanced at an english newspaper for ten years was his companions reply i fled to america hating england as a man might do some poisonous reptile sternly determined never to set foot upon her shores again i left without hope it seemed to me that she was implacable the war has changed many things  you are right crawshay admitted in many respects it has changed the english character we look now a little further afield we have lost some of our stubborn overconfidence we have grown in many respects more spiritual we have learnt what it means to make sacrifices sacrifices not for gold but for a righteous cause and as far as regards this country of yours sir denis he continued i was only remarking a few days ago that the greatest opponents of home rule who have ever mounted a political platform in england have completely changed their views there is only one idea today and that is to let ireland settle her own affairs such trouble as remains lies in your own country convert ulster and you are free  you heard what was said last night sir denis reminded his companion the oclory believes that that is already done  the faintest of white mists was being burnt away now by the strengthening sun long green waves came rolling in from the atlantic distant rocks gleamed purple in the gathering sunshine the green of the fields grew deeper the colouring on the moors warmer crawshay lit a cigarette and leaned back against a rock  over in america he observed i heard all sorts of stories about you the man hobson with whom i was sent to halifax and who dragged me off to chicago seemed to think that if he could once get his hand on your shoulder there were other charges which you might have to answer brightman that liverpool man had the same idea i am mentioning this for your own sake sir denis  the latter shook his head  heaven knows how ive kept clear he declared but there isnt a thing against me i sailed close to the wind in mexico id have fought for them against america if theyd really meant business but they didnt i was too late for the boer war or id have been in that for a certainty i went through south america but the little fighting i did there doesnt amount to anything after i came back to the states i ran some close shaves i admit but i kept clear of the law then i got in with some germans at washington they knew who i was and they knew very well how i felt about england i did a few things for themnothing risky they were keeping me for something big that came along as you know they offered me the job of bringing these things to england and i took it on  for an amateur crawshay confessed you certainly did wonderfully i am not a professional detective myself but you fairly beat us on the sea and you practically beat us on land as well  theres nothing succeeds like simplicity denis declared i gambled upon it that no one would think of searching the curtains of the music hall box in which gant and i spent apparently a jovial evening no one diduntil it was too late then i felt perfectly certain that both you and brightman would believe i was trying to get hold of richard beverley the poor fellow thought so himself for some time  there is just one question crawshay said after a moments pause which id like to ask its about nora sharey  sir denis glanced at his companion with a faint smile he suddenly realised the purport of his lingering  well what about her  she seems to have followed you very quickly from new york  must you put it like that her father and brother were connected with the german secret service in new york and on the declaration of war they had to hide she could scarcely stay there alone  she might have gone with her father to chicago crawshay observed  you must remember that she too is irish sir denis pointed out i am not at all sure that she wasnt a little homesick bytheby are you interested in her  since you ask me crawshay replied i am  sir denis threw away his cigarette  i suppose he said quietly if i tell you that i am delighted to hear it for your own sake as well as hers  thats all i have been hanging about to hear crawshay interrupted turning towards the castle i suppose we shall meet again in london  i think not they talk about sending me to the dublin convention here until they want me i dont think i shall move  crawshay looked around him the prospect in its way was beautiful but save for a few bending figures in the distant fields there was no sign of any human being  you wont be able to stand this for long he remarked youve lived too turbulent a life to vegetate here  sir denis laughed softly but with a new ring of real happiness  its clear that you are not an irishman he declared ive been away for over ten years i can just breathe this air wander about on the beach here walk on that moorland watch the sea poke about amongst my old ruins send for the priest and talk to him get my tenants together and hear what they have to sayi can do these things crawshay and breathe the atmosphere of it all down into my lungs and be content its just irelandthats allyou hurry back to your own bloated overrich smokedisfigured townruined country and spend your money on restaurants and theatres if you want to youre welcome  sir denis words sounded convincing enough but his companion only smiled as he brought his car out of a dilapidated coachhouse from amidst the ruins of a score of carriages  all the same he observed as he leaned over and shook hands with his host i should never be surprised to come across you in that smokedisfigured den of infamy look me up when you come wont you  certainly sir denis promised andmy regards to nora  richard beverley after his first embrace held his sisters hands for a moment and looked into her face  why katharine he exclaimed londons not agreeing with you you look pale  she laughed carelessly  it was the heat last month she told him i shall be all right now how well youre looking  im fine he admitted its a great life katharine im kind of worried about you though  there is nothing whatever the matter with me she assured him except that i want some work in a few days time now i shall have it i have eighty nurses on the way from the hospital with doctors and dressers and a complete st agness outfit they sailed yesterday and i shall go across to havre to meet them  good for you richard exclaimed say katharine what about lunch  you must be starving she declared well go down and have it i feel better already dick i think i must have been lonely  they went arm in arm downstairs and lunched cheerfully towards the end of the meal he asked the question which had been on his lips more than once  heard anything of jocelyn thew  not a word  richard sighed thoughtfully  what a waste he exclaimed a man like that ought to be doing great things katharine you ought to have seen their faces when they searched me and found i was only carrying out a packet of old love letters and it dawned upon them that hed got away with the goods i wonder if they ever caught him  shouldnt we have heard of it she asked  not necessarily if hed been caught under certain circumstances he might have been shot on sight and we should never have heard a word not that thats likely of course he went on suddenly realising her pallor what a clumsy ass i am katharine we should have heard of it one way or anotherdo you see whos sitting over there in a corner  katharine looked across the room and shook her head  the face of the man in khaki seems familiar she admitted  thats crawshay the fellow whom jocelyn thew fooled he was married last week to the girl with him nora sharey her name was she came from new york  they seem very happy katharine observed watching them as they left the room  crawshays a good fellow enough her brother remarked and the girls all right although at one time  he stopped short but his sisters eyes were fixed upon him enquiringly  at one time he continued i used to think that she was mad about jocelyn thew not that that made any difference so far as he was concerned he never seemed to find time or place in his life for women  they finished their luncheon and made their way upstairs once more to katharines sitting room richard stretched himself in any easychair and lit a cigar with an air of huge content  i am to be transferred when our first division comes across he told her our squadron commanders going to make that all right with the wo weve had some grand flights lately i can tell you katharine  there was a knock at the door a few moments later the waiter entered bearing a card upon a tray which he handed to katharine she read it with a perplexed frown  sir denis cathleybut i dont know of any one of that name she declared glancing up are you sure that he wants to see me  perhaps i had better explain a quiet voice interposed from outside may i come in  katharine gave a little cry and richard sprang to his feet sir denis pushed past the waiter for a moment katharine had swayed upon her feet i am so sorry he said earnestly please forgive me miss beverley and do sit down it was an absurd thing to force my way upon you like this only you see he went on as he helped her to a chair the circumstances which required my use of a partially assumed name have changed i ought to have written you and explained naturally you thought i was dead or at the other end of the world  katharine smiled a little weakly she was back again in her chair but sir denis seemed to have forgotten to release her hand which she made no effort to withdraw  it was perfectly ridiculous of me she murmured but i was just telling dickhe is back again for another four days leave and we were talking about you at luncheon timethat i wasnt feeling very well and your coming in like that was quite a shock i am absolutely all right now do please sit down and explain she begged motioning him to a chair  the waiter had disappeared sir denis shook hands with richard who wheeled an easychair forward for him he sat down between them and commenced his explanation  you see he went on as a criminal i am really rather a fraud when i tell you that i am an irishmanperhaps you may have guessed it from my nameand a rabid one a sinn feiner and that for ten years i have lived with a sentence probably of death hanging over me you will perhaps understand my hatred of england and my somewhat morbid demeanour generally  katharine was speechless richard beverley indulged in a long whistle  so thats the explanation he exclaimed that was why you got mixed up with that german crew eh  that sir denis admitted was the reason for my attempted enterprise  attempted richard protested but you brought it off didnt you  the end of the affair was really curious sir denis explained i suppose in a way i did bring it off i caught the mail train from euston that night got away with the papers and took them where i always meant toto my old home on the west coast of ireland there whilst i was waiting to keep an appointment with a german uboat i found out what happens to a man who has sworn an oath that he will never again look inside an english newspaper and been obstinate enough to keep his word  say this is interesting richard declared enthusiastically why of course there have been great changes havent there you irish are going to have all that you want after all  it looks like it sir denis assented i found that my home was the rendezvous of a lot of my old associates only instead of meeting underneath trapdoors at the risk of their lives they were meeting quite openly and without fear of molestation from them i heard that the government had granted me together with some others a free pardon many months ago i heard too of the coming convention and of the altered spirit in english politics i heard of these things just in time for the uboat was waiting outside in the bay  you didnt part with the stuff richard exclaimed eagerly  sir denis shook his head  i burnt the papers upon my hearth he told them crawshay ran me to ground there but his coming wasnt necessary a great deal besides the ashes of those documents went up in smoke that night  richard beverley had risen to his feet and was pacing up and down the room he found some vent for his feelings by wringing his friends hand  if this doesnt beat the band he exclaimed my head isnt strong enough to take it all in so crawshay found you out  he arrived sir denis replied to find the papers burning upon the hearth as a matter of fact he took the ashes with him  he didnt arrest you then after all there was no charge made  none whatever he was perfectly satisfied he stayed until the next morning and we parted friends a few days ago i had his wedding cards you know whom he married  saw them together downstairs richard declared im off in a moment to see if i can get hold of crawshay and shake his handso youre sir denis cathley eh and youve chucked that other game altogether  naturally the other repliedsir denis jocelyn cathley as a matter of fact i am up in town to arrange for some one else to take my place at the convention i am not much use as a maker of laws theyve promised me a commission in the irish guards that will be settled in a few days then i shall go back home to see what i can do amongst my tenantry and afterwardswell he concluded with a little gleam in his dark eyes they promise me i shall go out with the first drafts of the new battalion  richard gripped his friends hand once again and turned towards the door  its great he declared i must try and catch crawshay before he goes  he hurried out the door was closed sir denis turned at once towards katharine he rose to his feet and leaned over her chair his voice was not quite so steady  so much that i had thought lost for ever he said has come back to me so much that i had never thought to realise in this world seems to be coming true is it too late for me to ask for the one greatest thing of all of the only person who could countwho ever has counted you know so well katharine that even as a soured and disappointed man i loved you and now it is just you and you only who could give mewhat i want in life  she laid her fingers upon his shoulders her eyes shone as he drew her into his arms  i ought to keep you waiting such a long time she murmured because i had to ask you firstfor your friendship and you werent very kind to die but i cant
