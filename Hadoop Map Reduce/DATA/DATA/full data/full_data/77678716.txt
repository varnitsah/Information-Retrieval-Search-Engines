              burns     editors introduction to the heart of midlothian  scott began to work on the heart of midlothian almost before he had completed rob roy on nov 10 1817 he writes to archibald constable announcing that the negotiations for the sale of the story to messrs longman have fallen through their firm declining to relieve the ballantynes of their worthless stock so you have the staff in your own hands and as you are on the spot can manage it your own way depend on it that barring unforeseen illness or death these will be the best volumes which have appeared i pique myself on the first tale which is called the heart of midlothian sir walter had thought of adding a romance the regalia on the scotch royal insignia which had been rediscovered in the castle of edinburgh this story he never wrote mr cadell was greatly pleased at ousting the longmansthey have themselves to blame for the want of the tales and may grumble as they choose we have taggy by the tail and if we have influence to keep the best author of the day we ought to do itarchibald constable iii 104  though contemplated and arranged for the heart of midlothian was not actually taken in hand till shortly after jan 15 1818 when cadell writes that the tracts and pamphlets on the affair of porteous are to be collected for scott the author was in great glee    he says that he feels very strong with what he has now in hand but there was much anxiety concerning scotts health i do not at all like this illness of scotts said james ballantyne to hogg i have eften seen him look jaded of late and am afraid it is serious hand your tongue or ill gar you measure your length on the pavement replied hogg you fause downhearted loon that ye are you daur to speak as if scott were on his deathbed it cannot be it must not be i will not suffer you to speak that gait scott himself complains to charles kirkpatrick sharpe of these damned spasms the merchant abudahs hag was a henwife to them when they give me a real night of it  the heart of midlothian in spite of the authors malady was published in june 1818 as to its reception and the criticism which it received lockhart has left nothing to be gleaned contrary to his custom he has published but without the writers name a letter from lady louisa stuart which really exhausts what criticism can find to say about the new novel i have not only read it myself says lady louisa but am in a house where everybody is tearing it out of each others hands and talking of nothing else she preferred it to all but waverley and congratulates him on having made the perfectly good character the most interesting    had this very story been conducted by a common hand effie would have attracted all our concern and sympathy jeanie only cold approbation whereas jeanie without youth beauty genius warns passions or any other novelperfection is here our object from beginning to end lady louisa with her usual frankness finds the edinburgh lawyers tedious in the introduction and thinks that mr saddletree will not entertain english readers the conclusion flags but the chief fault i have to find relates to the reappearance and shocking fate of the boy i hear on all sides oh i do not like that i cannot say what i would have had instead but i do not like it either it is a lame huddled conclusion i know you so well in it bytheby you grow tired yourself want to get rid of the story and hardly care how lady lousia adds that sir george staunton would never have hazarded himself in the streets of edinburgh the end of poor madge wildfire is most pathetic the meeting at muschats cairn tremendous dumbiedikes and rory beau are delightful    i dare swear many of your readers never heard of the duke of argyle before she ends if i had known nothing and the whole world had told me the contrary i should have found you out in that one parenthesis for the man was mortal and had been a schoolmaster  lady louisa omits a character who was probably as essential to scotts scheme as anydouce davie deans the old cameronian he had almost been annoyed by the criticism of his covenanters in old mortality the heavy artillery out of the christian instructor or some such obscure field work and was determined to tickle off another there are signs of a war between literary cavaliers and literary covenanters at this time after the discharge of dr mccries heavy artillery charles kirkpatrick sharpe was presented by surtees of mainsforth with a manuscript of kirktons unprinted history of the church of scotland this he set forth to edite with the determination not to let the whig dogs have the best of it every covenanting scandal and absurdity such as the old story of mess david williamsondainty davieand his remarkable prowess and presence of mind at cherrytrees was raked up and inserted in notes to kirkton scott was sharpes ally in this enterprise i had in the persons of my forbears a full share you see of religious persecution    for all my greatgrandfathers were under the ban and i think there were hardly two of them out of jail at once i think it would be most scandalous to let the godly carry it oft thus it seems to have been the editing of kirkton it is very odd the volume of wodrow containing the memoir of russell concerning the murder is positively vanished from the library the advocates library neither book nor receipt is to be found surely they have stolen it in the fear of the lord the truth seems to have been that cavaliers and covenanters were racing for the manuscripts wherein they found smooth stones of the brook to pelt their opponents withal soon after scott writes it was not without exertion and trouble that i this day detected russells manuscript the account of the murder of sharpe by one of the murderers also kirkton and one or two others which mr mccrie had removed from their place in the library and deposited in a snug and secret corner the covenanters had made a raid on the ammunition of the cavaliers i have given adds sir walter an infernal row on the subject of hiding books in this manner sharpe replies that the villainous biographer of john knox dr mccrie that canting rogue is about to edite kirkton sharpe therefore advertised his own edition at once and edited kirkton by forced marches as it were scott reviewed the book in the quarterly jan 1818 he remarked that sharpe had not escaped the censure of these industrious literary gentlemen of opposite principles who have suffered a work always relied upon as one of their chief authorities to lie dormant for a hundred and forty years their querulous outcries probably from the fieldwork of the christian instructor he disregards among the passions of this literary bicker which scott allowed to amuse him was davie deans conceived scott was not going to be driven by querulous outcries off the covenanting field where he erected another trophy this time he was more friendly to the true blue presbyterians his scotch patriotism was one of his most earnest feelings the covenanters at worst were essentially scotch and he introduced a new cameronian with all the sterling honesty the puritanism the impracticable ideas of the covenant in contact with changed times and compelled to compromise  he possessed a curious pamphlet haldanes active testimony of the true blue presbyterians 12mo 1749 it is a most impartial work containing a declaration and testimony against the late unjust invasion of scotland by charles pretended prince of wales and william pretended duke of cumberland everything and everybody not covenanted the house of stuart the house of brunswick the house of hapsburg papists prelatists and turks are cursed up hill and down dale by these worthy survivors of the auld leaven everybody except the authors haldane and leslie has broken the everlasting covenant the very confession of westminster is arraigned for its laxity the whole civil and judicial law of god as given to the jews except the ritual polygamy divorce slavery and so forth is to be maintained in the law of scotland sins are acknowledged and since the covenant every political stepcromwells protectorate the restoration the revolution the accession of the dukes of hanoverhas been a sin a court of elders is to be established to put in execution the law of moses all offenders against the kirk are to be capitally punished stage plays are to be suppressed by the successors of the famous convention at lanark anno 1682 toleration of all religions is sinful and contrary to the word of god charles edward and the duke of cumberland are cursed also we reckon it a great vice in charles his foolish pity and lenity in sparing these profane blasphemous redcoats that providence delivered into his hand when by putting them to death this poor land might have been eased of the heavy burden of these vermin of hell the auld leaven swore terribly in scotland the atrocious cruelties of cumberland after culloden are stated with much frankness and power the german soldiers are said to have carried off a vast deal of spoil and plunder into germany and the redcoats had plays and diversions cricket probably on the inch of perth on a sabbath the hellish pagan juggler plays are set up and frequented with more impudence and audacity than ever only the jews our elder brethren are exempted from the curses of haldane and leslie who promise to recover for them the holy land the massacre in edinburgh in 1736 by wicked porteous calls for vengeance upon the authors and abettors thereof the army and navy are the most wicked and flagitious in the universe in fact the true blue testimony is very active indeed and could be delivered thanks to hellish toleration with perfect safety by leslie and haldane the candour of their eloquence assuredly proves that davie deans is not overdrawn indeed he is much less truculent than those who actually were testifying even after his decease  in the heart of midlothian scott set himself to draw his own people at their best he had a heroine to his hand in helen walker a character so distinguished for her undaunted love of virtue who unlike jeanie deans lived and died in poverty if not want in 1831 he erected a pillar over her grave in the old covenanting stronghold of irongray the inscription ends                     respect the grave of poverty                    when combined with love of truth                           and dear affection  the sweetness the courage the spirit the integrity of jeanie deans have made her of all scotts characters the dearest to her countrymen and the name of jeanie was given to many children in pious memory of the blameless heroine the foil to her in the person of effie is not less admirable among scotts qualities was one rare among modern authors he had an affectionate toleration for his characters if we compare effie with hetty in adam bede this charming and genial quality of scotts becomes especially striking hetty and dinah are in very much the same situation and condition as effie and jeanie deans but hetty is a frivolous little animal in whom vanity and silliness do duty for passion she has no heart she is only a butterfly broken on the wheel of the world doubtless there are such women in plenty yet we feel that her creator persecutes her and has a kind of spite against her this was impossible to scott effie has heart sincerity passion loyalty despite her flightiness and her readiness when her chance comes to play the fine lady it was distasteful to scott to create a character not human and sympathetic on one side or another thus his robber of milder mood on jeanies journey to england is comparatively a good fellow and the scoundrel ratcliffe is not a scoundrel utterly to make a lang tale short i canna undertake the job it gangs against my conscience your conscience rat said sharpitlaw with a sneer which the reader will probably think very natural upon the occasion ou ay sir answered ratcliffe calmly just my conscience a body has a conscience though it may be ill wunnin at it i think mines as weel out o the gate as maist folks are and yet its just like the noop of my elbow it whiles gets a bit dirl on a corner scott insists on leaving his worst people in possession of something likeable just as he cannot dismiss even captain craigengelt without assuring us that bucklaw made a provision for his necessities this is certainly a more humane way of writing fiction than that to which we are accustomed in an age of humanitarianism nor does scotts art suffer from his kindliness and effie in prison with a heart to be broken is not less pathetic than the heartless hetty in the same condemnation  as to her lover robertson or sir george staunton he certainly verges on the melodramatic perhaps we know too much about the real george robertson who was no heir to a title in disguise but merely a stabler in bristol accused at the instance of duncan forbes esq of culloden his majestys advocate for the crimes of stouthrieff housebreaking and robbery robertson kept an inn in bristo at edinburgh where the newcastle carrier commonly did put up and is believed to have been a married man it is not very clear that the novel gains much by the elevation of the bristo innkeeper to a baronetcy except in so far as effies appearance in the character of a great lady is entertaining and characteristic and jeanies conquest of her own envy is exemplary the change in social rank calls for the tragic conclusion about which almost every reader agrees with the criticism of lady louisa stuart and her friends thus the novel filled more pages than mr jedediah cleishbotham had opined and hence comes a languor which does not beset the story of old mortality scotts own love of adventure and of stirring incidents at any cost is an excellent quality in a novelist but it does in this instance cause him somewhat to dilute those immortal studies of scotch character which are the strength of his genius the reader feels a lack of reality in the conclusion the fatal encounter of the father and the lost son an incident as old as the legend of odysseus but this is more than atoned for by the admirable part of madge wildfire flitting like a feu follet up and down among the douce scotch and the dour rioters madge wildfire is no repetition of meg merrilies though both are unrestrained natural things rebels against the settled life musical voices out of the past singing forgotten songs of nameless minstrels nowhere but in shakspeare can we find such a distraught woman as madge wildfire so near akin to nature and to the moods of the bonny lady moon only he who created ophelia could have conceived or rivalled the scene where madge accompanies the hunters of staunton on the moonlit hill and sings her warnings to the fugitive                  when the gledes in the blue cloud                       the lavrock lies still                 when the hounds in the greenwood                       the hind keeps the hill                 theres a bloodhound ranging tinwald wood                       theres harness glancing sheen                 theres a maiden sits on tinwald brae                       and she sings loud between                 o sleep ye sound sir james she said                       when ye suld rise and ride                 theres twenty men wi bow and blade                        are seeking where ye hide  the madness of madge wildfire has its parallel in the wildness of goethes marguerite both of them lamenting the lost child which to madges fancy is now dead now living in a dream but the gloom that hangs about muschats cairn the ghastly vision of crying up ailie muschat and she and i will hae a grand boukingwashing and bleach our claise in the beams of the bonny lady moon have a terror beyond the german and are unexcelled by webster or by ford but the moon and the dew and the nightwind they are just like a caller kailblade laid on my brow and whiles i think the moon just shines on purpose to pleasure me when naebody sees her but mysell scott did not deal much in the facile pathos of the deathbed but that of madge wildfire has a grace of poetry and her latest song is the sweetest and wildest of his lyrics the most appropriate in its setting when we think of the contrasts to herthe honest dull goodnature of dumbiedikes the commonsense and humour of mrs saddletree the pragmatic pedantry of her husband the highland pride courage and absurdity of the captain of knockdanderwhen we consider all these so various and perfect creations we need not wonder that scott was in high glee over the heart of midlothian felt himself very strong and thought that these would be the best volumes that have appeared the difficulty as usual is to understand how in all this strength he permitted himself to be so careless over what is really by far the easiest part of the novelists taskthe construction but so it was about the monastery he said it was written with as much care as the rest that is with no care at all his genius flowed free in its own unconscious abundance where conscious deliberate workmanship was needed the forthright craftsmans hand there alone he was lax and irresponsible in shakspeares case we can often account for similar incongruities by the constraint of the old plot which he was using but scott was making his own plots or letting them make themselves i never could lay down a plan or having laid it down i never could adhere to it the action of composition always diluted some passages and abridged or omitted others and personages were rendered important or insignificant not according to their agency in the original conception of the plan but according to the success or otherwise with which i was able to bring them out i only tried to make that which i was actually writing diverting and interesting leaving the rest to fate   when i chain my mind to ideas which are purely imaginativefor argument is a different thingit seems to me that the sun leaves the landscape that i think away the whole vivacity and spirit of my original conception and that the results are cold tame and spiritless  in fact sir walter was like the magician who can raise spirits that once raised dominate him probably this must ever be the case when an authors characters are not puppets but real creations they then have a will and a way of their own a freewill which their creator cannot predetermine and correct something like this appears to have been scotts own theory of his lack of constructive power no one was so assured of its absence no one criticised it more severely than he did himself the edinburgh review about this time counselled the author of waverley to attempt a drama doubting only his powers of compression possibly work at a drama might have been of advantage to the genius of scott he was unskilled in selection and rejection which the drama especially demands but he detested the idea of writing for actors whom he regarded as ignorant dull and conceited i shall not fine and renew a lease of popularity upon the theatre to write for low illinformed and conceited actors whom you must please for your success is necessarily at their mercy i cannot away with he wrote to southey avowedly i will never write for the stage if i do call me horse he remarks to terry he wanted neither the profit nor the shame of it i do not think that the character of the audience in london is such that one could have the least pleasure in pleasing them he liked helping terry to terryfy the heart of midlothian and his other novels but he had no more desire than a senator of rome would have had to see his name become famous by the theatre this confirmed repulsion in one so learned in the dramatic poets is a curious trait in scotts character he could not accommodate his genius to the needs of the stage and that crown which has most potently allured most men of genius he would have thrust away had it been offered to him with none of caesars reluctance at the bottom of all this lay probably the secret conviction that his genius was his master that it must take him where it would on paths where he was compelled to follow terse and concentrated of set purpose he could not be a notable instance of this inability occurs in the introductory chapter to the heart of midlothian which has probably frightened away many modern readers the advocate and the writer to the signet and the poor client are persons quite uncalled for and their little adventure at gandercleugh is unreal oddly enough part of their conversation is absolutely in the manner of dickens  i think said i    the metropolitan county may in that case be said to have a sad heart  right as my glove mr pattieson added mr hardie and a close heart and a hard heartkeep it up jack  and a wicked heart and a poor heart answered halkit doing his best  and yet it may be called in some sort a strong heart and a high heart rejoined the advocate you see i can put you both out of heart  fortunately we have no more of this easy writing which makes such very melancholy reading  the narrative of the porteous mob as given by the novelist is not it seems entirely accurate like most artists sir walter took the liberty of composing his picture in his illustrations of the author of waverley 1825 mr robert chambers records the changes in facts made by scott in the first place wilson did not attack his guard and enable robertson to escape after the sermon but as soon as the criminals took their seats in the pew when fleeing out robertson tripped over the plate set on a stand to receive alms and oblations whereby he hurt himself and was seen to stagger and fall in running down the stairs leading to the cowgate mr mcqueen minister of the new kirk was coming up the stairs he conceived it to be his duty to set robertson on his feet again and covered his retreat as much as possible from the pursuit of the guard robertson ran up the horse wynd out at potter row port got into the kings park and headed for the village of duddingston beside the loch on the southeast of arthurs seat he fainted after jumping a dyke but was picked up and given some refreshment he lay in hiding till he could escape to holland  the conspiracy to hang porteous did not in fact develop in a few hours after his failure to appear on the scaffold the queens pardon or a reprieve reached edinburgh on thursday sept 2 the riot occurred on the night of sept 7 the council had been informed that lynching was intended thirtysix hours before the fatal evening but pronounced the reports to be caddies clatters their negligence of course must have increased the indignation of the queen the riot according to a very old man consulted by mr chambers was headed by two butchers named cumming tall strong and exceedingly handsome men who dressed in womens clothes as a disguise the rope was tossed out of a window in a small wares shop by a woman who received a piece of gold in exchange this extravagance is one of the very few points which suggest that people of some wealth may have been concerned in the affair tradition according to charles kirkpatrick sharpe believed in noble leaders of the riot it is certain that several witnesses of good birth and position testified very strongly against porteous at his trial  according to hogg scotts fame was now so firmly established that he cared not a fig for the opinion of his literary friends beforehand he was pleased however by the notice of ivanhoe the heart of midlothian and the bride of lammermoor in the edinburgh review of 1820 as he showed by quoting part of its remarks the reviewer frankly observed that when we began with one of these works we were conscious that we never knew how to leave off the porteous mob is rather heavily described and the whole part of george robertson or staunton is extravagant and displeasing the final catastrophe is needlessly improbable and startling the critic felt that he must be critical but his praise of effie and jeanie deans obviously comes from his heart jeanies character is superior to anything we can recollect in the history of invention    a remarkable triumph over the greatest of all difficulties in the conduct of a fictitious narrative the critique ends with an earnest wish that the author would try his hand in the lore of shakspeare but wiser than the woers of penelope scott refused to make that perilous adventure                                              andrew lang   an essay by mr george ormond based on manuscripts in the edinburgh record office scottish review july 1892 adds little to what is known about the porteous riot it is said that porteous was let down alive and hanged again more than once that his arm was broken by a lochaber axe and that a torch was applied to the foot from which the shoe had fallen a pamphlet of 1787 says that robertson became a spy on smugglers in holland returned to london procured a pardon through the butcher cumberland and at last died in misery in london it is plain that colonel moyle might have rescued porteous but he was naturally cautious about entering the city gates without a written warrant from the civil authorities                             to the best of patrons                      a pleased and indulgent reader                             jedediah cleishbotham               wishes health and increase and contentment  courteous reader  if ingratitude comprehendeth every vice surely so foul a stain worst of all beseemeth him whose life has been devoted to instructing youth in virtue and in humane letters therefore have i chosen in this prolegomenon to unload my burden of thanks at thy feet for the favour with which thou last kindly entertained the tales of my landlord certes if thou hast chuckled over their factious and festivous descriptions or hadst thy mind filled with pleasure at the strange and pleasant turns of fortune which they record verily i have also simpered when i beheld a second storey with attics that has arisen on the basis of my small domicile at gandercleugh the walls having been aforehand pronounced by deacon barrow to be capable of enduring such an elevation nor has it been without delectation that i have endued a new coat snuffbrown and with metal buttons having all nether garments corresponding thereto we do therefore lie in respect of each other under a reciprocation of benefits whereof those received by me being the most solid in respect that a new house and a new coat are better than a new tale and an old song it is meet that my gratitude should be expressed with the louder voice and more preponderating vehemence and how should it be so expressedcertainly not in words only but in act and deed it is with this sole purpose and disclaiming all intention of purchasing that pendicle or poffle of land called the carlinescroft lying adjacent to my garden and measuring seven acres three roods and four perches that i have committed to the eyes of those who thought well of the former tomes these four additional volumes of the tales of my landlord not the less if peter prayfort be minded to sell the said poffle it is at his own choice to say so and peradventure he may meet with a purchaser unless gentle reader the pleasing pourtraictures of peter pattieson now given unto thee in particular and unto the public in general shall have lost their favour in thine eyes whereof i am no way distrustful and so much confidence do i repose in thy continued favour that should thy lawful occasions call thee to the town of gandercleugh a place frequented by most at one time or other in their lives i will enrich thine eyes with a sight of those precious manuscripts whence thou hast derived so much delectation thy nose with a snuff from my mull and thy palate with a dram from my bottle of strong waters called by the learned of gandercleugh the dominies dribble o drink  it is there o highly esteemed and beloved reader thou wilt be able to bear testimony through the medium of thine own senses against the children of vanity who have sought to identify thy friend and servant with i know not what inditer of vain fables who hath cumbered the world with his devices but shrunken from the responsibility thereof truly this hath been well termed a generation hard of faith since what can a man do to assert his property in a printed tome saving to put his name in the titlepage thereof with his description or designation as the lawyers term it and place of abode of a surety i would have such sceptics consider how they themselves would brook to have their works ascribed to others their names and professions imputed as forgeries and their very existence brought into question even although peradventure it may be it is of little consequence to any but themselves not only whether they are living or dead but even whether they ever lived or no yet have my maligners carried their uncharitable censures still farther  these cavillers have not only doubted mine identity although thus plainly proved but they have impeached my veracity and the authenticity of my historical narratives verily i can only say in answer that i have been cautelous in quoting mine authorities it is true indeed that if i had hearkened with only one ear i might have rehearsed my tale with more acceptation from those who love to hear but half the truth it is it may hap not altogether to the discredit of our kindly nation of scotland that we are apt to take an interest warm yea partial in the deeds and sentiments of our forefathers he whom his adversaries describe as a perjured prelatist is desirous that his predecessors should be held moderate in their power and just in their execution of its privileges when truly the unimpassioned peruser of the annals of those times shall deem them sanguinary violent and tyrannical again the representatives of the suffering nonconformists desire that their ancestors the cameronians shall be represented not simply as honest enthusiasts oppressed for conscience sake but persons of fine breeding and valiant heroes truly the historian cannot gratify these predilections he must needs describe the cavaliers as proud and highspirited cruel remorseless and vindictive the suffering party as honourably tenacious of their opinions under persecution their own tempers being however sullen fierce and rude their opinions absurd and extravagant and their whole course of conduct that of persons whom hellebore would better have suited than prosecutions unto death for hightreason natheless while such and so preposterous were the opinions on either side there were it cannot be doubted men of virtue and worth on both to entitle either party to claim merit from its martyrs it has been demanded of me jedediah cleishbotham by what right i am entitled to constitute myself an impartial judge of their discrepancies of opinions seeing as it is stated that i must necessarily have descended from one or other of the contending parties and be of course wedded for better or for worse according to the reasonable practice of scotland to its dogmata or opinions and bound as it were by the tie matrimonial or to speak without metaphor ex jure sanguinis to maintain them in preference to all others  but nothing denying the rationality of the rule which calls on all now living to rule their political and religious opinions by those of their greatgrandfathers and inevitable as seems the one or the other horn of the dilemma betwixt which my adversaries conceive they have pinned me to the wall i yet spy some means of refuge and claim a privilege to write and speak of both parties with impartiality for o ye powers of logic when the prelatists and presbyterians of old times went together by the ears in this unlucky country my ancestor venerated be his memory was one of the people called quakers and suffered severe handling from either side even to the extenuation of his purse and the incarceration of his person  craving thy pardon gentle reader for these few words concerning me and mine i rest as above expressed thy sure and obligated friend  j c gandercleugh this 1st of april 1818   note a authors connection with quakerism     introduction to the heart of midlothian1830   the author has stated in the preface to the chronicles of the canongate 1827 that he received from an anonymous correspondent an account of the incident upon which the following story is founded he is now at liberty to say that the information was conveyed to him by a late amiable and ingenious lady whose wit and power of remarking and judging of character still survive in the memory of her friends her maiden name was miss helen lawson of girthhead and she was wife of thomas goldie esq of craigmuie commissary of dumfries  her communication was in these words  i had taken for summer lodgings a cottage near the old abbey of lincluden it had formerly been inhabited by a lady who had pleasure in embellishing cottages which she found perhaps homely and even poor enough mine therefore possessed many marks of taste and elegance unusual in this species of habitation in scotland where a cottage is literally what its name declares  from my cottage door i had a partial view of the old abbey before mentioned some of the highest arches were seen over and some through the trees scattered along a lane which led down to the ruin and the strange fantastic shapes of almost all those old ashes accorded wonderfully well with the building they at once shaded and ornamented  the abbey itself from my door was almost on a level with the cottage but on coming to the end of the lane it was discovered to be situated on a high perpendicular bank at the foot of which run the clear waters of the cluden where they hasten to join the sweeping nith                   whose distant roaring swells and fas  as my kitchen and parlour were not very far distant i one day went in to purchase some chickens from a person i heard offering them for sale it was a little rather stoutlooking woman who seemed to be between seventy and eighty years of age she was almost covered with a tartan plaid and her cap had over it a black silk hood tied under the chin a piece of dress still much in use among elderly women of that rank of life in scotland her eyes were dark and remarkably lively and intelligent i entered into conversation with her and began by asking how she maintained herself etc  she said that in winter she footed stockings that is knit feet to countrypeoples stockings which bears about the same relation to stockingknitting that cobbling does to shoemaking and is of course both less profitable and less dignified she likewise taught a few children to read and in summer she whiles reared a few chickens  i said i could venture to guess from her face she had never been married she laughed heartily at this and said i maun hae the queerest face that ever was seen that ye could guess that now do tell me madam how ye cam to think sae i told her it was from her cheerful disengaged countenance she said mem have ye na far mair reason to be happy than me wi a gude husband and a fine family o bairns and plenty o everything for me im the puirest o a puir bodies and can hardly contrive to keep mysell alive in a the wee bits o ways i hae tellt ye after some more conversation during which i was more and more pleased with the old womans sensible conversation and the naivete of her remarks she rose to go away when i asked her name her countenance suddenly clouded and she said gravely rather colouring my name is helen walker but your husband kens weel about me  in the evening i related how much i had been pleased and inquired what was extraordinary in the history of the poor woman mr  said there were perhaps few more remarkable people than helen walker she had been left an orphan with the charge of a sister considerably younger than herself and who was educated and maintained by her exertions attached to herby so many ties therefore it will not be easy to conceive her feelings when she found that this only sister must be tried by the laws of her country for childmurder and upon being called as principal witness against her the counsel for the prisoner told helen that if she could declare that her sister had made any preparations however slight or had given her any intimation on the subject that such a statement would save her sisters life as she was the principal witness against her helen said it is impossible for me to swear to a falsehood and whatever may be the consequence i will give my oath according to my conscience  the trial came on and the sister was found guilty and condemned but in scotland six weeks must elapse between the sentence and the execution and helen walker availed herself of it the very day of her sisters condemnation she got a petition drawn stating the peculiar circumstances of the case and that very night set out on foot to london  without introduction or recommendation with her simple perhaps illexpressed petition drawn up by some inferior clerk of the court she presented herself in her tartan plaid and country attire to the late duke of argyle who immediately procured the pardon she petitioned for and helen returned with it on foot just in time to save her sister  i was so strongly interested by this narrative that i determined immediately to prosecute my acquaintance with helen walker but as i was to leave the country next day i was obliged to defer it till my return in spring when the first walk i took was to helen walkers cottage  she had died a short time before my regret was extreme and i endeavoured to obtain some account of helen from an old woman who inhabited the other end of her cottage i inquired if helen ever spoke of her past historyher journey to london etc na the old woman said helen was a wily body and wheneer ony o the neebors asked anything about it she aye turned the conversation  in short every answer i received only tended to increase my regret and raise my opinion of helen walker who could unite so much prudence with so much heroic virtue  this narrative was inclosed in the following letter to the author without date or signature  sirthe occurrence just related happened to me twentysix years ago helen walker lies buried in the churchyard of irongray about six miles from dumfries i once proposed that a small monument should have been erected to commemorate so remarkable a character but i now prefer leaving it to you to perpetuate her memory in a more durable manner  the reader is now able to judge how far the author has improved upon or fallen short of the pleasing and interesting sketch of high principle and steady affection displayed by helen walker the prototype of the fictitious jeanie deans mrs goldie was unfortunately dead before the author had given his name to these volumes so he lost all opportunity of thanking that lady for her highly valuable communication but her daughter miss goldie obliged him with the following additional information  mrs goldie endeavoured to collect further particulars of helen walker particularly concerning her journey to london but found this nearly impossible as the natural dignity of her character and a high sense of family respectability made her so indissolubly connect her sisters disgrace with her own exertions that none of her neighbours durst ever question her upon the subject one old woman a distant relation of helens and who is still living says she worked an harvest with her but that she never ventured to ask her about her sisters trial or her journey to london helen she added was a lofty body and used a high style o language the same old woman says that every year helen received a cheese from her sister who lived at whitehaven and that she always sent a liberal portion of it to herself or to her fathers family this fact though trivial in itself strongly marks the affection subsisting between the two sisters and the complete conviction on the mind of the criminal that her sister had acted solely from high principle not from any want of feeling which another small but characteristic trait will further illustrate a gentleman a relation of mrs goldies who happened to be travelling in the north of england on coming to a small inn was shown into the parlour by a female servant who after cautiously shutting the door said sir im nelly walkers sister thus practically showing that she considered her sister as better known by her high conduct than even herself by a different kind of celebrity  mrs goldie was extremely anxious to have a tombstone and an inscription upon it erected in irongray churchyard and if sir walter scott will condescend to write the last a little subscription could be easily raised in the immediate neighbourhood and mrs goldies wish be thus fulfilled  it is scarcely necessary to add that the request of miss goldie will be most willingly complied with and without the necessity of any tax on the public nor is there much occasion to repeat how much the author conceives himself obliged to his unknown correspondent who thus supplied him with a theme affording such a pleasing view of the moral dignity of virtue though unaided by birth beauty or talent if the picture has suffered in the execution it is from the failure of the authors powers to present in detail the same simple and striking portrait exhibited in mrs goldies letter  abbotsford april 1 1830   note b tombstone to helen walker     postscript   although it would be impossible to add much to mrs goldies picturesque and most interesting account of helen walker the prototype of the imaginary jeanie deans the editor may be pardoned for introducing two or three anecdotes respecting that excellent person which he has collected from a volume entitled sketches from nature by john mdiarmid a gentleman who conducts an able provincial paper in the town of dumfries  helen was the daughter of a small farmer in a place called dalwhairn in the parish of irongray where after the death of her father she continued with the unassuming piety of a scottish peasant to support her mother by her own unremitted labour and privations a case so common that even yet i am proud to say few of my countrywomen would shrink from the duty  helen walker was held among her equals pensy that is proud or conceited but the facts brought to prove this accusation seem only to evince a strength of character superior to those around her thus it was remarked that when it thundered she went with her work and her bible to the front of the cottage alleging that the almighty could smite in the city as well as in the field  mr mdiarmid mentions more particularly the misfortune of her sister which he supposes to have taken place previous to 1736 helen walker declining every proposal of saving her relations life at the expense of truth borrowed a sum of money sufficient for her journey walked the whole distance to london barefoot and made her way to john duke of argyle she was heard to say that by the almighty strength she had been enabled to meet the duke at the most critical moment which if lost would have caused the inevitable forfeiture of her sisters life  isabella or tibby walker saved from the fate which impended over her was married by the person who had wronged her named waugh and lived happily for great part of a century uniformly acknowledging the extraordinary affection to which she owed her preservation  helen walker died about the end of the year 1791 and her remains are interred in the churchyard of her native parish of irongray in a romantic cemetery on the banks of the cairn that a character so distinguished for her undaunted love of virtue lived and died in poverty if not want

pattieson than in the rapid conveyance of intelligence and communication betwixt one part of scotland and another it is not above twenty or thirty years according to the evidence of many credible witnesses now alive since a little miserable horsecart performing with difficulty a journey of thirty miles per diem carried our mails from the capital of scotland to its extremity nor was scotland much more deficient in these accommodations than our rich sister had been about eighty years before fielding in his tom jones and farquhar in a little farce called the stagecoach have ridiculed the slowness of these vehicles of public accommodation according to the latter authority the highest bribe could only induce the coachman to promise to anticipate by halfanhour the usual time of his arrival at the bull and mouth  but in both countries these ancient slow and sure modes of conveyance are now alike unknown mailcoach races against mailcoach and highflyer against highflyer through the most remote districts of britain and in our village alone three postcoaches and four coaches with men armed and in scarlet cassocks thunder through the streets each day and rival in brilliancy and noise the invention of the celebrated tyrant                demens qui nimbos et non imitabile fulmen              aere et cornipedum pulsu simularat equorum  now and then to complete the resemblance and to correct the presumption of the venturous charioteers it does happen that the career of these dashing rivals of salmoneus meets with as undesirable and violent a termination as that of their prototype it is on such occasions that the insides and outsides to use the appropriate vehicular phrases have reason to rue the exchange of the slow and safe motion of the ancient flycoaches which compared with the chariots of mr palmer so ill deserve the name the ancient vehicle used to settle quietly down like a ship scuttled and left to sink by the gradual influx of the waters while the modern is smashed to pieces with the velocity of the same vessel hurled against breakers or rather with the fury of a bomb bursting at the conclusion of its career through the air the late ingenious mr pennant whose humour it was to set his face in stern opposition to these speedy conveyances had collected i have heard a formidable list of such casualties which joined to the imposition of innkeepers whose charges the passengers had no time to dispute the sauciness of the coachman and the uncontrolled and despotic authority of the tyrant called the guard held forth a picture of horror to which murder theft fraud and peculation lent all their dark colouring but that which gratifies the impatience of the human disposition will be practised in the teeth of danger and in defiance of

             the rattling of the unscythed car  and perhaps the echoes of ben nevis may soon be awakened by the bugle not of a warlike chieftain but of the guard of a mailcoach  it was a fine summer day and our little school had obtained a halfholiday by the intercession of a goodhumoured visitor   his honour gilbert goslinn of gandercleugh for i love to be precise in matters of importancej c  i expected by the coach a new number of an interesting periodical publication and walked forward on the highway to meet it with the impatience which cowper has described as actuating the resident in the country when longing for intelligence from the mart of news                                        the grand debate                     the popular haranguethe tart reply                     the logic and the wisdom and the wit                     and the loud laughi long to know them all                     i burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free                     and give them voice and utterance again  it was with such feelings that i eyed the approach of the new coach lately established on our road and known by the name of the somerset which to say truth possesses some interest for me even when it conveys no such important information the distant tremulous sound of its wheels was heard just as i gained the summit of the gentle ascent called the goslinbrae from which you command an extensive view down the valley of the river gander the public road which comes up the side of that stream and crosses it at a bridge about a quarter of a mile from the place where i was standing runs partly through enclosures and plantations and partly through open pasture land it is a childish amusement perhapsbut my life has been spent with children and why should not my pleasures be like theirschildish as it is then i must own i have had great pleasure in watching the approach of the carriage where the openings of the road permit it to be seen the gay glancing of the equipage its diminished and toylike appearance at a distance contrasted with the rapidity of its motion its appearance and disappearance at intervals and the progressively increasing sounds that announce its nearer approach have all to the idle and listless spectator who has nothing more important to attend to something of awakening interest the ridicule may attach to me which is flung upon many an honest citizen who watches from the window of his villa the passage of the stagecoach but it is a very natural source of amusement notwithstanding and many of those who join in the laugh are perhaps not unused to resort to it in secret  on the present occasion however fate had decreed that i should not enjoy the consummation of the amusement by seeing the coach rattle past me as i sat on the turf and hearing the hoarse grating voice of the guard as he skimmed forth for my grasp the expected packet without the carriage checking its course for an instant i had seen the vehicle thunder down the hill that leads to the bridge with more than its usual impetuosity glittering all the while by flashes from a cloudy tabernacle of the dust which it had raised and leaving a train behind it on the road resembling a wreath of summer mist but it did not appear on the top of the nearer bank within the usual space of three minutes which frequent observation had enabled me to ascertain was the medium time for crossing the bridge and mounting the ascent when double that space had elapsed i became alarmed and walked hastily forward as i came in sight of the bridge the cause of delay was too manifest for the somerset had made a summerset in good earnest and overturned so completely that it was literally resting upon the ground with the roof undermost and the four wheels in the air the exertions of the guard and coachman both of whom were gratefully commemorated in the newspapers having succeeded in disentangling the horses by cutting the harness were now proceeding to extricate the insides by a sort of summary and caesarean process of delivery forcing the hinges from one of the doors which they could not open otherwise in this manner were two disconsolate damsels set at liberty from the womb of the leathern conveniency as they immediately began to settle their clothes which were a little deranged as may be presumed i concluded they had received no injury and did not venture to obtrude my services at their toilette for which i understand i have since been reflected upon by the fair sufferers the outsides who must have been discharged from their elevated situation by a shock resembling the springing of a mine escaped nevertheless with the usual allowance of scratches and bruises excepting three who having been pitched into the river gander were dimly seen contending with the tide like the relics of aeneass shipwreck                    rari apparent mantes in gurgite vasto  i applied my poor exertions where they seemed to be most needed and with the assistance of one or two of the company who had escaped unhurt easily succeeded in fishing out two of the unfortunate passengers who were stout active young fellows and but for the preposterous length of their greatcoats and the equally fashionable latitude and longitude of their wellington trousers would have required little assistance from any one the third was sickly and elderly and might have perished but for the efforts used to preserve him  when the two greatcoated gentlemen had extricated themselves from the river and shaken their ears like huge waterdogs a violent altercation ensued betwixt them and the coachman and guard concerning the cause of their overthrow in the course of the squabble i observed that both my new acquaintances belonged to the law and that their professional sharpness was likely to prove an overmatch for the surly and official tone of the guardians of the vehicle the dispute ended in the guard assuring the passengers that they should have seats in a heavy coach which would pass that spot in less than halfanhour provided it were not full chance seemed to favour this arrangement for when the expected vehicle arrived there were only two places occupied in a carriage which professed to carry six the two ladies who had been disinterred out of the fallen vehicle were readily admitted but positive objections were stated by those previously in possession to the admittance of the two lawyers whose wetted garments being much of the nature of wellsoaked sponges there was every reason to believe they would refund a considerable part of the water they had collected to the inconvenience of their fellowpassengers on the other hand the lawyers rejected a seat on the roof alleging that they had only taken that station for pleasure for one stage but were entitled in all respects to free egress and regress from the interior to which their contract positively referred after some altercation in which something was said upon the edict nautae caupones stabularii the coach went off leaving the learned gentlemen to abide by their action of damages  they immediately applied to me to guide them to the next village and the best inn and from the account i gave them of the wallace head declared they were much better pleased to stop there than to go forward upon the terms of that impudent scoundrel the guard of the somerset all that they now wanted was a lad to carry their travelling bags who was easily procured from an adjoining cottage and they prepared to walk forward when they found there was another passenger in the same deserted situation with themselves this was the elderly and sicklylooking person who had been precipitated into the river along with the two young lawyers he it seems had been too modest to push his own plea against the coachman when he saw that of his betters rejected and now remained behind with a look of timid anxiety plainly intimating that he was deficient in those means of recommendation which are necessary passports to the hospitality of an inn  i ventured to call the attention of the two dashing young blades for such they seemed to the desolate condition of their fellowtraveller they took the hint with ready goodnature  o true mr dunover said one of the youngsters you must not remain on the pave here you must go and have some dinner with ushalkit and i must have a postchaise to go on at all events and we will set you down wherever suits you best  the poor man for such his dress as well as his diffidence bespoke him made the sort of acknowledging bow by which says a scotsman its too much honour for the like of me and followed humbly behind his gay patrons all three besprinkling the dusty road as they walked along with the moisture of their drenched garments and exhibiting the singular and somewhat ridiculous appearance of three persons suffering from the opposite extreme of humidity while the summer sun was at its height and everything else around them had the expression of heat and drought the ridicule did not escape the young gentlemen themselves and they had made what might be received as one or two tolerable jests on the subject before they had advanced far on their peregrination  we cannot complain like cowley said one of them that gideons fleece remains dry while all around is moist this is the reverse of the miracle  we ought to be received with gratitude in this good town we bring a supply of what they seem to need most said halkit  and distribute it with unparalleled generosity replied his companion performing the part of three watercarts for the benefit of their dusty roads  we come before them too said halkit in full professional forcecounsel and agent  and client said the young advocate looking behind him and then added lowering his voice that looks as if he had kept such dangerous company too long  it was indeed too true that the humble follower of the gay young men had the threadbare appearance of a wornout litigant and i could not but smile at the conceit though anxious to conceal my mirth from the object of it  when we arrived at the wallace inn the elder of the edinburgh gentlemen and whom i understood to be a barrister insisted that i should remain and take part of their dinner and their inquiries and demands speedily put my landlord and his whole family in motion to produce the best cheer which the larder and cellar afforded and proceed to cook it to the best advantage a science in which our entertainers seemed to be admirably skilled in other respects they were lively young men in the heyday of youth and good spirits playing the part which is common to the higher classes of the law at edinburgh and which nearly resembles that of the young templars in the days of steele and addison an air of giddy gaiety mingled with the good sense taste and information which their conversation exhibited and it seemed to be their object to unite the character of men of fashion and lovers of the polite arts a fine gentleman bred up in the thorough idleness and inanity of pursuit which i understand is absolutely necessary to the character in perfection might in all probability have traced a tinge of professional pedantry which marked the barrister in spite of his efforts and something of active bustle in his companion and would certainly have detected more than a fashionable mixture of information and animated interest in the language of both but to me who had no pretensions to be so critical my companions seemed to form a very happy mixture of goodbreeding and liberal information with a disposition to lively rattle pun and jest amusing to a grave man because it is what he himself can least easily command  the thin palefaced man whom their goodnature had brought into their society looked out of place as well as out of spirits sate on the edge of his seat and kept the chair at two feet distance from the table thus incommoding himself considerably in conveying the victuals to his mouth as if by way of penance for partaking of them in the company of his superiors a short time after dinner declining all entreaty to partake of the wine which circulated freely round he informed himself of the hour when the chaise had been ordered to attend and saying he would be in readiness modestly withdrew from the apartment  jack said the barrister to his companion i remember that poor fellows face you spoke more truly than you were aware of he really is one of my clients poor man  poor man echoed halkiti suppose you mean he is your one and only client  thats not my fault jack replied the other whose name i discovered was hardie you are to give me all your business you know and if you have none the learned gentleman here knows nothing can come of nothing  you seem to have brought something to nothing though in the case of that honest man he looks as if he were just about to honour with his residence the heart of midlothian  you are mistakenhe is just delivered from itour friend here looks for an explanation pray mr pattieson have you been in edinburgh  i answered in the affirmative  then you must have passed occasionally at least though probably not so faithfully as i am doomed to do through a narrow intricate passage leading out of the northwest corner of the parliament square and passing by a high and antique building with turrets and iron grates                           making good the saying odd                          near the church and far from god  mr halkit broke in upon his learned counsel to contribute his moiety to the riddlehaving at the door the sign of the red man  and being on the whole resumed the counsellor interrupting his friend in his turn a sort of place where misfortune is happily confounded with guilt where all who are in wish to get out  and where none who have the good luck to be out wish to get in added his companion  i conceive you gentlemen replied i you mean the prison  the prison added the young lawyeryou have hit itthe very reverend tolbooth itself and let me tell you you are obliged to us for describing it with so much modesty and brevity for with whatever amplifications we might have chosen to decorate the subject you lay entirely at our mercy since the fathers conscript of our city have decreed that the venerable edifice itself shall not remain in existence to confirm or to confute its  then the tolbooth of edinburgh is called the heart of midlothian said i  so termed and reputed i assure you  i think said i with the bashful diffidence with which a man lets slip a pun in presence of his superiors the metropolitan county may in that case be said to have a sad heart  right as my glove mr pattieson added mr hardie and a close heart and a hard heartkeep it up jack  and a wicked heart and a poor heart answered halkit doing his best  and yet it may be called in some sort a strong heart and a high heart rejoined the advocate you see i can put you both out of heart  i have played all my hearts said the younger gentleman  then well have another lead answered his companionand as to the old and condemned tolbooth what pity the same honour cannot be done to it as has been done to many of its inmates why should not the tolbooth have its last speech confession and dying words the old stones would be just as conscious of the honour as many a poor devil who has dangled like a tassel at the west end of it while the hawkers were shouting a confession the culprit had never heard of  i am afraid said i if i might presume to give my opinion it would be a tale of unvaried sorrow and guilt  not entirely my friend said hardie a prison is a world within itself and has its own business griefs and joys peculiar to its circle its inmates are sometimes shortlived but so are soldiers on service they are poor relatively to the world without but there are degrees of wealth and poverty among them and so some are relatively rich also they cannot stir abroad but neither can the garrison of a besieged fort or the crew of a ship at sea and they are not under a dispensation quite so desperate as either for they may have as much food as they have money to buy and are not obliged to work whether they have food or not  but what variety of incident said i not without a secret view to my present task could possibly be derived from such a work as you are pleased to talk of  infinite replied the young advocate whatever of guilt crime imposture folly unheardof misfortunes and unlookedfor change of fortune can be found to chequer life my last speech of the tolbooth should illustrate with examples sufficient to gorge even the publics alldevouring appetite for the wonderful and horrible the inventor of fictitious narratives has to rack his brains for means to diversify his tale and after all can hardly hit upon characters or incidents which have not been used again and again until they are familiar to the eye of the reader so that the development enlevement the desperate wound of which the hero never dies the burning fever from which the heroine is sure to recover become a mere matter of course i join with my honest friend crabbe and have an unlucky propensity to hope when hope is lost and to rely upon the corkjacket which carries the heroes of romance safe through all the billows of affliction he then declaimed the following passage rather with too much than too little emphasis                  much have i feared but am no more afraid                when some chaste beauty by some wretch betrayed                is drawn away with such distracted speed                that she anticipates a dreadful deed                not so do ilet solid walls impound                the captive fair and dig a moat around                let there be brazen locks and bars of steel                and keepers cruel such as never feel                with not a single note the purse supply                and when she begs let men and maids deny                be windows there from which she dare not fall                and help so distant tis in vain to call                still means of freedom will some power devise                and from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize  the end of uncertainty he concluded is the death of interest and hence it happens that no one now reads novels  hear him ye gods returned his companion i assure you mr pattieson you will hardly visit this learned gentleman but you are likely to find the new novel most in repute lying on his tablesnugly intrenched however beneath stairs institutes or an open volume of morrisons decisions  do i deny it said the hopeful jurisconsult or wherefore should i since it is well known these delilahs seduce my wisers and my betters may they not be found lurking amidst the multiplied memorials of our most distinguished counsel and even peeping from under the cushion of a judges armchair our seniors at the bar within the bar and even on the bench read novels and if not belied some of them have written novels into the bargain i only say that i read from habit and from indolence not from real interest that like ancient pistol devouring his leek i read and swear till i get to the end of the narrative but not so in the real records of human vagariesnot so in the state trials or in the books of adjournal where every now and then you read new pages of the human heart and turns of fortune far beyond what the boldest novelist ever attempted to produce from the coinage of his brain  and for such narratives i asked you suppose the history of the prison of edinburgh might afford appropriate materials  in a degree unusually ample my dear sir said hardiefill your glass however in the meanwhile was it not for many years the place in which the scottish parliament met was it not jamess place of refuge when the mob inflamed by a seditious preacher broke forth on him with the cries of the sword of the lord and of gideonbring forth the wicked haman since that time how many hearts have throbbed within these walls as the tolling of the neighbouring bell announced to them how fast the sands of their life were ebbing how many must have sunk at the soundhow many were supported by stubborn pride and dogged resolutionhow many by the consolations of religion have there not been some who looking back on the motives of their crimes were scarce able to understand how they should have had such temptation as to seduce them from virtue and have there not perhaps been others who sensible of their innocence were divided between indignation at the undeserved doom which they were to undergo consciousness that they had not deserved it and racking anxiety to discover some way in which they might yet vindicate themselves do you suppose any of these deep powerful and agitating feelings can be recorded and perused without exciting a corresponding depth of deep powerful and agitating interestoh do but wait till i publish the causes celebres of caledonia and you will find no want of a novel or a tragedy for some time to come the true thing will triumph over the brightest inventions of the most ardent imagination magna est veritas et praevalebit  i have understood said i encouraged by the affability of my rattling entertainer that less of this interest must attach to scottish jurisprudence than to that of any other country the general morality of our people their sober and prudent habits  secure them said the barrister against any great increase of professional thieves and depredators but not against wild and wayward starts of fancy and passion producing crimes of an extraordinary description which are precisely those to the detail of which we listen with thrilling interest england has been much longer a highly civilised country her subjects have been very strictly amenable to laws administered without fear or favour a complete division of labour has taken place among her subjects and the very thieves and robbers form a distinct class in society subdivided among themselves according to the subject of the depredations and the mode in which they carry them on acting upon regular habits and principles which can be calculated and anticipated at bow street hatton garden or the old bailey our sister kingdom is like a cultivated fieldthe farmer expects that in spite of all his care a certain number of weeds will rise with the corn and can tell you beforehand their names and appearance but scotland is like one of her own highland glens and the moralist who reads the records of her criminal jurisprudence will find as many curious anomalous facts in the history of mind as the botanist will detect rare specimens among her dingles and cliffs  and thats all the good you have obtained from three perusals of the commentaries on scottish criminal jurisprudence said his companion i suppose the learned author very little thinks that the facts which his erudition and acuteness have accumulated for the illustration of legal doctrines might be so arranged as to form a sort of appendix to the halfbound and slipshod volumes of the circulating library  ill bet you a pint of claret said the elder lawyer that he will not feel sore at the comparison but as we say at the bar i beg i may not be interrupted i have much more to say upon my scottish collection of causes celebres you will please recollect the scope and motive given for the contrivance and execution of many extraordinary and daring crimes by the long civil dissensions of scotlandby the hereditary jurisdictions which until 1748 rested the investigation of crises in judges ignorant partial or interestedby the habits of the gentry shut up in their distant and solitary mansionhouses nursing their revengeful passions just to keep their blood from stagnatingnot to mention that amiable national qualification called the perfervidum ingenium scotorum which our lawyers join in alleging as a reason for the severity of some of our enactments when i come to treat of matters so mysterious deep and dangerous as these circumstances have given rise to the blood of each reader shall be curdled and his epidermis crisped into goose skinbut histhere comes the landlord with tidings i suppose that the chaise is ready  it was no such thingthe tidings bore that no chaise could be had that evening for sir peter plyem had carried forward my landlords two pairs of horses that morning to the ancient royal borough of bubbleburgh to look after his interest there but as bubbleburgh is only one of a set of five boroughs which club their shares for a member of parliament sir peters adversary had judiciously watched his departure in order to commence a canvass in the no less royal borough of bitem which as all the world knows lies at the very termination of sir peters avenue and has been held in leadingstrings by him and his ancestors for time immemorial now sir peter was thus placed in the situation of an ambitious monarch who after having commenced a daring inroad into his enemys territories is suddenly recalled by an invasion of his own hereditary dominions he was obliged in consequence to return from the halfwon borough of bubbleburgh to look after the halflost borough of bitem and the two pairs of horses which had carried him that morning to bubbleburgh were now forcibly detained to transport him his agent his valet his jester and his harddrinker across the country to bitem the cause of this detention which to me was of as little consequence as it may be to the reader was important enough to my companions to reconcile them to the delay like eagles they smelled the battle afar off ordered a magnum of claret and beds at the wallace and entered at full career into the bubbleburgh and bitem politics with all the probable petitions and complaints to which they were likely to give rise  in the midst of an anxious animated and to me most unintelligible discussion concerning provosts bailies deacons sets of boroughs leets townclerks burgesses resident and nonresident all of a sudden the lawyer recollected himself poor dunover we must not forget him and the landlord was despatched in quest of the pauvre honteux with an earnestly civil invitation to him for the rest of the evening i could not help asking the young gentlemen if they knew the history of this poor man and the counsellor applied himself to his pocket to recover the memorial or brief from which he had stated his cause  he has been a candidate for our remedium miserabile said mr hardie commonly called a cessio bonorum as there are divines who have doubted the eternity of future punishments so the scotch lawyers seem to have thought that the crime of poverty might be atoned for by something short of perpetual imprisonment after a months confinement you must know a prisoner for debt is entitled on a sufficient statement to our supreme court setting forth the amount of his funds and the nature of his misfortunes and surrendering all his effects to his creditors to claim to be discharged from prison  i had heard i replied of such a humane regulation  yes said halkit and the beauty of it is as the foreign fellow said you may get the cessio when the bonorums are all spentbut what are you puzzling in your pockets to seek your only memorial among old playbills letters requesting a meeting of the faculty rules of the speculative society syllabus of lecturesall the miscellaneous contents of a young advocates pocket which contains everything but briefs and banknotes   a wellknown debating club in edinburgh  can you not state a case of cessio without your memorial why it is done every saturday the events follow each other as regularly as clockwork and one form of condescendence might suit every one of them  this is very unlike the variety of distress which this gentleman stated to fall under the consideration of your judges said i  true replied halkit but hardie spoke of criminal jurisprudence and this business is purely civil i could plead a cessio myself without the inspiring honours of a gown and threetailed periwiglistenmy client was bred a journeyman weavermade some little moneytook a farmfor conducting a farm like driving a

your lordships will please grant commission to take his oath  hardie now renounced this ineffectual search in which there was perhaps a little affectation and told us the tale of poor dunovers distresses with a tone in which a degree of feeling which he seemed ashamed of as unprofessional mingled with his attempts at wit and did him more honour it was one of those tales which seem to argue a sort of illluck or fatality attached to the hero a wellinformed industrious and blameless but poor and bashful man had in vain essayed all the usual means by which others acquire independence yet had never succeeded beyond the attainment of bare subsistence during a brief gleam of hope rather than of actual prosperity he had added a wife and family to his cares but the dawn was speedily overcast everything retrograded with him towards the verge of the miry slough of despond which yawns for insolvent debtors and after catching at each twig and experiencing the protracted agony of feeling them one by one elude his grasp he actually sunk into the miry pit whence he had been extricated by the professional exertions of hardie  and i suppose now you have dragged this poor devil ashore you will leave him half naked on the beach to provide for himself said halkit hark yeand he whispered something in his ear of which the penetrating and insinuating words interest with my lord alone reached mine  it is pessimi exempli said hardie laughing to provide for a ruined client but i was thinking of what you mention provided it can be managedbut hush here he comes  the recent relation of the poor mans misfortunes had given him i was pleased to observe a claim to the attention and respect of the young men who treated him with great civility and gradually engaged him in a conversation which much to my satisfaction again turned upon the causes celebres of scotland imboldened by the kindness with which he was treated mr dunover began to contribute his share to the amusement of the evening jails like other places have their ancient traditions known only to the inhabitants and handed down from one set of the melancholy lodgers to the next who occupy their cells some of these which dunover mentioned were interesting and served to illustrate the narratives of remarkable trials which hardie had at his fingerends and which his companion was also well skilled in this sort of conversation passed away the evening till the early hour when mr dunover chose to retire to rest and i also retreated to take down memorandums of what i had learned in order to add another narrative to those which it had been my chief amusement to collect and to write out in detail the two young men ordered a broiled bone madeira negus and a pack of cards and commenced a game at picquet  next morning the travellers left gandercleugh i afterwards learned from the papers that both have been since engaged in the great political cause of bubbleburgh and bitem a summary case and entitled to particular despatch but which it is thought nevertheless may outlast the duration of the parliament to which the contest refers mr halkit as the newspapers informed me acts as agent or solicitor and mr hardie opened for sir peter plyem with singular ability and to such good purpose that i understand he has since had fewer playbills and more briefs in his pocket and both the young gentlemen deserve their good fortune for i learned from dunover who called on me some weeks afterwards and communicated the intelligence with tears in his eyes that their interest had availed to obtain him a small office for the decent maintenance of his family and that after a train of constant and uninterrupted misfortune he could trace a dawn of prosperity to his having the good fortune to be flung from the top of a mailcoach into the river gander in company with an advocate and a writer to the signet the reader will not perhaps deem himself equally obliged to the accident since it brings upon him the following narrative founded upon the conversation of the evening     the heart of midlothian     chapter first                  whoeers been at paris must needs know the greve                the fatal retreat of the unfortunate brave                where honour and justice most oddly contribute                to ease heroes pains by an halter and gibbet                 there death breaks the shackles which force had put on                and the hangman completes what the judge but began                there the squire of the poet and knight of the post                find their pains no more baulked and their hopes no more                crossed                                                 prior  in former times england had her tyburn to which the devoted victims of justice were conducted in solemn procession up what is now called oxford street in edinburgh a large open street or rather oblong square surrounded by high houses called the grassmarket was used for the same melancholy purpose it was not ill chosen for such a scene being of considerable extent and therefore fit to accommodate a great number of spectators such as are usually assembled by this melancholy spectacle on the other hand few of the houses which surround it were even in early times inhabited by persons of fashion so that those likely to be offended or over deeply affected by such unpleasant exhibitions were not in the way of having their quiet disturbed by them the houses in the grassmarket are generally speaking of a mean description yet the place is not without some features of grandeur being overhung by the southern side of the huge rock on which the castle stands and by the mossgrown battlements and turreted walls of that ancient fortress  it was the custom until within these thirty years or thereabouts to use this esplanade for the scene of public executions the fatal day was announced to the public by the appearance of a huge black gallowstree towards the eastern end of the grassmarket this illomened apparition was of great height with a scaffold surrounding it and a double ladder placed against it for the ascent of the unhappy criminal and executioner as this apparatus was always arranged before dawn it seemed as if the gallows had grown out of the earth in the course of one night like the production of some foul demon and i well remember the fright with which the schoolboys when i was one of their number used to regard these ominous signs of deadly preparation on the night after the execution the gallows again disappeared and was conveyed in silence and darkness to the place where it was usually deposited which was one of the vaults under the parliament house or courts of justice this mode of execution is now exchanged for one similar to that in front of newgatewith what beneficial effect is uncertain the mental sufferings of the convict are indeed shortened he no longer stalks between the attendant clergymen dressed in his graveclothes through a considerable part of the city looking like a moving and walking corpse while yet an inhabitant of this world but as the ultimate purpose of punishment has in view the prevention of crimes it may at least be doubted whether in abridging the melancholy ceremony we have not in part diminished that appalling effect upon the spectators which is the useful end of all such inflictions and in consideration of which alone unless in very particular cases capital sentences can be altogether justified  on the 7th day of september 1736 these ominous preparations for execution were descried in the place we have described and at an early hour the space around began to be occupied by several groups who gazed on the scaffold and gibbet with a stern and vindictive show of satisfaction very seldom testified by the populace whose good nature in most cases forgets the crime of the condemned person and dwells only on his misery but the act of which the expected culprit had been convicted was of a description calculated nearly and closely to awaken and irritate the resentful feelings of the multitude the tale is well known yet it is necessary to recapitulate its leading circumstances for the better understanding what is to follow and the narrative may prove long but i trust not uninteresting even to those who have heard its general issue at any rate some detail is necessary in order to render intelligible the subsequent events of our narrative  contraband trade though it strikes at the root of legitimate government by encroaching on its revenuesthough it injures the fair trader and debauches the mind of those engaged in itis not usually looked upon either by the vulgar or by their betters in a very heinous point of view on the contrary in those countries where it prevails the cleverest boldest and most intelligent of the peasantry are uniformly engaged in illicit transactions and very often with the sanction of the farmers and inferior gentry smuggling was almost universal in scotland in the reigns of george i and ii for the people unaccustomed to imposts and regarding them as an unjust aggression upon their ancient liberties made no scruple to elude them whenever it was possible to do so  the county of fife bounded by two firths on the south and north and by the sea on the east and having a number of small seaports was long famed for maintaining successfully a contraband trade and as there were many seafaring men residing there who had been pirates and buccaneers in their youth there were not wanting a sufficient number of daring men to carry it on among these a fellow called andrew wilson originally a baker in the village of pathhead was particularly obnoxious to the revenue officers he was possessed of great personal strength courage and cunningwas perfectly acquainted with the coast and capable of conducting the most desperate enterprises on several occasions he succeeded in baffling the pursuit and researches of the kings officers but he became so much the object of their suspicions and watchful attention that at length he was totally ruined by repeated seizures the man became desperate he considered himself as robbed and plundered and took it into his head that he had a right to make reprisals as he could find opportunity where the heart is prepared for evil opportunity is seldom long wanting this wilson learned that the collector of the customs at kirkcaldy had come to pittenweem in the course of his official round of duty with a considerable sum of public money in his custody as the amount was greatly within the value of the goods which had been seized from him wilson felt no scruple of conscience in resolving to reimburse himself for his losses at the expense of the collector and the revenue he associated with himself one robertson and two other idle young men whom having been concerned in the same illicit trade he persuaded to view the transaction in the same justifiable light in which he himself considered it they watched the motions of the collector they broke forcibly into the house where he lodgedwilson with two of his associates entering the collectors apartment while robertson the fourth kept watch at the door with a drawn cutlass in his hand the officer of the customs conceiving his life in danger escaped out of his bedroom window and fled in his shirt so that the plunderers with much ease possessed themselves of about two hundred pounds of public money the robbery was committed in a very audacious manner for several persons were passing in the street at the time but robertson representing the noise they heard as a dispute or fray betwixt the collector and the people of the house the worthy citizens of pittenweem felt themselves no way called on to interfere in behalf of the obnoxious revenue officer so satisfying themselves with this very superficial account of the matter like the levite in the parable they passed on the opposite side of the way an alarm was at length given military were called in the depredators were pursued the booty recovered and wilson and robertson tried and condemned to death chiefly on the evidence of an accomplice  many thought that in consideration of the mens erroneous opinion of the nature of the action they had committed justice might have been satisfied with a less forfeiture than that of two lives on the other hand from the audacity of the fact a severe example was judged necessary and such was the opinion of the government when it became apparent that the sentence of death was to be executed files and other implements necessary for their escape were transmitted secretly to the culprits by a friend from without by these means they sawed a bar out of one of the prisonwindows and might have made their escape but for the obstinacy of wilson who as he was daringly resolute was doggedly pertinacious of his opinion his comrade robertson a young and slender man proposed to make the experiment of passing the foremost through the gap they had made and enlarging it from the outside if necessary to allow wilson free passage wilson however insisted on making the first experiment and being a robust and lusty man he not only found it impossible to get through betwixt the bars but by his struggles he jammed himself so fast that he was unable to draw his body back again in these circumstances discovery became unavoidable and sufficient precautions were taken by the jailor to prevent any repetition of the same attempt robertson uttered not a word of reflection on his companion for the consequences of his obstinacy but it appeared from the sequel that wilsons mind was deeply impressed with the recollection that but for him his comrade over whose mind he exercised considerable influence would not have engaged in the criminal enterprise which had terminated thus fatally and that now he had become his destroyer a second time since but for his obstinacy robertson might have effected his escape minds like wilsons even when exercised in evil practices sometimes retain the power of thinking and resolving with enthusiastic generosity his whole thoughts were now bent on the possibility of saving robertsons life without the least respect to his own the resolution which he adopted and the manner in which he carried it into effect were striking and unusual  adjacent to the tolbooth or city jail of edinburgh is one of three churches into which the cathedral of st giles is now divided called from its vicinity the tolbooth church it was the custom that criminals under sentence of death were brought to this church with a sufficient guard to hear and join in public worship on the sabbath before execution it was supposed that the hearts of these unfortunate persons however hardened before against feelings of devotion could not but be accessible to them upon uniting their thoughts and voices for the last time along with their fellowmortals in addressing their creator and to the rest of the congregation it was thought it could not but be impressive and affecting to find their devotions mingling with those who sent by the doom of an earthly tribunal to appear where the whole earth is judged might be considered as beings trembling on the verge of eternity the practice however edifying has been discontinued in consequence of the incident we are about to detail  the clergyman whose duty it was to officiate in the tolbooth church had concluded an affecting discourse part of which was particularly directed to the unfortunate men wilson and robertson who were in the pew set apart for the persons in their unhappy situation each secured betwixt two soldiers of the city guard the clergyman had reminded them that the next congregation they must join would be that of the just or of the unjust that the psalms they now heard must be exchanged in the space of two brief days for eternal hallelujahs or eternal lamentations and that this fearful alternative must depend upon the state to which they might be able to bring their minds before the moment of awful preparation that they should not despair on account of the suddenness of the summons but rather to feel this comfort in their misery that though all who now lifted the voice or bent the knee in conjunction with them lay under the same sentence of certain death they only had the advantage of knowing the precise moment at which it should be executed upon them therefore urged the good man his voice trembling with emotion redeem the time my unhappy brethren which is yet left and remember that with the grace of him to whom space and time are but as nothing salvation may yet be assured even in the pittance of delay which the laws of your country afford you  robertson was observed to weep at these words but wilson seemed as one whose brain had not entirely received their meaning or whose thoughts were deeply impressed with some different subjectan expression so natural to a person in his situation that it excited neither suspicion nor surprise  the benediction was pronounced as usual and the congregation was dismissed many lingering to indulge their curiosity with a more fixed look at the two criminals who now as well as their guards rose up as if to depart when the crowd should permit them a murmur of compassion was heard to pervade the spectators the more general perhaps on account of the alleviating circumstances of the case when all at once wilson who as we have already noticed was a very strong man seized two of the soldiers one with each hand and calling at the same time to his companion run geordie run threw himself on a third and fastened his teeth on the collar of his coat robertson stood for a second as if thunderstruck and unable to avail himself of the opportunity of escape but the cry of run run being echoed from many around whose feelings surprised them into a very natural interest in his behalf he shook off the grasp of the remaining soldier threw himself over the pew mixed with the dispersing congregation none of whom felt inclined to stop a poor wretch taking his last chance for his life gained the door of the church and was lost to all pursuit  the generous intrepidity which wilson had displayed on this occasion augmented the feeling of compassion which attended his fate the public where their own prejudices are not concerned are easily engaged on the side of disinterestedness and humanity admired wilsons behaviour and rejoiced in robertsons escape this general feeling was so great that it excited a vague report that wilson would be rescued at the place of execution either by the mob or by some of his old associates or by some second extraordinary and unexpected exertion of strength and courage on his own part the magistrates thought it their duty to provide against the possibility of disturbance they ordered out for protection of the execution of the sentence the greater part of their own city guard under the command of captain porteous a man whose name became too memorable from the melancholy circumstances of the day and subsequent events it may be necessary to say a word about this person and the corps which he commanded but the subject is of importance sufficient to deserve another chapter     chapter second                            and thou great god of aquavitae                          wha sways the empire of this city                          when fou were sometimes capernoity                           be thou prepared                          to save us frae that black banditti                           the city guard                                         fergussons daft days  captain john porteous a name memorable in the traditions of edinburgh as well as in the records of criminal jurisprudence was the son of a citizen of edinburgh who endeavoured to breed him up to his own mechanical trade of a tailor the youth however had a wild and irreclaimable propensity to dissipation which finally sent him to serve in the corps long maintained in the service of the states of holland and called the scotch dutch here he learned military discipline and returning afterwards in the course of an idle and wandering life to his native city his services were required by the magistrates of edinburgh in the disturbed year 1715 for disciplining their city guard in which he shortly afterwards received a captains commission it was only by his military skill and an alert and resolute character as an officer of police that he merited this promotion for he is said to have been a man of profligate habits an unnatural son and a brutal husband he was however useful in his station and his harsh and fierce habits rendered him formidable to rioters or disturbers of the public peace  the corps in which he held his command is or perhaps we should rather say was a body of about one hundred and twenty soldiers divided into three companies and regularly armed clothed and embodied they were chiefly veterans who enlisted in this cogs having the benefit of working at their trades when they were off duty these men had the charge of preserving public order repressing riots and street robberies acting in short as an armed police and attending on all public occasions where confusion or popular disturbance might be expected   the lord provost was exofficio commander and colonel of the corps which might be increased to three hundred men when the times required it no other drum but theirs was allowed to sound on the high street  between the luckenbooths and the netherbow  poor fergusson whose irregularities sometimes led him into unpleasant rencontres with these military conservators of public order and who mentions them so often that he may be termed their poet laureate thus admonishes his readers warned doubtless by his own experience   robert fergusson the scottish poet born 1750 died 1774                      gude folk as ye come frae the fair                     bide yont frae this black squad                     theres nae sic savages elsewhere                     allowed to wear cockad  in fact the soldiers of the city guard being as we have said in general discharged veterans who had strength enough remaining for this municipal duty and being moreover for the greater part highlanders were neither by birth education nor former habits trained to endure with much patience the insults of the rabble or the provoking petulance of truant schoolboys and idle debauchees of all descriptions with whom their occupation brought them into contact on the contrary the tempers of the poor old fellows were soured by the indignities with which the mob distinguished them on many occasions and frequently might have required the soothing strains of the poet we have just quoted                      o soldiers for your ain dear sakes                     for scotlands love the land o cakes                     gie not her bairns sic deadly paiks                     nor be sae rude                     wi firelock or lochaberaxe                     as spill their bluid  on all occasions when a holiday licensed some riot and irregularity a skirmish with these veterans was a favourite recreation with the rabble of edinburgh these pages may perhaps see the light when many have in fresh recollection such onsets as we allude to but the venerable corps with whom the contention was held may now be considered as totally extinct of late the gradual diminution of these civic soldiers reminds one of the abatement of king lears hundred knights the edicts of each succeeding set of magistrates have like those of goneril and regan diminished this venerable band with the similar question what need we fiveandtwentytenor five and it is now nearly come to what need one a spectre may indeed here and there still be seen of an old greyheaded and greybearded highlander with warworn features but bent double by age dressed in an old fashioned cockedhat bound with white tape instead of silver lace and in coat waistcoat and breeches of a muddycoloured red bearing in his withered hand an ancient weapon called a lochaberaxe a long pole namely with an axe at the extremity and a hook at the back of the hatchet   this hook was to enable the bearer of the lochaberaxe to scale a gateway by grappling the top of the door and swinging himself up by the staff of his weapon  such a phantom of former days still creeps i have been informed round the statue of charles the second in the parliament square as if the image of a stuart were the last refuge for any memorial of our ancient manners and one or two others are supposed to glide around the door of the guardhouse assigned to them in the luckenbooths when their ancient refuge in the high street was laid low   this ancient corps is now entirely disbanded their last march to do duty at hallowfair had something in it affecting their drums and fifes had been wont on better days to play on this joyous occasion the lively tune of jockey to the fair but on his final occasion the afflicted veterans moved slowly to the dirge of  the last time i came ower the muir  but the fate of manuscripts bequeathed to friends and executors is so uncertain that the narrative containing these frail memorials of the old town guard of edinburgh who with their grim and valiant corporal john dhu the fiercestlooking fellow i ever saw were in my boyhood the alternate terror and derision of the petulant brood of the high school may perhaps only come to light when all memory of the institution has faded away and then serve as an illustration of kays caricatures who has preserved the features of some of their heroes in the preceding generation when there was a perpetual alarm for the plots and activity of the jacobites some pains were taken by the magistrates of edinburgh to keep this corps though composed always of such materials as we have noticed in a more effective state than was afterwards judged necessary when their most dangerous service was to skirmish with the rabble on the kings birthday they were therefore more the objects of hatred and less that of scorn than they were afterwards accounted  to captain john porteous the honour of his command and of his corps seems to have been a matter of high interest and importance he was exceedingly incensed against wilson for the affront which he construed him to have put upon his soldiers in the effort he made for the liberation of his companion and expressed himself most ardently on the subject he was no less indignant at the report that there was an intention to rescue wilson himself from the gallows and uttered many threats and imprecations upon that subject which were afterwards remembered to his disadvantage in fact if a good deal of determination and promptitude rendered porteous in one respect fit to command guards designed to suppress popular commotion he seems on the other to have been disqualified for a charge so delicate by a hot and surly temper always too ready to come to blows and violence a character void of principle and a disposition to regard the rabble who seldom failed to regale him and his soldiers with some marks of their displeasure as declared enemies upon whom it was natural and justifiable that he should seek opportunities of vengeance being however the most active and trustworthy among the captains of the city guard he was the person to whom the magistrates confided the command of the soldiers appointed to keep the peace at the time of wilsons execution he was ordered to guard the gallows and scaffold with about eighty men all the disposable force that could be spared for that duty  but the magistrates took farther precautions which affected porteouss pride very deeply they requested the assistance of part of a regular infantry regiment not to attend upon the execution but to remain drawn up on the principal street of the city during the time that it went forward in order to intimidate the multitude in case they should be disposed to be unruly with a display of force which could not be resisted without desperation it may sound ridiculous in our ears considering the fallen state of this ancient civic corps that its officer should have felt punctiliously jealous of its honour yet so it was captain porteous resented as an indignity the introducing the welsh fusileers within the city and drawing them up in the street where no drums but his own were allowed to be sounded without the special command or permission of the magistrates as he could not show his illhumour to his patrons the magistrates it increased his indignation and his desire to be revenged on the unfortunate criminal wilson and all who favoured him these internal emotions of jealousy and rage wrought a change on the mans mien and bearing visible to all who saw him on the fatal morning when wilson was appointed to suffer porteouss ordinary appearance was rather favourable he was about the middle size stout and well made having a military air and yet rather a gentle and mild countenance his complexion was brown his face somewhat fretted with the sears of the smallpox his eyes rather languid than keen or fierce on the present occasion however it seemed to those who saw him as if he were agitated by some evil demon his step was irregular his voice hollow and broken his countenance pale his eyes staring and wild his speech imperfect and confused and his whole appearance so disordered that many remarked he seemed to be fey a scottish expression meaning the state of those who are driven on to their impending fate by the strong impulse of some irresistible necessity  one part of his conduct was truly diabolical if indeed it has not been exaggerated by the general prejudice entertained against his memory when wilson the unhappy criminal was delivered to him by the keeper of the prison in order that he might be conducted to the place of execution porteous not satisfied with the usual precautions to prevent escape ordered him to be manacled this might be justifiable from the character and bodily strength of the malefactor as well as from the apprehensions so generally entertained of an expected rescue but the handcuffs which were produced being found too small for the wrists of a man so bigboned as wilson porteous proceeded with his own hands and by great exertion of strength to force them till they clasped together to the exquisite torture of the unhappy criminal wilson remonstrated against such barbarous usage declaring that the pain distracted his thoughts from the subjects of meditation proper to his unhappy condition  it signifies little replied captain porteous your pain will soon be at an end  your cruelty is great answered the sufferer you know not how soon you yourself may have occasion to ask the mercy which you are now refusing to a fellowcreature may god forgive you  these words long afterwards quoted and remembered were all that passed between porteous and his prisoner but as they took air and became known to the people they greatly increased the popular compassion for wilson and excited a proportionate degree of indignation against porteous against whom as strict and even violent in the discharge of his unpopular office the common people had some real and many imaginary causes of complaint  when the painful procession was completed and wilson with the escort had arrived at the scaffold in the grassmarket there appeared no signs of that attempt to rescue him which had occasioned such precautions the multitude in general looked on with deeper interest than at ordinary executions and there might be seen on the countenances of many a stern and indignant expression like that with which the ancient cameronians might be supposed to witness the execution of their brethren who glorified the covenant on the same occasion and at the same spot but there was no attempt at violence wilson himself seemed disposed to hasten over the space that divided time from eternity the devotions proper and usual on such occasions were no sooner finished than he submitted to his fate and the sentence of the law was fulfilled  he had been suspended on the gibbet so long as to be totally deprived of life when at once as if occasioned by some newly received impulse there arose a tumult among the multitude many stones were thrown at porteous and his guards some mischief was done and the mob continued to press forward with whoops shrieks howls and exclamations a young fellow with a sailors cap slouched over his face sprung on the scaffold and cut the rope by which the criminal was suspended others approached to carry off the body either to secure for it a decent grave or to try perhaps some means of resuscitation captain porteous was wrought by this appearance of insurrection against his authority into a rage so headlong as made him forget that the sentence having been fully executed it was his duty not to engage in hostilities with the misguided multitude but to draw off his men as fast as possible he sprung from the scaffold snatched a musket from one of his soldiers commanded the party to give fire and as several eyewitnesses concurred in swearing set them the example by discharging his piece and shooting a man dead on the spot several soldiers obeyed his command or followed his example six or seven persons were slain and a great many were hurt and wounded  after this act of violence the captain proceeded to withdraw his men towards their guardhouse in the high street the mob were not so much intimidated as incensed by what had been done they pursued the soldiers with execrations accompanied by volleys of stones as they pressed on them the rearmost soldiers turned and again fired with fatal aim and execution it is not accurately known whether porteous commanded this second act of violence but of course the odium of the whole transactions of the fatal day attached to him and to him alone he arrived at the guardhouse dismissed his soldiers and went to make his report to the magistrates concerning the unfortunate events of the day  apparently by this time captain porteous had began to doubt the propriety of his own conduct and the reception he met with from the magistrates was such as to make him still more anxious to gloss it over he denied that he had given orders to fire he denied he had fired with his own hand he even produced the fusee which he carried as an officer for examination it was found still loaded of three cartridges which he was seen to put in his pouch that morning two were still there a white handkerchief was thrust into the muzzle of the piece and returned unsoiled or blackened to the defence founded on these circumstances it was answered that porteous had not used his own piece but had been seen to take one from a soldier among the many who had been killed and wounded by the unhappy fire there were several of better rank for even the humanity of such soldiers as fired over the heads of the mere rabble around the scaffold proved in some instances fatal to persons who were stationed in windows or observed the melancholy scene from a distance the voice of public indignation was loud and general and ere mens tempers had time to cool the trial of captain porteous took place before the high court of justiciary after a long and patient hearing the jury had the difficult duty of balancing the positive evidence of many persons and those of respectability who deposed positively to the prisoners commanding his soldiers to fire and himself firing his piece of which some swore that they saw the smoke and flash and beheld a man drop at whom it was pointed with the negative testimony of others who though well stationed for seeing what had passed neither heard porteous give orders to fire nor saw him fire himself but on the contrary averred that the first shot was fired by a soldier who stood close by him a great part of his defence was also founded on the turbulence of the mob which witnesses according to their feelings their predilections and their opportunities of observation represented differently some describing as a formidable riot what others represented as a trifling disturbance such as always used to take place on the like occasions when the executioner of the law and the men commissioned to protect him in his task were generally exposed to some indignities the verdict of the jury sufficiently shows how the evidence preponderated in their minds it declared that john porteous fired a gun among the people assembled at the execution that he gave orders to his soldiers to fire by which many persons were killed and wounded but at the same time that the prisoner and his guard had been wounded and beaten by stones thrown at them by the multitude upon this verdict the lords of justiciary passed sentence of death against captain john porteous adjudging him in the common form to be hanged on a gibbet at the common place of execution on wednesday 8th september 1736 and all his movable property to be forfeited to the kings use according to the scottish law in cases of wilful murder   the signatures affixed to the deathwarrant of captain porteous were andrew fletcher of milton lord justiceclerk sir james mackenzie lord royston david erskine lord dun sir walter pringle lord newhall sir gilbert elliot lord minto     chapter third                      the hours come but not the man   there is a tradition that while a little stream was swollen into a torrent by recent showers the discontented voice of the water spirit was heard to pronounce these words at the some moment a man urged on by his fate or in scottish language fey arrived at a gallop and prepared to cross the water no remonstrance from the bystanders was of power to stop himhe plunged into the stream and perished   kelpie  on the day when the unhappy porteous was expected to suffer the sentence of the law the place of execution extensive as it is was crowded almost to suffocation there was not a window in all the lofty tenements around it or in the steep and crooked street called the bow by which the fatal procession was to descend from the high street that was not absolutely filled with spectators the uncommon height and antique appearance of these houses some of which were formerly the property of the knights templars and the knights of st john and still exhibit on their fronts and gables the iron cross of these orders gave additional effect to a scene in itself so striking the area of the grassmarket resembled a huge dark lake or sea of human heads in the centre of which arose the fatal tree tall black and ominous from which dangled the deadly halter every object takes interest from its uses and associations and the erect beam and empty noose things so simple in themselves became on such an occasion objects of terror and of solemn interest  amid so numerous an assembly there was scarcely a word spoken save in whispers the thirst of vengeance was in some degree allayed by its supposed certainty and even the populace with deeper feeling than they are wont to entertain suppressed all clamorous exultation and prepared to enjoy the scene of retaliation in triumph silent and decent though stern and relentless it seemed as if the depth of their hatred to the unfortunate criminal scorned to display itself in anything resembling the more noisy current of their ordinary feelings had a stranger consulted only the evidence of his ears he might have supposed that so vast a multitude were assembled for some purpose which affected them with the deepest sorrow and stilled those noises which on all ordinary occasions arise from such a concourse but if he had gazed upon their faces he would have been instantly undeceived the compressed lip the bent brow the stern and flashing eye of almost everyone on whom he looked conveyed the expression of men come to glut their sight with triumphant revenge it is probable that the appearance of the criminal might have somewhat changed the temper of the populace in his favour and that they might in the moment of death have forgiven the man against whom their resentment had been so fiercely heated it had however been destined that the mutability of their sentiments was not to be exposed to this trial  the usual hour for producing the criminal had been past for many minutes yet the spectators observed no symptom of his appearance would they venture to defraud public justice was the question which men began anxiously to ask at each other the first answer in every case was bold and positivethey dare not but when the point was further canvassed other opinions were entertained and various causes of doubt were suggested porteous had been a favourite officer of the magistracy of the city which being a numerous and fluctuating body requires for its support a degree of energy in its functionaries which the individuals who compose it cannot at all times alike be supposed to possess in their own persons it was remembered that in the information for porteous the paper namely in which his case was stated to the judges of the criminal court he had been described by his counsel as the person on whom the magistrates chiefly relied in all emergencies of uncommon difficulty it was argued too that his conduct on the unhappy occasion of wilsons execution was capable of being attributed to an imprudent excess of zeal in the execution of his duty a motive for which those under whose authority he acted might be supposed to have great sympathy and as these considerations might move the magistrates to make a favourable representation of porteouss case there were not wanting others in the higher departments of government which would make such suggestions favourably listened to  the mob of edinburgh when thoroughly excited had been at all times one of the fiercest which could be found in europe and of late years they had risen repeatedly against the government and sometimes not without temporary success they were conscious therefore that they were no favourites with the rulers of the period and that if captain porteouss violence was not altogether regarded as good service it might certainly be thought that to visit it with a capital punishment would render it both delicate and dangerous for future officers in the same circumstances to act with effect in repressing tumults there is also a natural feeling on the part of all members of government for the general maintenance of authority and it seemed not unlikely that what to the relatives of the sufferers appeared a wanton and unprovoked massacre should be otherwise viewed in the cabinet of st jamess it might be there supposed that upon the whole matter captain porteous was in the exercise of a trust delegated to him by the lawful civil authority that he had been assaulted by the populace and several of his men hurt and that in finally repelling force by force his conduct could be fairly imputed to no other motive than selfdefence in the discharge of his duty  these considerations of themselves very powerful induced the spectators to apprehend the possibility of a reprieve and to the various causes which might interest the rulers in his favour the lower part of the rabble added one which was peculiarly well adapted to their comprehension it was averred in order to increase the odium against porteous that while he repressed with the utmost severity the slightest excesses of the poor he not only overlooked the license of the young nobles and gentry but was very willing to lend them the countenance of his official authority in execution of such loose pranks as it was chiefly his duty to have restrained this suspicion which was perhaps much exaggerated made a deep impression on the minds of the populace and when several of the higher rank joined in a petition recommending porteous to the mercy of the crown it was generally supposed he owed their favour not to any conviction of the hardship of his case but to the fear of losing a convenient accomplice in their debaucheries it is scarcely necessary to say how much this suspicion augmented the peoples detestation of this obnoxious criminal as well as their fear of his escaping the sentence pronounced against him  while these arguments were stated and replied to and canvassed and supported the hitherto silent expectation of the people became changed into that deep and agitating murmur which is sent forth by the ocean before the tempest begins to howl the crowded populace as if their motions had corresponded with the unsettled state of their minds fluctuated to and fro without any visible cause of impulse like the agitation of the waters called by sailors the groundswell the news which the magistrates had almost hesitated to communicate to them were at length announced and spread among the spectators with a rapidity like lightning a reprieve from the secretary of states office under the hand of his grace the duke of newcastle had arrived intimating the pleasure of queen caroline regent of the kingdom during the absence of george ii on the continent that the execution of the sentence of death pronounced against john porteous late captainlieutenant of the city guard of edinburgh present prisoner in the tolbooth of that city be respited for six weeks from the time appointed for his execution  the assembled spectators of almost all degrees whose minds had been wound up to the pitch which we have described uttered a groan or rather a roar of indignation and disappointed revenge similar to that of a tiger from whom his meal has been rent by his keeper when he was just about to devour it this fierce exclamation seemed to forbode some immediate explosion of popular resentment and in fact such had been expected by the magistrates and the necessary measures had been taken to repress it but the shout was not repeated nor did any sudden tumult ensue such as it appeared to announce the populace seemed to be ashamed of having expressed their disappointment in a vain clamour and the sound changed not into the silence which had preceded the arrival of these stunning news but into stifled mutterings which each group maintained among themselves and which were blended into one deep and hoarse murmur which floated above the assembly  yet still though all expectation of the execution was over the mob remained assembled stationary as it were through very resentment gazing on the preparations for death which had now been made in vain and stimulating their feelings by recalling the various claims which wilson might have had on royal mercy from the mistaken motives on which he acted as well as from the generosity he had displayed towards his accomplice this man they saidthe brave the resolute the generous was executed to death without mercy for stealing a purse of gold which in some sense he might consider as a fair reprisal while the profligate satellite who took advantage of a trifling tumult inseparable from such occasions to shed the blood of twenty of his fellowcitizens is deemed a fitting object for the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy is this to be bornewould our fathers have borne it are not we like them scotsmen and burghers of edinburgh  the officers of justice began now to remove the scaffold and other preparations which had been made for the execution in hopes by doing so to accelerate the dispersion of the multitude the measure had the desired effect for no sooner had the fatal tree been unfixed from the large stone pedestal or socket in which it was secured and sunk slowly down upon the wain intended to remove it to the place where it was usually deposited than the populace after giving vent to their feelings in a second shout of rage and mortification began slowly to disperse to their usual abodes and occupations  the windows were in like manner gradually deserted and groups of the more decent class of citizens formed themselves as if waiting to return homewards when the streets should be cleared of the rabble contrary to what is frequently the case this description of persons agreed in general with the sentiments of their inferiors and considered the cause as common to all ranks indeed as we have already noticed it was by no means amongst the lowest class of the spectators or those most likely to be engaged in the riot at wilsons execution that the fatal fire of porteouss soldiers had taken effect several persons were killed who were looking out at windows at the scene who could not of course belong to the rioters and were persons of decent rank and condition the burghers therefore resenting the loss which had fallen on their own body and proud and tenacious of their rights as the citizens of edinburgh have at all times been were greatly exasperated at the unexpected respite of captain porteous  it was noticed at the time and afterwards more particularly remembered that while the mob were in the act of dispersing several individuals were seen busily passing from one place and one group of people to another remaining long with none but whispering for a little time with those who appeared to be declaiming most violently against the conduct of government these active agents had the appearance of men from the country and were generally supposed to be old friends and confederates of wilson whose minds were of course highly excited against porteous  if however it was the intention of these men to stir the multitude to any sudden act of mutiny it seemed for the time to be fruitless the rabble as well as the more decent part of the assembly dispersed and went home peaceably and it was only by observing the moody discontent on their brows or catching the tenor of the conversation they held with each other that a stranger could estimate the state of their minds we will give the reader this advantage by associating ourselves with one of the numerous groups who were painfully ascending the steep declivity of the west bow to return to their dwellings in the lawnmarket  an unco thing this mrs howden said old peter plumdamas to his neighbour the roupingwife or saleswoman as he offered her his arm to assist her in the toilsome ascent to see the grit folk at lunnon set their face against law and gospel and let loose sic a reprobate as porteous upon a peaceable town  and to think o the weary walk they hae gien us answered mrs howden with a groan and sic a comfortable window as i had gotten too just within a pennystanecast of the scaffoldi could hae heard every word the minister saidand to pay twalpennies for my stand and a for naething  i am judging said mr plumdamas that this reprieve wadna stand gude in the auld scots law when the kingdom was a kingdom  i dinna ken muckle about the law answered mrs howden but i ken when we had a king and a chancellor and parliament men o our ain we could aye peeble them wi stanes when they werena gude bairnsbut naebodys nails can reach the length o lunnon  weary on lunnon and a that eer came out ot said miss grizel damahoy an ancient seamstress they hae taen away our parliament and they hae oppressed our trade our gentles will hardly allow that a scots needle can sew ruffles on a sark or lace on an owerlay  ye may say thatmiss damahoy and i ken o them that hae gotten raisins frae lunnon by forpits at ance responded plumdamas and then sic an host of idle english gaugers and excisemen as hae come down to vex and torment us that an honest man canna fetch sae muckle as a bit anker o brandy frae leith to the lawnmarket but hes like to be rubbit o the very gudes hes bought and paid forweel i winna justify andrew wilson for pitting hands on what wasna his but if he took nae mair than his ain theres an awfu difference between that and the fact this man stands for  if ye speak about the law said mrs howden here comes mr saddletree that can settle it as weel as ony on the bench  the party she mentioned a grave elderly person with a superb periwig dressed in a decent suit of sadcoloured clothes came up as she spoke and courteously gave his arm to miss grizel damahoy  it may be necessary to mention that mr bartoline saddletree kept an excellent and highlyesteemed shop for harness saddles c c at the sign of the golden nag at the head of bess wynd   maitland calls it bests wynd and later writers beths wynd as the name implies it was an open thoroughfare or alley leading from the lawnmarket and extended in a direct line between the old tolbooth to near the head of the cowgate it was partly destroyed by fire in 1786 and was totally removed in 1809 preparatory to the building of the new libraries of the faculty of advocates and writers to the signet  his genius however as he himself and most of his neighbours conceived lay towards the weightier matters of the law and he failed not to give frequent attendance upon the pleadings and arguments of the lawyers and judges in the neighbouring square where to say the truth he was oftener to be found than would have consisted with his own emolument but that his wife an active painstaking person could in his absence make an admirable shift to please the customers and scold the journeymen this good lady was in the habit of letting her husband take his way and go on improving his stock of legal knowledge without interruption but as if in requital she insisted upon having her own will in the domestic and commercial departments which he abandoned to her now as bartoline saddletree had a considerable gift of words which he mistook for eloquence and conferred more liberally upon the society in which he lived than was at all times gracious and acceptable there went forth a saying with which wags used sometimes to interrupt his rhetoric that as he had a golden nag at his door so he had a grey mare in his shop this reproach induced mr saddletree on all occasions to assume rather a haughty and stately tone towards his good woman a circumstance by which she seemed very little affected unless he attempted to exercise any real authority when she never failed to fly into open rebellion but such extremes bartoline seldom provoked for like the gentle king jamie he was fonder of talking of authority than really exercising it this turn of mind was on the whole lucky for him since his substance was increased without any trouble on his part or any interruption of his favourite studies  this word in explanation has been thrown in to the reader while saddletree was laying down with great precision the law upon porteouss case by which he arrived at this conclusion that if porteous had fired five minutes sooner before wilson was cut down he would have been versans in licito engaged that is in a lawful act and only liable to be punished propter excessum or for lack of discretion which might have mitigated the punishment to poena ordinaria  discretion echoed mrs howden on whom it may well be supposed the fineness of this distinction was entirely thrown awaywhan had jock porteous either grace discretion or gude mannersi mind when his father  but mrs howden said saddletree  and i said miss damahoy mind when his mother  miss damahoy entreated the interrupted orator  and i said plumdamas mind when his wife  mr plumdamasmrs howdenmiss damahoy again implored the oratormind the distinction as counsellor crossmyloof saysi says he take a distinction now the body of the criminal being cut down and the execution ended porteous was no longer official the act which he came to protect and guard being done and ended he was no better than cuivis ex populo  quivisquivis mr saddletree craving your pardon said with a prolonged emphasis on the first syllable mr butler the deputyschoolmaster of a parish near edinburgh who at that moment came up behind them as the false latin was uttered  what signifies interrupting me mr butlerbut i am glad to see ye notwithstandingi speak after counsellor crossmyloof and he said cuivis  if counsellor crossmyloof used the dative for the nominative i would have crossed his loof with a tight leathern strap mr saddletree there is not a boy on the booby form but should have been scourged for such a solecism in grammar  i speak latin like a lawyer mr butler and not like a schoolmaster retorted saddletree  scarce like a schoolboy i think rejoined butler  it matters little said bartoline all i mean to say is that porteous has become liable to the poena extra ordinem or capital punishmentwhich is to say in plain scotch the gallowssimply because he did not fire when he was in office but waited till the body was cut down the execution whilk he had in charge to guard implemented and he himself exonered of the public trust imposed on him  but mr saddletree said plumdamas do ye really think john porteouss case wad hae been better if he had begun firing before ony stanes were flung at a  indeed do i neighbour plumdamas replied bartoline confidently he being then in point of trust and in point of power the execution being but inchoat or at least not implemented or finally ended but after wilson was cut down it was a owerhe was clean exauctorate and had nae mair ado but to get awa wi his guard up this west bow as fast as if there had been a caption after himand this is law for i heard it laid down by lord vincovincentem  vincovincentemis he a lord of state or a lord of seat inquired mrs howden   a nobleman was called a lord of state the senators of the college  of justice were termed lords of seat or of the session  a lord of seata lord of sessioni fash mysell little wi lords o state they vex me wi a wheen idle questions about their saddles and curpels and holsters and horsefurniture and what theyll cost and whan theyll be readya wheen galloping geesemy wife may serve the like o them  and so might she in her day hae served the best lord in the land for as little as ye think o her mr saddletree said mrs howden somewhat indignant at the contemptuous way in which her gossip was mentioned when she and i were twa gilpies we little thought to hae sitten doun wi the like o my auld davie howden or you either mr saddletree  while saddletree who was not bright at a reply was cudgelling his brains for an answer to this homethrust miss damahoy broke in on him  and as for the lords of state said miss damahoy ye suld mind the riding o the parliament mr saddletree in the gude auld time before the uniona years rent o mony a gude estate gaed for horsegraith and harnessing forby broidered robes and footmantles that wad hae stude by their lane wi gold brocade and that were muckle in my ain line  ay and then the lusty banqueting with sweetmeats and comfits wet and dry and dried fruits of divers sorts said plumdamas but scotland was scotland in these days  ill tell ye what it is neighbours said mrs howden ill neer believe scotland is scotland ony mair if our kindly scots sit doun with the affront they hae gien us this day its not only the blude that is shed but the blude that might hae been shed thats required at our hands there was my daughters wean little eppie daidlemy oe ye ken miss grizelhad played the truant frae the school as bairns will do ye ken mr butler  and for which interjected mr butler they should be soundly scourged by their wellwishers  and had just cruppen to the gallows foot to see the hanging as was natural for a wean and what for mightna she hae been shot as weel as the rest o them and where wad we a hae been then i wonder how queen carline if her name be carline wad hae liked to hae had ane o her ain bairns in sic a venture  report says answered butler that such a circumstance would not have distressed her majesty beyond endurance  aweel said mrs howden the sum o the matter is that were i a man i wad hae amends o jock porteous be the upshot what like ot if a the carles and carlines in england had sworn to the naysay  i would claw down the tolbooth door wi my nails said miss grizel but i wad be at him  ye may be very right ladies said butler but i would not advise you to speak so loud  speak exclaimed both the ladies together there will be naething else spoken about frae the weighhouse to the watergate till this is either ended or mended  the females now departed to their respective places of abode plumdamas joined the other two gentlemen in drinking their meridian a bumperdram of brandy as they passed the wellknown lowbrowed shop in the lawnmarket where they were wont to take that refreshment mr plumdamas then departed towards his shop and mr butler who happened to have some particular occasion for the rein of an old bridle the truants of that busy day could have anticipated its application walked down the lawnmarket with mr saddletree each talking as he could get a word thrust in the one on the laws of scotland the other on those of syntax and neither listening to a word which his companion uttered     chapter fourth               elswhair he colde right weel lay down the law                 but in his house was meek as is a daw                                                   davie lindsay  there has been jock driver the carrier here speering about his new graith said mrs saddletree to her husband as he crossed his threshold not with the purpose by any means of consulting him upon his own affairs but merely to intimate by a gentle recapitulation how much duty she had gone through in his absence  weel replied bartoline and deigned not a word more  and the laird of girdingburst has had his running footman here and cad himsell hes a civil pleasant young gentleman to see when the broidered saddlecloth for his sorrel horse will be ready for he wants it agane the kelso races  weel aweel replied bartoline as laconically as before  and his lordship the earl of blazonbury lord flash and flame is like to be clean daft that the harness for the six flanders mears wi the crests coronets housings and mountings conform are no sent hame according to promise gien  weel weel weelweel weel gudewife said saddletree if he gangs daft well hae him cognoscedits a very weel  its weel that ye think sae mr saddletree answered his helpmate rather nettled at the indifference with which her report was received theres mony ane wad hae thought themselves affronted if sae mony customers had cad and naebody to answer them but womenfolk for a the lads were aff as soon as your back was turned to see porteous hanged that might be counted upon and sae you no being at hame  houts mrs saddletree said bartoline with an air of consequence dinna deave me wi your nonsense i was under the necessity of being elsewherenon omniaas mr crossmyloof said when he was called by two macers at oncenon omnia possumuspessimuspossimisi ken our lawlatin offends mr butlers ears but it means naebody an it were the lord president himsell can do twa turns at ance  very right mr saddletree answered his careful helpmate with a sarcastic smile and nae doubt its a decent thing to leave your wife to look after young gentlemens saddles and bridles when ye gang to see a man that never did ye nae ill raxing a halter  woman said saddletree assuming an elevated tone to which the meridian had somewhat contributed desisti say forbear from intromitting with affairs thou canst not understand dye think i was born to sit here brogging an elshin through bendleather when sic men as duncan forbes and that other arniston chield there without muckle greater parts if the closehead speak true than mysell maun be presidents and kings advocates nae doubt and wha but they whereas were favour equally distribute as in the days of the wight wallace  i ken naething we wad hae gotten by the wight wallace said mrs saddletree unless as i hae heard the auld folk tell they fought in thae days wi bendleather guns and then its a chance but what if he had bought them he might have forgot to pay for them and as for the greatness of your parts bartley the folk in the closehead maun ken mair about them than i do if they make sic a report of them   closehead the entrance of a blind alley  i tell ye woman said saddletree in high dudgeon that ye ken naething about these matters in sir william wallaces days there was nae man pinned down to sic a slavish wark as a saddlers for they got ony leather graith that they had use for readymade out of holland  well said butler who was like many of his profession something of a humorist and dry joker if that be the case mr saddletree i think we have changed for the better since we make our own harness and only import our lawyers from holland  its ower true mr butler answered bartoline with a sigh if i had had the luckor rather if my father had had the sense to send me to leyden and utrecht to learn the substitutes and pandex  you mean the institutesjustinians institutes mr saddletree said butler  institutes and substitutes are synonymous words mr butler and used indifferently as such in deeds of tailzie as you may see in balfours practiques or dallas of st martins styles i understand these things pretty weel i thank god but i own i should have studied in holland  to comfort you you might not have been farther forward than you are now mr saddletree replied mr butler for our scottish advocates are an aristocratic race their brass is of the right corinthian quality and non cuivis contigit adire corinthumaha mr saddletree  and aha mr butler rejoined bartoline upon whom as may be well supposed the jest was lost and all but the sound of the words ye said a gliff syne it was quivis and now i heard ye say cuivis with my ain ears as plain as ever i heard a word at the forebar  give me your patience mr saddletree and ill explain the discrepancy in three words said butler as pedantic in his own department though with infinitely more judgment and learning as bartoline was in his selfassumed profession of the lawgive me your patience for a momentyoull grant that the nominative case is that by which a person or thing is nominated or designed and which may be called the primary case all others being formed from it by alterations of the termination in the learned languages and by prepositions in our modern babylonian jargonsyoull grant me that i suppose mr saddletree  i dinna ken whether i will or noad avisandum ye kennaebody should be in a hurry to make admissions either in point of law or in point of fact said saddletree looking or endeavouring to look as if he understood what was said  and the dative case continued butler  i ken what a tutor dative is said saddletree readily enough  the dative case resumed the grammarian is that in which anything is given or assigned as properly belonging to a person or thingyou cannot deny that i am sure  i am sure ill no grant it though said saddletree  then what the deevil dye take the nominative and the dative cases to be said butler hastily and surprised at once out of his decency of expression and accuracy of pronunciation  ill tell you that at leisure mr butler said saddletree with a very knowing look ill take a day to see and answer every article of your condescendence and then ill hold you to confess or deny as accords  come come mr saddletree said his wife well hae nae confessions and condescendences here let them deal in thae sort o wares that are paid for themthey suit the like o us as all as a demipique saddle would suit a draught ox  aha said mr butler optat ephippia bos piger nothing new under the sunbut it was a fair hit of mrs saddletree however  and it wad far better become ye mr saddletree continued his helpmate since ye say ye hae skeel o the law to try if ye can do onything for effie deans puir thing thats lying up in the tolbooth yonder cauld and hungry and comfortlessa servant lass of ours mr butler and as innocent a lass to my thinking and as usefu in the shopwhen mr saddletree gangs outand yere aware hes seldom at hame when theres ony o the pleahouses openpoor effie used to help me to tumble the bundles o barkened leather up and down and range out the gudes and suit a bodys humoursand troth she could aye please the customers wi her answers for she was aye civil and a bonnier lass wasna in auld reekie and when folk were hasty and unreasonable she could serve them better than me that am no sae young as i hae been mr butler and a wee bit short in the temper into the bargain for when theres ower mony folks crying on me at anes and nane but ae tongue to answer them folk maun speak hastily or theyll neer get through their warksae i miss effie daily  de die in diem added saddletree  i think said butler after a good deal of hesitation i have seen the girl in the shopa modestlooking fairhaired girl  ay ay thats just puir effie said her mistress how she was abandoned to hersell or whether she was sackless o the sinful deed god in heaven knows but if shes been guilty shes been sair tempted and i wad amaist take my bibleaith she hasna been hersell at the time  butler had by this time become much agitated he fidgeted up and down the shop and showed the greatest agitation that a person of such strict decorum could be supposed to give way to was not this girl he said the daughter of david deans that had the parks at st leonards taken and has she not a sister  in troth has shepuir jeanie deans ten years aulder than hersell she was here greeting a wee while syne about her tittie and what could i say to her but that she behoved to come and speak to mr saddletree when he was at hame it wasna that i thought mr saddletree could do her or ony ither body muckle good or ill but it wad aye serve to keep the puir things heart up for a wee while and let sorrow come when sorrow maun  yere mistaen though gudewife said saddletree scornfully for i could hae gien her great satisfaction i could hae proved to her that her sister was indicted upon the statute saxteen hundred and ninety chapter onefor the mair ready prevention of childmurderfor concealing her pregnancy and giving no account of the child which she had borne  i hope said butleri trust in a gracious god that she can clear herself  and sae do i mr butler replied mrs saddletree i am sure i wad hae answered for her as my ain daughter but waes my heart i had been tender a the simmer and scarce ower the door o my room for twal weeks and as for mr saddletree he might be in a lyingin hospital and neer find out what the women cam there for sae i could see little or naething o her or i wad hae had the truth o her situation out o her ise warrant yebut we a think her sister maun be able to speak something to clear her  the haill parliament house said saddletree was speaking o naething else till this job o porteouss put it out o headits a beautiful point of presumptive murder and theres been nane like it in the justiciar court since the case of luckie smith the howdie that suffered in the year saxteen hundred and seventynine  but whats the matter wi you mr butler said the good woman ye are looking as white as a sheet will ye tak a dram  by no means said butler compelling himself to speak i walked in from dumfries yesterday and this is a warm day  sit down said mrs saddletree laying hands on him kindly and rest yeyell kill yoursell man at that rateand are we to wish you joy o getting the scule mr butler  yesnoi do not know answered the young man vaguely but mrs saddletree kept him to point partly out of real interest partly from curiosity  ye dinna ken whether ye are to get the free scule o dumfries or no after hinging on and teaching it a the simmer  no mrs saddletreei am not to have it replied butler more collectedly the laird of blackatthebane had a natural son bred to the kirk that the presbytery could not be prevailed upon to license and so  ay ye need say nae mair about it if there was a laird that had a puir kinsman or a bastard that it wad suit theres enough saidand yere een come back to liberton to wait for dead mens shoonand for as frail as mr whackbairn is he may live as lang as you that are his assistant and successor  very like replied butler with a sigh i do not know if i should wish it otherwise  nae doubt its a very vexing thing continued the good lady to be in that dependent station and you that hae right and title to sae muckle better i wonder how ye bear these crosses  quos diligit castigat answered butler even the pagan seneca could see an advantage in affliction the heathens had their philosophy and the jews their revelation mrs saddletree and they endured their distresses in their day christians have a better dispensation than eitherbut doubtless  he stopped and sighed  i ken what ye mean said mrs saddletree looking toward her husband theres whiles we lose patience in spite of baith book and biblebut ye are no gaun awa and looking sae poorlyyell stay and take some kale wi us  mr saddletree laid aside balfours practiques his favourite study and much good may it do him to join in his wifes hospitable importunity but the teacher declined all entreaty and took his leave upon the spot  theres something in a this said mrs saddletree looking after him as he walked up the street i wonder what makes mr butler sae distressed about effies misfortunethere was nae acquaintance atween them that ever i saw or heard of but they were

there is nae tutor nominate and the tutoratlaw declines to act but only i fear the expense of the procedure wad not be in rem versam for i am not aware if willie has ony effects whereof to assume the administration  he concluded this sentence with a selfimportant cough as one who has laid down the law in an indisputable manner  effects said mrs saddletree what effects has the puir weanhe was in

arrested by a topic of legal discussionwhoy there are two sorts of murdrum or murdragium or what you populariter et vulgariser call murther i mean there are many sorts for theres your murthrum per vigilias et insidias and your murthrum under trust  i am sure replied his moiety that murther by trust is the way that the gentry murther us merchants and whiles make us shut the booth upbut that has naething to do wi effies misfortune  the case of effie or euphemia deans resumed saddletree is one of those cases of murder presumptive that is a murder of the laws inferring or construction being derived from certain indicia or grounds of suspicion  so that said the good woman unless poor effie has communicated her situation shell be hanged by the neck if the bairn was stillborn or if it be alive at this moment  assuredly said saddletree it being a statute made by our sovereign lord and lady to prevent the horrid delict of bringing forth children in secretthe crime is rather a favourite of the law this species of murther being one of its ain creation  then if the law makes murders said mrs saddletree the law should be hanged for them or if they wad hang a lawyer instead the country wad find nae faut  a summons to their frugal dinner interrupted the farther progress of the conversation which was otherwise like to take a turn much less favourable to the science of jurisprudence and its professors than mr bartoline saddletree the fond admirer of both had at its opening anticipated     chapter fifth                      but up then raise all edinburgh                    they all rose up by thousands three                                       johnnie armstrangs goodnight  butler on his departure from the sign of the golden nag went in quest of a friend of his connected with the law of whom he wished to make particular inquiries concerning the circumstances in which the unfortunate young woman mentioned in the last chapter was placed having as the reader has probably already conjectured reasons much deeper than those dictated by mere humanity for interesting himself in her fate he found the person he sought absent from home and was equally unfortunate in one or two other calls which he made upon acquaintances whom he hoped to interest in her story but everybody was for the moment starkmad on the subject of porteous and engaged busily in attacking or defending the measures of government in reprieving him and the ardour of dispute had excited such universal thirst that half the young lawyers and writers together with their very clerks the class whom butler was looking after had adjourned the debate to some favourite tavern it was computed by an experienced arithmetician that there was as much twopenny ale consumed on the discussion as would have floated a firstrate manofwar  butler wandered about until it was dusk resolving to take that opportunity of visiting the unfortunate young woman when his doing so might be least observed for he had his own reasons for avoiding the remarks of mrs saddletree whose shopdoor opened at no great distance from that of the jail though on the opposite or south side of the street and a little higher up he passed therefore through the narrow and partly covered passage leading from the northwest end of the parliament square  he stood now before the gothic entrance of the ancient prison which as is well known to all men rears its ancient front in the very middle of the high street forming as it were the termination to a huge pile of buildings called the luckenbooths which for some inconceivable reason our ancestors had jammed into the midst of the principal street of the town leaving for passage a narrow street on the north and on the south into which the prison opens a narrow crooked lane winding betwixt the high and sombre walls of the tolbooth and the adjacent houses on the one side and the butresses and projections of the old cathedral upon the other to give some gaiety to this sombre passage well known by the name of the krames a number of little booths or shops after the fashion of cobblers stalls are plastered as it were against the gothic projections and abutments so that it seemed as if the traders had occupied with nests bearing the same proportion to the building every buttress and coign of vantage as the martlett did in macbeths castle of later years these booths have degenerated into mere toyshops where the little loiterers chiefly interested in such wares are tempted to linger enchanted by the rich display of hobbyhorses babies and dutch toys arranged in artful and gay confusion yet halfscared by the cross looks of the withered pantaloon or spectacled old lady by whom these tempting stores are watched and superintended but in the times we write of the hosiers the glovers the hatters the mercers the milliners and all who dealt in the miscellaneous wares now termed haberdashers goods were to be found in this narrow alley  to return from our digression butler found the outer turnkey a tall thin old man with long silver hair in the act of locking the outward door of the jail he addressed himself to this person and asked admittance to effie deans confined upon accusation of childmurder the turnkey looked at him earnestly and civilly touching his hat out of respect to butlers black coat and clerical appearance replied it was impossible any one could be admitted at present  you shut up earlier than usual probably on account of captain porteouss affair said butler  the turnkey with the true mystery of a person in office gave two grave nods and withdrawing from the wards a ponderous key of about two feet in length he proceeded to shut a strong plate of steel which folded down above the keyhole and was secured by a steel spring and catch butler stood still instinctively while the door was made fast and then looking at his watch walked briskly up the street muttering to himself almost unconsciously                 porta adversa ingens solidoque adamante columnae                vis ut nulla virum non ipsi exscindere ferro                coelicolae valeantstat ferrea turris ad aurasetc                                         drydens virgil book vi   wide is the fronting gate and raised on high with adamantine columns threats the sky vain is the force of man and heavens as vain to crush the pillars which the pile sustain sublime on these a tower of steel is reard  having wasted halfanhour more in a second fruitless attempt to find his legal friend and adviser he thought it time to leave the city and return to his place of residence in a small village about two miles and a half to the southward of edinburgh the metropolis was at this time surrounded by a high wall with battlements and flanking projections at some intervals and the access was through gates called in the scottish language ports which were regularly shut at night a small fee to the keepers would indeed procure egress and ingress at any time through a wicket left for that purpose in the large gate but it was of some importance to a man so poor as butler to avoid even this slight pecuniary mulct and fearing the hour of shutting the gates might be near he made for that to which he found himself nearest although by doing so he somewhat lengthened his walk homewards bristo port was that by which his direct road lay but the west port which leads out of the grassmarket was the nearest of the city gates to the place where he found himself and to that therefore he directed his course he reached the port in ample time to pass the circuit of the walls and entered a suburb called portsburgh chiefly inhabited by the lower order of citizens and mechanics here he was unexpectedly interrupted  he had not gone far from the gate before he heard the sound of a drum and to his great surprise met a number of persons sufficient to occupy the whole front of the street and form a considerable mass behind moving with great speed towards the gate he had just come from and having in front of them a drum beating to arms while he considered how he should escape a party assembled as it might be presumed for no lawful purpose they came full on him and stopped him  are you a clergyman one questioned him  butler replied that he was in orders but was not a placed minister  its mr butler from liberton said a voice from behind hell discharge the duty as weel as ony man  you must turn back with us sir said the first speaker in a tone civil but peremptory  for what purpose gentlemen said mr butler i live at some distance from townthe roads are unsafe by nightyou will do me a serious injury by stopping me  you shall be sent safely homeno man shall touch a hair of your headbut you must and shall come along with us  but to what purpose or end gentlemen said butler i hope you will be so civil as to explain that to me  you shall know that in good time come alongfor come you must by force or fair means and i warn you to look neither to the right hand nor the left and to take no notice of any mans face but consider all that is passing before you as a dream  i would it were a dream i could awaken from said butler to himself but having no means to oppose the violence with which he was threatened he was compelled to turn round and march in front of the rioters two men partly supporting and partly holding him during this parley the insurgents had made themselves masters of the west port rushing upon the waiters so the people were called who had the charge of the gates and possessing themselves of the keys they bolted and barred the folding doors and commanded the person whose duty it usually was to secure the wicket of which they did not understand the fastenings the man terrified at an incident so totally unexpected was unable to perform his usual office and gave the matter up after several attempts the rioters who seemed to have come prepared for every emergency called for torches by the light of which they nailed up the wicket with long nails which it seemed probable they had provided on purpose  while this was going on butler could not even if he had been willing avoid making remarks on the individuals who seemed to lead this singular mob the torchlight while it fell on their forms and left him in the shade gave him an opportunity to do so without their observing him several of those who seemed most active were dressed in sailors jackets trousers and seacaps others in large loosebodied greatcoats and slouched hats and there were several who judging from their dress should have been called women whose rough deep voices uncommon size and masculine deportment and mode of walking forbade them being so interpreted they moved as if by some wellconcerted plan of arrangement they had signals by which they knew and nicknames by which they distinguished each other butler remarked that the name of wildfire was used among them to which one stout amazon seemed to reply  the rioters left a small party to observe the west port and directed the waiters as they valued their lives to remain within their lodge and make no attempt for that night to repossess themselves of the gate they then moved with rapidity along the low street called the cowgate the mob of the city everywhere rising at the sound of their drum and joining them when the multitude arrived at the cowgate port they secured it with as little opposition as the former made it fast and left a small party to observe it it was afterwards remarked as a striking instance of prudence and precaution singularly combined with audacity that the parties left to guard those gates did not remain stationary on their posts but flitted to and fro keeping so near the gates as to see that no efforts were made to open them yet not remaining so long as to have their persons closely observed the mob at first only about one hundred strong now amounted to thousands and were increasing every moment they divided themselves so as to ascend with more speed the various narrow lanes which lead up from the cowgate to the high street and still beating to arms as they went an calling on all true scotsmen to join them they now filled the principal street of the city  the netherbow port might be called the temple bar of edinburgh as intersecting the high street at its termination it divided edinburgh properly so called from the suburb named the canongate as temple bar separates london from westminster it was of the utmost importance to the rioters to possess themselves of this pass because there was quartered in the canongate at that time a regiment of infantry commanded by colonel moyle which might have occupied the city by advancing through this gate and would possess the power of totally defeating their purpose the leaders therefore hastened to the netherbow port which they secured in the same manner and with as little trouble as the other gates leaving a party to watch it strong in proportion to the importance of the post  the next object of these hardy insurgents was at once to disarm the city guard and to procure arms for themselves for scarce any weapons but staves and bludgeons had been yet seen among them the guardhouse was a long low ugly building removed in 1787 which to a fanciful imagination might have suggested the idea of a long black snail crawling up the middle of the high street and deforming its beautiful esplanade this formidable insurrection had been so unexpected that there were no more than the ordinary sergeants guard of the citycorps upon duty even these were without any supply of powder and ball and sensible enough what had raised the storm and which way it was rolling could hardly be supposed very desirous to expose themselves by a valiant defence to the animosity of so numerous and desperate a mob to whom they were on the present occasion much more than usually obnoxious  there was a sentinel upon guard who that one townguard soldier might do his duty on that eventful evening presented his piece and desired the foremost of the rioters to stand off the young amazon whom butler had observed particularly active sprung upon the soldier seized his musket and after a struggle succeeded in wrenching it from him and throwing him down on the causeway one or two soldiers who endeavoured to turn out to the support of their sentinel were in the same manner seized and disarmed and the mob without difficulty possessed themselves of the guardhouse disarming and turning out of doors the rest of the men on duty it was remarked that notwithstanding the city soldiers had been the instruments of the slaughter which this riot was designed to revenge no ill usage or even insult was offered to them it seemed as if the vengeance of the people disdained to stoop at any head meaner than that which they considered as the source and origin of their injuries  on possessing themselves of the guard the first act of the multitude was to destroy the drums by which they supposed an alarm might be conveyed to the garrison in the castle for the same reason they now silenced their own which was beaten by a young fellow son to the drummer of portsburgh whom they had forced upon that service their next business was to distribute among the boldest of the rioters the guns bayonets partisans halberts and battle or lochaber axes until this period the principal rioters had preserved silence on the ultimate object of their rising as being that which all knew but none expressed now however having accomplished all the preliminary parts of their design they raised a tremendous shout of porteous porteous to the tolbooth to the tolbooth   illustration tolbooth cannongate   they proceeded with the same prudence when the object seemed to be nearly in their grasp as they had done hitherto when success was more dubious a strong party of the rioters drawn up in front of the luckenbooths and facing down the street prevented all access from the eastward and the west end of the defile formed by the luckenbooths was secured in the same manner so that the tolbooth was completely surrounded and those who undertook the task of breaking it open effectually secured against the risk of interruption  the magistrates in the meanwhile had taken the alarm and assembled in a tavern with the purpose of raising some strength to subdue the rioters the deacons or presidents of the trades were applied to but declared there was little chance of their authority being respected by the craftsmen where it was the object to save a man so obnoxious mr lindsay member of parliament for the city volunteered the perilous task of carrying a verbal message from the lord provost to colonel moyle the commander of the regiment lying in the canongate requesting him to force the netherbow port and enter the city to put down the tumult but mr lindsay declined to charge himself with any written order which if found on his person by an enraged mob might have cost him his life and the issue of the application was that colonel moyle having no written requisition from the civil authorities and having the fate of porteous before his eyes as an example of the severe construction put by a jury on the proceedings of military men acting on their own responsibility declined to encounter the risk to which the provosts verbal communication invited him  more than one messenger was despatched by different ways to the castle to require the commanding officer to march down his troops to fire a few cannonshot or even to throw a shell among the mob for the purpose of clearing the streets but so strict and watchful were the various patrols whom the rioters had established in different parts of the streets that none of the emissaries of the magistrates could reach the gate of the castle they were however turned back without either injury or insult and with nothing more of menace than was necessary to deter them from again attempting to accomplish their errand  the same vigilance was used to prevent everybody of the higher and those which in this case might be deemed the more suspicious orders of society from appearing in the street and observing the movements or distinguishing the persons of the rioters every person in the garb of a gentleman was stopped by small parties of two or three of the mob who partly exhorted partly required of them that they should return to the place from whence they came many a quadrille table was spoilt that memorable evening for the sedan chairs of ladies even of the highest rank were interrupted in their passage from one point to another in spite of the laced footmen and blazing flambeaux this was uniformly done with a deference and attention to the feelings of the terrified females which could hardly have been expected from the videttes of a mob so desperate those who stopped the chair usually made the excuse that there was much disturbance on the streets and that it was absolutely necessary for the ladys safety that the chair should turn back they offered themselves to escort the vehicles which they had thus interrupted in their progress from the apprehension probably that some of those who had casually united themselves to the riot might disgrace their systematic and determined plan of vengeance by those acts of general insult and license which are common on similar occasions  persons are yet living who remember to have heard from the mouths of ladies thus interrupted on their journey in the manner we have described that they were escorted to their lodgings by the young men who stopped them and even handed out of their chairs with a polite attention far beyond what was consistent with their dress which was apparently that of journeymen mechanics   a near relation of the authors used to tell of having been stopped by the rioters and escorted home in the manner described on reaching her own home one of her attendants in the appearance a baxter a bakers lad handed her out of her chair and took leave with a bow which in the ladys opinion argued breeding that could hardly be learned at the ovens mouth  it seemed as if the conspirators like those who assassinated cardinal beatoun in former days had entertained the opinion that the work about which they went was a judgment of heaven which though unsanctioned by the usual authorities ought to be proceeded in with order and gravity  while their outposts continued thus vigilant and suffered themselves neither from fear nor curiosity to neglect that part of the duty assigned to them and while the main guards to the east and west secured them against interruption a select body of the rioters thundered at the door of the jail and demanded instant admission no one answered for the outer keeper had prudently made his escape with the keys at the commencement of the riot and was nowhere to be found the door was instantly assailed with sledgehammers iron crows and the coulters of ploughs ready provided for the purpose with which they prized heaved and battered for some time with little effect for the door besides being of double oak planks clenched both endlong and athwart with broadheaded nails was so hung and secured as to yield to no means of forcing without the expenditure of much time the rioters however appeared determined to gain admittance gang after gang relieved each other at the exercise for of course only a few could work at once but gang after gang retired exhausted with their violent exertions without making much progress in forcing the prison door butler had been led up near to this the principal scene of action so near indeed that he was almost deafened by the unceasing clang of the heavy forehammers against the ironbound portal of the prison he began to entertain hopes as the task seemed protracted that the populace might give it over in despair or that some rescue might arrive to disperse them there was a moment at which the latter seemed probable  the magistrates having assembled their officers and some of the citizens who were willing to hazard themselves for the public tranquillity now sallied forth from the tavern where they held their sitting and approached the point of danger their officers went before them with links and torches with a herald to read the riotact if necessary they easily drove before them the outposts and videttes of the rioters but when they approached the line of guard which the mob or rather we should say the conspirators had drawn across the street in the front of the luckenbooths they were received with an unintermitted volley of stones and on their nearer approach the pikes bayonets and lochaberaxes of which the populace had possessed themselves were presented against them one of their ordinary officers a strong resolute fellow went forward seized a rioter and took from him a musket but being unsupported he was instantly thrown on his back in the street and disarmed in his turn the officer was too happy to be permitted to rise and run away without receiving any farther injury which afforded another remarkable instance of the mode in which these men had united a sort of moderation towards all others with the most inflexible inveteracy against the object of their resentment the magistrates after vain attempts to make themselves heard and obeyed possessing no means of enforcing their authority were constrained to abandon the field to the rioters and retreat in all speed from the showers of missiles that whistled around their ears  the passive resistance of the tolbooth gate promised to do more to baffle the purpose of the mob than the active interference of the magistrates the heavy sledgehammers continued to din against it without intermission and with a noise which echoed from the lofty buildings around the spot seemed enough to have alarmed the garrison in the castle it was circulated among the rioters that the troops would march down to disperse them unless they could execute their purpose without loss of time or that even without quitting the fortress the garrison might obtain the same end by throwing a bomb or two upon the street  urged by such motives for apprehension they eagerly relieved each other at the labour of assailing the tolbooth door yet such was its strength that it still defied their efforts at length a voice was heard to pronounce the words try it with fire the rioters with an unanimous shout called for combustibles and as all their wishes seemed to be instantly supplied they were soon in possession of two or three empty tarbarrels a huge red glaring bonfire speedily arose close to the door of the prison sending up a tall column of smoke and flame against its antique turrets and stronglygrated windows and illuminating the ferocious and wild gestures of the rioters who surrounded the place as well as the pale and anxious groups of those who from windows in the vicinage watched the progress of this alarming scene the mob fed the fire with whatever they could find fit for the purpose the flames roared and crackled among the heaps of nourishment piled on the fire and a terrible shout soon announced that the door had kindled and was in the act of being destroyed the fire was suffered to decay but long ere it was quite extinguished the most forward of the rioters rushed in their impatience one after another over its yet smouldering remains thick showers of sparkles rose high in the air as man after man bounded over the glowing embers and disturbed them in their passage it was now obvious to butler and all others who were present that the rioters would be instantly in possession of their victim and have it in their power to work their pleasure upon him whatever that might be   note c the old tolbooth     chapter sixth                            the evil you teach us           we will execute and it shall go hard but we will                         better the instruction                                                merchant of venice  the unhappy object of this remarkable disturbance had been that day delivered from the apprehension of public execution and his joy was the greater as he had some reason to question whether government would have run the risk of unpopularity by interfering in his favour after he had been legally convicted by the verdict of a jury of a crime so very obnoxious relieved from this doubtful state of mind his heart was merry within him and he thought in the emphatic words of scripture on a similar occasion that surely the bitterness of death was past some of his friends however who had watched the manner and behaviour of the crowd when they were made acquainted with the reprieve were of a different opinion they augured from the unusual sternness and silence with which they bore their disappointment that the populace nourished some scheme of sudden and desperate vengeance and they advised porteous to lose no time in petitioning the proper authorities that he might be conveyed to the castle under a sufficient guard to remain there in security until his ultimate fate should be determined habituated however by his office to overawe the rabble of the city porteous could not suspect them of an attempt so audacious as to storm a strong and defensible prison and despising the advice by which he might have been saved he spent the afternoon of the eventful day in giving an entertainment to some friends who visited him in jail several of whom by the indulgence of the captain of the tolbooth with whom he had an old intimacy arising from their official connection were even permitted to remain to supper with him though contrary to the rules of the jail  it was therefore in the hour of unalloyed mirth when this unfortunate wretch was full of bread hot with wine and high in mistimed and illgrounded confidence and alas with all his sins full blown when the first distant shouts of the rioters mingled with the song of merriment and intemperance the hurried call of the jailor to the guests requiring them instantly to depart and his yet more hasty intimation that a dreadful and determined mob had possessed themselves of the city gates and guardhouse were the first explanation of these fearful clamours  porteous might however have eluded the fury from which the force of authority could not protect him had he thought of slipping on some disguise and leaving the prison along with his guests it is probable that the jailor might have connived at his escape or even that in the hurry of this alarming contingency he might not have observed it but porteous and his friends alike wanted presence of mind to suggest or execute such a plan of escape the former hastily fled from a place where their own safety seemed compromised and the latter in a state resembling stupefaction awaited in his apartment the termination of the enterprise of the rioters the cessation of the clang of the instruments with which they had at first attempted to force the door gave him momentary relief the flattering hopes that the military had marched into the city either from the castle or from the suburbs and that the rioters were intimidated and dispersing were soon destroyed by the broad and glaring light of the flames which illuminating through the grated window every corner of his apartment plainly showed that the mob determined on their fatal purpose had adopted a means of forcing entrance equally desperate and certain  the sudden glare of light suggested to the stupified and astonished object of popular hatred the possibility of concealment or escape to rush to the chimney to ascend it at the risk of suffocation were the only means which seemed to have occurred to him but his progress was speedily stopped by one of those iron gratings which are for the sake of security usually placed across the vents of buildings designed for imprisonment the bars however which impeded his farther progress served to support him in the situation which he had gained and he seized them with the tenacious grasp of one who esteemed himself clinging to his last hope of existence the lurid light which had filled the apartment lowered and died away the sound of shouts was heard within the walls and on the narrow and winding stair which eased within one of the turrets gave access to the upper apartments of the prison the huzza of the rioters was answered by a shout wild and desperate as their own the cry namely of the imprisoned felons who expecting to be liberated in the general confusion welcomed the mob as their deliverers by some of these the apartment of porteous was pointed out to his enemies the obstacle of the lock and bolts was soon overcome and from his hiding place the unfortunate man heard his enemies search every corner of the apartment with oaths and maledictions which would but shock the reader if we recorded them but which served to prove could it have admitted of doubt the settled purpose of soul with which they sought his destruction  a place of concealment so obvious to suspicion and scrutiny as that which porteous had chosen could not long screen him from detection he was dragged from his lurkingplace with a violence which seemed to argue an intention to put him to death on the spot more than one weapon was directed towards him when one of the rioters the same whose female disguise had been particularly noticed by butler interfered in an authoritative tone are ye mad he said or would ye execute an act of justice as if it were a crime and a cruelty this sacrifice will lose half its savour if we do not offer it at the very horns of the altar we will have him die where a murderer should die on the common gibbetwe will have him die where he spilled the blood of so many innocents  a loud shout of applause followed the proposal and the cry to the gallows with the murdererto the grassmarket with him echoed on all hands  let no man hurt him continued the speaker let him make his peace with god if he can we will not kill both his soul and body  what time did he give better folk for preparing their account answered several voices let us mete to him with the same measure he measured to them  but the opinion of the spokesman better suited the temper of those he addressed a temper rather stubborn than impetuous sedate though ferocious and desirous of colouring their cruel and revengeful action with a show of justice and moderation  for an instant this man quitted the prisoner whom he consigned to a selected guard with instructions to permit him to give his money and property to whomsoever he pleased a person confined in the jail for debt received this last deposit from the trembling hand of the victim who was at the same time permitted to make some other brief arrangements to meet his approaching fate the felons and all others who wished to leave the jail were now at full liberty to do so not that their liberation made any part of the settled purpose of the rioters but it followed as almost a necessary consequence of forcing the jail doors with wild cries of jubilee they joined the mob or disappeared among the narrow lanes to seek out the hidden receptacles of vice and infamy where they were accustomed to lurk and conceal themselves from justice  two persons a man about fifty years old and a girl about eighteen were all who continued within the fatal walls excepting two or three debtors who probably saw no advantage in attempting their escape the persons we have mentioned remained in the strong room of the prison now deserted by all others one of their late companions in misfortune called out to the man to make his escape in the tone of an acquaintance rin for it ratcliffethe roads clear  it may be sae willie answered ratcliffe composedly but i have taen a fancy to leave aff trade and set up for an honest man  stay there and be hanged then for a donnard auld deevil said the other and ran down the prison stair  the person in female attire whom we have distinguished as one of the most active rioters was about the same time at the ear of the young woman flee effie flee was all he had time to whisper she turned towards him an eye of mingled fear affection and upbraiding all contending with a sort of stupified surprise he again repeated flee effie flee for the sake of all thats good and dear to you again she gazed on him but was unable to answer a loud noise was now heard and the name of madge wildfire was repeatedly called from the bottom of the staircase  i am comingi am coming said the person who answered to that appellative and then reiterating hastily for gods sakefor your own sakefor my sake flee or theyll take your life he left the strong room  the girl gazed after him for a moment and then faintly muttering better tyne life since tint is gude fame she sunk her head upon her hand and remained seemingly unconscious as a statue of the noise and tumult which passed around her  that tumult was now transferred from the inside to the outside of the tolbooth the mob had brought their destined victim forth and were about to conduct him to the common place of execution which they had fixed as the scene of his death the leader whom they distinguished by the name of madge wildfire had been summoned to assist at the procession by the impatient shouts of his confederates  i will insure you five hundred pounds said the unhappy man grasping wildfires handfive hundred pounds for to save my life  the other answered in the same undertone and returning his grasp with one equally convulsive five hundredweight of coined gold should not save youremember wilson  a deep pause of a minute ensued when wildfire added in a more composed tone make your peace with heavenwhere is the clergyman  butler who in great terror and anxiety had been detained within a few yards of the tolbooth door to wait the event of the search after porteous was now brought forward and commanded to walk by the prisoners side and to prepare him for immediate death his answer was a supplication that the rioters would consider what they did you are neither judges nor jury said he you cannot have by the laws of god or man power to take away the life of a human creature however deserving he may be of death if it is murder even in a lawful magistrate to execute an offender otherwise than in the place time and manner which the judges sentence prescribes what must it be in you who have no warrant for interference but your own wills in the name of him who is all mercy show mercy to this unhappy man and do not dip your hands in his blood nor rush into the very crime which you are desirous of avenging  cut your sermon shortyou are not in your pulpit answered one of the rioters  if we hear more of your clavers said another we are like to hang you up beside him  peacehush said wildfire do the good man no harmhe discharges his conscience and i like him the better  he then addressed butler now sir we have patiently heard you and we just wish you to understand in the way of answer that you may as well argue to the ashlarwork and iron stanchels of the tolbooth as think to change our purposeblood must have blood we have sworn to each other by the deepest oaths ever were pledged that porteous shall die the death he deserves so richly therefore speak no more to us but prepare him for death as well as the briefness of his change will permit  they had suffered the unfortunate porteous to put on his nightgown and slippers as he had thrown off his coat and shoes in order to facilitate his attempted escape up the chimney in this garb he was now mounted on the hands of two of the rioters clasped together so as to form what is called in scotland the kings cushion butler was placed close to his side and repeatedly urged to perform a duty always the most painful which can be imposed on a clergyman deserving of the name and now rendered more so by the peculiar and horrid circumstances of the criminals case porteous at first uttered some supplications for mercy but when he found that there was no chance that these would be attended to his military education and the natural stubbornness of his disposition combined to support his spirits  are you prepared for this dreadful end said butler in a faltering voice o turn to him in whose eyes time and space have no existence and to whom a few minutes are as a lifetime and a lifetime as a minute  i believe i know what you would say answered porteous sullenly i was bred a soldier if they will murder me without time let my sins as well as my blood lie at their door  who was it said the stern voice of wildfire that said to wilson at this very spot when he could not pray owing to the galling agony of his fetters that his pains would soon be overi say to you to take your own tale home and if you cannot profit by the good mans lessons blame not them that are still more merciful to you than you were to others   illustration the porteous mob95   the procession now moved forward with a slow and determined pace it was enlightened by many blazing links and torches for the actors of this work were so far from affecting any secrecy on the occasion that they seemed even to court observation their principal leaders kept close to the person of the prisoner whose pallid yet stubborn features were seen distinctly by the torchlight as his person was raised considerably above the concourse which thronged around him those who bore swords muskets and battleaxes marched on each side as if forming a regular guard to the procession the windows as they went along were filled with the inhabitants whose slumbers had been broken by this unusual disturbance some of the spectators muttered accents of encouragement but in general they were so much appalled by a sight so strange and audacious that they looked on with a sort of stupified astonishment no one offered by act or word the slightest interruption  the rioters on their part continued to act with the same air of deliberate confidence and security which had marked all their proceedings when the object of their resentment dropped one of his slippers they stopped sought for it and replaced it upon his foot with great deliberation   this little incident characteristic of the extreme composure of this extraordinary mob was witnessed by a lady who disturbed like others from her slumbers had gone to the window it was told to the author by the ladys daughter  as they descended the bow towards the fatal spot where they designed to complete their purpose it was suggested that there should be a rope kept in readiness for this purpose the booth of a man who dealt in cordage was forced open a coil of rope fit for their purpose was selected to serve as a halter and the dealer next morning found that a guinea had been left on his counter in exchange so anxious were the perpetrators of this daring action to show that they meditated not the slightest wrong or infraction of law excepting so far as porteous was himself concerned  leading or carrying along with them in this determined and regular manner the object of their vengeance they at length reached the place of common execution the scene of his crime and destined spot of his sufferings several of the rioters if they should not rather be described as conspirators endeavoured to remove the stone which filled up the socket in which the end of the fatal tree was sunk when it was erected for its fatal purpose others sought for the means of constructing a temporary gibbet the place in which the gallows itself was deposited being reported too secure to be forced without much loss of time butler endeavoured to avail himself of the delay afforded by these circumstances to turn the people from their desperate design for gods sake he exclaimed remember it is the image of your creator which you are about to deface in the person of this unfortunate man wretched as he is and wicked as he may be he has a share in every promise of scripture and you cannot destroy him in impenitence without blotting his name from the book of lifedo not destroy soul and body give time for preparation  what time had they returned a stern voice whom he murdered on this very spotthe laws both of god and man call for his death  but what my friends insisted butler with a generous disregard to his own safetywhat hath constituted you his judges  we are not his judges replied the same person he has been already judged and condemned by lawful authority we are those whom heaven and our righteous anger have stirred up to execute judgment when a corrupt government would have protected a murderer  i am none said the unfortunate porteous that which you charge upon me fell out in selfdefence in the lawful exercise of my duty  away with himaway with him was the general cry  why do you trifle away time in making a gallowsthat dyesters pole is good enough for the homicide  the unhappy man was forced to his fate with remorseless rapidity butler separated from him by the press escaped the last horrors of his struggles unnoticed by those who had hitherto detained him as a prisonerhe fled from the fatal spot without much caring in what direction his course lay a loud shout proclaimed the stern delight with which the agents of this deed regarded its completion butler then at the opening into the low street called the cowgate cast back a terrified glance and by the red and dusky light of the torches he could discern a figure wavering and struggling as it hung suspended above the heads of the multitude and could even observe men striking at it with their lochaberaxes and partisans the sight was of a nature to double his horror and to add wings to his flight  the street down which the fugitive ran opens to one of the eastern ports or gates of the city butler did not stop till he reached it but found it still shut he waited nearly an hour walking up and down in inexpressible perturbation of mind at length he ventured to call out and rouse the attention of the terrified keepers of the gate who now found themselves at liberty to resume their office without interruption butler requested them to open the gate they hesitated he told them his name and occupation  he is a preacher said one i have heard him preach in haddoshole  a fine preaching has he been at the night said another but maybe least said is sunest mended  opening then the wicket of the main gate the keepers suffered butler to depart who hastened to carry his horror and fear beyond the walls of edinburgh his first purpose was instantly to take the road homeward but other fears and cares connected with the news he had learned in that remarkable day induced him to linger in the neighbourhood of edinburgh until daybreak more than one group of persons passed him as he was whiling away the hours of darkness that yet remained whom from the stifled tones of their discourse the unwonted hour when they travelled and the hasty pace at which they walked he conjectured to have been engaged in the late fatal transaction  certain it was that the sudden and total dispersion of the rioters when their vindictive purpose was accomplished seemed not the least remarkable feature of this singular affair in general whatever may be the impelling motive by which a mob is at first raised the attainment of their object has usually been only found to lead the way to farther excesses but not so in the present case they seemed completely satiated with the vengeance they had prosecuted with such stanch and sagacious activity when they were fully satisfied that life had abandoned their victim they dispersed in every direction throwing down the weapons which they had only assumed to enable them to carry through their purpose at daybreak there remained not the least token of the events of the night excepting the corpse of porteous which still hung suspended in the place where he had suffered and the arms of various kinds which the rioters had taken from the city guardhouse which were found scattered about the streets as they had thrown them from their hands when the purpose for which they had seized them was accomplished  the ordinary magistrates of the city resumed their power not without trembling at the late experience of the fragility of its tenure to march troops into the city and commence a severe inquiry into the transactions of the preceding night were the first marks of returning energy which they displayed but these events had been conducted on so secure and wellcalculated a plan of safety and secrecy that there was little or nothing learned to throw light upon the authors or principal actors in a scheme so audacious an express was despatched to london with the tidings where they excited great indignation and surprise in the council of regency and particularly in the bosom of queen caroline who considered her own authority as exposed to contempt by the success of this singular conspiracy nothing was spoke of for some time save the measure of vengeance which should be taken not only on the actors of this tragedy so soon as they should be discovered but upon the magistrates who had suffered it to take place and upon the city which had been the scene where it was exhibited on this occasion it is still recorded in popular tradition that her majesty in the height of her displeasure told the celebrated john duke of argyle that sooner than submit to such an insult she would make scotland a huntingfield in that case madam answered that highspirited nobleman with a profound bow i will take leave of your majesty and go down to my own country to get my hounds ready  the import of the reply had more than met the ear and as most of the scottish nobility and gentry seemed actuated by the same national spirit the royal displeasure was necessarily checked in midvolley and milder courses were recommended and adopted to some of which

were to choose a spot from which the rising or setting sun could be seen to the greatest possible advantage it would be that wild path winding around the foot of the high belt of semicircular rocks called salisbury crags and marking the verge of the steep descent which slopes down into the glen on the southeastern side of the city of edinburgh the prospect in its general outline commands a closebuilt highpiled city stretching itself out beneath in a form which to a romantic imagination may be supposed to represent that of a dragon now a noble arm of the sea with its rocks isles distant shores and boundary of mountains and now a fair and fertile champaign country varied with hill dale and rock and skirted by the picturesque ridge of the pentland mountains but as the path gently circles around the base of the cliffs the prospect composed as it is of these enchanting and sublime objects changes at every step and presents them blended with or divided from each other in every possible variety which can gratify the eye and the imagination when a piece of scenery so beautiful yet so variedso exciting by its intricacy and yet so sublimeis lighted up by the tints of morning or of evening and displays all that variety of shadowy depth exchanged with partial brilliancy which gives character even to the tamest of landscapes the effect approaches near to enchantment this path used to be my favourite evening and morning resort when engaged with a favourite author or new subject of study it is i am informed now become totally impassable a circumstance which if true reflects little credit on the taste of the good town or its leaders   a beautiful and solid pathway has within a few years been formed around these romantic rocks and the author has the pleasure to think that the passage in the text gave rise to the undertaking   it was from this fascinating paththe scene to me of so much delicious musing when life was young and promised to be happy that i have been unable to pass it over without an episodical descriptionit was i say from this romantic path that butler saw the morning arise the day after the murder of porteous it was possible for him with ease to have found a much shorter road to the house to which he was directing his course and in fact that which he chose was extremely circuitous but to compose his own spirits as well as to while away the time until a proper hour for visiting the family without surprise or disturbance he was induced to extend his circuit by the foot of the rocks and to linger upon his way until the morning should be considerably advanced while now standing with his arms across and waiting the slow progress of the sun above the horizon now sitting upon one of the numerous fragments which storms had detached from the rocks above him he is meditating alternately upon the horrible catastrophe which he had witnessed and upon the melancholy and to him most interesting news which he had learned at saddletrees we will give the reader to understand who butler was and how his fate was connected with that of effie deans the unfortunate handmaiden of the careful mrs saddletree  reuben butler was of english extraction though born in scotland his grandfather was a trooper in monks army and one of the party of dismounted dragoons which formed the forlorn hope at the storming of dundee in 1651 stephen butler called from his talents in reading and expounding scripture stephen and bible butler was a stanch independent and received in its fullest comprehension the promise that the saints should inherit the earth as hard knocks were what had chiefly fallen to his share hitherto in the division of this common property he lost not the opportunity which the storm and plunder of a commercial place afforded him to appropriate as large a share of the better things of this world as he could possibly compass it would seem that he had succeeded indifferently well for his exterior circumstances appeared in consequence of this event to have been much mended  the troop to which he belonged was quartered at the village of dalkeith as forming the bodyguard of monk who in the capacity of general for the commonwealth resided in the neighbouring castle when on the eve of the restoration the general commenced his march from scotland a measure pregnant with such important consequences he newmodelled his troops and more especially those immediately about his person in order that they might consist entirely of individuals devoted to himself on this occasion scripture stephen was weighed in the balance and found wanting it was supposed he felt no call to any expedition which might endanger the reign of the military sainthood and that he did not consider himself as free in conscience to join with any party which might be likely ultimately to acknowledge the interest of charles stuart the son of the last man as charles i was familiarly and irreverently termed by them in their common discourse as well as in their more elaborate predications and harangues as the time did not admit of cashiering such dissidents stephen butler was only advised in a friendly way to give up his horse and accoutrements to one of middletons old troopers who possessed an accommodating conscience of a military stamp and which squared itself chiefly upon those of the colonel and paymaster as this hint came recommended by a certain sum of arrears presently payable stephen had carnal wisdom enough to embrace the proposal and with great indifference saw his old corps depart for coldstream on their route for the south to establish the tottering government of england on a new basis  the zone of the extrooper to use horaces phrase was weighty enough to purchase a cottage and two or three fields still known by the name of beersheba within about a scottish mile of dalkeith and there did stephen establish himself with a youthful helpmate chosen out of the said village whose disposition to a comfortable settlement on this side of the grave reconciled her to the gruff manners serious temper and weatherbeaten features of the martial enthusiast stephen did not long survive the falling on evil days and evil tongues of which milton in the same predicament so mournfully complains at his death his consort remained an early widow with a male child of three years old which in the sobriety wherewith it demeaned itself in the oldfashioned and even grim cast of its features and in its sententious mode of expressing itself would sufficiently have vindicated the honour of the widow of beersheba had any one thought proper to challenge the babes descent from bible butler  butlers principles had not descended to his family or extended themselves among his neighbours the air of scotland was alien to the growth of independency however favourable to fanaticism under other colours but nevertheless they were not forgotten and a certain neighbouring laird who piqued himself upon the loyalty of his principles in the worst of times though i never heard they exposed him to more peril than that of a broken head or a nights lodging in the main guard when wine and cavalierism predominated in his upper storey had found it a convenient thing to rake up all matter of accusation against the deceased stephen in this enumeration his religious principles made no small figure as indeed they must have seemed of the most exaggerated enormity to one whose own were so small and so faintly traced as to be well nigh imperceptible in these circumstances poor widow butler was supplied with her full proportion of fines for nonconformity and all the other oppressions of the time until beersheba was fairly wrenched out of her hands and became the property of the laird who had so wantonly as it had hitherto appeared persecuted this poor forlorn woman when his purpose was fairly achieved he showed some remorse or moderation of whatever the reader may please to term it in permitting her to occupy her husbands cottage and cultivate on no very heavy terms a croft of land adjacent her son benjamin in the meanwhile grew up to mass estate and moved by that impulse which makes men seek marriage even when its end can only be the perpetuation of misery he wedded and brought a wife and eventually a son reuben to share the poverty of beersheba  the laird of dumbiedikes had hitherto been moderate in his exactions perhaps because he was ashamed to tax too highly the miserable means of support which remained to the widow butler   dumbiedikes selected as descriptive of the taciturn character of the imaginary owner is really the name of a house bordering on the kings park so called because the late mr braidwood an instructor of the deaf and dumb resided there with his pupils the situation of the real house is different from that assigned to the ideal mansion  but when a stout active young fellow appeared as the labourer of the croft in question dumbiedikes began to think so broad a pair of shoulders might bear an additional burden he regulated indeed his management of his dependants who fortunately were but few in number much upon the principle of the carters whom he observed loading their carts at a neighbouring coalhill and who never failed to clap an additional brace of hundredweights on their burden so soon as by any means they had compassed a new horse of somewhat superior strength to that which had broken down the day before however reasonable this practice appeared to the laird of dumbiedikes he ought to have observed that it may be overdone and that it infers as a matter of course the destruction and loss of both horse and cart and loading even so it befell when the additional prestations came to be demanded of benjamin butler a man of few words and few ideas but attached to beersheba with a feeling like that which a vegetable entertains to the spot in which it chances to be planted he neither remonstrated with the laird nor endeavoured to escape from him but toiling night and day to accomplish the terms of his taskmaster fell into a burning fever and died his wife did not long survive him and as if it had been the fate of this family to be left orphans our reuben butler was about the year 17045 left in the same circumstances in which his father had been placed and under the same guardianship being that of his grandmother the widow of monks old trooper  the same prospect of misery hung over the head of another tenant of this hardhearted lord of the soil this was a tough trueblue presbyterian called deans who though most obnoxious to the laird on account of principles in church and state contrived to maintain his ground upon the estate by regular payment of mailduties kain arriage carriage dry multure lock gowpen and knaveship and all the various exactions now commuted for money and summed up in the emphatic word rent but the years 1700 and 1701 long remembered in scotland for dearth and general distress subdued the stout heart of the agricultural whig citations by the groundofficer decreets of the baron court sequestrations poindings of outside and inside plenishing flew about his ears as fast as the tory bullets whistled around those of the covenanters at pentland bothwell brigg or airsmoss struggle as he might and he struggled gallantly douce david deans was routed horse and foot and lay at the mercy of his grasping landlord just at the time that benjamin butler died the fate of each family was anticipated but they who prophesied their expulsion to beggary and ruin were disappointed by an accidental circumstance  on the very termday when their ejection should have taken place when all their neighbours were prepared to pity and not one to assist them the minister of the parish as well as a doctor from edinburgh received a hasty summons to attend the laird of dumbiedikes both were surprised for his contempt for both faculties had been pretty commonly his theme over an extra bottle that is to say at least once every day the leech for the soul and he for the body alighted in the court of the little old manorhouse at almost the same time and when they had gazed a moment at each other with some surprise they in the same breath expressed their conviction that dumbiedikes must needs be very ill indeed since he summoned them both to his presence at once ere the servant could usher them to his apartment the party was augmented by a man of law nichil novit writing himself procurator before the sheriffcourt for in those days there were no solicitors this latter personage was first summoned to the apartment of the laird where after some short space the soulcurer and the bodycurer were invited to join him  dumbiedikes had been by this time transported into the best bedroom used only upon occasions of death and marriage and called from the former of these occupations the deadroom there were in this apartment besides the sick person himself and mr novit the son and heir of the patient a tall gawky sillylooking boy of fourteen or fifteen and a housekeeper a good buxom figure of a woman betwixt forty and fifty who had kept the keys and managed matters at dumbiedikes since the ladys death it was to these attendants that dumbiedikes addressed himself pretty nearly in the following words temporal and spiritual matters the care of his health and his affairs being strangely jumbled in a head which was never one of the clearest  these are sair times wi me gentlemen and neighbours amaist as ill as at the aughtynine when i was rabbled by the collegeaners   immediately previous to the revolution the students at the edinburgh college were violent anticatholics they were strongly suspected of burning the house of prestonfield

made the very attorney shudder he tried his hand at ghostly advice probably for the first time in his life and recommended as an opiate for the agonised conscience of the laird reparation of the injuries he had done to these distressed families which he observed by the way the civil law called restitutio in integrum but mammon was struggling with remorse for retaining his place in a bosom he had so long possessed and he partly succeeded as an old tyrant proves often too strong for his insurgent rebels  i canna dot he answered with a voice of despair it would kill me to dothow can ye bid

gaun lad  after these contradictory instructions the laird felt his mind so much at ease that he drank three bumpers of brandy continuously and soughed awa as jenny expressed it in an attempt to sing deil stick the minister  his death made a revolution in favour of the distressed families john dumbie now of dumbiedikes in his own right seemed to be close and selfish enough but wanted the grasping spirit and active mind of his father and his guardian happened to agree with him in opinion that his fathers dying recommendation should be attended to the tenants therefore were not actually turned out of doors among the snowwreaths and were allowed wherewith to procure buttermilk and peasbannocks which they ate under the full force of the original malediction the cottage of deans called woodend was not very distant from that at beersheba formerly there had been but little intercourse between the families deans was a sturdy scotsman with all sort of prejudices against the southern and the spawn of the southern moreover deans was as we have said a stanch presbyterian of the most rigid and unbending adherence to what he conceived to be the only possible straight line as he was wont to express himself between righthand heats and extremes and lefthand defections and therefore he held in high dread and horror all independents and whomsoever he supposed allied to them  but notwithstanding these national prejudices and religious professions deans and the widow butler were placed in such a situation as naturally and at length created some intimacy between the families they had shared a common danger and a mutual deliverance they needed each others assistance like a company who crossing a mountain stream are compelled to cling close together lest the current should be too powerful for any who are not thus supported  on nearer acquaintance too deans abated some of his prejudices he found old mrs butler though not thoroughly grounded in the extent and bearing of the real testimony against the defections of the times had no opinions in favour of the independent party neither was she an englishwoman therefore it was to be hoped that though she was the widow of an enthusiastic corporal of cromwells dragoons her grandson might be neither schismatic nor antinational two qualities concerning which goodman deans had as wholesome a terror as against papists and malignants above all for douce davie deans had his weak side he perceived that widow butler looked up to him with reverence listened to his advice and compounded for an occasional fling at the doctrines of her deceased husbands to which as we have seen she was by no means warmly attached in consideration of the valuable counsels which the presbyterian afforded her for the management of her little farm these usually concluded with they may do otherwise in england neighbour butler for aught i ken or it may be different in foreign parts or they wha think differently on the great foundation of our covenanted reformation overturning and mishguggling the government and discipline of the kirk and breaking down the carved work of our zion might be for sawing the craft wi aits but i say peace peace and as his advice was shrewd and sensible though conceitedly given it was received with gratitude and followed with respect  the intercourse which took place betwixt the families at beersheba and woodend became strict and intimate at a very early period betwixt reuben butler with whom the reader is already in some degree acquainted and jeanie deans the only child of douce davie deans by his first wife that singular christian woman as he was wont to express himself whose name was savoury to all that knew her for a desirable professor christian menzies in hochmagirdle the manner of which intimacy and the consequences thereof we now proceed to relate     chapter eighth                 reuben and rachel though as fond as doves               were yet discreet and cautious in their loves               nor would attend to cupids wild commands               till cool reflection bade them join their hands               when both were poor they thought it argued ill                 of hasty love to make them poorer still                                       crabbes parish register  while widow butler and widower deans struggled with poverty and the hard and sterile soil of those parts and portions of the lands of dumbiedikes which it was their lot to occupy it became gradually apparent that deans was to gain the strife and his ally in the conflict was to lose it the former was a man and not much past the prime of lifemrs butler a woman and declined into the vale of years this indeed ought in time to have been balanced by the circumstance that reuben was growing up to assist his grandmothers labours and that jeanie deans as a girl could be only supposed to add to her fathers burdens but douce davie deans know better things and so schooled and trained the young minion as he called her that from the time she could walk upwards she was daily employed in some task or other suitable to her age and capacity a circumstance which added to her fathers daily instructions and lectures tended to give her mind even when a child a grave serious firm and reflecting cast an uncommonly strong and healthy temperament free from all nervous affection and every other irregularity which attacking the body in its more noble functions so often influences the mind tended greatly to establish this fortitude simplicity and decision of character  on the other hand reuben was weak in constitution and though not timid in temper might be safely pronounced anxious doubtful and apprehensive he partook of the temperament of his mother who had died of a consumption in early age he was a pale thin feeble sickly boy and somewhat lame from an accident in early youth he was besides the child of a doting grandmother whose too solicitous attention to him soon taught him a sort of diffidence in himself with a disposition to overrate his own importance which is one of the very worst consequences that children deduce from overindulgence  still however the two children clung to each others society not more from habit than from taste they herded together the handful of sheep with the two or three cows which their parents turned out rather to seek food than actually to feed upon the unenclosed common of dumbiedikes it was there that the two urchins might be seen seated beneath a blooming bush of whin their little faces laid close together under the shadow of the same plaid drawn over both their heads while the landscape around was embrowned by an overshadowing cloud big with the shower which had driven the children to shelter on other occasions they went together to school the boy receiving that encouragement and example from his companion in crossing the little brooks which intersected their path and encountering cattle dogs and other perils upon their journey which the male sex in such cases usually consider it as their prerogative to extend to the weaker but when seated on the benches of the schoolhouse they began to con their lessons together reuben who was as much superior to jeanie deans in acuteness of intellect as inferior to her in firmness of constitution and in that insensibility to fatigue and danger which depends on the conformation of the nerves was able fully to requite the kindness and countenance with which in other circumstances she used to regard him he was decidedly the best scholar at the little parish school and so gentle was his temper and disposition that he was rather admired than envied by the little mob who occupied the noisy mansion although he was the declared favourite of the master several girls in particular for in scotland they are taught with the boys longed to be kind to and comfort the sickly lad who was so much cleverer than his companions the character of reuben butler was so calculated as to offer scope both for their sympathy and their admiration the feelings perhaps through which the female sex the more deserving part of them at least is more easily attached  but reuben naturally reserved and distant improved none of these advantages and only became more attached to jeanie deans as the enthusiastic approbation of his master assured him of fair prospects in future life and awakened his ambition in the meantime every advance that reuben made in learning and considering his opportunities they were uncommonly great rendered him less capable of attending to the domestic duties of his grandmothers farm while studying the pons asinorum in euclid he suffered every cuddie upon the common to trespass upon a large field of peas belonging to the laird and nothing but the active exertions of jeanie deans with her little dog dustiefoot could have saved great loss and consequent punishment similar miscarriages marked his progress in his classical studies he read virgils georgics till he did not know bere from barley and had nearly destroyed the crofts of beersheba while attempting to cultivate them according to the practice of columella and cato the censor  these blunders occasioned grief to his granddame and disconcerted the good opinion which her neighbour davie deans had for some time entertained of reuben  i see naething ye can make of that silly callant neighbour butler said he to the old lady unless ye train him to the wark o the ministry and neer was there mair need of poorfu preachers than een now in these cauld gallio days when mens hearts are hardened like the nether millstone till they come to regard none of these things its evident this puir callant of yours will never be able to do an usefu days wark unless it be as an ambassador from our master and i will make it my business to procure a license when he is fit for the same trusting he will be a shaft cleanly polished and meet to be used in the body of the kirk and that he shall not turn again like the sow to wallow in the mire of heretical extremes and defections but shall have the wings of a dove though he hath lain among the pots  the poor widow gulped down the affront to her husbands principles implied in this caution and hastened to take butler from the high school and encourage him in the pursuit of mathematics and divinity the only physics and ethics that chanced to be in fashion at the time  jeanie deans was now compelled to part from the companion of her labour her study and her pastime and it was with more than childish feeling that both children regarded the separation but they were young and hope was high and they separated like those who hope to meet again at a more auspicious hour while reuben butler was acquiring at the university of st andrews the knowledge necessary for a clergyman and macerating his body with the privations which were necessary in seeking food for his mind his granddame became daily less able to struggle with her little farm and was at length obliged to throw it up to the new laird of dumbiedikes that great personage was no absolute jew and did not cheat her in making the bargain more than was tolerable he even gave her permission to tenant the house in which she had lived with her husband as long as it should be tenantable only he protested against paying for a farthing of repairs any benevolence which he possessed being of the passive but by no means of the active mood  in the meanwhile from superior shrewdness skill and other circumstances some of them purely accidental davie deans gained a footing in the world the possession of some wealth the reputation of more and a growing disposition to preserve and increase his store for which when he thought upon it seriously he was inclined to blame himself from his knowledge in agriculture as it was then practised he became a sort of favourite with the laird who had no great pleasure either in active sports or in society and was wont to end his daily saunter by calling at the cottage of woodend  being himself a man of slow ideas and confused utterance dumbiedikes used to sit or stand for halfanhour with an old laced hat of his fathers upon his head and an empty tobaccopipe in his mouth with his eyes following jeanie deans or the lassie as he called her through the course of her daily domestic labour while her father after exhausting the subject of bestial of ploughs and of harrows often took an opportunity of going fullsail into controversial subjects to which discussions the dignitary listened with much seeming patience but without making any reply or indeed as most people thought without understanding a single word of what the orator was saying deans indeed denied this stoutly as an insult at once to his own talents for expounding hidden truths of which he was a little vain and to the lairds capacity of understanding them he said dumbiedikes was nane of these flashy gentles wi lace on their skirts and swords at their tails that were rather for riding on horseback to hell than gauging barefooted to heaven he wasna like his fathernae profane companykeepernae swearernae drinkernae frequenter of playhouse or musichouse or dancinghousenae sabbathbreakernae imposer of aiths or bonds or denier of liberty to the flockhe clave to the warld and the warlds gear a wee ower muckle but then there was some breathing of a gale upon his spirit etc etc all this honest davie said and believed  it is not to be supposed that by a father and a man of sense and observation the constant direction of the lairds eyes towards jeanie was altogether unnoticed this circumstance however made a much greater impression upon another member of his family a second helpmate to wit whom he had chosen to take to his bosom ten years after the death of his first some people were of opinion that douce davie had been rather surprised into this step for in general he was no friend to marriages or giving in marriage and seemed rather to regard that state of society as a necessary evila thing lawful and to be tolerated in the imperfect state of our nature but which clipped the wings with which we ought to soar upwards and tethered the soul to its mansion of clay and the creaturecomforts of wife and bairns his own practice however had in this material point varied from his principles since as we have seen he twice knitted for himself this dangerous and ensnaring entanglement  rebecca his spouse had by no means the same horror of matrimony and as she made marriages in imagination for every neighbour round she failed not to indicate a match betwixt dumbiedikes and her stepdaughter jeanie the goodman used regularly to frown and pshaw whenever this topic was touched upon but usually ended by taking his bonnet and walking out of the house to conceal a certain gleam of satisfaction which at such a suggestion involuntarily diffused itself over his austere features  the more youthful part of my readers may naturally ask whether jeanie deans was deserving of this mute attention of the laird of dumbiedikes and the historian with due regard to veracity is compelled to answer that her personal attractions were of no uncommon description she was short and rather too stoutly made for her size had grey eyes light coloured hair a round goodhumoured face much tanned with the sun and her only peculiar charm was an air of inexpressible serenity which a good conscience kind feelings contented temper and the regular discharge of all her duties spread over her features there was nothing it may be supposed very appalling in the form or manners of this rustic heroine yet whether from sheepish bashfulness or from want of decision and imperfect knowledge of his own mind on the subject the laird of dumbiedikes with his old laced hat and empty tobaccopipe came and enjoyed the beatific vision of jeanie deans day after day week after week year after year without proposing to accomplish any of the prophecies of the stepmother  this good lady began to grow doubly impatient on the subject when after having been some years married she herself presented douce davie with another daughter who was named euphemia by corruption effie it was then that rebecca began to turn impatient with the slow pace at which the lairds wooing proceeded judiciously arguing that as lady dumbiedikes would have but little occasion for tocher the principal part of her gudemans substance would naturally descend to the child by the second marriage other stepdames have tried less laudable means for clearing the way to the succession of their own children but rebecca to do her justice only sought little effies advantage through the promotion or which must have generally been accounted such of her elder sister she therefore tried every female art within the compass of her simple skill to bring the laird to a point but had the mortification to perceive that her efforts like those of an unskilful angler only scared the trout she meant to catch upon one occasion in particular when she joked with the laird on the propriety of giving a mistress to the house of dumbiedikes he was so effectually startled that neither laced hat tobaccopipe nor the intelligent proprietor of these movables visited woodend for a fortnight rebecca was therefore compelled to leave the laird to proceed at his own snails pace convinced by experience of the gravediggers aphorism that your dull ass will not mend his pace for beating  reuben in the meantime pursued his studies at the university supplying his wants by teaching the younger lads the knowledge he himself acquired and thus at once gaining the means of maintaining himself at the seat of learning and fixing in his mind the elements of what he had already obtained in this manner as is usual among the poorer students of divinity at scottish universities he contrived not only to maintain himself according to his simple wants but even to send considerable assistance to his sole remaining parent a sacred duty of which the scotch are seldom negligent his progress in knowledge of a general kind as well as in the studies proper to his profession was very considerable but was little remarked owing to the retired modesty of his disposition which in no respect qualified him to set off his learning to the best advantage and thus had butler been a man given to make complaints he had his tale to tell like others of unjust preferences bad luck and hard usage on these subjects however he was habitually silent perhaps from modesty perhaps from a touch of pride or perhaps from a conjunction of both  he obtained his license as a preacher of the gospel with some compliments from the presbytery by whom it was bestowed but this did not lead to any preferment and he found it necessary to make the cottage at beersheba his residence for some months with no other income than was afforded by the precarious occupation of teaching in one or other of the neighbouring families after having greeted his aged grandmother his first visit was to woodend where he was received by jeanie with warm cordiality arising from recollections which had never been dismissed from her mind by rebecca with goodhumoured hospitality and by old deans in a mode peculiar to himself  highly as douce davie honoured the clergy it was not upon each individual of the cloth that he bestowed his approbation and a little jealous perhaps at seeing his youthful acquaintance erected into the dignity of a teacher and preacher he instantly attacked him upon various points of controversy in order to discover whether he might not have fallen into some of the snares defections and desertions of the time butler was not only a man of stanch presbyterian principles but was also willing to avoid giving pain to his old friend by disputing upon points of little importance and therefore he might have hoped to have come like fine gold out of the furnace of davies interrogatories but the result on the mind of that strict investigator was not altogether so favourable as might have been hoped and anticipated old judith butler who had hobbled that evening as far as woodend in order to enjoy the congratulations of her neighbours upon reubens return and upon his high attainments of which she was herself not a little proud was somewhat mortified to find that her old friend deans did not enter into the subject with the warmth she expected at first in he seemed rather silent than dissatisfied and it was not till judith had essayed the subject more than once that it led to the following dialogue  aweel neibor deans i thought ye wad hae been glad to see reuben amang us again poor fellow  i am glad mrs butler was the neighbours concise answer  since he has lost his grandfather and his father praised be him that giveth and taketh i ken nae friend he has in the world thats been sae like a father to him as the sell oye neibor deans  god is the only

tales to tell me fit for naething but to puff up our inward man wi our ain vain acts i stude beside blessed alexander peden when i heard him call the death and testimony of our happy martyrs but draps

glad to see my bairn againthe halts gane now unless he has to walk ower mony miles at a stretch and he has a wee bit colour in his cheek that glads my auld een to see it and he has as decent a black coat as the minister and  i am very heartily glad he is weel and thriving said mr deans with a gravity that seemed intended to cut short the subject but a woman who is bent upon a point is not easily pushed aside from it  and continued mrs butler he can wag his head in a pulpit now neibor deans think but of thatmy ain oeand abody maun sit still and listen to him as if he were the paip of rome  the whatthe whowoman said deans with a sternness far beyond his usual gravity as soon as these offensive words had struck upon the tympanum of his ear  eh guide us said the poor woman i had forgot what an ill will ye had aye at the paip and sae had my puir gudeman stephen butler mony an afternoon he wad sit and take up his testimony again the paip and again baptizing of bairns and the like  woman reiterated deans either speak about what ye ken something o or be silent i say that independency is a foul heresy and anabaptism a damnable and deceiving error whilk suld be rooted out of the land wi the fire o the spiritual and the sword o the civil magistrate  weel weel neibor ill no say that ye mayna be right answered the submissive judith i am sure ye are right about the sawing and the mawing the shearing and the leading and what for suld ye no be right about kirkwark toobut concerning my oe reuben butler  reuben butler gudewife said david with solemnity is a lad i wish heartily weel to even as if he were mine ain sonbut i doubt there will be outs and ins in the track of his walk i muckle fear his gifts will get the heels of his grace he has ower muckle human wit and learning and

something proud o his human gifts and learning whilk enables him to dress up his doctrine in that fine airy dress but added he at seeing the old womans uneasiness at his discourse affliction may gie him a jagg and let the wind out o him as out o a cow thats eaten wet clover and the lad may do weel and be a burning and a shining light and i trust it will be yours to see and his to feel it and that soon  widow butler was obliged to retire unable to make anything more of her neighbour whose discourse though she did not comprehend it filled her with undefined apprehensions on her grandsons account and greatly depressed the joy with which she had welcomed him on his return and it must not be concealed in justice to mr deanss discernment that butler in their conference had made a greater display of his learning than the occasion called for or than was likely to be acceptable to the old man who accustomed to consider himself as a person preeminently entitled to dictate upon theological subjects of controversy felt rather humbled and mortified when learned authorities were placed in array against him in fact butler had not escaped the tinge of pedantry which naturally flowed from his education and was apt on many occasions to make parade of his knowledge when there was no need of such vanity  jeanie deans however found no fault with this display of learning but on the contrary admired it perhaps on the same score that her sex are said to admire men of courage on account of their own deficiency in that qualification the circumstances of their families threw the young people constantly together their old intimacy was renewed though upon a footing better adapted to their age and it became at length understood betwixt them that their union should be deferred no longer than until butler should obtain some steady means of support however humble this however was not a matter speedily to be accomplished plan after plan was formed and plan after plan failed the goodhumoured cheek of jeanie lost the first flush of juvenile freshness reubens brow assumed the gravity of manhood yet the means of obtaining a settlement seemed remote as ever fortunately for the lovers their passion was of no ardent or enthusiastic cast and a sense of duty on both sides induced them to bear with patient fortitude the protracted interval which divided them from each other  in the meanwhile time did not roll on without effecting his usual changes the widow of stephen butler so long the prop of the family of beersheba was gathered to her fathers and rebecca the careful spouse of our friend davie deans was also summoned from her plans of matrimonial and domestic economy the morning after her death reuben butler went to offer his mite of consolation to his old friend and benefactor he witnessed on this occasion a remarkable struggle betwixt the force of natural affection and the religious stoicism which the sufferer thought it was incumbent upon him to maintain under each earthly dispensation whether of weal or woe  on his arrival at the cottage jeanie with her eyes overflowing with tears pointed to the little orchard in which she whispered with broken accents my poor father has been since his misfortune somewhat alarmed at this account butler entered the orchard and advanced slowly towards his old friend who seated in a small rude arbour appeared to be sunk in the extremity of his affliction he lifted his eyes somewhat sternly as butler approached as if offended at the interruption but as the young man hesitated whether he ought to retreat or advance he arose and came forward to meet him with a selfpossessed and even dignified air  young man said the sufferer lay it not to heart though the righteous perish and the merciful are removed seeing it may well be said that they are taken away from the evils to come woe to me were i to shed a tear for the wife of my bosom when i might weep rivers of water for this afflicted church cursed as it is with carnal seekers and with the dead of heart  i am happy said butler that you can forget your private affliction in your regard for public duty  forget reuben said poor deans putting his handkerchief to his eyesshes not to be forgotten on this side of time but he that gives the wound can send the ointment i declare there have been times during this night when my meditation hae been so rapt that i knew not of my heavy loss it has been with me as with the worthy john semple called carspharn john upon a like triali have been this night on the banks of ulai plucking an apple here and there   note e carspharn john  notwithstanding the assumed fortitude of deans which he conceived to be the discharge of a great christian duty he had too good a heart not to suffer deeply under this heavy loss woodend became altogether distasteful to him and as he had obtained both substance and experience by his management of that little farm he resolved to employ them as a dairyfarmer or cowfeeder as they are called in scotland the situation he chose for his new settlement was at a place called saint leonards crags lying betwixt edinburgh and the mountain called arthurs seat and adjoining to the extensive sheep pasture still named the kings park from its having been formerly dedicated to the preservation of the royal game here he rented a small lonely house about halfamile distant from the nearest point of the city but the site of which with all the adjacent ground is now occupied by the buildings which form the southeastern suburb an extensive pastureground adjoining which deans rented from the keeper of the royal park enabled him to feed his milkcows and the unceasing industry and activity of jeanie his oldest daughter were exerted in making the most of their produce  she had now less frequent opportunities of seeing reuben who had been obliged after various disappointments to accept the subordinate situation of assistant in a parochial school of some eminence at three or four miles distance from the city here he distinguished himself and became acquainted with several respectable burgesses who on account of health or other reasons chose that their children should commence their education in this little village his prospects were thus gradually brightening and upon each visit which he paid at saint leonards he had an opportunity of gliding a hint to this purpose into jeanies ear these visits were necessarily very rare on account of the demands which the duties of the school made upon butlers time nor did he dare to make them even altogether so frequent as these avocations would permit deans received him with civility indeed and even with kindness but reuben as is usual in such cases imagined that he read his purpose in his eyes and was afraid too premature an explanation on the subject would draw down his positive disapproval upon the whole therefore he judged it prudent to call at saint leonards just so frequently as old acquaintance and neighbourhood seemed to authorise and no oftener there was another person who was more regular in his visits   illustration the laird in jeanies cottage130   when davie deans intimated to the laird of dumbiedikes his purpose of quitting wi the land and house at woodend the laird stared and said nothing he made his usual visits at the usual hour without remark until the day before the term when observing the bustle of moving furniture already commenced the great eastcountry awmrie dragged out of its nook and standing with its shoulder to the company like an awkward booby about to leave the room the laird again stared mightily and was heard to ejaculatehegh sirs even after the day of departure was past and gone the laird of dumbiedikes at his usual hour which was that at which david deans was wont to loose the pleugh presented himself before the closed door of the cottage at woodend and seemed as much astonished at finding it shut against his approach as if it was not exactly what he had to expect on this occasion he was heard to ejaculate gude guide us which by those who knew him was considered as a very unusual mark of emotion from that moment forward dumbiedikes became an altered man and the regularity of his movements hitherto so exemplary was as totally disconcerted as those of a boys watch when he has broken the mainspring like the index of the said watch did dumbiedikes spin round the whole bounds of his little property which may be likened unto the dial of the timepiece with unwonted velocity there was not a cottage into which he did not enter nor scarce a maiden on whom he did not stare but so it was that although there were better farmhouses on the land than woodend and certainly much prettier girls than jeanie deans yet it did somehow befall that the blank in the lairds time was not so pleasantly filled up as it had been there was no seat accommodated him so well as the bunker at woodend and no face he loved so much to gaze on as jeanie deanss so after spinning round and round his little orbit and then remaining stationary for a week it seems to have occurred to him that he was not pinned down to circulate on a pivot like the hands of the watch but possessed the power of shifting his central point and extending his circle if he thought proper to realise which privilege of change of place he bought a pony from a highland drover and with its assistance and company stepped or rather stumbled as far as saint leonards crags  jeanie deans though so much accustomed to the lairds staring that she was sometimes scarce conscious of his presence had nevertheless some occasional fears lest he should call in the organ of speech to back those expressions of admiration which he bestowed on her through his eyes should this happen farewell she thought to all chance of a union with butler for her father however stouthearted and independent in civil and religious principles was not without that respect for the laird of the land so deeply imprinted on the scottish tenantry of the period moreover if he did not positively dislike butler yet his fund of carnal learning was often the object of sarcasms on davids part which were perhaps founded in jealousy and which certainly indicated no partiality for the party against whom they were launched and lastly the match with dumbiedikes would have presented irresistible charms to one who used to complain that he felt himself apt to take ower grit an armfu o the warld so that upon the whole the lairds diurnal visits were disagreeable to jeanie from apprehension of future consequences and it served much to console her upon removing from the spot where she was bred and born that she had seen the last of dumbiedikes his laced hat and tobaccopipe the poor girl no more expected he could muster courage to follow her to saint leonards crags than that any of her appletrees or cabbages which she had left rooted in the yard at woodend would spontaneously and unaided have undertaken the same journey it was therefore with much more surprise than pleasure that on the sixth day after their removal to saint leonards she beheld dumbiedikes arrive laced hat tobaccopipe and all and with the selfsame greeting of hows a wi ye jeaniewhares the gudeman assume as nearly as he could the same position in the cottage at saint leonards which he had so long and so regularly occupied at woodend he was no sooner however seated than with an unusual exertion of his powers of conversation he added jeaniei say jeanie womanhere he extended his hand towards her shoulder with all the fingers spread out as if to clutch it but in so bashful and awkward a manner that when she whisked herself beyond its reach the paw remained suspended in the air with the palm open like the claw of a heraldic griffinjeanie continued the swain in this moment of inspirationi say jeanie its a braw day outby and the roads are no that ill for boothose   illustration jeaniei say jeanie woman133   the deils in the daidling body muttered jeanie between her teeth wha wad hae thought o his daikering out this length and she afterwards confessed that she threw a little of this ungracious sentiment into her accent and manner for her father being abroad and the body as she irreverently termed the landed proprietor looking unco gleg and canty she didna ken what he might be coming out wi next  her frowns however acted as a complete sedative and the laird relapsed from that day into his former taciturn habits visiting the cowfeeders cottage three or four times every week when the weather permitted with apparently no other purpose than to stare at jeanie deans while douce davie poured forth his eloquence upon the controversies and testimonies of the day     chapter ninth                 her air her manners all who saw admired               courteous though coy and gentle though retired               the joy of youth and health her eyes displayed               and ease of heart her every look conveyed                                                        crabbe  the visits of the laird thus again sunk into matters of ordinary course from which nothing was to be expected or apprehended if a lover could have gained a fair one as a snake is said to fascinate a bird by pertinaciously gazing on her with great stupid greenish eyes which began now to be occasionally aided by spectacles unquestionably dumbiedikes would have been the person to perform the feat but the art of fascination seems among the artes perditae and i cannot learn that this most pertinacious of starers produced any effect by his attentions beyond an occasional yawn  in the meanwhile the object of his gaze was gradually attaining the verge of youth and approaching to what is called in females the middle age which is impolitely held to begin a few years earlier with their more fragile sex than with men many people would have been of opinion that the laird would have done better to have transferred his glances to an object possessed of far superior charms to jeanies even when jeanies were in their bloom who began now to be distinguished by all who visited the cottage at st leonards crags  effie deans under the tender and affectionate care of her sister had now shot up into a beautiful and blooming girl her grecian shaped head was profusely rich in waving ringlets of brown hair which confined by a blue snood of silk and shading a laughing hebe countenance seemed the picture of health pleasure and contentment her brown russet shortgown set off a shape which time perhaps might be expected to render too robust the frequent objection to scottish beauty but which in her present early age was slender and taper with that graceful and easy sweep of outline which at once indicates health and beautiful proportion of parts  these growing charms in all their juvenile profusion had no power to shake the steadfast mind or divert the fixed gaze of the constant laird of dumbiedikes but there was scarce another eye that could behold this living picture of health and beauty without pausing on it with pleasure the traveller stopped his weary horse on the eve of entering the city which was the end of his journey to gaze at the sylphlike form that tripped by him with her milkpail poised on her head bearing herself so erect and stepping so light and free under her burden that it seemed rather an ornament than an encumbrance the lads of the neighbouring suburb who held their evening rendezvous for putting the stone casting the hammer playing at long bowls and other athletic exercises watched the motions of effie deans and contended with each other which should have the good fortune to attract her attention even the rigid presbyterians of her fathers persuasion who held each indulgence of the eye and sense to be a snare at least if not a crime were surprised into a moments delight while gazing on a creature so exquisiteinstantly checked by a sigh reproaching at once their own weakness and mourning that a creature so fair should share in the common and hereditary guilt and imperfection of our nature which she deserved as much by her guileless purity of thought speech and action as by her uncommon loveliness of face and person  yet there were points in effies character which gave rise not only to strange doubt and anxiety on the part of douce david deans whose ideas were rigid as may easily be supposed upon the subject of youthful amusements but even of serious apprehension to her more indulgent sister the children of the scotch of the inferior classes are usually spoiled by the early indulgence of their parents how wherefore and to what degree the lively and instructive narrative of the amiable and accomplished authoress of glenburnie has saved me and all future scribblers the trouble of recording   the late mrs elizabeth hamilton  effie had had a double share of this inconsiderate and misjudged kindness even the strictness of her fathers principles could not condemn the sports of infancy and childhood and to the good old man his younger daughter the child of his old age seemed a child for some years after she attained the years of womanhood was still called the bit lassie and little effie and was permitted to run up and down uncontrolled unless upon the sabbath or at the times of family worship her sister with all the love and care of a mother could not be supposed to possess the same authoritative influence and that which she had hitherto exercised became gradually limited and diminished as effies advancing years entitled her in her own conceit at least to the right of independence and free agency with all the innocence and goodness of disposition therefore which we have described the lily of st leonards possessed a little fund of selfconceit and obstinacy and some warmth and irritability of temper partly natural perhaps but certainly much increased by the unrestrained freedom of her childhood her character will be best illustrated by a cottage evening scene  the careful father was absent in his wellstocked byre foddering those useful and patient animals on whose produce his living depended and the summer evening was beginning to close in when jeanie deans began to be very anxious for the appearance of her sister and to fear that she would not reach home before her father returned from the labour of the evening when it was his custom to have family exercise and when she knew that effies absence would give him the most serious displeasure these apprehensions hung heavier upon her mind because for several preceding evenings effie had disappeared about the same time and her stay at first so brief as scarce to be noticed had been gradually protracted to halfanhour and an hour and on the present occasion had considerably exceeded even this last limit and now jeanie stood at the door with her hand before her eyes to avoid the rays of the level sun and looked alternately along the various tracks which led towards their dwelling to see if she could descry the nymphlike form of her sister there was a wall and a stile which separated the royal domain or kings park as it is called from the public road to this pass she frequently directed her attention when she saw two persons appear there somewhat suddenly as if they had walked close by the side of the wall to screen themselves from observation one of them a man drew back hastily the other a female crossed the stile and advanced towards herit was effie she met her sister with that affected liveliness of manner which in her rank and sometimes in those above it females occasionally assume to hide surprise or confusion and she carolled as she came                      the elfin knight sate on the brae                     the broom grows bonny the broom grows fair                     and by there came lilting a lady so gay                     and we daurna gang down to the broom nae mair  whisht effie said her sister our fathers coming out o the byre the damsel stinted in her songwhare hae ye been sae late at een  its no late lass answered effie  its chappit eight on every clock o the town and the suns gaun down ahint the corstorphine hillswhare can

folk out sae late at een effie  what needs ye be aye speering then at folk retorted effie im sure if yell ask nae questions ill tell ye nae lees i never ask what brings the laird of dumbiedikes glowering here like a wullcat only his eens greener and no sae gleg day after day till we are a like to gaunt our charts aft  because ye ken very weel he comes to see our father said jeanie in answer to this pert remark  and dominie butlerdoes he come to see our father thats sae taen wi his latin words said effie delighted to find that by carrying the war into the enemys country she could divert the threatened attack upon herself and with the petulance of youth she pursued her triumph over her prudent elder sister she looked at her with a sly air in which there was something like irony as she chanted in a low but marked tone a scrap of an old scotch song                      through the kirkyard                     i met wi the laird                     the silly puir body he said me nae harm                     but just ere twas dark                     i met wi the clerk  here the songstress stopped looked full at her sister and observing the tears gather in her eyes she suddenly flung her arms round her neck and kissed them away jeanie though hurt and displeased was unable to resist the caresses of this untaught child of nature whose good and evil seemed to flow rather from impulse than from reflection but as she returned the sisterly kiss in token of perfect reconciliation she could not suppress the gentle reproofeffie if ye will learn fule sangs ye might make a kinder use of them  and so i might jeanie continued the girl clinging to her sisters neck and i wish i had never learned ane o themand i wish we had never come hereand i wish my tongue had been blistered or i had vexed ye  never mind that effie replied the affectionate sister i canna be muckle vexed wi ony thing ye say to mebut o dinna vex our father  i will noti will not replied effie and if there were as mony dances the morns night as there are merry dancers in the north firmament on a frosty een i winna budge an inch to gang near ane o them  dance echoed jeanie deans in astonishment o effie what could take ye to a dance  it is very possible that in the communicative mood into which the lily of st leonards was now surprised she might have given her sister her unreserved confidence and saved me the pain of telling a melancholy tale but at the moment the word dance was uttered it reached the ear of old david deans who had turned the corner of the house and came upon his daughters ere they were aware of his presence the word prelate or even the word pope could hardly have produced so appalling an effect upon davids ear for of all exercises that of dancing which he termed a voluntary and regular fit of distraction he deemed most destructive of serious thoughts and the readiest inlet to all sorts of licentiousness and he accounted the encouraging and even permitting assemblies or meetings whether among those of high or low degree for this fantastic and absurd purpose or for that of dramatic representations as one of the most flagrant proofs of defection and causes of wrath the pronouncing of the word dance by his own daughters and at his own door now drove him beyond the verge of patience dance he exclaimed dancedance said ye i daur ye limmers that ye are to name sic a word at my doorcheek its a dissolute profane pastime practised by the israelites only at their base and brutal worship of the golden calf at bethel and by the unhappy lass wha danced aff the head of john the baptist upon whilk chapter i will exercise this night for your farther instruction since ye need it sae muckle nothing doubting that she has cause to rue the day lang or this time that eer she suld hae shook a limb on sic an errand better for her to hae been born a cripple and carried frae door to door like auld bessie bowie begging bawbees than to be a kings daughter fiddling and flinging the gate she did i hae often wondered that ony ane that ever bent a knee for the right purpose should ever daur to crook a hough to fyke and fling at pipers wind and fiddlers squealing and i bless god with that singular worthy peter walker the packman at bristoport that ordered my lot in my dancing days so that fear of my head and throat dread of bloody rope and swift bullet and trenchant swords and pain of boots and thumkins cauld and hunger wetness and weariness stopped the lightness of my head and the wantonness of my feet   note f peter walker  and now if i hear ye quean lassies sae muckle as name dancing or think theres sic a thing in this warld as flinging to fiddlers sounds and pipers springs as sure as my fathers spirit is with the just ye shall be no more either charge or concern of mine gang in thengang in then hinnies he added in a softer tone for the tears of both daughters but especially those of effie began to flow very fastgang in dears and well seek grace to preserve us frae all manner of profane folly whilk causeth to sin and promoteth the kingdom of darkness warring with the kingdom of light  the objurgation of david deans however well meant was unhappily timed it created a division of feelings in effies bosom and deterred her from her intended confidence in her sister she wad hand me nae better than the dirt below her feet said effie to herself were i to confess i hae danced wi him four times on the green down by and ance at maggie macqueenss and shell maybe hing it ower my head that shell tell my father and then she wad be mistress and mair but ill no gang back there again im resolved ill no gang back ill lay in a leaf of my bible and thats very near as if i had made an aith that i winna gang back   this custom of making a mark by folding a leaf in the partys bible when a solemn resolution is formed is still held to be in some sense an appeal to heaven for his or her sincerity  and she kept her vow for a week during which she was unusually cross and fretful blemishes which had never before been observed in her temper except during a moment of contradiction  there was something in all this so mysterious as considerably to alarm the prudent and affectionate jeanie the more so as she judged it unkind to her sister to mention to their father grounds of anxiety which might arise from her own imagination besides her respect for the good old man did not prevent her from being aware that he was both hottempered and positive and she sometimes suspected that he carried his dislike to youthful amusements beyond the verge that religion and reason demanded jeanie had sense enough to see that a sudden and severe curb upon her sisters hitherto unrestrained freedom might be rather productive of harm than good and that effie in the headstrong wilfulness of youth was likely to make what might be overstrained in her fathers precepts an excuse to herself for neglecting them altogether in the higher classes a damsel however giddy is still under the dominion of etiquette and subject to the surveillance of mammas and chaperons but the country girl who snatches her moment of gaiety during the intervals of labour is under no such guardianship or restraint and her amusement becomes so much the more hazardous jeanie saw all this with much distress of mind when a circumstance occurred which appeared calculated to relieve her anxiety  mrs saddletree with whom our readers have already been made acquainted chanced to be a distant relation of douce david deans and as she was a woman orderly in her life and conversation and moreover of good substance a sort of acquaintance was formally kept up between the families now this careful dame about a year and a half before our story commences chanced to need in the line of her profession a better sort of servant or rather shopwoman mr saddletree she said was never in the shop when he could get his nose within the parliament house and it was an awkward thing for a womanbody to be standing among bundles o barkened leather her lane selling saddles and bridles and she had cast her eyes upon her farawa cousin effie deans as just the very sort of lassie she would want to keep her in countenance on such occasions  in this proposal there was much that pleased old davidthere was bed board and bountithit was a decent situationthe lassie would be under mrs saddletrees eye who had an upright walk and lived close by the tolbooth kirk in which might still be heard the comforting doctrines of one of those few ministers of the kirk of scotland who had not bent the knee unto baal according to davids expression or become accessory to the course of national defectionsunion toleration patronages and a bundle of prelatical erastian oaths which had been imposed on the church since the revolution and particularly in the reign of the late woman as he called queen anne the last of that unhappy race of stuarts in the good mans security concerning the soundness of the theological doctrine which his daughter was to hear he was nothing disturbed on account of the snares of a different kind to which a creature so beautiful young and wilful might be exposed in the centre of a populous and corrupted city the fact is that he thought with so much horror on all approaches to irregularities of the nature most to be dreaded in such cases that he would as soon have suspected and guarded against effies being induced to become guilty of the crime of murder he only regretted that she should live under the same roof with such a worldlywise man as bartoline saddletree whom david never suspected of being an ass as he was but considered as one really endowed with all the legal knowledge to which he made pretension and only liked him the worse for possessing it the lawyers especially those amongst them who sate as ruling elders in the general assembly of the kirk had been forward in promoting the measures of patronage of the abjuration oath and others which in the opinion of david deans were a breaking down of the carved work of the sanctuary and an intrusion upon the liberties of the kirk upon the dangers of listening to the doctrines of a legalised formalist such as saddletree david gave his daughter many lectures so much so that he had time to touch but slightly on the dangers of chambering companykeeping and promiscuous dancing to which at her time of life most people would have thought effie more exposed than to the risk of theoretical error in her religious faith  jeanie parted from her sister with a mixed feeling of regret and apprehension and hope she could not be so confident concerning effies prudence as her father for she had observed her more narrowly had more sympathy with her feelings and could better estimate the temptations to which she was exposed on the other hand mrs saddletree was an observing shrewd notable woman entitled to exercise over effie the full authority of a mistress and likely to do so strictly yet with kindness her removal to saddletrees it was most probable would also serve to break off some idle acquaintances which jeanie suspected her sister to have formed in the neighbouring suburb upon the whole then she viewed her departure from saint leonards with pleasure and it was not until the very moment of their parting for the first time in their lives that she felt the full force of sisterly sorrow while they repeatedly kissed each others cheeks and wrung each others hands jeanie took that moment of affectionate sympathy to press upon her sister the necessity of the utmost caution in her conduct while residing in edinburgh effie listened without once raising her large dark eyelashes from which the drops fell so fast as almost to resemble a fountain at the conclusion she sobbed again kissed her sister promised to recollect all the good counsel she had given her and they parted  during the first weeks effie was all that her kinswoman expected and even more but with time there came a relaxation of that early zeal which she manifested in mrs saddletrees service to borrow once again from the poet who so correctly and beautifully describes living manners                  something there waswhat none presumed to say                clouds lightly passing on a summers day                whispers and hints which went from ear to ear                and mixed reports no judge on earth could clear  during this interval mrs saddletree was sometimes displeased by effies lingering when she was sent upon errands about the shop business and sometimes by a little degree of impatience which she manifested at being rebuked on such occasions but she goodnaturedly allowed that the first was very natural to a girl to whom everything in edinburgh was new and the other was only the petulance of a spoiled child when subjected to the yoke of domestic discipline for the first time attention and submission could not be learned at onceholyrood was not built in a dayuse would make perfect  it seemed as if the considerate old lady had presaged truly ere many months had passed effie became almost wedded to her duties though she no longer discharged them with the laughing cheek and light step which had at first attracted every customer her mistress sometimes observed her in tears but they were signs of secret sorrow which she concealed as often as she saw them attract notice time wore on her cheek grew pale and her step heavy the cause of these changes could not have escaped the matronly eye of mrs saddletree but she was chiefly confined by indisposition to her bedroom for a considerable time during the latter part of effies service this interval was marked by symptoms of anguish almost amounting to despair the utmost efforts of the poor girl to command her fits of hysterical agony were often totally unavailing and the mistakes which she made in the shop the while were so numerous and so provoking that bartoline saddletree who during his wifes illness was obliged to take closer charge of the business than consisted with his study of the weightier matters of the law lost all patience with the girl who in his law latin and without much respect to gender he declared ought to be cognosced by inquest of a jury as fatuus furiosus and naturaliter idiota neighbours also and fellowservants remarked with malicious curiosity or degrading pity the disfigured shape loose dress and pale cheeks of the once beautiful and still interesting girl but to no one would she grant her confidence answering all taunts with bitter sarcasm and all serious expostulation with sullen denial or with floods of tears  at length when mrs saddletrees recovery was likely to permit her wonted attention to the regulation of her household effie deans as if unwilling to face an investigation made by the authority of her mistress asked permission of bartoline to go home for a week or two assigning indisposition and the wish of trying the benefit of repose and the change of air as the motives of her request sharpeyed as a lynx or conceiving himself to be so in the nice sharp quillits of legal discussion bartoline was as dull at drawing inferences from the occurrences of common life as any dutch professor of mathematics he suffered effie to depart without much suspicion and without any inquiry  it was afterwards found that a period of a week intervened betwixt her leaving her masters house and arriving at st leonards she made her appearance before her sister in a state rather resembling the spectre than the living substance of the gay and beautiful girl who had left her fathers cottage for the first time scarce seventeen months before the lingering illness of her mistress had for the last few months given her a plea for confining herself entirely to the dusky precincts of the shop in the lawnmarket and jeanie was so much occupied during the same period with the concerns of her fathers household that she had rarely found leisure for a walk in the city and a brief and hurried visit to her sister the young women therefore had scarcely seen each other for several months nor had a single scandalous surmise reached the ears of the secluded inhabitants of the cottage at st leonards jeanie therefore terrified to death at her sisters appearance at first overwhelmed her with inquiries to which the unfortunate young woman returned for a time incoherent and rambling answers and finally fell into a hysterical fit rendered too certain of her sisters misfortune jeanie had now the dreadful alternative of communicating her ruin to her father or of endeavouring to conceal it from him to all questions concerning the name or rank of her seducer and the fate of the being to whom her fall had given birth effie remained as mute as the grave to which she seemed hastening and indeed the least allusion to either seemed to drive her to distraction her sister in distress and in despair was about to repair to mrs saddletree to consult her experience and at the same time to obtain what lights she could upon this most unhappy affair when she was saved that trouble by a new stroke of fate which seemed to carry misfortune to the uttermost  david deans had been alarmed at the state of health in which his daughter had returned to her paternal residence but jeanie had contrived to divert him from particular and specific inquiry it was therefore like a clap of thunder to the poor old man when just as the hour of noon had brought the visit of the laird of dumbiedikes as usual other and sterner as well as most unexpected guests arrived at the cottage of st leonards these were the officers of justice with a warrant of justiciary to search for and apprehend euphemia or effie deans accused of the crime of childmurder the stunning weight of a blow so totally unexpected bore down the old man who had in his early youth resisted the brow of military and civil tyranny though backed with swords and guns tortures and gibbets he fell extended and senseless upon his own hearth and the men happy to escape from the scene of his awakening raised with rude humanity the object of their warrant from her bed and placed her in a coach which they had brought with them the hasty remedies which jeanie had applied to bring back her fathers senses were scarce begun to operate when the noise of the wheels in motion recalled her attention to her miserable sister to ran shrieking after the carriage was the first vain effort of her distraction but she was stopped by one or two female neighbours assembled by the extraordinary appearance of a coach in that sequestered place who almost forced her back to her fathers house the deep and sympathetic affliction of these poor people by whom the little family at st leonards were held in high regard filled the house with lamentation even dumbiedikes was moved from his wonted apathy and groping for his purse as he spoke ejaculated jeanie womanjeanie woman dinna greetits sad wark but siller will help it and he drew out his purse as he spoke  the old man had now raised himself from the ground and looking about him as if he missed something seemed gradually to recover the sense of his wretchedness where he said with a voice that made the roof ring where is the vile harlot that has disgraced the blood of an honest manwhere is she that has no place among us but has come foul with her sins like the evil one among the children of godwhere is she jeaniebring her before me that i may kill her with a word and a look  all hastened around him with their

jeanie now in some degree restored to the power of thought joined in the same request the next day found the father and daughter still in the depth of affliction but the father sternly supporting his load of ill through a proud sense of religious duty and the daughter anxiously suppressing her own feelings to avoid again awakening his thus was it with the afflicted family until the morning after porteouss death a period at which we are now arrived     chapter tenth                   is all the counsel that we two have shared                 the sisters vows the hours that we have spent

conducting butler to the door of the cottage at st leonards yet the space which we have occupied in the preceding narrative does not exceed in length that which he actually spent on salisbury crags on the morning which succeeded the execution done upon porteous by the rioters for this delay he had his own motives he wished to collect his thoughts strangely agitated as they were first by the melancholy news of effie deanss situation and afterwards by the frightful scene which he had witnessed in the situation also in which he stood with respect to jeanie and her father some ceremony at least some choice of fitting time and season was necessary to wait upon them eight in the morning was then the ordinary hour for breakfast and he resolved that it should arrive before he made his appearance in their cottage  never did hours pass so heavily butler shifted his place and enlarged his circle to while away the time and heard the huge bell of st giless toll each successive hour in swelling tones which were instantly attested by those of the other steeples in succession he had heard seven struck in this manner when he began to think he might venture to approach nearer to st leonards from which he was still a mile distant accordingly he descended from his lofty station as low as the bottom of the valley which divides salisbury crags from those small rocks which take their name from saint leonard it is as many of my readers may know a deep wild grassy valley scattered with huge rocks and fragments which have descended from the cliffs and steep ascent to the east  this sequestered dell as well as other places of the open pasturage of the kings park was about this time often the resort of the gallants of the time who had affairs of honour to discuss with the sword duels were then very common in scotland for the gentry were at once idle haughty fierce divided by faction and addicted to intemperance so that there lacked neither provocation nor inclination to resent it when given and the sword which was part of every gentlemans dress was the only weapon used for the decision of such differences when therefore butler observed a young man skulking apparently to avoid observation among the scattered rocks at some distance from the footpath he was naturally led to suppose that he had sought this lonely spot upon that evil errand he was so strongly impressed with this that notwithstanding his own distress of mind he could not according to his sense of duty as a clergyman pass this person without speaking to him there are times thought he to himself when the slightest interference may avert a great calamitywhen a word spoken in season may do more for prevention than the eloquence of tully could do for remedying eviland for my own griefs be they as they may i shall feel them the lighter if they divert me not from the prosecution of my duty  thus thinking and feeling he quitted the ordinary path and advanced nearer the object he had noticed the man at first directed his course towards the hill in order as it appeared to avoid him but when he saw that butler seemed disposed to follow him he adjusted his hat fiercely turned round and came forward as if to meet and defy scrutiny  butler had an opportunity of accurately studying his features as they advanced slowly to meet each other the stranger seemed about twentyfive years old his dress was of a kind which could hardly be said to indicate his rank with certainty for it was such as young gentlemen sometimes wore while on active exercise in the morning and which therefore was imitated by those of the inferior ranks as young clerks and tradesmen because its cheapness rendered it attainable while it approached more nearly to the apparel of youths of fashion than any other which the manners of the times permitted them to wear if his air and manner could be trusted however this person seemed rather to be dressed under than above his rank for his carriage was bold and somewhat supercilious his step easy and free his manner daring and unconstrained his stature was of the middle size or rather above it his limbs wellproportioned yet not so strong as to infer the reproach of clumsiness his features were uncommonly handsome and all about him would have been interesting and prepossessing but for that indescribable expression which habitual dissipation gives to the countenance joined with a certain audacity in look and manner of that kind which is often assumed as a mask for confusion and apprehension  butler and the stranger metsurveyed each otherwhen as the latter slightly touching his hat was about to pass by him butler while he returned the salutation observed a fine morning siryou are on the hill early  i have business here said the young man in a tone meant to repress farther inquiry  i do not doubt it sir said butler i trust you will forgive my hoping that it is of a lawful kind  sir said the other with marked surprise i never forgive impertinence nor can i conceive what title you have to hope anything about what no way concerns you  i am a soldier sir said butler and have a charge to arrest evildoers in the name of my master  a soldier said the young man stepping back and fiercely laying his hand on his sworda soldier and arrest me did you reckon what your life was worth before you took the commission upon you  you mistake me sir said butler gravely neither my warfare nor my warrant are of this world i am a preacher of the gospel and have power in my masters name to command the peace upon earth and goodwill towards men which was proclaimed with the gospel  a minister said the stranger carelessly and with an expression approaching to scorn i know the gentlemen of your cloth in scotland claim a strange right of intermeddling with mens private affairs but i have been abroad and know better than to be priestridden  sir if it be true that any of my cloth or it might be more decently said of my calling interfere with mens private affairs for the gratification either of idle curiosity or for worse motives you cannot have learned a better lesson abroad than to contemn such practices but in my masters work i am called to be busy in season and out of season and conscious as i am of a pure motive it were better for me to incur your contempt for speaking than the correction of my own conscience for being silent  in the name of the devil said the young man impatiently say what you have to say then though whom you take me for or what earthly concern you have with me a stranger to you or with my actions and motives of which you can know nothing i cannot conjecture for an instant  you are about said butler to violate one of your countrys wisest lawsyou are about which is much more dreadful to violate a law which god himself has implanted within our nature and written as it were in the table of our hearts to which every thrill of our nerves is responsive  and what is the law you speak of said the stranger in a hollow and somewhat disturbed accent  thou shalt do no murder said butler with a deep and solemn voice  the young man visibly started and looked considerably appalled butler perceived he had made a favourable impression and resolved to follow it up think he said young man laying his hand kindly upon the strangers shoulder what an awful alternative you voluntarily choose for yourself to kill or be killed think what it is to rush uncalled into the presence of an offended deity your heart fermenting with evil passions your hand hot from the steel you had been urging with your best skill and malice against the breast of a fellowcreature or suppose yourself the scarce less wretched survivor with the guilt of cain the first murderer in your heart with the stamp upon your browthat stamp which struck all who gazed on him with unutterable horror and by which the murderer is made manifest to all who look upon him think  the stranger gradually withdrew himself from under the hand of his monitor and pulling his hat over his brows thus interrupted him your meaning sir i dare say is excellent but you are throwing your advice away i am not in this place with violent intentions against any one i may be bad enoughyou priests say all men are sobut i am here for the purpose of saving life not of taking it away if you wish to spend your time rather in doing a good action than in talking about you know not what i will give you an opportunity do you see yonder crag to the right over which appears the chimney of a lone house go thither inquire for one jeanie deans the daughter of the goodman let her know that he she wots of remained here from daybreak till this hour expecting to see her and that he can abide no longer tell her she must meet me at the hunters bog tonight as the moon rises behind st anthonys hill or that she will make a desperate man of me  who or what are you replied butler exceedingly and most unpleasantly surprised who charge me with such an errand  i am the devilanswered the young man hastily  butler stepped instinctively back and commanded himself internally to heaven for though a wise and strongminded man he was neither wiser nor more strongminded than those of his age and education with whom to disbelieve witchcraft or spectres was held an undeniable proof of atheism  the stranger went on without observing his emotion yes call me apollyon abaddon whatever name you shall choose as a clergyman acquainted with the upper and lower circles of spiritual denomination to call me by you shall not find an appellation more odious to him that bears it than is mine own  this sentence was spoken with the bitterness of selfupbraiding and a contortion of visage absolutely demoniacal butler though a man brave by principle if not by constitution was overawed for intensity of mental distress has in it a sort of sublimity which repels and overawes all men but especially those of kind and sympathetic dispositions the stranger turned abruptly from butler as he spoke but instantly returned and coming up to him closely and boldly said in a fierce determined tone i have told you who and what i amwho and what are you what is your name  butler answered the person to whom this abrupt question was addressed surprised into answering it by the sudden and fierce manner of the queristreuben butler a preacher of the gospel  at this answer the stranger again plucked more deep over his brows the hat which he had thrown back in his former agitation butler he repeatedthe assistant of the schoolmaster at liberton  the same answered butler composedly  the stranger covered his face with his hand as if on sudden reflection and then turned away but stopped when he had walked a few paces and seeing butler follow him with his eyes called out in a stern yet suppressed tone just as if he had exactly calculated that his accents should not be heard a yard beyond the spot on which butler stood go your way and do mine errand do not look after me i will neither descend through the bowels of these rocks nor vanish in a flash of fire and yet the eye that seeks to trace my motions shall have reason to curse it was ever shrouded by eyelid or eyelash begone and look not behind you tell jeanie deans that when the moon rises i shall expect to meet her at nicol muschats cairn beneath saint anthonys chapel   illustration st anthonys chapel159   as he uttered these words he turned and took the road against the hill with a haste that seemed as peremptory as his tone of authority  dreading he knew not what of additional misery to a lot which seemed little capable of receiving augmentation and desperate at the idea that any living man should dare to send so extraordinary a request couched in terms so imperious to the halfbetrothed object of his early and only affection butler strode hastily towards the cottage in order to ascertain how far this daring and rude gallant was actually entitled to press on jeanie deans a request which no prudent and scarce any modest young woman was likely to comply with  butler was by nature neither jealous nor superstitious yet the feelings which lead to those moods of the mind were rooted in his heart as a portion derived from the common stock of humanity it was maddening to think that a profligate gallant such as the manner and tone of the stranger evinced him to be should have it in his power to command forth his future bride and plighted true love at a place so improper and an hour so unseasonable yet the tone in which the stranger spoke had nothing of the soft halfbreathed voice proper to the seducer who solicits an assignation it was bold fierce and imperative and had less of love in it than of menace and intimidation  the suggestions of superstition seemed more plausible had butlers mind been very accessible to them was this indeed the roaring lion who goeth about seeking whom he may devour this was a question which pressed itself on butlers mind with an earnestness that cannot be conceived by those who live in the present day the fiery eye the abrupt demeanour the occasionally harsh yet studiously subdued tone of voicethe features handsome but now clouded with pride now disturbed by suspicion now inflamed with passionthose dark hazel eyes which he sometimes shaded with his cap as if he were averse to have them seen while they were occupied with keenly observing the motions and bearing of othersthose eyes that were now turbid with melancholy now gleaming with scorn and now sparkling with furywas it the passions of a mere mortal they expressed or the emotions of a fiend who seeks and seeks in vain to conceal his fiendish designs under the borrowed mask of manly beauty the whole partook of the mien language and port of the ruined archangel and imperfectly as we have been able to describe it the effect of the interview upon butlers nerves shaken as they were at the time by the horrors of the preceding night were greater than his understanding warranted or his pride cared to submit to the very place where he had met this singular person was desecrated as it were and unhallowed owing to many violent deaths both in duels and by suicide which had in former times taken place there and the place which he had named as a rendezvous at so late an hour was held in general to be accursed from a frightful and cruel murder which had been there committed by the wretch from whom the place took its name upon the person of his own wife   note g muschats cairn  it was in such places according to the belief of that period when the laws against witchcraft were still in fresh observance and had even lately been acted upon that evil spirits had power to make themselves visible to human eyes and to practise upon the feelings and senses of mankind suspicions founded on such circumstances rushed on butlers mind unprepared as it was by any previous course of reasoning to deny that which all of his time country and profession believed but common sense rejected these vain ideas as inconsistent if not with possibility at least with the general rules by which the universe is governeda deviation from which as butler well argued with himself ought not to be admitted as probable upon any but the plainest and most incontrovertible evidence an earthly lover however or a young man who from whatever cause had the right of exercising such summary and unceremonious authority over the object of his longsettled and apparently sincerely returned affection was an object scarce less appalling to his mind than those which superstition suggested  his limbs exhausted with fatigue his mind harassed with anxiety and with painful doubts and recollections butler dragged himself up the ascent from the valley to st leonards crags and presented himself at the door of deanss habitation with feelings much akin to the miserable reflections and fears of its inhabitants     chapter eleventh                           then she stretched out her lily hand                         and for to do her best                        hae back thy faith and troth willie                         god gie thy soul good rest                                                    old ballad  come in answered the low and sweettoned voice he loved best to hear as butler tapped at the door of the cottage he lifted the latch and found himself under the roof of affliction jeanie was unable to trust herself with more than one glance towards her lover whom she now met under circumstances so agonising to her feelings and at the same time so humbling to her honest pride it is well known that much both of what is good and bad in the scottish national character arises out of the intimacy of their family connections to be come of honest folk that is of people who have borne a fair and unstained reputation is an advantage as highly prized among the lower scotch as the emphatic counterpart to be of a good family is valued among their gentry the worth and respectability of one member of a peasants family is always accounted by themselves and others not only a matter of honest pride but a guarantee for the good conduct of the whole on the contrary such a melancholy stain as was now flung on one of the children of deans extended its disgrace to all connected with him and jeanie felt herself lowered at once in her own eyes and in those of her lover it was in vain that she repressed this feeling as far subordinate and too selfish to be mingled with her sorrow for her sisters calamity nature prevailed and while she shed tears for her sisters distress and danger there mingled with them bitter drops of grief for her own degradation  as butler entered the old man was seated by the fire with his wellworn pocket bible in his hands the companion of the wanderings and dangers of his youth and bequeathed to him on the scaffold by one of those who in the year 1686 sealed their enthusiastic principles with their blood the sun sent its rays through a small window at the old mans back and shining motty through the reek to use the expression of a bard of that time and country illumined the grey hairs of the old man and the sacred page which he studied his features far from handsome and rather harsh and severe had yet from their expression of habitual gravity and contempt for earthly things an expression of stoical dignity amidst their sternness he boasted in no small degree the attributes which southey ascribes to the ancient scandinavians whom he terms firm to inflict and stubborn to endure the whole formed a picture of which the lights might have been given by rembrandt but the outline would have required the force and vigour of michael angelo  deans lifted his eye as butler entered and instantly withdrew it as from an object which gave him at once surprise and sudden pain he had assumed such high ground with this carnalwitted scholar as he had in his pride termed butler that to meet him of all men under feelings of humiliation aggravated his misfortune and was a consummation like that of the dying chief in the old balladearl percy sees my fall  deans raised the bible with his left hand so as partly to screen his face and putting back his right as far as he could held it towards butler in that position at the same time turning his body from him as if to prevent his seeing the working of his countenance butler clasped the extended hand which had supported his orphan infancy wept over it and in vain endeavoured to say more than the wordsgod comfort yougod comfort you  he willhe doth my friend said deans assuming firmness as he discovered the agitation of his guest he doth now and he will yet more in his own gude time i have been ower proud of my sufferings in a gude cause reuben and now i am to be tried with those whilk will turn my pride and glory into a reproach and a hissing how muckle better i hae thought mysell than them that lay saft fed sweet and drank deep when i was in the mosshaggs and moors wi precious donald cameron and worthy mr blackadder called guessagain and how proud i was o being made a spectacle to men and angels having stood on their pillory at the canongate afore i was fifteen years old for the cause of a national covenant to think reuben that i wha hae been sae honoured and exalted in my youth nay when i was but a hafflins callant and that hae borne testimony again the defections o the times yearly monthly daily hourly minutely striving and testifying with uplifted hand and voice crying aloud and sparing not against all great national snares as the nationwasting and churchsinking abomination of union toleration and patronage imposed by the last woman of that unhappy race of stuarts also against the infringements and invasions of the just powers of eldership whereanent i uttered my paper called a cry of an howl in the desert printed at the bowhead and sold by all flying stationers in town and countryand now  here he paused it may well be supposed that butler though not absolutely coinciding in all the good old mans ideas about church government had too much consideration and humanity to interrupt him while he reckoned up with conscious pride his sufferings and the constancy of his testimony on the contrary when he paused under the influence of the bitter recollections of the moment butler instantly threw in his mite of encouragement  you have been well known my old and revered friend a true and tried follower of the cross one who as saint jerome hath it per infamiam et bonam famam grassari ad immortalitatem which may be freely rendered who rusheth on to immortal life through bad report and good report you have been one of those to whom the tender and fearful souls cry during the midnight solitudewatchman what of the nightwatchman what of the nightand assuredly this heavy dispensation as it comes not without divine permission so it comes not without its special commission and use  i do receive it as such said poor deans returning the grasp of butlers hand and if i have not been taught to read the scripture in any other tongue but my native scottish even in his distress butlers latin quotation had not escaped his notice i have nevertheless so learned them that i trust to bear even this crook in my lot with submission but oh reuben butler the kirk of whilk though unworthy i have yet been thought a polished shaft and meet to be a pillar holding from my youth upward the place of ruling elderwhat will the lightsome and profane think of the guide that cannot keep his own family from stumbling how will they take up their song and their reproach when they see that the children of professors are liable to as foul backsliding as the offspring of belial but i will bear my cross with the comfort that whatever showed like goodness in me or mine was but like the light that shines frae creeping insects on the braeside in a dark nightit kythes bright to the ee because all is dark around it but when the morn comes on the mountains it is but a puir crawling kailworm after a and sae it shows wi ony rag of human righteousness or formal lawwork that we may pit round us to cover our shame  as he pronounced these words the door again opened and mr bartoline saddletree entered his threepointed hat set far back on his head with a silk handkerchief beneath it to keep it in that cool position his goldheaded cane in his hand and his whole deportment that of a wealthy burgher who might one day look to have a share in the magistracy if not actually to hold the curule chair itself  rochefoucault who has torn the veil from so many foul gangrenes of the human heart says we find something not altogether unpleasant to us in the misfortunes of our best friends mr saddletree would have been very angry had any one told him that he felt pleasure in the disaster of poor effie deans and the disgrace of her family and yet there is great question whether the gratification of playing the person of importance inquiring investigating and laying down the law on the whole affair did not offer to say the least full consolation for the pain which pure sympathy gave him on account of his wifes kinswoman he had now got a piece of real judicial business by the end instead of being obliged as was his common case to intrude his opinion where it was neither wished nor wanted and felt as happy in the exchange as a boy when he gets his first new watch which actually goes when wound up and has real hands and a true dialplate but besides this subject for legal disquisition bartolines brains were also overloaded with the affair of porteous his violent death and all its probable consequences to the city and community it was what the french call lembarras des richesses the confusion arising from too much mental wealth he walked in with a consciousness of double importance full fraught with the superiority of one who possesses more information than the company into which he enters and who feels a right to discharge his learning on them without mercy good morning mr deansgoodmorrow to you mr butleri was not aware that you were acquainted with mr deans  butler made some slight answer his reasons may be readily imagined for not making his connection with the family which in his eyes had something of tender mystery a frequent subject of conversation with indifferent persons such as saddletree  the worthy burgher in the plenitude of selfimportance now sate down upon a chair wiped his brow collected his breath and made the first experiment of the resolved pith of his lungs in a deep and dignified sigh resembling a groan in sound and intonationawfu times these neighbour deans awfu times  sinfu shamefu heavendaring times answered deans in a lower and more subdued tone  for my part continued saddletree swelling with importance what between the distress of my friends and my poor auld country ony wit that ever i had may be said to have abandoned me sae that i sometimes think myself as ignorant as if i were inter rusticos here when i arise in the morning wi my mind just arranged touching whats to be done in puir effies misfortune and hae gotten the haill statute at my fingerends the mob maun get up and string jock porteous to a dyesters beam and ding a thing out of my head again  deeply as he was distressed with his own domestic calamity deans could not help expressing some interest in the news saddletree immediately entered on details of the insurrection and its consequences while butler took the occasion to seek some private conversation with jeanie deans she gave him the opportunity he sought by leaving the room as if in prosecution of some part of her morning labour butler followed her in a few minutes leaving deans so closely engaged by his busy visitor that there was little chance of his observing their absence  the scene of their interview was an outer apartment where jeanie was used to busy herself in arranging the productions of her dairy when butler found an opportunity of stealing after her into this place he found her silent dejected and ready to burst into tears instead of the active industry with which she had been accustomed even while in the act of speaking to employ her hands in some useful branch of household business she was seated listless in a corner sinking apparently under the weight of her own thoughts yet the instant he entered she dried her eyes and with the simplicity and openness of her character immediately entered on conversation  i am glad you have come in mr butler said she forforfor i wished to tell ye that all maun be ended between you and meits best for baith our sakes  ended said butler in surprise and for what should it be endedi grant this is a heavy dispensation but it lies neither at your door nor mineits an evil of gods sending and it must be borne but it cannot break plighted troth jeanie while they that plighted their word wish to keep it  but reuben said the young woman looking at him affectionately i ken weel that ye think mair of me than yourself and reuben i can only in requital think mair of your weal than of my ain ye are a man of spotless name bred to gods ministry and a men say that ye will some day rise high in the kirk though poverty keep ye doun een now poverty is a bad backfriend reuben and that ye ken ower weel but illfame is a waur ane and that is a truth ye sall never learn through my means  what do you mean said butler eagerly and impatiently or how do you connect your sisters guilt if guilt there be which i trust in god may yet be disproved with our engagementhow can that affect you or me  how can you ask me that mr butler will this stain dye think ever be forgotten as lang as our heads are abune the grund will it not stick to us and to our bairns and to their very bairns bairns to hae been the child of an honest man might hae been saying something for me and mine but to be the sister of ao my godwith this exclamation her resolution failed and she burst into a passionate fit of tears  the lover used every effort to induce her to compose herself and at length succeeded but she only resumed her composure to express herself with the same positiveness as before no reuben ill bring disgrace hame to nae mans hearth my ain distresses i can bear and i maun bear but there is nae occasion for buckling them on other folks shouthers i will bear my load alonethe back is made for the burden  a lover is by charter wayward and suspicious and jeanies readiness to renounce their engagement under pretence of zeal for his peace of mind and respectability of character seemed to poor butler to form a portentous combination with the commission of the stranger he had met with that morning his voice faltered as he asked whether nothing but a sense of her sisters present distress occasioned her to talk in that manner  and what else can do sae she replied with simplicity is it not ten long years since we spoke together in this way  ten years said butler its a long timesufficient perhaps for a woman to weary  to weary of her auld gown said jeanie and to wish for a new ane if she likes to be brave but not long enough to weary of a friendthe eye may wish change but the heart never  never said reubenthats a bold promise  but not more bauld than true said jeanie with the same quiet simplicity which attended her manner in joy and grief in ordinary affairs and in those which most interested her feelings  butler paused and looking at her fixedlyi am charged he said with a message to you jeanie  indeed from whom or what can ony ane have to say to me  it is from a stranger said butler affecting to speak with an indifference which his voice belieda young man whom i met this morning in the park  mercy said jeanie eagerly and what did he say  that he did not see you at the hour he expected but required you should meet him alone at muschats cairn this night so soon as the moon rises  tell him said jeanie hastily i shall certainly come  may i ask said butler his suspicions increasing at the ready alacrity of the answer who this man is to whom you are so willing to give the meeting at a place and hour so uncommon  folk maun do muckle they have little will to do in this world replied jeanie  granted said her lover but what compels you to thiswho is this person what i saw of him was not very favourablewho or what is he  i do not know replied jeanie composedly  you do not know said butler stepping impatiently through the apartmentyou purpose to meet a young man whom you do not know at such a time and in a place so lonelyyou say you are compelled to do thisand yet you say you do not know the person who exercises such an influence over youjeanie what am i to think of this  think only reuben that i speak truth as if i were to answer at the last dayi do not ken this mani do not even ken that i ever saw him and yet i must give him the meeting he askstheres life and death upon it  will you not tell your father or take him with you said butler  i cannot said jeanie i have no permission  will you let me go with you i will wait in the park till nightfall and join you when you set out  it is impossible said jeanie there maunna be mortal creature within hearing of our conference  have you considered well the nature of what you are going to dothe timethe placean unknown and suspicious characterwhy if he had asked to see you in this house your father sitting in the next room and within call at such an hour you should have refused to see him  my weird maun be fulfilled mr butler my life and my safety are in gods hands but ill not spare to risk either of them on the errand i am gaun to do  then jeanie said butler much displeased we must indeed break short off and bid farewell when there can be no confidence betwixt a man and his plighted wife on such a momentous topic it is a sign that she has no longer the regard for him that makes their engagement safe and suitable  jeanie looked at him and sighed i thought she said that i had brought myself to bear this partingbutbuti did not ken that we were to part in unkindness but i am a woman and you are a manit may be different wi youif your mind is made easier by thinking sae hardly of me i would not ask you to think otherwise  you are said butler what you have always beenwiser better and less selfish in your native feelings than i can be with all the helps philosophy can give to a christianbut whywhy will you persevere in an undertaking so desperate why will you not let me be your assistantyour protector or at least your adviser  just because i cannot and i dare not answered jeaniebut hark whats that surely my father is no weel  in fact the voices in the next room became obstreperously loud of a sudden the cause of which vociferation it is necessary to explain before we go farther  when jeanie and butler retired mr saddletree entered upon the business which chiefly interested the family in the commencement of their conversation he found old deans who in his usual state of mind was no granter of propositions so much subdued by a deep sense of his daughters danger and disgrace that he heard without replying to or perhaps without understanding one or two learned disquisitions on the nature of the crime imputed to her charge and on the steps which ought to be taken in consequence his only answer at each pause was i am no misdoubting that you wuss us weelyour wifes our farawa cousin  encouraged by these symptoms of acquiescence saddletree who as an amateur of the law had a supreme deference for all constituted authorities again recurred to his other topic of interest the murder namely of porteous and pronounced a severe censure on the parties concerned  these are kittle timeskittle times mr deans when the people take the power of life and death out of the hands of the rightful magistrate into their ain rough grip i am of opinion and so i believe will mr crossmyloof and the privy council that this rising in effeir of war to take away the life of a reprieved man will prove little better than perduellion  if i hadna that on my mind whilk is ill to bear mr saddletree said deans i wad make bold to dispute that point wi you  how could you dispute whats plain law man said saddletree somewhat contemptuously theres no a callant that eer carried a pock wi a process int but will tell you that perduellion is the warst and maist virulent kind of treason being an open convocating of the kings lieges against his authority mair especially in arms and by touk of drum to baith whilk accessories my een and lugs bore witness and muckle worse than lesemajesty or the concealment of a treasonable purposeit winna bear a dispute neighbour  but it will though retorted douce davie deans i tell ye it will bear a disputer never like your cauld legal formal doctrines neighbour saddletree i haud unco little by the parliament house since the awfu downfall of the hopes of honest folk that followed the revolution  but what wad ye hae had mr deans said saddletree impatiently didna ye get baith liberty and conscience made fast and settled by tailzie on you and your heirs for ever  mr saddletree retorted deans i ken ye are one of those that are wise after the manner of this world and that ye hand your part and cast in your portion wi the lang heads and lang gowns and keep with the smart wittypated lawyers of this our landweary on the dark and dolefu cast that they hae gien this unhappy kingdom when their black hands of defection were clasped in the red hands of our sworn murtherers when those who had numbered the towers of our zion and marked the bulwarks of reformation saw their hope turn into a snare and their rejoicing into weeping  i canna understand this neighbour answered saddletree i am an honest presbyterian of the kirk of scotland and stand by her and the general assembly and the due administration of justice by the fifteen lords o session and the five lords o justiciary  out upon ye mr saddletree exclaimed david who in an opportunity of giving his testimony on the offences and backslidings of the land forgot for a moment his own domestic calamityout upon your general assembly and the back of my hand to your court o sessionwhat is the tane but a waefu bunch o cauldrife professors and ministers that sate bien and warm when the persecuted remnant were warstling wi hunger and cauld and fear of death and danger of fire and sword upon wet braesides peathaggs and flowmosses and that now creep out of their holes like bluebottle flees in a blink of sunshine to take the pupits and places of better folkof them that witnessed and testified and fought and endured pit prisonhouse and transportation beyond seasa bonny bike theres o themand for your court o session  ye may say what ye will o the general assembly said saddletree interrupting him and let them clear them that kens them but as for the lords o session forby that they are my nextdoor neighbours i would have ye ken for your ain regulation that to raise scandal anent them whilk is termed to murmur again them is a crime sui generissui generis mr deansken ye what that amounts to  i ken little o the language of antichrist said deans and i care less than little what carnal courts may call the speeches of honest men and as to murmur again them its what a the folk that loses their pleas and ninetenths o them that win them will be gey sure to be guilty in sae i wad hae ye ken that i hand a your glegtongued advocates that sell their knowledge for pieces of silverand your worldlywise judges that will gie three days of hearing in presence to a debate about the peeling of an ingan and no ae halfhour to the gospel testimonyas legalists and formalists countenancing by sentences and quirks and cunning terms of law the late begun courses of national defectionsunion toleration patronages and yerastian prelatic oaths as for the soul and bodykilling court o justiciary  the habit of considering his life as dedicated to bear testimony in behalf of what he deemed the suffering and deserted cause of true religion had swept honest david along with it thus far but with the mention of the criminal court the recollection of the disastrous condition of his daughter rushed at once on his mind he stopped short in the midst of his triumphant declamation pressed his hands against his forehead and remained silent  saddletree was somewhat moved but apparently not so much so as to induce him to relinquish the privilege of prosing in his turn afforded him by davids sudden silence nae doubt neighbour he said its a sair thing to hae to do wi courts of law unless it be to improve anes knowledge and practique by waiting on as a hearer and touching this unhappy affair of effieyell hae seen the dittay doubtless he dragged out of his pocket a bundle of papers and began to turn them over this is no itthis is the information of mungo marsport of that ilk against captain lackland for coming on his lands of marsport with hawks hounds lyingdogs nets guns crossbows hagbuts of found or other engines more or less for destruction of game sic as reddeer fallowdeer cappercailzies greyfowl moorfowl paitricks herons and sic like he the said defender not being ane qualified person in terms of the statute sixteen hundred and twentyane that is not having ane ploughgate of land now the defences proponed say that non constat at this present what is a ploughgate of land whilk uncertainty is sufficient to elide the conclusions of the libel but then the answers to the defences they are signed by mr crossmyloof but mr younglad drew them they propone that it signifies naething in hoc statu what or how muckle a ploughgate of land may be in respect the defender has nae lands whatsoever less or mair sae grant a ploughgate here saddletree read from the paper in his hand to be less than the nineteenth part of a guses grassi trow mr crossmyloof put in thati ken his styleof a guses grass what the better will the defender be seeing he hasna a divotcast of land in scotlandadvocatus for lackland duplies that nihil interest de possessione the pursuer must put his case under the statutenow this is worth your notice neighbourand must show formaliter et specialiter as well as generaliter what is the qualification that defender lackland does not possesslet him tell me what a ploughgate of land is and ill tell him if i have one or no surely the pursuer is bound to understand his own libel and his own statute that he founds upon titius pursues maevius for recovery of ane black horse lent to maeviussurely he shall have judgment but if titius pursue maevius for ane scarlet or crimson horse doubtless he shall be bound to show that there is sic ane animal in rerum natura no man can be bound to plead to nonsensethat is to say to a charge which cannot be explained or understoodhes wrang therethe better the pleadings the fewer understand themand so the reference unto this undefined and unintelligible measure of land is as if a penalty was inflicted by statute for any man who suld hunt or hawk or use lyingdogs and wearing a skyblue pair of breeches without havingbut i am wearying you mr deanswell pass to your ain businessthough this cue of marsport against lackland has made an unco din in the outer house weel heres the dittay against puir effie whereas it is humbly meant and shown to us etc they are words of mere style that whereas by the laws of this and every other wellregulated realm the murder of any one more especially of an infant child is a crime of ane high nature and severely punishable and whereas without prejudice to the foresaid generality it was by ane act made in the second session of the first parliament of our most high and dread sovereigns william and mary especially enacted that ane woman who shall have concealed her condition and shall not be able to show that she hath called for help at the birth in case that the child shall be found dead or amissing shall be deemed and held guilty of the murder thereof and the said facts of concealment and pregnancy being found proven or confessed shall sustain the pains of law accordingly yet nevertheless you effie or euphemia deans  read no farther said deans raising his head up i would rather ye thrust a sword into my heart than read a word farther  weel neighbour said saddletree i thought it wad hae comforted ye to ken the best and the warst ot but the question is whats to be dune  nothing answered deans firmly but to abide the dispensation that the lord sees meet to send us oh if it had been his will to take the grey head to rest before this awful visitation on my house and name but his will be done i can say that yet though i can say little mair  but neighbour said saddletree yell retain advocates for the puir lassie its a thing maun needs be thought of  if there was ae man of them answered deans that held fast his integritybut i ken them weel they are a carnal crafty and warldhunting selfseekers yerastians and arminians every ane o them  hout tout neighbour ye mauna take the warld at its word said saddletree the very deil is no sae ill as hes cad and i ken mair than ae advocate that may be said to hae some integrity as weel as their neighbours that is after a sort o fashion o their ain  it is indeed but a fashion of integrity that ye will find amang them replied david deans and a fashion of wisdom and fashion of carnal learninggazing glancingglasses they are fit only to fling the glaiks in folks een wi their pawky policy and earthly ingine their flights and refinements and periods of eloquence frae heathen emperors and popish canons they canna in that daft trash ye were reading to me sae muckle as ca men that are sae illstarred as to be amang their hands by ony name o the dispensation o grace but maun new baptize them by the names of the accursed titus wha was made the instrument of burning the holy temple and other sic like heathens  its tishius interrupted saddletree and no titus mr crossmyloof cares as little about titus or the latin as ye dobut its a case of necessityshe maun hae counsel now i could speak to mr crossmyloofhes weel kend for a roundspun presbyterian and a ruling elder to boot  hes a rank yerastian replied deans one of the public and polititious warldlywise men that stude up to prevent ane general owning of the cause in the day of power  what say ye to the auld laird of cuffabout said saddletree he whiles thumps the dust out of a case gey and well  he the fause loon answered deanshe was in his bandaliers to hae joined the ungracious highlanders in 1715 an they had ever had the luck to cross the firth  weel arniston theres a clever chield for ye said bartoline triumphantly  ay to bring popish medals in till their very library from that schismatic woman in the north the duchess of gordon   james dundas younger of arniston was tried in the year 1711 upon charge of leasingmaking in having presented from the duchess of gordon medal of the pretender for the purpose it was said of affronting queen anne   weel weel but somebody ye maun haewhat think ye o kittlepunt  hes an arminian  woodsetter  hes i doubt a cocceian  auld whilliewhaw  hes ony thing ye like  young naemmo  hes naething at a  yere ill to please neighbour said saddletree i hae run ower the pick o them for you ye maun een choose for yoursell but bethink ye that in the multitude of counsellors theres safetywhat say ye to try young mackenyie he has a his uncles practiques at the tongues end  what sir wad ye speak to me exclaimed the sturdy presbyterian in excessive wrath about a man that has the blood of the saints at his fingers ends did na his eme uncle die and gang to his place wi the name of the bluidy mackenyie and winna he be kend by that name sae lang as theres a scots tongue to speak the word if the life of the dear bairn thats under a suffering dispensation and jeanies and my ain and a mankinds depended on my asking sic a slave o satan to speak a word for me or them they should a gae doun the water thegither for davie deans  it was the exalted tone in which he spoke this last sentence that broke up the conversation between butler and jeanie and brought them both ben the house to use the language of the country here they found the poor old man half frantic between grief and zealous ire against saddletrees proposed measures his cheek inflamed his hand clenched and his voice raised while the tear in his eye and the occasional quiver of his accents showed that his utmost efforts were inadequate to shaking off the consciousness of his misery butler apprehensive of the consequences of his agitation to an aged and feeble frame ventured to utter to him a recommendation to patience  i am patient returned the old man sternlymore patient than any one who is alive to the woeful backslidings of a miserable time can be patient and in so much that i need neither sectarians nor sons nor grandsons of sectarians to instruct my grey hairs how to bear my cross  but sir continued butler taking no offence at the slur cast on his grandfathers faith we must use human means when you call in a physician you would not i suppose question him on the nature of his religious principles  wad i no answered davidbut i wad though and if he didna satisfy me that he had a right sense of the right hand and left hand defections of the day not a goutte of his physic should gang through my fathers son  it is a dangerous thing to trust to an illustration butler had done so and miscarried but like a gallant soldier when his musket misses fire he stood his ground and charged with the bayonetthis is too rigid an interpretation of your duty sir the sun shines and the rain descends on the just and unjust and they are placed together in life in circumstances which frequently render intercourse between them indispensable perhaps that the evil may have an opportunity of being converted by the good and perhaps also that the righteous might among other trials be subjected to that of occasional converse with the profane  yere a silly callant reuben answered deans with your bits of argument can a man touch pitch and not be defiled or what think ye of the brave and worthy champions of the covenant that wadna sae muckle as hear a minister speak be his gifts and graces as they would that hadna witnessed against the enormities of the day nae lawyer shall ever speak for me and mine that hasna concurred in the testimony of the scattered yet lovely remnant which abode in the clifts of the rocks  so saying and as if fatigued both with the arguments and presence of his guests the old man arose and seeming to bid them adieu with a motion of his head and hand went to shut himself up in his sleeping apartment  its thrawing his daughters life awa said saddletree to butler to hear him speak in that daft gate where will he ever get a cameronian advocate or wha ever heard of a lawyers suffering either for ae religion or another the lassies life is clean flung awa  during the latter part of this debate dumbiedikes had arrived at the door dismounted hung the ponys bridle on the usual hook and sunk down on his ordinary settle his eyes with more than their usual animation followed first one speaker then another till he caught the melancholy sense of the whole from saddletrees last words he rose from his seat stumped slowly across the room and coming close up to saddletrees ear said in a tremulous anxious voice willwill siller do naething for them mr saddletree  umph said saddletree looking gravesiller will certainly do it in the parliament house if ony thing can do it but wheres the siller to come frae mr deans ye see will do naething and though mrs saddletrees their farawa friend and right good weelwisher and is weel disposed to assist yet she wadna like to stand to be bound singuli in solidum to such an expensive wark an ilka friend wad bear a share o the burden something might be duneilka ane to be liable for their ain inputi wadna like to see the case fa through without being pledit wadna be creditable for a that daft whig body says  illi willyes assuming fortitude i will be answerable said dumbiedikes for a score of punds sterlingand he was silent staring in astonishment at finding himself capable of such unwonted resolution and excessive generosity  god almighty bless ye laird said jeanie in a transport of gratitude  ye may ca the twenty punds thretty said dumbiedikes looking bashfully away from her and towards saddletree  that will do bravely said saddletree rubbing his hands and ye sall hae a my skill and knowledge to gar the siller gang farill tape it out weeli ken how to gar the birkies tak short fees and be glad o them tooits only garring them trow ye hae twa or three cases of importance coming on and theyll work cheap to get custom let me alane for whillywhaing an advocateits nae sin to get as muckle flue them for our siller as we canafter a its but the wind o their mouthit costs them naething whereas in my wretched occupation of a saddler horse milliner and harness maker we are out unconscionable sums just for barkened hides and leather  can i be of no use said butler my means alas are only worth the black coat i wear but i am youngi owe much to the familycan i do nothing  ye can help to collect evidence sir said saddletree if we could but find ony ane to say she had gien the least hint o her condition she wad be brought aft wi a wat fingermr crossmyloof telld me sae the crown says he canna be craved to prove a positivewast a positive or a negative they couldna be cad to proveit was the tane or the tither o them i am sure and it maksna muckle matter whilk wherefore says he the libel maun be redargued by the panel proving her defences and it canna be done otherwise  but the fact sir argued butler the fact that this poor girl has borne a child surely the crown lawyers must prove that said butler  saddletree paused a moment while the visage of dumbiedikes which traversed as if it had been placed on a pivot from the one spokesman to the other assumed a more blithe expression  yeyeyees said saddletree after some grave hesitation unquestionably that is a thing to be proved as the court will more fully declare by an interlocutor of relevancy in common form but i fancy that jobs done already for she has confessed her guilt  confessed the murder exclaimed jeanie with a scream that made them all start  no i didna say that replied bartoline but she confessed bearing the babe  and what became of it then said jeanie for not a word could i get from her but bitter sighs and tears  she says it was taken away from her by the woman in whose house it was born and who assisted her at the time  and who was that woman said butler surely by her means the truth might be discoveredwho was she i will fly to her directly  i wish said dumbiedikes i were as young and as supple as you and had the gift of the gab as weel  who is she again reiterated butler impatientlywho could that woman be  ay wha kens that but herself said saddletree she deponed farther and declined to answer that interrogatory  then to herself will i instantly go said butler farewell jeanie then coming close up to hertake no rash steps till you hear from me farewell and he immediately left the cottage  i wad gang too said the landed proprietor in an anxious jealous and repining tone but my powny winna for the life o me gang ony other road than just frae dumbiedikes to this houseend and sae straight back again  yell do better for them said saddletree as they left the house together by sending me the thretty punds  thretty punds hesitated dumbiedikes who was now out of the reach of those eyes which had inflamed his generosity i only said twenty punds  ay but said saddletree that was under protestation to add and eik and so ye craved leave to amend your libel and made it thretty  did i i dinna mind that i did answered dumbiedikes but whatever i said ill stand to then bestriding his steed with some difficulty he added dinna ye think poor jeanies een wi the tears in them glanced like lamour beads mr saddletree  i kenna muckle about womens een laird replied the insensible bartoline and i care just as little i wuss i were as weel free o their tongues though few wives he added recollecting the necessity of keeping up his character for domestic rule are under better command than mine laird i allow neither perduellion nor lesemajesty against my sovereign authority  the laird saw nothing so important in this observation as to call for a rejoinder and when they had exchanged a mute salutation they parted in peace upon their different errands     chapter twelfth                   ill warrant that fellow from drowning                 were the ship no stronger than a nutshell                                             the tempest  butler felt neither fatigue nor want of refreshment although from the mode in which he had spent the night he might well have been overcome with either but in the earnestness with which he hastened to the assistance of the sister of jeanie deans he forgot both  in his first progress he walked with so rapid a pace as almost approached to running when he was surprised to hear behind him a call upon his name contending with an asthmatic cough and halfdrowned amid the resounding trot of a highland pony he looked behind and saw the laird of dumbiedikes making after him with what speed he might for it happened fortunately for the lairds purpose of conversing with butler that his own road homeward was for about two hundred yards the same with that which led by the nearest way to the city butler stopped when he heard himself thus summoned internally wishing no good to the panting equestrian who thus retarded his journey  uh uh uh ejaculated dumbiedikes as he checked the hobbling pace of the pony by our friend butler uh uh its a hardset willyard beast this o mine he had in fact just overtaken the object of his chase at the very point beyond which it would have been absolutely impossible for him to have continued the pursuit since there butlers road parted from that leading to dumbiedikes and no means of influence or compulsion which the rider could possibly have used towards his bucephalus could have induced the celtic obstinacy of rory bean such was the ponys name to have diverged a yard from the path that conducted him to his own paddock  even when he had recovered from the shortness of breath occasioned by a trot much more rapid than rory or he were accustomed to the high purpose of dumbiedikes seemed to stick as it were in his throat and impede his utterance so that butler stood for nearly three minutes ere he could utter a syllable and when he did find voice it was only to say after one or two efforts uh uh uhm i say mrmr butler its a braw day for the harst  fine day indeed said butler i wish you good morning sir  staystay a bit rejoined dumbiedikes that was no what i had gotten to say  then pray be quick and let me have your commands rejoined butler i crave your pardon but i am in haste and tempus neminiyou know the proverb  dumbiedikes did not know the proverb nor did he even take the trouble to endeavour to look as if he did as others in his place might have done he was concentrating all his intellects for one grand proposition and could not afford any detachment to defend outposts i say mr butler said he ken ye if mr saddletrees a great lawyer  i have no persons word for it but his own answered butler drily but undoubtedly he best understands his own qualities  umph replied the taciturn dumbiedikes in a tone which seemed to say mr butler i take your meaning in that case he pursued ill employ my ain man o business nichil novit auld nichils son and amaist as gleg as his father to agent effies plea  and having thus displayed more sagacity than butler expected from him he courteously touched his goldlaced cocked hat and by a punch on the ribs conveyed to rory bean it was his riders pleasure that he should forthwith proceed homewards a hint which the quadruped obeyed with that degree of alacrity with which men and animals interpret and obey suggestions that entirely correspond with their own inclinations  butler resumed his pace not without a momentary revival of that jealousy which the honest lairds attention to the family of deans had at different times excited in his bosom but he was too generous long to nurse any feeling which was allied to selfishness he is said butler to himself rich in what i want why should i feel vexed that he has the heart to dedicate some of his pelf to render them services which i can only form the empty wish of executing in gods name let us each do what we can may she be but happysaved from the misery and disgrace that seems impendinglet me but find the means of preventing the fearful experiment of this evening and farewell to other thoughts though my heartstrings break in parting with them  he redoubled his pace and soon stood before the door of the tolbooth or rather before the entrance where the door had formerly been placed his interview with the mysterious stranger the message to jeanie his agitating conversation with her on the subject of breaking off their mutual engagements and the interesting scene with old deans had so entirely occupied his mind as to drown even recollection of the tragical event which he had witnessed the preceding evening his attention was not recalled to it by the groups who stood scattered on the street in conversation which they hushed when strangers approached or by the bustling search of the agents of the city police supported by small parties of the military or by the appearance of the guardhouse before which were treble sentinels or finally by the subdued and intimidated looks of the lower orders of society who conscious that they were liable to suspicion if they were not guilty of accession to a riot likely to be strictly inquired into glided about with an humble and dismayed aspect like men whose spirits being exhausted in the revel and the dangers of a desperate debauch overnight are nerveshaken timorous and unenterprising on the succeeding day  none of these symptoms of alarm and trepidation struck butler whose mind was occupied with a different and to him still more interesting subject until he stood before the entrance to the prison and saw it defended by a double file of grenadiers instead of bolts and bars their stand stand the blackened appearance of the doorless gateway and the winding staircase and apartments of the tolbooth now open to the public eye recalled the whole proceedings of the eventful night upon his requesting to speak with effie deans the same tall thin silverhaired turnkey whom he had seen on the preceding evening made his appearance  i think he replied to butlers request of admission with true scottish indirectness ye will be the same lad that was for in to see her yestreen  butler admitted he was the same person  and i am thinking pursued the turnkey that ye speered at me when we locked up and if we locked up earlier on account of porteous  very likely i might make some such observation said butler but the question now is can i see effie deans  i dinna kengang in by and up the turnpike stair and turn till the ward on the left hand  the old man followed close behind him with his keys in his hand not forgetting even that huge one which had once opened and shut the outward gate of his dominions though at present it was but an idle and useless burden no sooner had butler entered the room to which he was directed than the experienced hand of the warder selected the proper key and locked it on the outside at first butler conceived this manoeuvre was only an effect of the mans habitual and official caution and jealousy but when he heard the hoarse command turn out the guard and immediately afterwards heard the clash of a sentinels arms as he was posted at the door of his apartment he again called out to the turnkey my good friend i have business of some consequence with effie deans and i beg to see her as soon as possible no answer was returned if it be against your rules to admit me repeated butler in a still louder tone to see the prisoner i beg you will tell me so and let me go about my businessfugit irrevocabile tempus muttered he to himself  if ye had business to do ye suld hae dune it before ye cam here replied the man of keys from the outside yell find its easier wunnin in than wunnin out heretheres sma likelihood o another porteous mob coming to rabble us againthe law will haud her ain now neighbour and that yell find to your cost  what do you mean by that sir retorted butler you must mistake me for some other person my name is reuben butler preacher of the gospel  i ken that weel eneugh said the turnkey  well then if you know me i have a right to know from you in return what warrant you have for detaining me that i know is the right of every british subject  warrant said the jailorthe warrants awa to libberton wi twa sheriff officers seeking ye if ye had staid at hame as honest men should do ye wad hae seen the warrant but if ye come to be incarcerated of your ain accord wha can help it my jo  so i cannot see effie deans then said butler and you are determined not to let me out  troth will i no neighbour answered the old man doggedly as for effie deans yell hae eneuch ado to mind your ain business and let her mind hers and for letting you out that maun be as the magistrate will determine and fare ye weel for a bit for i maun see deacon sawyers put on ane or twa o the doors that your quiet folk broke down yesternight mr butler  there was something in this exquisitely provoking but there was also something darkly alarming to be imprisoned even on a false accusation has something in it disagreeable and menacing even to men of more constitutional courage than butler had to boast for although he had much of that resolution which arises from a sense of duty and an honourable desire to discharge it yet as his imagination was lively and his frame of body delicate he was far from possessing that cool insensibility to danger which is the happy portion of men of stronger health more firm nerves and less acute sensibility an indistinct idea of peril which he could neither understand nor ward off seemed to float before his eyes he tried to think over the events of the preceding night in hopes of discovering some means of explaining or vindicating his conduct for appearing among the mob since it immediately occurred to him that his detention must be founded on that circumstance and it was with anxiety that he found he could not recollect to have been under the observation of any disinterested witness in the attempts that he made from time to time to expostulate with the rioters and to prevail on them to release him the distress of deanss family the dangerous rendezvous which jeanie had formed and which he could not now hope to interrupt had also their share in his unpleasant reflections yet impatient as he was to receive an eclaircissement upon the cause of his confinement and if possible to obtain his liberty he was affected with a trepidation which seemed no good omen when after remaining an hour in this solitary apartment he received a summons to attend the sitting magistrate he was conducted from prison strongly guarded by a party of soldiers with a parade of precaution that however illtimed and unnecessary is generally displayed after an event which such precaution if used in time might have prevented  he was introduced into the council chamber as the place is called where the magistrates hold their sittings and which was then at a little distance from the prison one or two of the senators of the city were present and seemed about to engage in the examination of an individual who was brought forward to the foot of the long greencovered table round which the council usually assembled is that the preacher said one of the magistrates as the city officer in attendance introduced butler the man answered in the affirmative let him sit down there for an instant we will finish this mans business very briefly  shall we remove mr butler queried the assistant  it is not necessarylet him remain where he is  butler accordingly sate down on a bench at the bottom of the apartment attended by one of his keepers  it was a large room partially and imperfectly lighted but by chance or the skill of the architect who might happen to remember the advantage which might occasionally be derived from such an arrangement one window was so placed as to throw a strong light at the foot of the table at which prisoners were usually posted for examination while the upper end where the examinants sate was thrown into shadow butlers eyes were instantly fixed on the person whose examination was at present proceeding in the idea that he might recognise some one of the conspirators of the former night but though the features of this man were sufficiently marked and striking he could not recollect that he had ever seen them before  the complexion of this person was dark and his age somewhat advanced he wore his own hair combed smooth down and cut very short it was jet black slightly curled by nature and already mottled with grey the mans face expressed rather knavery than vice and a disposition to sharpness cunning and roguery more than the traces of stormy and indulged passions his sharp quick black eyes acute features ready sardonic smile promptitude and effrontery gave him altogether what is called among the vulgar a knowing look which generally implies a tendency to knavery at a fair or market you could not for a moment have doubted that he was a horsejockey intimate with all the tricks of his trade yet had you met him on a moor you would not have apprehended any violence from him his dress was also that of a horsedealera closebuttoned jockeycoat or wraprascal as it was then termed with huge metal buttons coarse blue upper stockings called boothose because supplying the place of boots and a slouched hat he only wanted a loaded whip under his arm and a spur upon one heel to complete the dress of the character he seemed to represent  your name is james ratcliffe said the magistrate  ayalways wi your honours leave  that is to say you could find me another name if i did not like that one  twenty to pick and choose upon always with your honours leave resumed the respondent  but james ratcliffe is your present namewhat is your trade  i canna just say distinctly that i have what ye wad ca preceesely a trade  but repeated the magistrate what are your means of livingyour occupation  hout toutyour honour wi your leave kens that as weel as i do replied the examined  no matter i want to hear you describe it said the examinant  me describeand to your honourfar be it from jemmie ratcliffe responded the prisoner  come sir no triflingi insist on an answer  weel sir replied the declarant i maun make a clean breast for ye see wi your leave i am looking for favourdescribe my occupation quo yetroth it will be ill to do that in a feasible way in a place like thisbut what ist again that the aught command says  thou shalt not steal answered the magistrate  are you sure o that replied the accusedtroth then my occupation and that command are sair at odds for i read it thou shalt steal and that makes an unco difference though theres but a wee bit word left out  to cut the matter short ratcliffe you have been a most notorious thief said the examinant  i believe highlands and lowlands ken that sir forby england and holland replied ratcliffe with the greatest composure and effrontery  and what dye think the end of your calling will be said the magistrate  i could have gien a braw guess yesterdaybut i dinna ken sae weel the day answered the prisoner  and what would you have said would have been your end had you been asked the question yesterday  just the gallows replied ratcliffe with the same composure  you are a daring rascal sir said the magistrate and how dare you hope times are mended with you today  dear your honour answered ratcliffe theres muckle difference between lying in prison under sentence of death and staying there of anes ain proper accord when it would have cost a man naething to get up and rin awawhat was to hinder me from stepping out quietly when the rabble walked awa wi jock porteous yestreenand does your honour really think i staid on purpose to be hanged  i do not know what you may have proposed to yourself but i know said the magistrate what the law proposes for you and that is to hang you next wednesday eight days  na na your honour said ratcliffe firmly craving your honours pardon ill neer believe that till i see it i have kend the law this mony a year and mony a thrawart job i hae had wi her first and last but the auld jaud is no sae ill as that comes toi aye fand her bark waur than her bite  and if you do not expect the gallows to which you are condemned for the fourth time to my knowledge may i beg the favour to know said the magistrate what it is you do expect in consideration of your not having taken your flight with the rest of the jailbirds which i will admit was a line of conduct little to have been expected  i would never have thought for a moment of staying in that auld gousty toom house answered ratcliffe but that use and wont had just gien me a fancy to the place and im just expecting a bit post int  a post exclaimed the magistrate a whippingpost i suppose you mean  na na sir i had nae thoughts o a whuppinpost after having been four times doomed to hang by the neck till i was dead i think i am far beyond being whuppit  then in heavens name what did you expect  just the post of underturnkey for i understand theres a vacancy said the prisoner i wadna think of asking the lockmans place ower his head it wadna suit me sae weel as ither folk for i never could put a beast out o the way much less deal wi a man   note h hangman or lockman  thats something in your favour said the magistrate making exactly the inference to which ratcliffe was desirous to lead him though he mantled his art with an affectation of oddity  but continued the magistrate how do you think you can be trusted with a charge in the prison when you have broken at your own hand half the jails in scotland  wi your honours leave said ratcliffe if i kend sae weel how to wun out mysell its like i wad be a the better a hand to keep other folk in i think they wad ken their business weel that held me in when i wanted to be out or wan out when i wanted to hand them in  the remark seemed to strike the magistrate but he made no further immediate observation only desired ratcliffe to be removed  when this daring and yet sly freebooter was out of hearing the magistrate asked the city clerk what he thought of the fellows assurance  its no for me to say sir replied the clerk but if james ratcliffe be inclined to turn to good there is not a man eer came within the ports of the burgh could be of sae muckle use to the good town in the thief and lockup line of business ill speak to mr sharpitlaw about him  upon ratcliffes retreat butler was placed at the table for examination the magistrate conducted his inquiry civilly but yet in a manner which gave him to understand that he laboured under strong suspicion with a frankness which at once became his calling and character butler avowed his involuntary presence at the murder of porteous and at the request of the magistrate entered into a minute detail of the circumstances which attended that unhappy affair all the particulars such as we have narrated were taken minutely down by the clerk from butlers dictation  when the narrative was concluded the crossexamination commenced which it is a painful task even for the most candid witness to undergo since a story especially if connected with agitating and alarming incidents can scarce be so clearly and distinctly told but that some ambiguity and doubt may be thrown upon it by a string of successive and minute interrogatories  the magistrate commenced by observing that butler had said his object was to return to the village of libberton but that he was interrupted by the mob at the west port is the west port your usual way of leaving town when you go to libberton said the magistrate with a sneer  no certainly answered butler with the haste of a man anxious to vindicate the accuracy of his evidence but i chanced to be nearer that port than any other and the hour of shutting the gates was on the point of striking  that was unlucky said the magistrate drily pray being as you say under coercion and fear of the lawless multitude and compelled to accompany them through scenes disagreeable to all men of humanity and more especially irreconcilable to the profession of a minister did you not attempt to struggle resist or escape from their violence  butler replied that their numbers prevented him from attempting resistance and their vigilance from effecting his escape  that was unlucky again repeated the magistrate in the same dry inacquiescent tone of voice and manner he proceeded with decency and politeness but with a stiffness which argued his continued suspicion to ask many questions concerning the behaviour of the mob the manners and dress of the ringleaders and when he conceived that the caution of butler if he was deceiving him must be lulled asleep the magistrate suddenly and artfully returned to former parts of his declaration and required a new recapitulation of the circumstances to the minutest and most trivial point which attended each part of the melancholy scene no confusion or contradiction however occurred that could countenance the suspicion which he seemed to have adopted against butler at length the train of his interrogatories reached madge wildfire at whose name the magistrate and townclerk exchanged significant glances if the fate of the good town had depended on her careful magistrates knowing the features and dress of this personage his inquiries could not have been more particular but butler could say almost nothing of this persons features which were disguised apparently with red paint and soot like an indian going to battle besides the projecting shade of a curch or coif which muffled the hair of the supposed female he declared that he thought he could not know this madge wildfire if placed before him in a different dress but that he believed he might recognise her voice  the magistrate requested him again to state by what gate he left the city  by the cowgate port replied butler  was that the nearest road to libberton  no answered butler with embarrassment but it was the nearest way to extricate myself from the mob  the clerk and magistrate again exchanged glances  is the cowgate port a nearer way to libberton from the grassmarket than bristo port  no replied butler but i had to visit a friend  indeed said the interrogatoryou were in a hurry to tell the sight you had witnessed i suppose  indeed i was not replied butler nor did i speak on the subject the whole time i was at st leonards crags  which road did you take to st leonards crags  by the foot of salisbury crags was the reply  indeed you seem partial to circuitous routes again said the magistrate whom did you see after you left the city  one by one he obtained a description of every one of the groups who had passed butler as already noticed their number demeanour and appearance and at length came to the circumstance of the mysterious stranger in the kings park on this subject butler would fain have remained silent but the magistrate had no sooner got a slight hint concerning the incident than he seemed bent to possess himself of the most minute particulars  look ye mr butler said he you are a young man and bear an excellent character so much i will myself testify in your favour but we are aware there has been at times a sort of bastard and fiery zeal in some of your order and those men irreproachable in other points which has led them into doing and countenancing great irregularities by which the peace of the country is liable to be shakeni will deal plainly with you i am not at all satisfied with this story of your setting out again and again to seek your dwelling by two several roads which were both circuitous and to be frank no one whom we have examined on this unhappy affair could trace in your appearance any thing like your acting under compulsion moreover the waiters at the cowgate port observed something like the trepidation of guilt in your conduct and declare that you were the first to command them to open the gate in a tone of authority as if still presiding over the guards and outposts of the rabble who had besieged them the whole night  god forgive them said butler i only asked free passage for myself they must have much misunderstood if they did not wilfully misrepresent me  well mr butler resumed the magistrate i am inclined to judge the best and hope the best as i am sure i wish the best but you must be frank with me if you wish to secure my good opinion and lessen the risk of inconvenience to yourself you have allowed you saw another individual in your passage through the kings park to saint leonards cragsi must know every word which passed betwixt you  thus closely pressed butler who had no reason for concealing what passed at that meeting unless because jeanie deans was concerned in it thought it best to tell the whole truth from beginning to end  do you suppose said the magistrate pausing that the young woman will accept an invitation so mysterious  i fear she will replied butler  why do you use the word fear it said the magistrate  because i am apprehensive for her safety in meeting at such a time and place one who had something of the manner of a desperado and whose message was of a character so inexplicable  her safety shall be cared for said the magistrate mr butler i am concerned i cannot immediately discharge you from confinement but i hope you will not be long detainedremove mr butler and let him be provided with decent accommodation in all respects  he was conducted back to the prison accordingly but in the food offered to him as well as in the apartment in which he was lodged the recommendation of the magistrate was strictly attended to     chapter thirteenth                        dark and eerie was the night                         and lonely was the way                     as janet wi her green mantell                        to miles cross she did gae                                           old ballad  leaving butler to all the uncomfortable thoughts attached to his new situation among which the most predominant was his feeling that he was by his confinement deprived of all possibility of assisting the family at st leonards in their greatest need we return to jeanie deans who had seen him depart without an opportunity of farther explanation in all that agony of mind with which the female heart bids adieu to the complicated sensations so well described by coleridge                      hopes and fears that kindle hope                      an undistinguishable throng                     and gentle wishes long subdued                       subdued and cherished long  it is not the firmest heart and jeanie under her russet rokelay had one that would not have disgraced catos daughter that can most easily bid adieu to these soft and mingled emotions she wept for a few minutes bitterly and without attempting to refrain from this indulgence of passion but a moments recollection induced her to check herself for a grief selfish and proper to her own affections while her father and sister were plunged into such deep and irretrievable affliction she drew from her pocket the letter which had been that morning flung into her apartment through an open window and the contents of which were as singular as the expression was violent and energetic if she would save a human being from the most damning guilt and all its desperate consequencesif she desired the life an honour of her sister to be saved from the bloody fangs of an unjust lawif she desired not to forfeit peace of mind here and happiness hereafter such was the frantic style of the conjuration she was entreated to give a sure secret and solitary meeting to the writer she alone could rescue him so ran the letter and he only could rescue her he was in such circumstances the billet farther informed her that an attempt to bring any witness of their conference or even to mention to her father or any other person whatsoever the letter which requested it would inevitably prevent its taking place and ensure the destruction of her sister the letter concluded with incoherent but violent protestations that in obeying this summons she had nothing to fear personally  the message delivered to her by butler from the stranger in the park tallied exactly with the contents of the letter but assigned a later hour and a different place of meeting apparently the writer of the letter had been compelled to let butler so far into his confidence for the sake of announcing this change to jeanie she was more than once on the point of producing the billet in vindication of herself from her lovers halfhinted suspicions but there is something in stooping to justification which the pride of innocence does not at all times willingly submit to besides that the threats contained in the letter in case of her betraying the secret hung heavy on her heart it is probable however that had they remained longer together she might have taken the resolution to submit the whole matter to butler and be guided by him as to the line of conduct which she should adopt and when by the sudden interruption of their conference she lost the opportunity of doing so she felt as if she had been unjust to a friend whose advice might have been highly useful and whose attachment deserved her full and unreserved confidence  to have recourse to her father upon this occasion she considered as highly imprudent there was no possibility of conjecturing in what light the matter might strike old david whose manner of acting and thinking in extraordinary circumstances depended upon feelings and principles peculiar to himself the operation of which could not be calculated upon even by those best acquainted with him to have requested some female friend to have accompanied her to the place of rendezvous would perhaps have been the most eligible expedient but the threats of the writer that betraying his secret would prevent their meeting on which her sisters safety was said to depend from taking place at all would have deterred her from making such a confidence even had she known a person in whom she thought it could with safety have been reposed but she knew none such their acquaintance with the cottagers in the vicinity had been very slight and limited to trifling acts of good neighbourhood jeanie knew little of them and what she knew did not greatly incline her to trust any of them they were of the order of loquacious goodhumoured gossips usually found in their situation of life and their conversation had at all times few charms for a young woman to whom nature and the circumstance of a solitary life had given a depth of thought and force of character superior to the frivolous part of her sex whether in high or low degree  left alone and separated from all earthly counsel she had recourse to a friend and adviser whose ear is open to the cry of the poorest and most afflicted of his people she knelt and prayed with fervent sincerity that god would please to direct her what course to follow in her arduous and distressing situation it was the belief of the time and sect to which she belonged that special answers to prayer differing little in their character from divine inspiration were as they expressed it borne in upon their minds in answer to their earnest petitions in a crisis of difficulty without entering into an abstruse point of divinity one thing is plainnamely that the person who lays open his doubts and distresses in prayer with feeling and sincerity must necessarily in the act of doing so purify his mind from the dross of worldly passions and interests and bring it into that state when the resolutions adopted are likely to be selected rather from a sense of duty than from any inferior motive jeanie arose from her devotions with her heart fortified to endure affliction and encouraged to face difficulties  i will meet this unhappy man she said to herselfunhappy he must be since i doubt he has been the cause of poor effies misfortunebut i will meet him be it for good or ill my mind shall never cast up to me that for fear of what might be said or done to myself i left that undone that might even yet be the rescue of her  with a mind greatly composed since the adoption of this resolution she went to attend her father the old man firm in the principles of his youth did not in outward appearance at least permit a thought of hit family distress to interfere with the stoical reserve of his countenance and manners he even chid his daughter for having neglected in the distress of the morning some trifling domestic duties which fell under her department  why what meaneth this jeanie said the old manthe brown fouryearaulds milk is not seiled yet nor the bowies put up on the bink if ye neglect your warldly duties in the day of affliction what confidence have i that ye mind the greater matters that concern salvation god knows our bowies and our pipkins and our draps o milk and our bits o bread are nearer and dearer to us than the bread of life  jeanie not unpleased to hear her fathers thoughts thus expand themselves beyond the sphere of his immediate distress obeyed him and proceeded to put her household matters in order while old david moved from place to place about his ordinary employments scarce showing unless by a nervous impatience at remaining long stationary an occasional convulsive sigh or twinkle of the eyelid that he was labouring under the yoke of such bitter affliction  the hour of noon came on and the father and child sat down to their homely repast in his petition for a blessing on the meal the poor old man added to his supplication a prayer that the bread eaten in sadness of heart and the bitter waters of marah might be made as nourishing as those which had been poured forth from a full cup and a plentiful basket and store and having concluded his benediction and resumed the bonnet which he had laid reverently aside he proceeded to exhort his daughter to eat not by example indeed but at least by precept  the man after gods own heart he said washed and anointed himself and did eat bread in order to express his submission under a dispensation of suffering and it did not become a christian man or woman so to cling to creaturecomforts of wife or bairnshere the words became too great as it were for his utteranceas to forget the fist dutysubmission to the divine will  to add force to his precept he took a morsel on his plate but nature proved too strong even for the powerful feelings with which he endeavoured to bridle it ashamed of his weakness he started up and ran out of the house with haste very unlike the deliberation of his usual movements in less than five minutes he returned having successfully struggled to recover his ordinary composure of mind and countenance and affected to colour over his late retreat by muttering that he thought he heard the young staig loose in the byre  he did not again trust himself with the subject of his former conversation and his daughter was glad to see that he seemed to avoid farther discourse on that agitating topic the hours glided on as on they must and do pass whether winged with joy or laden with affliction the sun set beyond the dusky eminence of the castle and the screen of western hills and the close of evening summoned david deans and his daughter to the family duty of the night it came bitterly upon jeanies recollection how often when the hour of worship approached she used to watch the lengthening shadows and look out from the door of the house to see if she could spy her sisters return homeward alas this idle and thoughtless waste of time to what evils had it not finally led and was she altogether guiltless who noticing effies turn to idle and light society had not called in her fathers authority to restrain herbut i acted for the best she again reflected and who could have expected such a growth of evil from one grain of human leaven in a disposition so kind and candid and generous  as they sate down to the exercise as it is called a chair happened accidentally to stand in the place which effie usually occupied david deans saw his daughters eyes swim in tears as they were directed towards this object and pushed it aside with a gesture of some impatience as if desirous to destroy every memorial of earthly interest when about to address the deity the portion of scripture was read the psalm was sung the prayer was made and it was remarkable that in discharging these duties the old man avoided all passages and expressions of which scripture affords so many that might be considered as applicable to his own domestic misfortune in doing so it was perhaps his intention to spare the feelings of his daughter as well as to maintain in outward show at least that stoical appearance of patient endurance of all the evil which earth could bring which was in his opinion essential to the character of one who rated all earthly things at their just estimate of nothingness when he had finished the duty of the evening he came up to his daughter wished her goodnight and having done so continued to hold her by the hands for halfaminute then drawing her towards him kissed her forehead and ejaculated the god of israel bless you even with the blessings of the promise my dear bairn  it was not either in the nature or habits of david deans to seem a fond father nor was he often observed to experience or at least to evince that fulness of the heart which seeks to expand itself in tender expressions or caresses even to those who were dearest to him on the contrary he used to censure this as a degree of weakness in several of his neighbours and particularly in poor widow butler it followed however from the rarity of such emotions in this selfdenied and reserved man that his children attached to occasional marks of his affection and approbation a degree of high interest and solemnity well considering them as evidences of feelings which were only expressed when they became too intense for suppression or concealment  with deep emotion therefore did he bestow and his daughter receive this benediction and paternal caress and you my dear father exclaimed jeanie when the door had closed upon the venerable old man may you have purchased and promised blessings multiplied upon youupon you who walk in this world as though you were not of the world and hold all that it can give or take away but as the midges that the sunblink brings out and the evening wind sweeps away  she now made preparation for her nightwalk her father slept in another part of the dwelling and regular in all his habits seldom or never left his apartment when he had betaken himself to it for the evening it was therefore easy for her to leave the house unobserved so soon as the time approached at which she was to keep her appointment but the step she was about to take had difficulties and terrors in her own eyes though she had no reason to apprehend her fathers interference her life had been spent in the quiet uniform and regular seclusion of their peaceful and monotonous household the very hour which some damsels of the present day as well of her own as of higher degree would consider as the natural period of commencing an evening of pleasure brought in her opinion awe and solemnity in it and the resolution she had taken had a strange daring and adventurous character to which she could hardly reconcile herself when the moment approached for putting it into execution her hands trembled as she snooded her fair hair beneath the riband then the only ornament or cover which young unmarried women wore on their head and as she adjusted the scarlet tartan screen or muffler made of plaid which the scottish women wore much in the fashion of the black silk veils still a part of female dress in the netherlands a sense of impropriety as well as of danger pressed upon her as she lifted the latch of her paternal mansion to leave it on so wild an expedition and at so late an hour unprotected and without the knowledge of her natural guardian  when she found herself abroad and in the open fields additional subjects of apprehension crowded upon her the dim cliffs and scattered rocks interspersed with greensward through which she had to pass to the place of appointment as they glimmered before her in a clear autumn night recalled to her memory many a deed of violence which according to tradition had been done and suffered among them in earlier days they had been the haunt of robbers and assassins the memory of whose crimes is preserved in the various edicts which the council of the city and even the parliament of scotland had passed for dispersing their bands and ensuring safety to the lieges so near the precincts of the city the names of these criminals and of their atrocities were still remembered in traditions of the scattered cottages and the neighbouring suburb in latter times as we have already noticed the sequestered and broken character of the ground rendered it a fit theatre for duels and rencontres among the fiery youth of the period two or three of these incidents all sanguinary and one of them fatal in its termination had happened since deans came to live at st leonards his daughters recollections therefore were of blood and horror as she pursued the small scarcetracked solitary path every step of which conveyed het to a greater distance from help and deeper into the ominous seclusion of these unhallowed precincts  as the moon began to peer forth on the scene with a doubtful flitting and solemn light jeanies apprehensions took another turn too peculiar to her rank and country to remain unnoticed but to trace its origin will require another chapter     chapter fourteenth                              the spirit i have seen                       may be the devil and the devil has power                       to assume a pleasing shape                                               hamlet  witchcraft and demonology as we have already had occasion to remark were at this period believed in by almost all ranks but more especially among the stricter classes of presbyterians whose government when their party were at the head of the state had been much sullied by their eagerness to inquire into and persecute these imaginary crimes now in this point of view also saint leonards crags and the adjacent chase were a dreaded and illreputed district not only had witches held their meetings there but even of very late years the enthusiast or impostor mentioned in the pandaemonium of richard bovet gentleman had among the recesses of these romantic cliffs found his way into the hidden retreats where the fairies revel in the bowels of the earth   note i the fairy boy of leith  with all these legends jeanie deans was too well acquainted to escape that strong impression which they usually make on the imagination indeed relations of this ghostly kind had been familiar to her from her infancy for they were the only relief which her fathers conversation afforded from controversial argument or the gloomy history of the strivings and testimonies escapes captures tortures and executions of those martyrs of the covenant with whom it was his chiefest boast to say he had been acquainted in the recesses of mountains in caverns and in morasses to which these persecuted enthusiasts were so ruthlessly pursued they conceived they had often to contend with the visible assaults of the enemy of mankind as in the cities and in the cultivated fields they were exposed to those of the tyrannical government and their soldiery such were the terrors which made one of their gifted seers exclaim when his companion returned to him after having left him alone in a haunted cavern in sorn in galloway it is hard living in this worldincarnate devils above the earth and devils under the earth satan has been here since ye went away but i have dismissed him by resistance we will be no more troubled with him this night david deans believed this and many other such ghostly encounters and victories on the faith of the ansars or auxiliaries of the banished prophets this event was beyond davids remembrance but he used to tell with great awe yet not without a feeling of proud superiority to his auditors how he himself had been present at a fieldmeeting at crochmade when the duty of the day was interrupted by the apparition of a tall black man who in the act of crossing a ford to join the congregation lost ground and was carried down apparently by the force of the stream all were instantly at work to assist him but with so little success that ten or twelve stout men who had hold of the rope which they had cast in to his aid were rather in danger to be dragged into the stream and lose their own lives than likely to save that of the supposed perishing man but famous john semple of carspharn david deans used to say with exultation saw the whaup in the rapequit the rope he cried to us for i that was but a callant had a hand o the rape mysell it is the great enemy he will burn but not drown his design is to disturb the good wark by raising wonder and confusion in your minds to put off from your spirits all that ye hae heard and feltsae we let go the rape said david and he went adown the water screeching and bullering like a bull of bashan as hes cad in scripture   note j intercourse of the covenanters with the invisible world  trained in these and similar legends it was no wonder that jeanie began to feel an illdefined apprehension not merely of the phantoms which might beset her way but of the quality nature and purpose of the being who had thus appointed her a meeting at a place and hour of horror and at a time when her mind must be necessarily full of those tempting and ensnaring thoughts of grief and despair which were supposed to lay sufferers particularly open to the temptations of the evil one if such an idea had crossed even butlers wellinformed mind it was calculated to make a much stronger impression upon hers yet firmly believing the possibility of an encounter so terrible to flesh and blood jeanie with a degree of resolution of which we cannot sufficiently estimate the merit because the incredulity of the age has rendered us strangers to the nature and extent of her feelings persevered in her determination not to omit an opportunity of doing something towards saving her sister although in the attempt to avail herself of it she might be exposed to dangers so dreadful to her imagination so like christiana in the pilgrims progress when traversing with a timid yet resolved step the terrors of the valley of the shadow of death she glided on by rock and stone now in glimmer and now in gloom as her path lay through moonlight or shadow and endeavoured to overpower the suggestions of fear sometimes by fixing her mind upon the distressed condition of her sister and the duty she lay under to afford her aid should that be in her power and more frequently by recurring in mental prayer to the protection of that being to whom night is as noonday  thus drowning at one time her fears by fixing her mind on a subject of overpowering interest and arguing them down at others by referring herself to the protection of the deity she at length approached the place assigned for this mysterious conference  it was situated in the depth of the valley behind salisbury crags which has for a background the northwestern shoulder of the mountain called arthurs seat on whose descent still remain the ruins of what was once a chapel or hermitage dedicated to st anthony the eremite a better site for such a building could hardly have been selected for the chapel situated among the rude and pathless cliffs lies in a desert even in the immediate vicinity of a rich populous and tumultuous capital and the hum of the city might mingle with the orisons of the recluses conveying as little of worldly interest as if it had been the roar of the distant ocean beneath the steep ascent on which these ruins are still visible was and perhaps is still pointed out the place where the wretch nichol muschat who has been already mentioned in these pages had closed a long scene of cruelty towards his unfortunate wife by murdering her with circumstances of uncommon barbarity   see note g muschats cairn  the execration in which the mans crime was held extended itself to the place where it was perpetrated which was marked by a small cairn or heap of stones composed of those which each chance passenger had thrown there in testimony of abhorrence and on the principle it would seem of the ancient british malediction may you have a cairn for your burialplace   illustration muschats cairn221   as our heroine approached this ominous and unhallowed spot she paused and looked to the moon now rising broad in the northwest and shedding a more distinct light than it had afforded during her walk thither eyeing the planet for a moment she then slowly and fearfully turned her head towards the cairn from which it was at first averted she was at first disappointed nothing was visible beside the little pile of stones which shone grey in the moonlight a multitude of confused suggestions rushed on her mind had her correspondent deceived her and broken his appointmentwas he too tardy at the appointment he had madeor had some strange turn of fate prevented him from appearing as he proposedor if he were an unearthly being as her secret apprehensions suggested was it his object merely to delude her with false hopes and put her to unnecessary toil and terror according to the nature as she had heard of those wandering demonsor did he purpose to blast her with the sudden horrors of his presence when she had come close to the place of rendezvous these anxious reflections did not prevent her approaching to the cairn with a pace that though slow was determined  when she was within two yards of the heap of stones a figure rose suddenly up from behind it and jeanie scarce forbore to scream aloud at what seemed the realisation of the most frightful of her anticipations she constrained herself to silence however and making a dead pause suffered the figure to open the conversation which he did by asking in a voice which agitation rendered tremulous and hollow are you the sister of that illfated young woman  i ami am the sister of effie deans exclaimed jeanie and as ever you hope god will hear you at your need tell me if you can tell what can be done to save her  i do not hope god will hear me at my need was the singular answer i do not deservei do not expect he will this desperate language he uttered in a tone calmer than that with which he had at first spoken probably because the shook of first addressing her was what he felt most difficult to overcome jeanie remained mute with horror to hear language expressed so utterly foreign to all which she had ever been acquainted with that it sounded in her ears rather like that of a fiend than of a human being the stranger pursued his address to her without seeming to notice her surprise you see before you a wretch predestined to evil here and hereafter  for the sake of heaven that hears and sees us said jeanie dinna speak in this desperate fashion the gospel is sent to the chief of sinnersto the most miserable among the miserable  then should i have my own share therein said the stranger if you call it sinful to have been the destruction of the mother that bore meof the friend that loved meof the woman that trusted meof the innocent child that was born to me if to have done all this is to be a sinner and survive it is to be miserable then am i most guilty and most miserable indeed  then you are the wicked cause of my sisters ruin said jeanie with a natural touch of indignation expressed in her tone of voice  curse me for it if you will said the stranger i have well deserved it at your hand  it is fitter for me said jeanie to pray to god to forgive you  do as you will how you will or what you will he replied with vehemence only promise to obey my directions and save your sisters life  i must first know said jeanie the means you would have me use in her behalf  noyou must first swearsolemnly swear that you will employ them when i make them known to you  surely it is needless to swear that i will do all that is lawful to a christian to save the life of my sister  i will have no reservation thundered the stranger lawful or unlawful christian or heathen you shall swear to do my hest and act by my counsel oryou little know whose wrath you provoke  i will think on what you have said said jeanie who began to get much alarmed at the frantic vehemence of his manner and disputed in her own mind whether she spoke to a maniac or an apostate spirit incarnatei will think on what you say and let you ken tomorrow  tomorrow exclaimed the man with a laugh of scornand where will i be tomorrowor where will you be tonight unless you swear to walk by my counselthere was one accursed deed done at this spot before now and there shall be another to match it unless you yield up to my guidance body and soul  as he spoke he offered a pistol at the unfortunate young woman she neither fled nor fainted but sunk on her knees and asked him to spare her life  is that all you have to say said the unmoved ruffian  do not dip your hands in the blood of a defenceless creature that has trusted to you said jeanie still on her knees  is that all you can say for your lifehave you no promise to givewill you destroy your sister and compel me to shed more blood  i can promise nothing said jeanie which is unlawful for a christian  he cocked the weapon and held it towards her  may god forgive you she said pressing her hands forcibly against her eyes  dn muttered the man and turning aside from her he uncocked the pistol and replaced it in his pocketi am a villain he said steeped in guilt and wretchedness but not wicked enough to do you any harm i only wished to terrify you into my measuresshe hears me notshe is gonegreat god what a wretch am i become  as he spoke she recovered herself from an agony which partook of the bitterness of death and in a minute or two through the strong exertion of her natural sense and courage collected herself sufficiently to understand he intended her no personal injury  no he repeated i would not add to the murder of your sister and of her child that of any one belonging to hermad frantic as i am and unrestrained by either fear or mercy given up to the possession of an evil being and forsaken by all that is good i would not hurt you were the world offered me for a bribe but for the sake of all that is dear to you swear you will follow my counsel take this weapon shoot me through the head and with your own hand revenge your sisters wrong only follow the coursethe only course by which her life can be saved  alas is she innocent or guilty  she is guiltlessguiltless of every thing but of having trusted a villainyet had it not been for those that were worse than i amyes worse than i am though i am bad indeedthis misery had not befallen  and my sisters childdoes it live said jeanie  no it was murderedthe newborn infant was barbarously murdered he uttered in a low yet stern and sustained voicebut he added hastily not by her knowledge or consent  then why cannot the guilty be brought to justice and the innocent freed  torment me not with questions which can serve no purpose he sternly repliedthe deed was done by those who are far enough from pursuit and safe enough from discoveryno one can save effie but yourself  woes me how is it in my power asked jeanie in despondency  hearken to meyou have senseyou can apprehend my meaningi will trust you your sister is innocent of the crime charged against her  thank god for that said jeanie  be still and hearkenthe person who assisted her in her illness murdered the child but it was without the mothers knowledge or consentshe is therefore guiltless as guiltless as the unhappy innocent that but gasped a few minutes in this unhappy worldthe better was its hap to be so soon at rest she is innocent as that infant and yet she must dieit is impossible to clear her of the law  cannot the wretches be discovered and given up to punishment said jeanie  do you think you will persuade those who are hardened in guilt to die to save anotheris that the reed you would lean to  but you said there was a remedy again gasped out the terrified young woman  there is answered the stranger and it is in your own hands the blow which the law aims cannot be broken by directly encountering it but it may be turned aside you saw your sister during the period preceding the birth of her childwhat is so natural as that she should have mentioned her condition to you the doing so would as their cant goes take the case from under the statute for it removes the quality of concealment i know their jargon and have had sad cause to know it and the quality of concealment is essential to this statutory offence   note k child murder  nothing is so natural as that effie should have mentioned her condition to youthinkreflecti am positive that she did  woes me said jeanie she never spoke to me on the subject but grat sorely when i spoke to her about her altered looks and the change on her spirits  you asked her questions on the subject he said eagerly you must remember her answer was a confession that she had been ruined by a villainyes lay a strong emphasis on thata cruel false villain call itany other name is unnecessary and that she bore under her bosom the consequences of his guilt and her folly and that he had assured her he would provide safely for her approaching illnesswell he kept his word these last words he spoke as if it were to himself and with a violent gesture of selfaccusation and then calmly proceeded you will remember all thisthat is all that is necessary to be said  but i cannot remember answered jeanie with simplicity that which effie never told me  are you so dullso very dull of apprehension he exclaimed suddenly grasping her arm and holding it firm in his hand i tell you speaking between his teeth and under his breath but with great energy you must remember that she told you all this whether she ever said a syllable of it or no you must repeat this tale in which there is no falsehood except in so far as it was not told to you before these justicesjusticiarywhatever they call their bloodthirsty court and save your sister from being murdered and them from becoming murderers do not hesitatei pledge life and salvation that in saying what i have said you will only speak the simple truth  but replied jeanie whose judgment was too accurate not to see the sophistry of this argument i shall be mansworn in the very thing in which my testimony is wanted for it is the concealment for which poor effie is blamed and you would make me tell a falsehood anent it  i see he said my first suspicions of you were right and that you will let your sister innocent fair and guiltless except in trusting a villain die the death of a murderess rather than bestow the breath of your mouth and the sound of your voice to save her  i wad ware the best blood in my body to keep her skaithless said jeanie weeping in bitter agony but i canna change right into wrang or make that true which is false  foolish hardhearted girl said the stranger are you afraid of what they may do to you i tell you even the retainers of the law who course life as greyhounds do hares will rejoice at the escape of a creature so youngso beautiful that they will not suspect your tale that if they did suspect it they would consider you as deserving not only of forgiveness but of praise for your natural affection  it is not man i fear said jeanie looking upward the god whose name i must call on to witness the truth of what i say he will know the falsehood  and he will know the motive said the stranger eagerly he will know that you are doing thisnot for lucre of gain but to save the life of the innocent and prevent the commission of a worse crime than that which the law seeks to avenge  he has given us a law said jeanie for the lamp of our path if we stray from it we err against knowledgei may not do evil even that good may come out of it but youyou that ken all this to be true which i must take on your wordyou that if i understood what you said een now promised her shelter and protection in her travail why do not you step forward and bear leal and soothfast evidence in her behalf as ye may with a clear conscience  to whom do you talk of a clear conscience woman said he with a sudden fierceness which renewed her terrorsto mei have not known one for many a year bear witness in her behalfa proper witness that even to speak these few words to a woman of so little consequence as yourself must choose such an hour and such a place as this when you see owls and bats fly abroad like larks in the sunshine you may expect to see such as i am in the assemblies of menhushlisten to that  a voice was heard to sing one of those wild and monotonous strains so common in scotland and to which the natives of that country chant their old ballads the sound ceasedthen came nearer and was renewed the stranger listened attentively still holding jeanie by the arm as she stood by him in motionless terror as if to prevent her interrupting the strain by speaking or stirring when the sounds were renewed the words were distinctly audible                    when the gledes in the blue cloud                         the lavrock lies still                   when the hounds in the greenwood                        the hind keeps the hill  the person who sung kept a strained and powerful voice at its highest pitch so that it could be heard at a very considerable distance as the song ceased they might hear a stifled sound as of steps and whispers of persons approaching them the song was again raised but the tune was changed                   o sleep ye sound sir james she said                       when ye suld rise and ride                 theres twenty men wi bow and blade                       are seeking where ye hide  i dare stay no longer said the stranger return home or remain till they come upyou have nothing to fearbut do not tell you saw meyour sisters fate is in your hands so saying he turned from her and with a swift yet cautiously noiseless step plunged into the darkness on the side most remote from the sounds which they heard approaching and was soon lost to her sight jeanie remained by the cairn terrified beyond expression and uncertain whether she ought to fly homeward with all the speed she could exert or wait the approach of those who were advancing towards her this uncertainty detained her so long that she now distinctly saw two or three figures already so near to her that a precipitate flight would have been equally fruitless and impolitic     chapter fifteenth                               she speaks things in doubt                  that carry but half sense her speech is nothing                  yet the unshaped use of it doth move                  the hearers to collection they aim at it                  and botch the words up to fit their own thoughts                                            hamlet  like the digressive poet ariosto i find myself under the necessity of connecting the branches of my story by taking up the adventures of another of the characters and bringing them down to the point at which we have left those of jeanie deans it is not perhaps the most artificial way of telling a story but it has the advantage of sparing the necessity of resuming what a knitter if stockinglooms have left such a person in the land might call our dropped stitches a labour in which the author generally toils much without getting credit for his pains  i could risk a sma wad said the clerk to the magistrate that this rascal ratcliffe if he were insured of his necks safety could do more than ony ten of our policepeople and constables to help us to get out of this scrape of porteouss he is weel acquent wi a the smugglers thieves and banditti about edinburgh and indeed he may be called the father of a the misdoers in scotland for he has passed amang them for these twenty years by the name of daddie rat  a bonny sort of a scoundrel replied the magistrate to expect a place under the city  begging your honours pardon said the citys procuratorfiscal upon whom the duties of superintendent of police devolved mr fairscrieve is perfectly in the right it is just sic as ratcliffe that the town needs in my department an if sae be that hes disposed to turn his knowledge to the city service yell no find a better manyell get nae saints to be searchers for uncustomed goods or for thieves and sic likeand your decent sort of men religious professors and broken tradesmen that are put into the like o sic trust can do nae gude ava they are feared for this and they are scrupulous about that and they arena free to tell a lie though it may be for the benefit of the city and they dinna like to be out at irregular hours and in a dark cauld night and they like a clout ower the crown far waur and sae between the fear o god and the fear o man and the fear o getting a sair throat or sair banes theres a dozen o our cityfolk baith waiters and officers and constables that can find out naething but a wee bit skulduddery for the benefit of the kirk treasurer jock porteous thats stiff and stark puir fallow was worth a dozen o them for he never had ony fears or scruples or doubts or conscience about onything your honours bade him  he was a gude servant o the town said the bailie though he was an ower freeliving man but if you really think this rascal ratcliffe could do us ony service in discovering these malefactors i would insure him life reward and promotion its an awsome thing this mischance for the city mr fairscrieve it will be very ill taen wi abune stairs queen caroline god bless her is a womanat least i judge sae and its nae treason to speak my mind sae farand ye maybe ken as weel as i do for ye hae a housekeeper though ye arena a married man that women are wilfu and downa bide a slight and it will sound ill in her ears that sic a confused mistake suld come to pass and naebody sae muckle as to be put into the tolbooth about it  if ye thought that sir said the procuratorfiscal we could easily clap into the prison a few blackguards upon suspicion it will have a gude active look and i hae aye plenty on my list that wadna be a hair the waur of a week or twas imprisonment and if ye thought it no strictly just ye could be just the easier wi them the neist time they did onything to deserve it they arena the sort to be lang o gieing ye an opportunity to clear scores wi them on that account  i doubt that will hardly do in this case mr sharpitlaw returned the townclerk theyll run their letters and be adrift again before ye ken where ye are   a scottish form of procedure answering in some respects to the english habeas corpus  i will speak to the lord provost said the magistrate about ratcliffes business mr sharpitlaw you will go with me and receive instructionssomething may be made too out of this story of butlers and his unknown gentlemani know no business any man has to swagger about in the kings park and call himself the devil to the terror of honest folks who dinna care to hear mair about the devil than is said from the pulpit on the sabbath i cannot think the preacher himsell wad be heading the mob though the time has been they hae been as forward in a bruilzie as their neighbours  but these times are lang by said mr sharpitlaw in my fathers time there was mair search for silenced ministers about the bowhead and the covenant close and all the tents of kedar as they cad the dwellings o the godly in those days than theres now for thieves and vagabonds in the laigh calton and the back o the canongate but that times weel by an it bide and if the bailie will get me directions and authority from the provost ill speak wi daddie rat mysell for im thinking ill make mair out o him than yell do  mr sharpitlaw being necessarily a man of high trust was accordingly empowered in the course of the day to make such arrangements as might seem in the emergency most advantageous for the good town he went to the jail accordingly and saw ratcliffe in private  the relative positions of a policeofficer and a professed thief bear a different complexion according to circumstances the most obvious simile of a hawk pouncing upon his prey is often least applicable sometimes the guardian of justice has the air of a cat watching a mouse and while he suspends his purpose of springing upon the pilferer takes care so to calculate his motions that he shall not get beyond his power sometimes more passive still he uses the art of fascination ascribed to the rattlesnake and contents himself with glaring on the victim through all his devious flutterings certain that his terror confusion and disorder of ideas will bring him into his jaws at last the interview between ratcliffe and sharpitlaw had an aspect different from all these they sat for five minutes silent on opposite sides of a small table and looked fixedly at each other with a sharp knowing and alert cast of countenance not unmingled with an inclination to laugh and resembled more than anything else two dogs who preparing for a game at romps are seen to couch down and remain in that posture for a little time watching each others movements and waiting which shall begin the game  so mr ratcliffe said the officer conceiving it suited his dignity to speak first you give up business i find  yes sir replied ratcliffe i shall be on that lay nae mairand i think that will save your folk some trouble mr sharpitlaw  which jock daigleish then finisher of the law in the scottish metropolis wad save them as easily returned the procuratorfiscal   among the flying leaves of the period there is one called sutherlands lament for the loss of his postwith his advice to john daglees his successor he was whipped and banished 25th july 1722 there is another called the speech and dying words of john dalgleish lockman alias hangman of edinburgh containing these lines                        death ive a favour for to beg                       that ye wad only gie a fleg                            and spare my life                       as i did to illhanged megg                                the websters wife  ay if i waited in the tolbooth here to have him fit my cravatbut thats an idle way o speaking mr sharpitlaw  why i suppose you know you are under sentence of death mr ratcliffe replied mr sharpitlaw  aye so are a as that worthy minister said in the tolbooth kirk the day robertson wan off but naebody kens when it will be executed gude faith he had better reason to say sae than he dreamed off before the play was played out that morning  this robertson said sharpitlaw in a lower and something like a confidential tone dye ken ratthat is can ye

collectors job that wilson led him into and some tuilzies about run goods wi the gaugers and the waiters he never did onything that came near our line o business  umph thats singular considering the company he kept  fact upon my honour and credit said ratcliffe gravely he keepit out o our little bits of affairs and thats mair than wilson did i hae dune business wi wilson afore now but the lad will come on in time theres nae fear o him naebody will live the life he has led but what hell come to sooner or later  who or what is he ratcliffe you know i suppose said sharpitlaw  hes better born i judge than he cares to let on hes been a soldier and he has been a playactor and i watna what he has been or hasna been for as young as he is sae that it had daffing and nonsense about it  pretty pranks he has played in his time i suppose  ye may say that said ratcliffe with a sardonic smile and touching his nose a deevil amang the lasses  like enough said sharpitlaw weel ratcliffe ill no stand niffering wi ye ye ken the way that favours gotten in my office ye maun be usefu  certainly sir to the best of my powernaething for naethingi ken the rule of the office said the exdepredator

daddie rat unless ye do or say something to deserve it  well then dn it answered the criminal since it maun be sae i saw geordie robertson among the boys that brake the jail i suppose that will do me

womans bit mutch on his head but ye never saw sic a cathrow ane couldna hae een to a thing  but did he speak to no one said sharpitlaw  they were a speaking and gabbling through other said ratcliffe who was obviously unwilling to carry his evidence farther than he could possibly help  this will not do ratcliffe said the procurator you must speak outoutout tapping the table emphatically as he repeated that impressive monosyllable  its very hard sir said the prisoner and but for the underturnkeys place  and the reversion of the captaincythe captaincy of the tolbooth manthat is in case of gude behaviour  ay ay said ratcliffe gude behaviourtheres the deevil and then its waiting for dead folks shoon into the bargain  but robertsons head will weigh something said sharpitlaw something gey and heavy rat the town maun show causethats right and reasonand then yell hae freedom to enjoy your gear honestly  i dinna ken said ratcliffe its a queer way of beginning the trade of honestybut deil ma care weel then i heard and saw him speak to the wench effie deans thats up there for childmurder  the deil ye did rat this is finding a mares nest wi a witnessand the man that spoke to butler in the park and that was to meet wi jeanie deans at muschats cairnwhew lay that and that together as sure as i live hes been the father of the lassies wean  there hae been waur guesses than that im thinking observed ratcliffe turning his quid of tobacco in his cheek and squirting out the juice i heard something a while syne about his drawing up wi a bonny quean about the pleasaunts and that it was a wilson could do to keep him frae marrying her  here a city officer entered and told sharpitlaw that they had the woman in custody whom he had directed them to bring before him  its little matter now said he the thing is taking another turn however george ye may bring her in  the officer retired and introduced upon his return a tall strapping wench of eighteen or twenty dressed fantastically in a sort of blue ridingjacket with tarnished lace her hair clubbed like that of a man a highland bonnet and a bunch of broken feathers a ridingskirt or petticoat of scarlet camlet embroidered with tarnished flowers her features were coarse and masculine yet at a little distance by dint of very bright wildlooking black eyes an aquiline nose and a commanding profile appeared rather handsome she flourished the switch she held in her hand dropped a courtesy as low as a lady at a birthnight introduction recovered herself seemingly according to touchstones directions to audrey and opened the conversation without waiting till any questions were asked  god gie your honour gudeeen and mony o them bonny mr sharpitlawgudeeen to ye daddie rattonthey tauld me ye were hanged man or did ye get out o john dalgleishs hands like halfhangit maggie dickson  whisht ye daft jaud said ratcliffe and hear whats said to ye  wi a my heart ratton great preferment for poor madge to be brought up the street

butler come into the apartment theres a minister in the tolboothwha will ca it a graceless place nowise warrant hes in for the gude auld causebut its be nae cause o mine and off she went into a song   hey for cavaliers ho for cavaliers dub a dub dub a dub have at old beelzebub olivers squeaking for fear  did you ever see that mad woman before said sharpitlaw to butler  not to my knowledge sir replied butler  i thought as much said the procuratorfiscal looking towards ratcliffe who answered his glance with a nod of acquiescence and intelligence  but that is madge wildfire as she calls herself said the man of law to butler  ay that i am said madge and that i have been ever since i was something betterheigh hoand something like melancholy dwelt on her features for a minutebut i canna mind when that wasit was lang syne at ony rate and ill neer fash my thumb about it             i glance like the wildfire through country and town                im seen on the causewayim seen on the down            the lightning that flashes so bright and so free                is scarcely so blithe or so bonny as me  hand your tongue ye skirling limmer said the officer who had acted as master of the ceremonies to this extraordinary performer and who was rather scandalised at the freedom of her demeanour before a person of mr sharpitlaws importancehaud your tongue or ise gie ye something to skirl for  let her alone george said sharpitlaw dinna put her out o tune i hae some questions to ask herbut first mr butler take another look of her  do sae ministerdo sae cried madge i am as weel worth looking at as ony book in your aughtand i can say the single carritch and the double carritch and justification and effectual calling and the assembly of divines at westminster that is she added in a low tone i could say them ancebut its lang syneand ane forgets ye ken and poor madge heaved another deep sigh  weel sir said mr sharpitlaw to butler what think ye now  as i did before said butler that i never saw the poor demented creature in my life before  then she is not the person whom you said the rioters last night described as madge wildfire  certainly not said butler they may be near the same height for they are both tall but i see little other resemblance  their dress then is not alike said sharpitlaw  not in the least said butler  madge my bonny woman said sharpitlaw in the same coaxing manner what did ye do wi your ilkadays claise yesterday  i dinna mind said madge  where was ye yesterday at een madge  i dinna mind ony thing about yesterday answered madge ae day is eneugh for ony body to wun ower wi at a time and ower muckle sometimes  but maybe madge ye wad mind something about it if i was to gie ye this halfcrown said sharpitlaw taking out the piece of money  that might gar me laugh but it couldna gar me mind  but madge continued sharpitlaw were i to send you to the workhouse in leith wynd and gar jock daigleish lay the tawse on your back  that wad gar me greet said madge sobbing but it couldna gar me mind ye ken  she is ower far past reasonable folks motives sir said ratcliffe to mind siller or john dalgleish or the catandninetails either but i think i could gar her tell us something  try her then ratcliffe said sharpitlaw for i am tired of her crazy pate and be dd to her  madge said ratcliffe hae ye ony joes now  an ony body ask ye say ye dinna kenset him to be speaking of my joes auld daddie ratton  i dare say ye hae deil ane  see if i haena then said madge with the toss of the head of affronted beautytheres rob the ranter and will fleming and then theres geordie robertson ladthats gentleman geordiewhat think ye o that  ratcliffe laughed and winking to the procuratorfiscal pursued the inquiry in his own way but madge the lads only like ye when ye hae on your brawsthey wadna touch you wi a pair o tangs when you are in your auld ilkaday rags  yere a leeing auld sorrow then replied the fair one for gentle geordie robertson put my ilkadays claise on his ain bonny sell yestreen and gaed a through the town wi them and gawsie and grand he lookit like ony queen in the land  i dinna believe a word ot said ratcliffe with another wink to the procurator thae duds were a o the colour o moonshine in the water im thinking madgethe gown wad be a skyblue scarlet ise warrant ye  it was nae sic thing said madge whose unretentive memory let out in the eagerness of contradiction all that she would have most wished to keep concealed had her judgment been equal to her inclination it was neither scarlet nor skyblue but my ain auld brown threshiecoat of a shortgown and my mothers auld mutch and my red rokelayand he gied me a croun and a kiss for the use o them blessing on his bonny facethough its been a dear ane to me  and where did he change his clothes again hinnie said sharpitlaw in his most conciliatory manner  the procurators spoiled a observed ratcliffe drily and it was even so for the question put in so direct a shape immediately awakened madge to the propriety of being reserved upon those very topics on which ratcliffe had indirectly seduced her to become communicative  what wast ye were speering at us sir she resumed with an appearance of stolidity so speedily assumed as showed there was a good deal of knavery mixed with her folly  i asked you said the procurator at what hour and to what place robertson brought back your clothes  robertsonlord hand a care o us what robertson  why the fellow we were speaking of gentle geordie as you call him  geordie gentle answered madge with wellfeigned amazementi dinna ken naebody they ca geordie gentle  come my jo said sharpitlaw this will not do you must tell us what you did with these clothes of yours  madge wildfire made no answer unless the question may seem connected with the snatch of a song with which she indulged the embarrassed investigator        what did ye wi the bridal ringbridal ringbridal ring       what did ye wi your wedding ring ye little cutty quean o              i gied it till a sodger a sodger a sodger         i gied it till a sodger an auld true love o mine o  of all the madwomen who have sung and said since the days of hamlet the dane if ophelia be the most affecting madge wildfire was the most provoking  the procuratorfiscal was in despair ill take some measures with this dd bess of bedlam said he that shall make her find her tongue  wi your favour sir said ratcliffe better let her mind settle a littleye have aye made out something  true said the official person a brown shortgown mutch red rokelaythat agrees with your madge wildfire mr butler butler agreed that it did so yes there was a sufficient motive for taking this crazy creatures dress and name while he was about such a job  and i am free to say now said ratcliffe  when you see it has come out without you interrupted sharpitlaw  just sae sir reiterated ratcliffe i am free to say now since its come out otherwise that these were the clothes i saw robertson wearing last night in the jail when he was at the head of the rioters  thats direct evidence said sharpitlaw stick to that rati will report favourably of you to the provost for i have business for you tonight it wears late i must home and get a snack and ill be back in the evening keep madge with you ratcliffe and try to get her into a good tune again so saying he left the prison     chapter sixteenth                    and some they whistledand some they sang                          and some did loudly say                  whenever lord barnards horn it blew                         away musgrave away                                  ballad of little musgrave  when the man of office returned to the heart of midlothian he resumed his conference with ratcliffe of whose experience and assistance he now held himself secure you must speak with this wench ratthis effie deansyou must sift her a wee bit for as sure as a tether she will ken robertsons hauntstill her rattill her without delay  craving your pardon mr sharpitlaw said the turnkey elect thats what i am not free to do  free to do man what the deil ails ye nowi thought we had settled a that  i dinna ken sir said ratcliffe i hae spoken to this effieshes strange to this place and to its ways and to a our ways mr sharpitlaw and she greets the silly tawpie and shes breaking her heart already about this wild chield and were she the means o taking him she wad break it outright  she wunna hae time lad said sharpitlaw the woodie will hae its ain o her before thata womans heart takes a lang time o breaking  thats according to the stuff they are made o sir replied ratcliffebut to make a lang tale short i canna undertake the job it gangs against my conscience  your conscience rat said sharpitlaw with a sneer which the reader will probably think very natural upon the occasion  ou ay sir answered ratcliffe calmly just my conscience abody has a conscience though it may be ill wunnin at it i think mines as weel out o the gate as maist folks are and yet its just like the noop of my elbow it whiles gets a bit dirl on a corner  weel rat replied sharpitlaw since ye are nice ill speak to the hussy mysell  sharpitlaw accordingly caused himself to be introduced into the little dark apartment tenanted by the unfortunate effie deans the poor girl was seated on her little flockbed plunged in a deep reverie some food stood on the table of a quality better than is usually supplied to prisoners but it was untouched the person under whose care she was more particularly placed said that sometimes she tasted naething from the tae end of the fourandtwenty hours to the tother except a drink of water  sharpitlaw took a chair and commanding the turnkey to retire he opened the conversation endeavouring to throw into his tone and countenance as much commiseration as they were capable of expressing for the one was sharp and harsh the other sly acute and selfish  hows a wi ye effiehow dye find yoursell hinny  a deep sigh was the only answer  are the folk civil to ye effieits my duty to inquire  very civil sir said effie compelling herself to answer yet hardly knowing what she said  and your victuals continued sharpitlaw in the same condoling tonedo you get what you likeor is there onything you would particularly fancy as your health seems but silly  its a very weel sir i thank ye said the poor prisoner in a tone how different from the sportive vivacity of those of the lily of st leonardsits a very gudeower gude for me  he must have been a great villain effie who brought you to this pass said sharpitlaw  the remark was dictated partly by a natural feeling of which even he could not divest himself though accustomed to practise on the passions of others and keep a most heedful guard over his own and partly by his wish to introduce the sort of conversation which might best serve his immediate purpose indeed upon the present occasion these mixed motives of feeling and cunning harmonised together wonderfully for said sharpitlaw to himself the greater rogue robertson is the more will be the merit of bringing him to justice he must have been a great villain indeed he again reiterated and i wish i had the skelping o him  i may blame mysell mair than him said effie i was bred up to ken better but he poor fellowshe stopped  was a thorough blackguard a his life i dare say said sharpitlaw a stranger he was in this country and a companion of that lawless vagabond wilson i think effie  it wad hae been dearly telling him that he had neer seen wilsons face  thats very true that you are saying effie said sharpitlaw where wast that robertson and you were used to howff thegither somegate about the laigh calton i am thinking  the simple and dispirited girl had thus far followed mr sharpitlaws lead because he had artfully adjusted his observations to the thoughts he was pretty certain must be passing through her own mind so that her answers became a kind of thinking aloud a mood into which those who are either constitutionally absent in mind or are rendered so by the temporary pressure of misfortune may be easily led by a skilful train of suggestions but the last observation of the procuratorfiscal was too much of the nature of a direct interrogatory and it broke the charm accordingly  what was it that i was saying said effie starting up from her reclining posture seating herself upright and hastily shading her dishevelled hair back from her wasted but still beautiful countenance she fixed her eyes boldly and keenly upon sharpitlawyou are too much of a gentleman sirtoo much of an honest man to take any notice of what a poor creature like me says that can hardly ca my senses my aingod help me  advantagei would be of some advantage to you if i could said sharpitlaw in a soothing tone and i ken naething sae likely to serve ye effie as gripping this rascal robertson  o dinna misca him sir that never miscad yourobertsoni am sure i had naething to say against ony man o the name and naething will i say  but if you do not heed your own misfortune effie you should mind what distress he has brought on your family said the man of law  o heaven help me exclaimed poor effiemy poor fathermy dear jeanieo thats sairest to bide of a o sir if you hae ony kindnessif ye hae ony touch of compassionfor a the folk i see here are as hard as the wastanesif ye wad but bid them let my sister jeanie in the next time she cas for when i hear them put her awa frae the door and canna climb up to that high window to see sae muckle as her gowntail its like to pit me out o my judgment and she looked on him with a face of entreaty so earnest yet so humble that she fairly shook the steadfast purpose of his mind  you shall see your sister he began if youll tell methen interrupting himself he added in a more hurried toneno dn it you shall see your sister whether you tell me anything or no so saying he rose up and left the apartment  when he had rejoined ratcliffe he observed you are right ratton theres no making much of that lassie but ae thing i have clearedthat is that robertson has been the father of the bairn and so i will wager a boddle it will be he thats to meet wi jeanie deans this night at muschats cairn and there well nail him rat or my name is not gideon sharpitlaw  but said ratcliffe perhaps because he was in no hurry to see anything which was like to be connected with the discovery and apprehension of robertson an that were the case mr butler wad hae kend the man in the kings park to be the same person wi him in madge wildfires claise that headed the mob  that makes nae difference man replied sharpitlawthe dress the light the confusion and maybe a touch o a blackit cork or a slake o painthout ratton i have seen ye dress your ainsell that the deevil ye belang to durstna hae made oath tye  and thats true too said ratcliffe  and besides ye donnard carle continued sharpitlaw triumphantly the minister did say that he thought he knew something of the features of the birkie that spoke to him in the park though he could not charge his memory where or when he had seen them  its evident then your honour will be right said ratcliffe  then rat you and i will go with the party oursells this night and see him in grips or we are done wi him  i seena muckle use i can be o to your honour said ratcliffe reluctantly  use answered sharpitlawyou can guide the partyyou ken the ground besides i do not intend to quit sight o you my good friend till i have him in hand  weel sir said ratcliffe but in no joyful tone of acquiescence ye maun hae it your ain waybut mind hes a desperate man  we shall have that with us answered sharpitlaw that will settle him if it is necessary  but sir answered ratcliffe i am sure i couldna undertake to guide you to muschats cairn in the nighttime i ken the place as mony does in fair daylight but how to find it by moonshine amang sae mony crags and stanes as like to each other as the collier to the deil is mair than i can tell i might as soon seek moonshine in water  whats the meaning o this ratcliffe said sharpitlaw while he fixed his eye on the recusant with a fatal and ominous expressionhave you forgotten that you are still under sentence of death  no sir said ratcliffe thats a thing no easily put out o memory and if my presence be judged necessary nae doubt i maun gang wi your honour but i was gaun to tell your honour of ane that has mair skeel o the gate than me and thats een madge wildfire  the devil she hasdo you think me as mad as she is to trust to her guidance on such an occasion  your honour is the best judge answered ratcliffe but i ken i can keep her in tune and garr her haud the straight pathshe often sleeps out or rambles about amang thae hills the haill simmer night the daft limmer  weel ratcliffe replied the procuratorfiscal if you think she can guide us the right waybut take heed to what you are aboutyour life depends on your behaviour  its a sair judgment on a man said ratcliffe when he has ance gane sae far wrang as i hae done that deil a bit he can be honest tryt whilk way he will  such was the reflection of ratcliffe when he was left for a few minutes to himself while the retainer of justice went to procure a proper warrant and give the necessary directions  the rising moon saw the whole party free from the walls of the city and entering upon the open ground arthurs seat like a couchant lion of immense sizesalisbury crags like a huge belt or girdle of granite were dimly visible holding their path along the southern side of the canongate they gained the abbey of holyrood house and from thence found their way by step and stile into the kings park they were at first four in numberan officer of justice and sharpitlaw who were well armed with pistols and cutlasses ratcliffe who was not trusted with weapons lest he might peradventure have used them on the wrong side and the female but at the last stile when they entered the chase they were joined by other two officers whom sharpitlaw desirous to secure sufficient force for his purpose and at the same time to avoid observation had directed to wait for him at this place ratcliffe saw this accession of strength with some disquietude for he had hitherto thought it likely that robertson who was a bold stout and active young fellow might have made his escape from sharpitlaw and the single officer by force or agility without his being implicated in the matter but the present strength of the followers of justice was overpowering and the only mode of saving robertson which the old sinner was well disposed to do providing always he could accomplish his purpose without compromising his own safety must be by contriving that he should have some signal of their approach it was probably with this view that ratcliffe had requested the addition of madge to the party having considerable confidence in her propensity to exert her lungs indeed she had already given them so many specimens of her clamorous loquacity that sharpitlaw half determined to send her back with one of the officers rather than carry forward in his company a person so extremely ill qualified to be a guide in a secret expedition it seemed too as if the open air the approach to the hills and the ascent of the moon supposed to be so portentous over those whose brain is infirm made her spirits rise in a degree tenfold more loquacious than she had hitherto exhibited to silence her by fair means seemed impossible authoritative commands and coaxing entreaties she set alike at defiance and threats only made her sulky and altogether intractable  is there no one of you said sharpitlaw impatiently that knows the way to this accursed placethis nichol muschats cairnexcepting this mad clavering idiot  deil ane o them kens it except mysell exclaimed madge how suld they the puir fule cowards but i hae sat on the grave frae batfleeing time till cookcrow and had mony a fine crack wi muschat and ailie muschat that are lying sleeping below  the devil take your crazy brain said sharpitlaw will you not allow the men to answer a question  the officers obtaining a moments audience while ratcliffe diverted madges attention declared that though they had a general knowledge of the spot they could not undertake to guide the party to it by the uncertain light of the moon with such accuracy as to insure success to their expedition  what shall we do ratcliffe said sharpitlaw if he sees us before we see himand thats what he is certain to do if we go strolling about without keeping the straight roadwe may bid gude day to the job and i would rather lose one hundred pounds baith for the credit of the police and because the provost says somebody maun be hanged for this job o porteous come ot what likes  i think said ratcliffe we maun just try madge and ill see if i can get her keepit in ony better order and at ony rate if he suld hear her skirting her auld ends o sangs hes no to ken for that that theres onybody wi her  thats true said sharpitlaw and if he thinks her alone hes as like to come towards her as to rin frae her so set forwardwe hae lost ower muckle time alreadysee to get her to keep the right road  and what sort o house does nichol muschat and his wife keep now said ratcliffe to the mad woman by way of humouring her vein of folly they were but thrawn folk lang syne an a tales be true  ou ay ay aybut as forgotten now replied madge in the confidential tone of a gossip giving the history of her nextdoor neighbourye see i spoke to them mysell and tauld them byganes suld be byganesher throats sair misguggled and mashackered though she wears her corpsesheet drawn weel up to hide it but that canna hinder the bluid seiping through ye

mysell on a bit rag we hae at hame that was mailed wi the bluid of a bit skirting wean that was hurt some gate but out it winna comeweel yell say thats queer but i will bring it out to st anthonys blessed well some braw night just like this and ill cry up ailie muschat and she and i will hae a grand boukingwashing and bleach our claes in the beams of the bonny lady moon thats far pleasanter to me than the sunthe suns ower het and ken ye cummers my brains are het eneugh already but the moon and the dew and the nightwind they are just like a caller kailblade laid on my brow and whiles i think the moon just shines on purpose to pleasure me when naebody sees her but mysell  this raving discourse she continued with prodigious volubility walking on at a great pace and dragging ratcliffe along with her while he endeavoured in appearance at least if not in reality to induce her to moderate her voice  all at once she stopped short upon the top of a little hillock gazed upward fixedly and said not one word for the space of five minutes what the devil is the matter with her now said sharpitlaw to ratcliffecan you not get her forward  ye maun just take a grain o patience wi her sir said ratcliffe shell no gae a foot faster than she likes herself  dn her said sharpitlaw ill take care she has her time in bedlam or bridewell or both for shes both mad and mischievous  in the meanwhile madge who had looked very pensive when she first stopped suddenly burst into a vehement fit of laughter then paused and sighed bitterlythen was seized with a second fit of laughterthen fixing her eyes on the moon lifted up her voice and sung              good even good fair moon good even to thee                  i prithee dear moon now show to me              the form and the features the speech and degree                  of the man that true lover of mine shall be  but i need not ask that of the bonny lady mooni ken that weel eneugh myselltruelove though he wasnabut naebody shall sae that i ever tauld a word about the matterbut whiles i wish the bairn had livedweel god guide us theres a heaven aboon us ahere she sighed bitterly and a bonny moon and sterns in it forby and here she laughed once more  are we to stand here all night said sharpitlaw very impatiently drag her forward  ay sir said ratcliffe if we kend whilk way to drag her that would settle it at ancecome madge hinny addressing her well no be in time to see nichol and his wife unless ye show us the road  in troth and that i will ratton said she seizing him by the arm and resuming her route with huge strides considering it was a female who took them and ill tell ye ratton blithe will nichol muschat be to see ye for he says he kens weel there isna sic a villain out o hell as ye are and he wad be ravished to hae a crack wi youlike to like ye kenits a proverb never failsand ye are baith a pair o the deevils peats i trowhard to ken whilk deserves the hettest corner o his ingleside  ratcliffe was consciencestruck and could not forbear making an involuntary protest against this classification i never shed blood he replied  but ye hae sauld it rattonye hae sauld blood mony a time folk kill wi the tongue as weel as wi the handwi the word as weel as wi the gulley                       it is the bonny butcher lad                      that wears the sleeves of blue                      he sells the flesh on saturday                          on friday that he slew  and what is that i ain doing now thought ratcliffe but ill hae nae wyte of robertsons young bluid if i can help it then speaking apart to madge he asked her whether she did not remember ony o her auld sangs  mony a dainty ane said madge and blithely can i sing them for lightsome sangs make merry gate and she sang                    when the gledes in the blue cloud                         the lavrock lies still                   when the hounds in the greenwood                        the hind keeps the hill  silence her cursed noise if you should throttle her said sharpitlaw i see somebody yonderkeep close my boys and creep round the shoulder of the height george poinder stay you with ratcliffe and tha mad yelling bitch and you other two come with me round under the shadow of the brae  and he crept forward with the stealthy pace of an indian savage who leads his band to surprise an unsuspecting party of some hostile tribe ratcliffe saw them glide of avoiding the moonlight and keeping as much in the shade as possible  robertsons done up said he to himself thae young lads are aye sae thoughtless what deevil could he hae to say to jeanie deans or to ony woman on earth that he suld gang awa and get his neck raxed for her and this mad quean after cracking like a pengun and skirling like a peahen for the haill night behoves just to hae hadden her tongue when her clavers might have dune some gude but its aye the way wi women if they ever hand their tongues ava ye may swear its for mischief i wish i could set her on again without this bloodsucker kenning what i am doing but hes as gleg as mackeachans elshin that ran through sax plies of bendleather and halfaninch into the kings heel   elshin a shoemakers awl  he then began to hum but in a very low and suppressed tone the first stanza of a favourite ballad of wildfires the words of which bore some distant analogy with the situation of robertson trusting that the power of association would not fail to bring the rest to her mind                 theres a bloodhound ranging tinwald wood                       theres harness glancing sheen                 theres a maiden sits on tinwald brae                       and she sings loud between  madge had no sooner received the catchword than she vindicated ratcliffes sagacity by setting off at score with the song                  o sleep ye sound sir james she said                       when ye suld rise and ride                 theres twenty men wi bow and blade                       are seeking where ye hide  though ratcliffe was at a considerable distance from the spot called muschats cairn yet his eyes practised like those of a cat to penetrate darkness could mark that robertson had caught the alarm george poinder less keen of sight or less attentive was not aware of his flight any more than sharpitlaw and his assistants whose view though they were considerably nearer to the cairn was intercepted by the broken nature of the ground under which they were screening themselves at length however after the interval of five or six minutes they also perceived that robertson had fled and rushed hastily towards the place while sharpitlaw called out aloud in the harshest tones of a voice which resembled a sawmill at work chase ladschasehaud the braei see him on the edge of the hill then hollowing back to the rearguard of his detachment he issued his farther orders ratcliffe come here and detain the womangeorge run and kepp the stile at the dukes walkratcliffe come here directlybut first knock out that mad bitchs brains  ye had better rin for it madge said ratcliffe for its ill dealing wi an angry man  madge wildfire was not so absolutely void of common sense as not to understand this innuendo and while ratcliffe in seemingly anxious haste of obedience hastened to the spot where sharpitlaw waited to deliver up jeanie deans to his custody she fled with all the despatch she could exert in an opposite direction thus the whole party were separated and in rapid motion of flight or pursuit excepting ratcliffe and jeanie whom although making no attempt to escape he held fast by the cloak and who remained standing by muschats cairn     chapter seventeenth                  you have paid the heavens your function                and the prisoner the very debt of your calling                           measure for measure  jeanie deansfor here our story unites itself with that part of the narrative which broke off at the end of the fourteenth chapterwhile she waited in terror and amazement the hasty advance of three or four men towards her was yet more startled at their suddenly breaking asunder and giving chase in different directions to the late object of her terror who became at that moment though she could not well assign a reasonable cause rather the cause of her interest one of the party it was sharpitlaw came straight up to her and saying your name is jeanie deans and you are my prisoner immediately added but if you will tell me which way he ran i will let you go  i dinna ken sir was all the poor girl could utter and indeed it is the phrase which rises most readily to the lips of any person in her rank as the readiest reply to any embarrassing question  but said sharpitlaw ye ken wha it was ye were speaking wi my leddy on the hill side and midnight sae near ye surely ken that my bonny woman  i dinna ken sir again iterated jeanie who really did not comprehend in her terror the nature of the questions which were so hastily put to her in this moment of surprise  we will try to mend your memory by and by hinny said sharpitlaw and shouted as we have already told the reader to ratcliffe to come up and take charge of her while he himself directed the chase after robertson which he still hoped might be successful as ratcliffe approached sharpitlaw pushed the young woman towards him with some rudeness and betaking himself to the more important object of his quest began to scale crags and scramble up steep banks with an agility of which his profession and his general gravity of demeanour would previously have argued him incapable in a few minutes there was no one within sight and only a distant halloo from one of the pursuers to the other faintly heard on the side of the hill argued that there was any one within hearing jeanie deans was left in the clear moonlight standing under the guard of a person of whom she knew nothing and what was worse concerning whom as the reader is well aware she could have learned nothing that would not have increased her terror  when all in the distance was silent ratcliffe for the first time addressed her and it was in that cold sarcastic indifferent tone familiar to habitual depravity whose crimes are instigated by custom rather than by passion this is a braw night for ye dearie he said attempting to pass his arm across her shoulder to be on the green hill wi your jo jeanie extricated herself from his grasp but did not make any reply  i think lads and lasses continued the ruffian dinna meet at muschats cairn at midnight to crack nuts and he again attempted to take hold of her  if ye are an officer of justice sir said jeanie again eluding his attempt to seize her ye deserve to have your coat stripped from your back  very true hinny said he succeeding forcibly in his attempt to get hold of her but suppose i should strip your cloak off first  ye are more a man i am sure than to hurt me sir said jeanie for gods sake have pity on a halfdistracted creature  come come said ratcliffe youre a goodlooking wench and should not be crossgrained i was going to be an honest manbut the devil has this very day flung first a lawyer and then a woman in my gate ill tell you what jeanie they are out on the hillsideif youll be guided by me ill carry you to a wee bit corner in the pleasance that i ken o in an auld wifes that a the prokitors o scotland wot naething o and well send robertson word to meet us in yorkshire for there is a set o braw lads about the midland counties that i hae dune business wi before now and sae well leave mr sharpitlaw to whistle on his thumb  it was fortunate for jeanie in an emergency like the present that she possessed presence of mind and courage so soon as the first hurry of surprise had enabled her to rally her recollection she saw the risk she was in from a ruffian who not only was such by profession but had that evening been stupifying by means of strong liquors the internal aversion which he felt at the business on which sharpitlaw had resolved to employ him  dinna speak sae loud said she in a low voice hes up yonder  whorobertson said ratcliffe eagerly  ay replied jeanie up yonder and she pointed to the ruins of the hermitage and chapel  by gd then said ratcliffe ill make my ain of him either one way or otherwait for me here  but no sooner had he set off as fast as he could run towards the chapel than jeanie started in an opposite direction over high and low on the nearest path homeward her juvenile exercise as a herdswoman had put life and mettle in her heels and never had she followed dustiefoot when the cows were in the corn with half so much speed as she now cleared the distance betwixt muschats cairn and her fathers cottage at st leonards to lift the latchto enterto shut bolt and double bolt the doorto draw against it a heavy article of furniture which she could not have moved in a moment of less energy so as to make yet farther provision against violence was almost the work of a moment yet done with such silence as equalled the celerity  her next anxiety was upon her fathers account and she drew silently to the door of his apartment in order to satisfy herself whether he had been disturbed by her return he was awakeprobably had slept but little but the constant presence of his own sorrows the distance of his apartment from the outer door of the house and the precautions which jeanie had taken to conceal her departure and return had prevented him from being sensible of either he was engaged in his devotions and jeanie could distinctly hear him use these wordsand for the other child thou hast given me to be a comfort and stay to my old age may her days be long in the land according to the promise thou hast given to those who shall honour father and mother may all her purchased and promised blessings be multiplied upon her keep her in the watches of the night and in the uprising of the morning that all in this land may know that thou hast not utterly hid thy face from those that seek thee in truth and in sincerity he was silent but probably continued his petition in the strong fervency of mental devotion  his daughter retired to her apartment comforted that while she was exposed to danger her head had been covered by the prayers of the just as by an helmet and under the strong confidence that while she walked worthy of the protection of heaven she would experience its countenance it was in that moment that a vague idea first darted across her mind that something might yet be achieved for her sisters safety conscious as she now was of her innocence of the unnatural murder with which she stood charged it came as she described it on her mind like a sunblink on a stormy sea and although it instantly vanished yet she felt a degree of composure which she had not experienced for many days and could not help being strongly persuaded that by some means or other she would be called upon and directed to work out her sisters deliverance she went to bed not forgetting her usual devotions the more fervently made on account of her late deliverance and she slept soundly in spite of her agitation  we must return to ratcliffe who had started like a greyhound from the slips when the sportsman cries halloo as soon as jeanie had pointed to the ruins whether he meant to aid robertsons escape or to assist his pursuers may be very doubtful perhaps he did not himself know but had resolved to be guided by circumstances he had no opportunity however of doing either for he had no sooner surmounted the steep ascent and entered under the broken arches of the rains than a pistol was presented at his head and a harsh voice commanded him in the kings name to surrender himself prisoner mr sharpitlaw said ratcliffe surprised is this your honour  is it only you and be dd to you answered the fiscal still more disappointedwhat made you leave the woman  she told me she saw robertson go into the ruins so i made what haste i could to cleek the callant  its all over now said sharpitlaw we shall see no more of him tonight but he shall hide himself in a beanhool if he remains on scottish ground without my finding him call back the people ratcliffe  ratcliffe hollowed to the dispersed officers who willingly obeyed the signal for probably there was no individual among them who would have been much desirous of a rencontre hand to hand and at a distance from his comrades with such an active and desperate fellow as robertson  and where are the two women said sharpitlaw  both made their heels serve them i suspect replied ratcliffe and he hummed the end of the old song                   then hey play up the rinawa bride                        for she has taen the gee  one woman said sharpitlawfor like all rogues he was a great calumniator of the fair sexone woman is enough to dark the fairest ploy that was ever planned and how could i be such an ass as to expect to carry through a job that had two in it   note l calumniator of the fair sex  but we know how to come by them both if they are wanted thats one good thing  accordingly like a defeated general sad and sulky he led back his discomfited forces to the metropolis and dismissed them for the night  the next morning early he was under the necessity of making his report to the sitting magistrate of the day the gentleman who occupied the chair of office on this occasion for the bailies anglice aldermen take it by rotation chanced to be the same by whom butler was committed a person very generally respected among his fellowcitizens something he was of a humorist and rather deficient in general education but acute patient and upright possessed of a fortune acquired by honest industry which made him perfectly independent and in short very happily qualified to support the respectability of the office which he held  mr middleburgh had just taken his seat and was debating in an animated manner with one of his colleagues the doubtful chances of a game at golf which they had played the day before when a letter was delivered to him addressed for bailie middleburgh these to be forwarded with speed it contained these words  siri know you to be a sensible and a considerate magistrate and one who as such will be content to worship god though the devil bid you i therefore expect that notwithstanding the signature of this letter acknowledges my share in an action which in a proper time and place i would not fear either to avow or to justify you will not on that account reject what evidence i place before you the clergyman butler is innocent of all but involuntary presence at an action which he wanted spirit to approve of and from which he endeavoured with his best set phrases to dissuade us but it was not for him that it is my hint to speak there is a woman in your jail fallen under the edge of a law so cruel that it has hung by the wall like unsecured armour for twenty years and is now brought down and whetted to spill the blood of the most beautiful and most innocent creature whom the walls of a prison ever girdled in her sister knows of her innocence as she communicated to her that she was betrayed by a villaino that high heaven                  would put in every honest hand a whip                 to scourge me such a villain through the world  i write distractedlybut this girlthis jeanie deans is a peevish puritan superstitious and scrupulous after the manner of her sect and i pray your honour for so my phrase must go to press upon her that her sisters life depends upon her testimony but though she should remain silent do not dare to think that the young woman is guiltyfar less to permit her execution remember the death of wilson was fearfully avenged and those yet live who can compel you to drink the dregs of your poisoned chalicei say remember porteous and say that you had good counsel from                           one of his slayers  the magistrate read over this extraordinary letter twice or thrice at first he was tempted to throw it aside as the production of a madman so little did the scraps from playbooks as he termed the poetical quotation resemble the correspondence of a rational being on a reperusal however he thought that amid its incoherence he could discover something like a tone of awakened passion though expressed in a manner quaint and unusual  it is a cruelly severe statute said the magistrate to his assistant and i wish the girl could be taken from under the letter of it a child may have been born and it may have been conveyed away while the mother was insensible or it may have perished for want of that relief which the poor creature herselfhelpless terrified distracted despairing and exhaustedmay have been unable to afford to it and yet it is certain if the woman is found guilty under the statute execution will follow the crime has been too common and examples are necessary  but if this other wench said the cityclerk can speak to her sister communicating her situation it will take the case from under the statute  very true replied the bailie and i will walk out one of these days to st leonards and examine the girl myself i know something of their father deansan old trueblue cameronian who would see house and family go to wreck ere he would disgrace his testimony by a sinful complying with the defections of the times and such he will probably uphold the taking an oath before a civil magistrate if they are to go on and flourish with their bullheaded obstinacy the legislature must pass an act to take their affirmations as in the case of quakers but surely neither a father nor a sister will scruple in a case of this kind as i said before i will go speak with them myself when the hurry of this porteous investigation is somewhat over their pride and spirit of contradiction will be far less alarmed than if they were called into a court of justice at once  and i suppose butler is to remain incarcerated said the cityclerk  for the present certainly said the magistrate but i hope soon to set him at liberty upon bail  do you rest upon the testimony of that lightheaded letter asked the clerk  not very much answered the bailie and yet there is something striking about it tooit seems the letter of a man beside himself either from great agitation or some great sense of guilt  yes said the townclerk it is very like the letter of a mad strolling playactor who deserves to be hanged with all the rest of his gang as your honour justly observes  i was not quite so bloodthirsty continued the magistrate but to the point butlers private character is excellent and i am given to understand by some inquiries i have been making this morning that he did actually arrive in town only the day before yesterday so that it was impossible he could have been concerned in any previous machinations of these unhappy rioters and it is not likely that he should have joined them on a suddenty  theres no saying anent thatzeal catches fire at a slight spark as fast as a brunstane match observed the secretary i hae kend a minister wad be fair gudeday and fair gudeeen wi ilka man in the parochine and hing just as quiet as a rocket on a stick till ye mentioned the word abjurationoath or patronage or siclike and then whiz he was off and up in the air an hundred miles beyond common manners common sense and common comprehension  i do not understand answered the burghermagistrate that the young man butlers zeal is of so inflammable a character but i will make farther investigation what other business is there before us  and they proceeded to minute investigations concerning the affair of porteouss death and other affairs through which this history has no occasion to trace them  in the course of their business they were interrupted by an old woman of the lower rank extremely haggard in look and wretched in her appearance who thrust herself into the council room  what do you want gudewifewho are you said bailie middleburgh  what do i want replied she in a sulky tonei want my bairn or i want naething frae nane o ye for as grands ye are and she went on muttering to herself with the wayward spitefulness of agethey maun hae lordships and honours nae doubtset them up the gutterbloods and deil a gentleman amang themthen again addressing the sitting magistrate will your honour gie me back my puir crazy bairnhis honouri hae kend the day when less wad serd him the oe of a campvere skipper  good woman said the magistrate to this shrewish supplicanttell us what it is you want and do not interrupt the court  thats as muckle as till say bark bawtie and be dune witi tell ye raising her termagant voice i want my bairn is na that braid scots  who are youwho is your bairn demanded the magistrate  wha am iwha suld i be but meg murdockson and wha suld my bairn be but magdalen murdocksonyour guard soldiers and your constables and your officers ken us weel eneugh when they rive the bits o duds aff our backs and take what penny o siller we hae and harle us to the correctionhouse in leith wynd and pettle us up wi bread and water and siclike sunkets  who is she said the magistrate looking round to some of his people  other than a gude ane sir said one of the city officers shrugging his shoulders and smiling  will ye say sae said the termagant her eye gleaming with impotent fury an i had ye amang the figgatwhins wadna i set my ten talents in your wuzzent face for that very word and she suited the word to the action by spreading out a set of claws resembling those of st georges dragon on a country signpost   this was a name given to a tract of sand hillocks extending along the seashore from leith to portobello and which at this time were covered with whinbushes or furze  what does she want here said the impatient magistratecan she not tell her business or go away  its my bairnits magdalen murdockson im wantin answered the beldam screaming at the highest pitch of her cracked and mistuned voicehavena i been telling ye sae this halfhour and if ye are deaf what needs ye sit cockit up there and keep folk scraughin tye this gate  she wants her daughter sir said the same officer whose interference had given the hag such offence beforeher daughter who was taken up last nightmadge wildfire as they ca her  madge hellfire as they ca her echoed the beldam and what business has a blackguard like you to ca an honest womans bairn out o her ain name  an honest womans bairn maggie answered the peaceofficer smiling and shaking his head with an ironical emphasis on the adjective and a calmness calculated to provoke to madness the furious old shrew  if i am no honest now i was honest ance she replied and thats mair than ye can say ye born and bred thief that never kend ither folks gear frae your ain since the day ye was cleckit honest say yeye pykit your mothers pouch o twalpennies scots when ye were five years auld just as she was taking leave o your father at the fit o the gallows  she has you there george said the assistants and there was a general laugh for the wit was fitted for the meridian of the place where it was uttered this general applause somewhat gratified the passions of the old hag the grim feature smiled and even laughedbut it was a laugh of bitter scorn she condescended however as if appeased by the success of her sally to explain her business more distinctly when the magistrate commanding silence again desired her either to speak out her errand or to leave the place  her bairn she said was her bairn and she came to fetch her out of ill haft and waur guiding if she wasna sae wise as ither folk few ither folk had suffered as muckle as she had done forby that she could fend the waur for hersell within the four was of a jail she could prove by fifty witnesses and fifty to that that her daughter had never seen jock porteous alive or dead since he had gien her a laundering wi his cane the neger that he was for driving a dead cat at the provosts wig on the elector of hanovers birthday  notwithstanding the wretched appearance and violent demeanour of this woman the magistrate felt the justice of her argument that her child might be as dear to her as to a more fortunate and more amiable mother he proceeded to investigate the circumstances which had led to madge murdocksons or wildfires arrest and as it was clearly shown that she had not been engaged in the riot he contented himself with directing that an eye should be kept upon her by the police but that for the present she should be allowed to return home with her mother during the interval of fetching madge from the jail the magistrate endeavoured to discover whether her mother had been privy to the change of dress betwixt that young woman and robertson but on this point he could obtain no light she persisted in declaring that she had never seen robertson since his remarkable escape during servicetime and that if her daughter had changed clothes with him it must have been during her absence at a hamlet about two miles out of town called duddingstone where she could prove that she passed that eventful night and in fact one of the townofficers who had been searching for stolen linen at the cottage of a washerwoman in that village gave his evidence that he had seen maggie murdockson there whose presence had considerably increased his suspicion of the house in which she was a visitor in respect that he considered her as a person of no good reputation  i tauld ye sae said the hag see now what it is to hae a character gude or badnow maybe after a i could tell ye something about porteous that you councilchamber bodies never could find out for as muckle stir as ye mak  all eyes were turned towards herall ears were alert speak out said the magistrate  it will be for your ain gude insinuated the townclerk  dinna keep the bailie waiting urged the assistants  she remained doggedly silent for two or three minutes casting around a malignant and sulky glance that seemed to enjoy the anxious suspense with which they waited her answer and then she broke forth at oncea that i ken about him is that he was neither soldier nor gentleman but just a thief and a blackguard like maist o yoursells dearswhat will ye gie me for that news nowhe wad hae served the gude town lang or provost or bailie wad hae fund that out my jo  while these matters were in discussion madge wildfire entered and her first exclamation was eh see if there isna our auld neerdoweel deevilsbuckie o a mitherhegh sirs but we are a hopeful family to be twa o us in the guard at ancebut there were better days wi us ancewere there na mither  old maggies eyes had glistened with something like an expression of pleasure when she saw her daughter set at liberty but either her natural affection like that of the tigress could not be displayed without a strain of ferocity or there was something in the ideas which madges speech awakened that again stirred her cross and savage temper what signifies what we were ye streetraking limmer she exclaimed pushing her daughter before her to the door with no gentle degree of violence ise tell thee what thou is nowthous a crazed hellicat bess o bedlam that sall taste naething but bread and water for a fortnight to serve ye for the plague ye hae gien meand ower gude for ye ye idle taupie  madge however escaped from her mother at the door ran back to the foot of the table dropped a very low and fantastic courtesy to the judge and said with a giggling laughour minnies sair misset after her ordinar sirshell hae had some quarrel wi her auld gudemanthats satan ye ken sirs this explanatory note she gave in a low confidential tone and the spectators of that credulous generation did not hear it without an involuntary shudder the gudeman and her disna aye gree weel and then i maun pay the piper but my backs broad eneugh to beart aan if she hae nae havings thats nae reason why wiser folk shouldna hae some here another deep courtesy when the ungracious voice of her mother was heard  madge ye limmer if i come to fetch ye  hear till her said madge but ill wun out a gliff the night for a that to dance in the moonlight when her and the gudeman will be whirrying through the blue lift on a broomshank to see jean jap that they hae putten intill the kirkcaldy tolboothay they will hae a merry sail ower inchkeith and ower a the bits o bonny waves that are poppling and plashing against the rocks in the gowden glimmer o the moon ye kenim coming motherim coming she concluded on hearing a scuffle at the door betwixt the beldam and the officers who were endeavouring to prevent her reentrance madge then waved her hand wildly towards the ceiling and sung at the topmost pitch of her voice                                     up in the air                         on my bonny grey mare                         and i see and i see and i see her yet  and with a hop skip and jump sprung out of the room as the witches of macbeth used in less refined days to seem to fly upwards from the stage  some weeks intervened before mr middleburgh agreeably to his benevolent resolution found an opportunity of taking a walk towards st leonards in order to discover whether it might be possible to obtain the evidence hinted at in the anonymous letter respecting effie deans  in fact the anxious perquisitions made to discover the murderers of porteous occupied the attention of all concerned with the administration of justice  in the course of these inquiries two circumstances happened material to our story butler after a close investigation of his conduct was declared innocent of accession to the death of porteous but as having been present during the whole transaction was obliged to find bail not to quit his usual residence at liberton that he might appear as a witness when called upon the other incident regarded the disappearance of madge wildfire and her mother from edinburgh when they were sought with the purpose of subjecting them to some farther interrogatories it was discovered by mr sharpitlaw that they had eluded the observation of the police and left the city so soon as dismissed from the councilchamber no efforts could trace the place of their retreat  in the meanwhile the excessive indignation of the council of regency at the slight put upon their authority by the murder of porteous had dictated measures in which their own extreme desire of detecting the actors in that conspiracy were consulted in preference to the temper of the people and the character of their churchmen an act of parliament was hastily passed offering two hundred pounds reward to those who should inform against any person concerned in the deed and the penalty of death by a very unusual and severe enactment was denounced against those who should harbour the guilty but what was chiefly accounted exceptionable was a clause appointing the act to be read in churches by the officiating clergyman on the first sunday of every month for a certain period immediately before the sermon the ministers who should refuse to comply with this injunction were declared for the first offence incapable of sitting or voting in any church judicature and for the second incapable of holding any ecclesiastical preferment in scotland  this last order united in a common cause those who might privately rejoice in porteouss death though they dared not vindicate the manner of it with the more scrupulous presbyterians who held that even the pronouncing the name of the lords spiritual in a scottish pulpit was quodammodo an acknowledgment of prelacy and that the injunction of the legislature was an interference of the civil government with the jus divinum of presbytery since to the general assembly alone as representing the invisible head of the kirk belonged the sole and exclusive right of regulating whatever pertained to public worship very many also of different political or religious sentiments and therefore not much moved by these considerations thought they saw in so violent an act of parliament a more vindictive spirit than became the legislature of a great country and something like an attempt to trample upon the rights and independence of scotland the various steps adopted for punishing the city of edinburgh by taking away her charter and liberties for what a violent and overmastering mob had done within her walls were resented by many who thought a pretext was too hastily taken for degrading the ancient metropolis of scotland in short there was much heartburning discontent and disaffection occasioned by these illconsidered measures   the magistrates were closely interrogated before the house of peers concerning the particulars of the porteous mob and the patois in which these functionaries made their answers sounded strange in the ears of the  southern nobles the duke of newcastle having demanded to know with what kind of shot the guard which porteous commanded had loaded their muskets was answered naively ow just sic as ane shoots dukes and fools with this reply was considered as a contempt of the house of lords and the provost would have suffered accordingly but that the duke of argyle explained that the expression properly rendered into english meant ducks and waterfowls   amidst these heats and dissensions the trial of effie deans after she had been many weeks imprisoned was at length about to be brought forward and mr middleburgh found leisure to inquire into the evidence concerning her for this purpose he chose a fine day for his walk towards her fathers house  the excursion into the country was somewhat distant in the opinion of a burgess of those days although many of the present inhabit suburban villas considerably beyond the spot to which we allude threequarters of an hours walk however even at a pace of magisterial gravity conducted our benevolent officebearer to the crags of st leonards and the humble mansion of david deans  the old man was seated on the deas or turfseat at the end of his cottage busied in mending his cartharness with his own hands for in those days any sort of labour which required a little more skill than usual fell to the share of the goodman himself and that even when he was well to pass in the world with stern and austere gravity he persevered in his task after having just raised his head to notice the advance of the stranger it would have been impossible to have discovered from his countenance and manner the internal feelings of agony with which he contended mr middleburgh waited an instant expecting deans would in some measure acknowledge his presence and lead into conversation but as he seemed determined to remain silent he was himself obliged to speak first  my name is middleburghmr james middleburgh one of the present magistrates of the city of edinburgh  it may be sae answered deans laconically and without interrupting his labour  you must understand he continued that the duty of a magistrate is sometimes an unpleasant one  it may be sae replied david i hae naething to say in the contrair and he was again doggedly silent  you must be aware pursued the magistrate that persons in my situation are often obliged to make painful and disagreeable inquiries of individuals merely because it is their bounden duty  it may be sae again replied deans i hae naething to say anent it either the tae way or the tother but i do ken there was ance in a day a just and godfearing magistracy in yon town o edinburgh that did not bear the sword in vain but were a terror to evildoers and a praise to such as kept the path in the glorious days of auld worthy faithfu provost dick when there was a true and faithfu general assembly of   note m sir william dick of braid  the kirk walking hand in hand with the real noble scottishhearted barons and with the magistrates of this and other towns gentles burgesses and commons of all ranks seeing with one eye hearing with one ear and upholding the ark with their united strengthand then folk might see men deliver up their silver to the states use as if it had been as muckle sclate stanes my father saw them toom the sacks of dollars out o provost dicks window intill the carts that carried them to the army at dunse law and if ye winna believe his testimony there is the window itsell still standing in the luckenboothsi think its a claithmerchants booth the dayat the airn stanchells five doors abune gossfords close   i think so toobut if the reader be curious he may consult mr chamberss traditions of edinburgh  but now we haena sic spirit amang us we think mair about the warst wallydraigle in our ain byre than about the blessing which the angel of the covenant gave to the patriarch even at peniel and mahanaim or the binding obligation of our national vows and we wad rather gie a pund scots to buy an unguent to clear out auld rannelltrees and our beds o the english bugs as they ca them than we wad gie a plack to rid the land of the swarm of arminian caterpillars socinian pismires and deistical miss katies that have ascended out of the bottomless pit to plague this perverse insidious and lukewarm generation  it happened to davie deans on this occasion as it has done to many other habitual orators when once he became embarked on his favourite subject the stream of his own enthusiasm carried him forward in spite of his mental distress while his wellexercised memory supplied him amply with all the types and tropes of rhetoric peculiar to his sect and cause  mr middleburgh contented himself with answeringall this may be very true my friend but as you said just now i have nothing to say to it at present either one way or otheryou have two daughters i think mr deans  the old man winced as one whose smarting sore is suddenly galled but instantly composed himself resumed the work which in the heat of his declamation he had laid down and answered with sullen resolution ae daughter sironly ane  i understand you said mr middleburgh you have only one daughter here at home with youbut this unfortunate girl who is a prisonershe is i think your youngest daughter  the presbyterian sternly raised his eyes after the world and according to the flesh she is my daughter but when she became a child of belial and a companykeeper and a trader in guilt and iniquity she ceased to be a bairn of mine  alas mr deans said middleburgh sitting down by him and endeavouring to take his hand which the old man proudly withdrew we are ourselves all sinners and the errors of our offspring as they ought not to surprise us being the portion which they derive of a common portion of corruption inherited through us so they do not entitle us to cast them off because they have lost themselves  sir said deans impatiently i ken a that as weel asi mean to say he resumed checking the irritation he felt at being schooleda discipline of the mind which those most ready to bestow it on others do themselves most reluctantly submit to receivei mean to say that what ye o serve may be just and reasonablebut i hae nae freedom to enter into my ain private affairs wi strangersand now in this great national emergency when theres the porteous act has come doun frae london that is a deeper blow to this poor sinfu kingdom and suffering kirk than ony that has been heard of since the foul and fatal testat a time like this  but goodman interrupted mr middleburgh you must think of your own household first or else you are worse even than the infidels  i tell ye bailie middleburgh retorted david deans if ye be a bailie as there is little honour in being ane in these evil daysi tell ye i heard the gracious saunders pedeni wotna whan it was but it was in killing time when the plowers were drawing alang their furrows on the back of the kirk of scotlandi heard him tell his hearers gude and waled christians they were too that some o them wad greet mair for a bit drowned calf or stirk than for a the defections and oppressions of the day and that they were some o them thinking o ae thing some o anither and there was lady hundleslope thinking o greeting jock at the fireside and the lady confessed in my hearing that a drow of anxiety had come ower her for her son that she had left at hame weak of a decayand what wad he hae said of me if i had ceased to think of the gude cause for a castawayait kills me to think of what she is   see life of peden p 14  but the life of your child goodmanthink of thatif her life could be saved said middleburgh  her life exclaimed davidi wadna gie ane o my grey hairs for her life if her gude name be ganeand yet said he relenting and retracting as he spoke i wad make the niffer mr middleburghi wad gie a these grey hairs that she has brought to shame and sorrowi wad gie the auld head they grow on for her life and that she might hae time to amend and return for what hae the wicked beyond the breath of their nosthrilsbut ill never see her mairnothatthat i am determined inill never see her mair his lips continued to move for a minute after his voice ceased to be heard as if he were repeating the same vow internally  well sir said mr middleburgh i speak to you as a man of sense if you would save your daughters life you must use human means  i understand what you mean but mr novit who is the procurator and doer of an honourable person the laird of dumbiedikes is to do what carnal wisdom can do for her in the circumstances mysell am not clear to trinquet and traffic wi courts o justice as they are now constituted i have a tenderness and scruple in my mind anent them  that is to say said middleburgh that you are a cameronian and do not acknowledge the authority of our courts of judicature or present government  sir under your favour replied david who was too proud of his own polemical knowledge to call himself the follower of any one ye take me up before i fall down i canna see why i suld be termed a cameronian especially now that ye hae given the name of that famous and savoury sufferer not only until a regimental band of souldiers h m 26th foot whereof i am told many can now curse swear and use profane language as fast as ever richard cameron could preach or pray but also because ye have in as far as it is in your power rendered that martyrs name vain and contemptible by pipes drums and fifes playing the vain carnal spring called the cameronian rant which too many professors of religion dance toa practice maist unbecoming a professor to dance to any tune whatsoever more especially promiscuously that is with the female sex a brutish fashion it is whilk is the beginning of defection with many as i may hae as muckle cause as maist folk to testify   see note f peter walker  well but mr deans replied mr middleburgh i only meant to say that you were a cameronian or macmillanite one of the society people in short who think it inconsistent to take oaths under a government where the covenant is not ratified  sir replied the controversialist who forgot even his present distress in such discussions as these you cannot fickle me sae easily as you do opine i am not a macmillanite or a russelite or a hamiltonian or a harleyite or a howdenitei will be led by the nose by nonei take my name as a christian from no vessel of clay i have my own principles and practice to answer for and am an humble pleader for the gude auld cause in a legal way   all various species of the great genus cameronian  that is to say mr deans said middleburgh that you are a deanite and have opinions peculiar to yourself  it may please you to say sae said david deans but i have maintained my testimony before as great folk and in sharper times and though i will neither exalt myself nor pull down others i wish every man and woman in this land had kept the true testimony and the middle and straight path as it were on the ridge of a hill where wind and water shears avoiding righthand snares and extremes and lefthand wayslidings as weel as johnny dodds of farthings acre and ae man mair that shall be nameless  i suppose replied the magistrate that is as much as to say that johnny dodds of farthings acre and david deans of st leonards constitute the only members of the true real unsophisticated kirk of scotland  god forbid that i suld make sic a vainglorious speech when there are sae mony professing christians answered david but this i maun say that all men act according to their gifts and their grace sae that it is nae marvel that  this is all very fine interrupted mr middleburgh but i have no time to spend in hearing it the matter in hand is thisi have directed a citation to be lodged in your daughters handsif she appears on the day of trial and gives evidence there is reason to hope she may save her sisters lifeif from any constrained scruples about the legality of her performing the office of an affectionate sister and a good subject by appearing in a court held under the authority of the law and government you become the means of deterring her from the discharge of this duty i must say though the truth may sound harsh in your ears that you who gave life to this unhappy girl will become the means of her losing it by a premature and violent death  so saying mr middleburgh turned to leave him  bide aweebide awee mr middleburgh said deans in great perplexity and distress of mind but the bailie who was probably sensible that protracted discussion might diminish the effect of his best and most forcible argument took a hasty leave and declined entering farther into the controversy  deans sunk down upon his seat stunned with a variety of conflicting emotions it had been a great source of controversy among those holding his opinions in religious matters how far the government which succeeded the revolution could be without sin acknowledged by true presbyterians seeing that it did not recognise the great national testimony of the solemn league and covenant and latterly those agreeing in this general doctrine and assuming the sounding title of the antipopish antiprelatic antierastian antisectarian true presbyterian remnant were divided into many petty sects among themselves even as to the extent of submission to the existing laws and rulers which constituted such an acknowledgment as amounted to sin  at a very stormy and tumultuous meeting held in 1682 to discuss these important and delicate points the testimonies of the faithful few were found utterly inconsistent with each other   this remarkable convocation took place upon 15th june 1682 and an account of its confused and divisive proceedings may be found in michael shields faithful contendings displayed first printed at glasgow 1780  p 21 it affords a singular and melancholy example how much a metaphysical  and polemical spirit had crept in amongst these unhappy sufferers since amid so many real injuries which they had to sustain they were disposed to add disagreement and disunion concerning the character and extent of such as were only imaginary  the place where this conference took place was remarkably well adapted for such an assembly it was a wild and very sequestered dell in tweeddale surrounded by high hills and far remote from human habitation a small river or rather a mountain torrent called the talla breaks down the glen with great fury dashing successively over a number of small cascades which has procured the spot the name of talla linns here the leaders among the scattered adherents to the covenant men who in their banishment from human society and in the recollection of the seventies to which they had been exposed had become at once sullen in their tempers and fantastic in their religious opinions met with arms in their hands and by the side of the torrent discussed with a turbulence which the noise of the stream could not drown points of controversy as empty and unsubstantial as its foam  it was the fixed judgment of most of the meeting that all payment of cess or tribute to the existing government was utterly unlawful and a sacrificing to idols about other impositions and degrees of submission there were various opinions and perhaps it is the best illustration of the spirit of those military fathers of the church to say that while all allowed it was impious to pay the cess employed for maintaining the standing army and militia there was a fierce controversy on the lawfulness of paying the duties levied at ports and bridges for maintaining roads and other necessary purposes that there were some who repugnant to these imposts for turnpikes and pontages were nevertheless free in conscience to make payment of the usual freight at public ferries and that a person of exceeding and punctilious zeal james russel one of the slayers of the archbishop of st andrews had given his testimony with great warmth even against this last faint shade of subjection to constituted authority this ardent and enlightened person and his followers had also great scruples about the lawfulness of bestowing the ordinary names upon the days of the week and the months of the year which savoured in their nostrils so strongly of paganism that at length they arrived at the conclusion that they who owned such names as monday tuesday january february and so forth served themselves heirs to the same if not greater punishment than had been denounced against the idolaters of old  david deans had been present on this memorable occasion although too young to be a speaker among the polemical combatants his brain however had been thoroughly heated by the noise clamour and metaphysical ingenuity of the discussion and it was a controversy to which his mind had often returned and though he carefully disguised his vacillation from others and perhaps from himself he had never been able to come to any precise line of decision on the subject in fact his natural sense had acted as a counterpoise to his controversial zeal he was by no means pleased with the quiet and indifferent manner in which king williams government slurred over the errors of the times when far from restoring the presbyterian kirk to its former supremacy they passed an act of oblivion even to those who had been its persecutors and bestowed on many of them titles favours and employments when in the first general assembly which succeeded the revolution an overture was made for the revival of the league and covenant it was with horror that douce david heard the proposal eluded by the men of carnal wit and policy as he called them as being inapplicable to the present times and not falling under the modern model of the church the reign of queen anne had increased his conviction that the revolution government was not one of the true presbyterian complexion but then more sensible than the bigots of his sect he did not confound the moderation and tolerance of these two reigns with the active tyranny and oppression exercised in those of charles ii and james ii the presbyterian form of religion though deprived of the weight formerly attached to its sentences of excommunication and compelled to tolerate the coexistence of episcopacy and of sects of various descriptions was still the national church and though the glory of the second temple was far inferior to that which had flourished from 1639 till the battle of dunbar still it was a structure that wanting the strength and the terrors retained at least the form and symmetry of the original model then came the insurrection in 1715 and david deanss horror for the revival of the popish and prelatical faction reconciled him greatly to the government of king george although he grieved that that monarch might be suspected of a leaning unto erastianism in short moved by so many different considerations he had shifted his ground at different times concerning the degree of freedom which he felt in adopting any act of immediate acknowledgment or submission to the present government which however mild and paternal was still uncovenanted and now he felt himself called upon by the most powerful motive conceivable to authorise his daughters giving testimony in a court of justice which all who have been since called cameronians accounted a step of lamentable and direct defection the voice of nature however exclaimed loud in his bosom against the dictates of fanaticism and his imagination fertile in the solution of polemical difficulties devised an expedient for extricating himself from the fearful dilemma in which he saw on the one side a falling off from principle and on the other a scene from which a fathers thoughts could not but turn in shuddering horror  i have been constant and unchanged in my testimony said david deans but then who has said it of me that i have judged my neighbour over closely because he hath had more freedom in his walk than i have found in mine i never was a separatist nor for quarrelling with tender souls about mint cummin or other the lesser tithes my daughter jean may have a light in this subject that is hid frae my auld eenit is laid on her conscience and not on mineif she hath freedom to gang before this judicatory and hold up her hand for this poor castaway surely i will not say she steppeth over her bounds and if nothe paused in his mental argument while a pang of unutterable anguish convulsed his features yet shaking it off he firmly resumed the strain of his reasoningand if notgod forbid that she should go into defection at bidding of mine i wunna fret the tender conscience of one bairnno not to save the life of the other  a roman would have devoted his daughter to death from different feelings and motives but not upon a more heroic principle of duty     chapter eighteenth                      to man in this his trial state                         the privilege is given                    when tost by tides of human fate                         to anchor fast on heaven                                         wattss hymns  it was with a firm step that deans sought his daughters apartment determined to leave her to the light of her own conscience in the dubious point of casuistry in which he supposed her to be placed  the little room had been the sleeping apartment of both sisters and there still stood there a small occasional bed which had been made for effies accommodation when complaining of illness she had declined to share as in happier times her sisters pillow the eyes of deans rested involuntarily on entering the room upon this little couch with its darkgreen coarse curtains and the ideas connected with it rose so thick upon his soul as almost to incapacitate him from opening his errand to his daughter her occupation broke the ice he found her gazing on a slip of paper which contained a citation to her to appear as a witness upon her sisters trial in behalf of the accused for the worthy magistrate determined to omit no chance of doing effie justice and to leave her sister no apology for not giving the evidence which she was supposed to possess had caused the ordinary citation or subpoena of the scottish criminal court to be served upon her by an officer during his conference with david  this precaution was so far favourable to deans that it saved him the pain of entering upon a formal explanation with his daughter he only said with a hollow and tremulous voice i perceive ye are aware of the matter  o father we are cruelly sted between gods laws and mans lawswhat shall we dowhat can we do  jeanie it must be observed had no hesitation whatever about the mere act of appearing in a court of justice she might have heard the point discussed by her father more than once but we have already noticed that she was accustomed to listen with reverence to much which she was incapable of understanding and that subtle arguments of casuistry found her a patient but unedified hearer upon receiving the citation therefore her thoughts did not turn upon the chimerical scruples which alarmed her fathers mind but to the language which had been held to her by the stranger at muschats cairn in a word she never doubted but she was to be dragged forward into the court of justice in order to place her in the cruel position of either sacrificing her sister by telling the truth or committing perjury in order to save her life and so strongly did her thoughts run in this channel that she applied her fathers words ye are aware of the matter to his acquaintance with the advice that had been so fearfully enforced upon her she looked up with anxious surprise not unmingled with a cast of horror which his next words as she interpreted and applied them were not qualified to remove  daughter said david it has ever been my mind that in things of ane doubtful and controversial nature ilk christians conscience suld be his ain guidewherefore descend into yourself try your ain mind with sufficiency of soul exercise and as you sall finally find yourself clear to do in this mattereven so be it  but father said jeanie whose mind revolted at the construction which she naturally put upon his language can thisthis be a doubtful or controversial mattermind father the ninth commandthou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour  david deans paused for still applying her speech to his preconceived difficulties it seemed to him as if she a woman and a sister was scarce entitled to be scrupulous upon this occasion where he a man exercised in the testimonies of that testifying period had given indirect countenance to her following what must have been the natural dictates of her own feelings but he kept firm his purpose until his eyes involuntarily rested upon the little settlebed and recalled the form of the child of his old age as she sate upon it pale emaciated and brokenhearted his mind as the picture arose before him involuntarily conceived and his tongue involuntarily utteredbut in a tone how different from his usual dogmatical precisionarguments for the course of conduct likely to ensure his childs safety  daughter he said i did not say that your path was free from stumblingand questionless this act may be in the opinion of some a transgression since he who beareth witness unlawfully and against his conscience doth in some sort bear false witness against his neighbour yet in matters of compliance the guilt lieth not in the compliance sae muckle as in the mind and conscience of him that doth comply and therefore although my testimony hath not been spared upon public defections i haena felt freedom to separate mysell from the communion of many who have been clear to hear those ministers who have taken the fatal indulgence because they might get good of them though i could not  when david had proceeded thus far his conscience reproved him that he might be indirectly undermining the purity of his daughters faith and smoothing the way for her falling off from strictness of principle he therefore suddenly stopped and changed his tonejeanie i perceive that our vile affectionsso i call them in respect of doing the will of our fathercling too heavily to me in this hour of trying sorrow to permit me to keep sight of my ain duty or to airt you to yours i will speak nae mair anent this overtrying matterjeanie if ye can wi god and gude conscience speak in favour of this puir unhappyhere his voice falteredshe is your sister in the fleshworthless and castaway as she is she is the daughter of a saint in heaven that was a mother to you jeanie in place of your ainbut if ye arena free in conscience to speak for her in the court of judicature follow your conscience jeanie and let gods will be done after this adjuration he left the apartment and his daughter remained in a state of great distress and perplexity  it would have been no small addition to the sorrows of david deans even in this extremity of suffering had he known that his daughter was applying the casuistical arguments which he had been using not in the sense of a permission to follow her own opinion on a dubious and disputed point of controversy but rather as an encouragement to transgress one of those divine commandments which christians of all sects and denominations unite in holding most sacred  can this be said jeanie as the door closed on her fathercan these be his words that i have heard or has the enemy taken his voice and features to give weight unto the counsel which causeth to perisha sisters life and a father pointing out how to save ito god deliver methis is a fearfu temptation  roaming from thought to thought she at one time imagined her father understood the ninth commandment literally as prohibiting false witness against our neighbour without extending the denunciation against falsehood uttered in favour of the criminal but her clear and unsophisticated power of discriminating between good and evil instantly rejected an interpretation so limited and so unworthy of the author of the law she remained in a state of the most agitating terror and uncertaintyafraid to communicate her thoughts freely to her father lest she should draw forth an opinion with which she could not complywrung with distress on her sisters account rendered the more acute by reflecting that the means of saving her were in her power but were such as her conscience prohibited her from usingtossed in short like a vessel in an open roadstead during a storm and like that vessel resting on one only sure cable and anchorfaith in providence and a resolution to discharge her duty  butlers affection and strong sense of religion would have been her principal support in these distressing circumstances but he was still under restraint which did not permit him to come to st leonards crags and her distresses were of a nature which with her indifferent habits of scholarship she found it impossible to express in writing she was therefore compelled to trust for guidance to her own unassisted sense of what was right or wrong it was not the least of jeanies distresses that although she hoped and believed her sister to be innocent she had not the means of receiving that assurance from her own mouth  the doubledealing of ratcliffe in the matter of robertson had not prevented his being rewarded as doubledealers frequently have been with favour and preferment sharpitlaw who found in him something of a kindred genius had been intercessor in his behalf with the magistrates and the circumstance of his having voluntarily remained in the prison when the doors were forced by the mob would have made it a hard measure to take the life which he had such easy means of saving he received a full pardon and soon afterwards james ratcliffe the greatest thief and housebreaker in scotland was upon the faith perhaps of an ancient proverb selected as a person to be entrusted with the custody of other delinquents  when ratcliffe was thus placed in a confidential situation he was repeatedly applied to by the sapient saddletree and others who took some interest in the deans family to procure an interview between the sisters but the magistrates who were extremely anxious for the apprehension of robertson had given strict orders to the contrary hoping that by keeping them separate they might from the one or the other extract some information respecting that fugitive on this subject jeanie had nothing to tell them she informed mr middleburgh that she knew nothing of robertson except having met him that night by appointment to give her some advice respecting her sisters concern the purport of which she said was betwixt god and her conscience of his motions purposes or plans past present or future she knew nothing and so had nothing to communicate  effie was equally silent though from a different cause it was in vain that they offered a commutation and alleviation of her punishment and even a free pardon if she would confess what she knew of her lover she answered only with tears unless when at times driven into pettish sulkiness by the persecution of the interrogators she made them abrupt and disrespectful answers  at length after her trial had been delayed for many weeks in hopes she might be induced to speak out on a subject infinitely more interesting to the magistracy than her own guilt or innocence their patience was worn out and even mr middleburgh finding no ear lent to farther intercession in her behalf the day was fixed for the trial to proceed  it was now and not sooner that sharpitlaw recollecting his promise to effie deans or rather being dinned into compliance by the unceasing remonstrances of mrs saddletree who was his nextdoor neighbour and who declared it was heathen cruelty to keep the twa brokenhearted creatures separate issued the important mandate permitting them to see each other  on the evening which preceded the eventful day of trial jeanie was permitted to see her sisteran awful interview and occurring at a most distressing crisis this however formed a part of the bitter cup which she was doomed to drink to atone for crimes and follies to which she had no accession and at twelve oclock noon being the time appointed for admission to the jail she went to meet for the first time for several months her guilty erring and most miserable sister in that abode of guilt error and utter misery     chapter nineteenth                         sweet sister let me live                 what sin you do to save a brothers life                 nature dispenses with the deed so far                            that it becomes a virtue                                         measure for measure  jeanie deans was admitted into the jail by ratcliffe this fellow as void of shame as of honesty as he opened the now trebly secured door asked her with a leer which made her shudder whether she remembered him  a halfpronounced and timid no was her answer  what not remember moonlight and muschats cairn and rob and rat said he with the same sneeryour memory needs redding up my jo  if jeanies distresses had admitted of aggravation it must have been to find her sister under the charge of such a profligate as this man he was not indeed without something of good to balance so much that was evil in his character and habits in his misdemeanours he had never been bloodthirsty or cruel and in his present occupation he had shown himself in a certain degree accessible to touches of humanity but these good qualities were unknown to jeanie who remembering the scene at muschats cairn could scarce find voice to acquaint him that she had an order from bailie middleburgh permitting her to see her sister  i ken that fa weel my bonny doo mair by token i have a special charge to stay in the ward with you a the time ye are thegither  must that be sae asked jeanie with an imploring voice  hout ay hinny replied the turnkey and what the waur will you and your tittie be of jim ratcliffe hearing what ye hae to say to ilk otherdeil a word yell say that will gar him ken your kittle sex better than he kens them already and another thing is that if ye dinna speak o breaking the tolbooth deil a word will i tell ower either to do ye good or ill  thus saying ratcliffe marshalled her the way to the apartment where effie was confined  shame fear and grief had contended for mastery in the poor prisoners bosom during the whole morning while she had looked forward to this meeting but when the door opened all gave way to a confused and strange feeling that had a tinge of joy in it as throwing herself on her sisters neck she ejaculated my dear jeaniemy dear jeanie its lang since i hae seen ye jeanie returned the embrace with an earnestness that partook almost of rapture but it was only a flitting emotion like a sunbeam unexpectedly penetrating betwixt the clouds of a tempest and obscured almost as soon as visible the sisters walked together to the side of the pallet bed and sate down side by side took hold of each others hands and looked each other in the face but without speaking a word in this posture they remained for a minute while the gleam of joy gradually faded from their features and gave way to the most intense expression first of melancholy and then of agony till throwing themselves again into each others arms they to use the language of scripture lifted up their voices and wept bitterly  even the hardhearted turnkey who had spent his life in scenes calculated to stifle both conscience and feeling could not witness this scene without a touch of human sympathy it was shown in a trifling action but which had more delicacy in it than seemed to belong to ratcliffes character and station the unglazed window of the miserable chamber was open and the beams of a bright sun fell right upon the bed where the sufferers were seated with a gentleness that had something of reverence in it ratcliffe partly closed the shutter and seemed thus to throw a veil over a scene so sorrowful  ye are ill effie were the first words jeanie could utter ye are very ill  o what wad i gie to be ten times waur jeanie was the replywhat wad i gie to be cauld dead

tallow dn them  to this homely strain of consolation the mourners returned no answer indeed they were so much lost in their own sorrows as to have become insensible of ratcliffes presence o effie said her elder sister how could you conceal your situation from me o woman had i deserved this at your handhad ye spoke but ae wordsorry we might hae been and shamed we might hae been but this awfu

what a different character the feelings with which she regarded her seducer bore compared with the christian charity under which she attempted to veil it  and ye hae suffered a this for him and ye can

the wild and vague hope which had suddenly gleamed upon her the unhappy prisoner let go her hold of his coat and fell with her face on the pavement of the apartment in a strong convulsion fit  jeanie deans possessed with her excellently clear understanding the concomitant advantage of promptitude of spirit even in the extremity of distress  she did not suffer herself to be overcome by her own feelings of exquisite sorrow but instantly applied herself to her sisters relief with the readiest remedies which circumstances afforded and which to do ratcliffe justice he showed himself anxious to suggest and alert in procuring he had even the delicacy to withdraw to the farthest corner of the room so as to render his official attendance upon them as little intrusive as possible when effie was composed enough again to resume her conference with her sister  the prisoner once more in the most earnest and broken tones conjured jeanie to tell her the particulars of the conference with robertson and jeanie felt it was impossible to refuse her this gratification  do ye mind she said effie when ye were in the fever before we left woodend and how angry your mother thats now in a better place was wi me for gieing ye milk and water to drink because ye grat for it ye were a bairn then and ye are a woman now and should ken better than ask what canna but hurt youbut come weal or woe i canna refuse

but kend how muckle good it does me but to ken onything o him thats like goodness or kindness ye wadna wonder that i wish to hear o him  jeanie sighed and commenced her narrative of all that had passed betwixt robertson and her making it as brief as possible effie listened in breathless anxiety holding her sisters hand in hers and keeping her eye fixed upon her face as if devouring every word she uttered the interjections of poor fellowpoor george which escaped in whispers and betwixt sighs were the only sounds with which she interrupted the story when it was finished she made a long pause  and this was his advice were the first words she uttered  just sic as i hae telld ye replied her sister  and he wanted you to say something to yon folks that wad save my young life  he wanted

as i used to hae in the fever but instead of the fiery een and wolves and widow butlers bullseg that i used to see spieling upon my bed i am thinking now about a high black gibbet and me standing up and such seas of faces all looking up at poor effie deans and asking if it be her that george robertson used to call the lily of st leonards and then they stretch out their faces and make mouths and girn at me and whichever way i look i see a face laughing like meg murdockson when she tauld me i had seen the last of my wean god preserve us jeanie that carline has a fearsome face  she clapped her hands before her eyes as she uttered this exclamation as if to secure herself against seeing the fearful object she had alluded to  jeanie deans remained with her sister for two hours during which she endeavoured if possible to extract something from her that might be serviceable in her exculpation but she had nothing to say beyond what she had declared on her first examination with the purport of which the reader will be made acquainted in proper time and place they wadna believe her she said and she had naething mair to tell them  at length ratcliffe though reluctantly informed the sisters that there was a necessity that they should part mr novit he said was to see the prisoner and maybe mr langtale too langtale likes to look at a bonny lass whether in prison or out o prison  reluctantly therefore and slowly after many a tear and many an embrace jeanie retired from the apartment and heard its jarring bolts turned upon the dear being from whom she was separated somewhat familiarised now even with her rude conductor she offered him a small present in money with a request he would do what he could for her sisters accommodation to her surprise ratcliffe declined the fee i wasna bloody when i was on the pad he said and i winna be greedythat is beyond whats right and reasonablenow that i am in the lockkeep the siller and for civility your sister sall hae sic as i can

after spending the greater part of the morning in his devotions for his benevolent neighbours had kindly insisted upon discharging his task of ordinary labour david deans entered the apartment when the breakfast meal was prepared his eyes were involuntarily cast down for he was afraid to look at jeanie uncertain as he was whether she might feel herself at liberty with a good conscience to attend the court of justiciary that day to give the evidence which he understood that she possessed in order to her sisters exculpation at length after a minute of apprehensive hesitation he looked at her dress to discover whether it seemed to be in her contemplation to go abroad that morning her apparel was neat and plain but such as conveyed no exact intimation of her intentions to go abroad she had exchanged her usual garb for morning labour for one something inferior to that with which as her best she was wont to dress herself for church or any more rare occasion of going into society her sense taught her that it was respectful to be decent in her apparel on such an occasion while her feelings induced her to lay aside the use of the very few and simple personal ornaments which on other occasions she permitted herself to wear so that there occurred nothing in her external appearance which could mark out to her father with anything like certainty her intentions on this occasion  the preparations for their humble meal were that morning made in vain the father and daughter sat each assuming the appearance of eating when the others eyes were turned to them and desisting from the effort with disgust when the affectionate imposture seemed no longer necessary  at length these moments of constraint were removed the sound of st giless heavy toll announced the hour previous to the commencement of the trial jeanie arose and with a degree of composure for which she herself could not account assumed her plaid and made her other preparations for a distant walking it was a strange contrast between the firmness of her demeanour and the vacillation and cruel uncertainty of purpose indicated in all her fathers motions and one unacquainted with both could scarcely have supposed that the former was in her ordinary habits of life a docile quiet gentle and even timid country maiden while her father with a mind naturally proud and strong and supported by religious opinions of a stern stoical and unyielding character had in his time undergone and withstood the most severe hardships and the most imminent peril without depression of spirit or subjugation of his constancy the secret of this difference was that jeanies mind had already anticipated the line of conduct which she must adopt with all its natural and necessary consequences while her father ignorant of every other circumstance tormented himself with imagining what the one sister might say or swear or what effect her testimony might have upon the awful event of the trial  he watched his daughter with a faltering and indecisive look until she looked back upon him with a look of unutterable anguish as she was about to leave the apartment  my dear lassie said he i will his action hastily and confusedly searching for his worsted mittans and staff showed his purpose of accompanying her though his tongue failed distinctly to announce it   a kind of worsted gloves used by the lower orders  father said jeanie replying rather to his action than his words ye had better not  in the strength of my god answered deans assuming firmness i will go forth  and taking his daughters arm under his he began to walk from the door with a step so hasty that she was almost unable to keep up with him a trifling circumstance but which marked the perturbed state of his mind checked his course  your bonnet father said jeanie who observed he had come out with his grey hairs uncovered he turned back with a slight blush on his cheek being ashamed to have been detected in an omission which indicated so much mental confusion assumed his large blue scottish bonnet and with a step slower but more composed as if the circumstance had obliged him to summon up his resolution and collect his scattered ideas again placed his daughters arm under his and resumed the way to edinburgh  the courts of justice were then and are still held in what is called the parliament close or according to modern phrase parliament square and occupied the buildings intended for the accommodation of the scottish estates this edifice though in an imperfect and corrupted style of architecture had then a grave decent and as it were a judicial aspect which was at least entitled to respect from its antiquity for which venerable front i observed on my last occasional visit to the metropolis that modern taste had substituted at great apparent expense a pile so utterly inconsistent with every monument of antiquity around and in itself so clumsy at the same time and fantastic that it may be likened to the decorations of tom errand the porter in the trip to the jubilee when he appears bedizened with the tawdry finery of beau clincher sed transeat cum caeteris erroribus  the small quadrangle or close if we may presume still to give it that appropriate though antiquated title which at lichfield salisbury and elsewhere is properly applied to designate the enclosure adjacent to a cathedral already evinced tokens of the fatal scene which was that day to be acted the soldiers of the city guard were on their posts now enduring and now rudely repelling with the butts of their muskets the motley crew who thrust each other forward to catch a glance at the unfortunate object of trial as she should pass from the adjacent prison to the court in which her fate was to be determined all must have occasionally observed with disgust the apathy with which the vulgar gaze on scenes of this nature and how seldom unless when their sympathies are called forth by some striking and extraordinary circumstance the crowd evince any interest deeper than that of callous unthinking bustle and brutal curiosity they laugh jest quarrel and push each other to and fro with the same unfeeling indifference as if they were assembled for some holiday sport or to see an idle procession occasionally however this demeanour so natural to the degraded populace of a large town is exchanged for a temporary touch of human affections and so it chanced on the present occasion  when deans and his daughter presented themselves in the close and endeavoured to make their way forward to the door of the courthouse they became involved in the mob and subject of course to their insolence as deans repelled with some force the rude pushes which he received on all sides his figure and antiquated dress caught the attention of the rabble who often show an intuitive sharpness in ascribing the proper character from external appearance                          yere welcome whigs                          frae bothwell briggs  sung one fellow for the mob of edinburgh were at that time jacobitically disposed probably because that was the line of sentiment most diametrically opposite to existing authority                          mess david williamson                            chosen of twenty                        ran up the pupit stair                            and sang killiecrankie  chanted a siren whose profession might be guessed by her appearance a tattered caidie or errandporter whom david deans had jostled in his attempt to extricate himself from the vicinity of these scorners exclaimed in a strong northcountry tone ta deil ding out her cameronian eenwhat gies her titles to dunch gentlemans about  make room for the ruling elder said yet another he comes to see a precious sister glorify god in the grassmarket  whisht shames in ye sirs said the voice of a man very loudly which as quickly sinking said in a low but distinct tone its her father and sister  all fell back to make way for the sufferers and all even the very rudest and most profligate were struck with shame and silence in the space thus abandoned to them by the mob deans stood holding his daughter by the hand and said to her with a countenance strongly and sternly expressive of his internal emotion ye hear with your ears and ye see with your eyes where and to whom the backslidings and defections of professors are ascribed by the scoffers not to themselves alone but to the kirk of which they are members and to its blessed and invisible head then weel may we take wi patience our share and portion of this outspreading reproach  the man who had spoken no other than our old friend dumbiedikes whose mouth like that of the prophets ass had been opened by the emergency of the case now joined them and with his usual taciturnity escorted them into the courthouse no opposition was offered to their entrance either by the guards or doorkeepers and it is even said that one of the latter refused a shilling of civilitymoney tendered him by the laird of dumbiedikes who was of opinion that siller wad make a easy but this last incident wants confirmation  admitted within the precincts of the courthouse they found the usual number of busy officebearers and idle loiterers who attend on these scenes by choice or from duty burghers gaped and stared young lawyers sauntered sneered and laughed as in the pit of the theatre while others apart sat on a bench retired and reasoned highly inter apices juris on the doctrines of constructive crime and the true import of the statute the bench was prepared for the arrival of the judges the jurors were in attendance the crowncounsel employed in looking over their briefs and notes of evidence looked grave and whispered with each other they occupied one side of a large table placed beneath the bench on the other sat the advocates whom the humanity of the scottish law in this particular more liberal than that of the sistercountry not only permits but enjoins to appear and assist with their advice and skill all persons under trial mr nichil novit was seen actively instructing the counsel for the panel so the prisoner is called in scottish lawphraseology busy bustling and important when they entered the courtroom deans asked the laird in a tremulous whisper where will she sit  dumbiedikes whispered novit who pointed to a vacant space at the bar fronting the judges and was about to conduct deans towards it  no he said i cannot sit by heri cannot own hernot as yet at leasti will keep out of her sight and turn mine own eyes elsewherebetter for us baith  saddletree whose repeated interference with the counsel had procured him one or two rebuffs and a special request that he would concern himself with his own matters now saw with pleasure an opportunity of playing the person of importance he bustled up to the poor old man and proceeded to exhibit his consequence by securing through his interest with the barkeepers and macers a seat for deans in a situation where he was hidden from the general eye by the projecting corner of the bench  its gude to have a friend at court he said continuing his heartless harangues to the passive auditor who neither heard nor replied to them few folk but mysell could hae sorted ye out a seat like thisthe lords will be here incontinent and proceed instanter to trial they wunna fence the court

at largemr novit suldna jeanie deans be enclosed  novit answered in the affirmative and offered to conduct jeanie to the apartment where according to the scrupulous practice of the scottish court the witnesses remain in readiness to be called into court to give evidence and separated at the same time from all who might influence their testimony or give them information concerning that which was passing upon the trial  is this necessary said jeanie still reluctant to quit her fathers hand  a matter of absolute needcessity said saddletree wha ever heard of witnesses no being enclosed  it is really a matter of necessity said the younger counsellor retained for her sister and jeanie reluctantly followed the macer of the court to the place appointed  this mr deans said saddletree is cad sequestering a witness but its clean different whilk maybe ye wadna fund out o yoursell frae sequestering anes estate or effects as in cases of bankruptcy i hae aften been sequestered as a witness for the sheriff is in the use whiles to cry me in to witness the declarations at precognitions and so is mr sharpitlaw but i was neer like to be sequestered o land and gudes but ance and that was lang syne afore i was married but whisht whisht heres the court coming  as he spoke the five lords of justiciary in their long robes of scarlet faced with white and preceded by their macebearer entered with the usual formalities and took their places upon the bench of judgment  the audience rose to receive them and the bustle occasioned by their entrance was hardly composed when a great noise and confusion of persons struggling and forcibly endeavouring to enter at the doors of the courtroom and of the galleries announced that the prisoner was about to be placed at the bar this tumult takes place when the doors at first only opened to those either having right to be present or to the better and more qualified ranks are at length laid open to all whose curiosity induces them to be present on the occasion with inflamed countenances and dishevelled dresses struggling with and sometimes tumbling over each other in rushed the rude multitude while a few soldiers forming as it were the centre of the tide could scarce with all their efforts clear a passage for the prisoner to the place which she was to occupy by the authority of the court and the exertions of its officers the tumult among the spectators was at length appeased and the unhappy girl brought forward and placed betwixt two sentinels with drawn bayonets as a prisoner at the bar where she was to abide her deliverance for good or evil according to the issue of her trial     chapter twentyfirst               we have strict statutes and most biting laws             the needful bits and curbs for headstrong steeds             which for these fourteen years we have let sleep                  like to an oergrown lion in a cave                       that goes not out to prey                                         measure for measure  euphemia deans said the presiding judge in an accent in which pity was blended with dignity stand up and listen to the criminal indictment now to be preferred against you  the unhappy girl who had been stupified by the confusion through which the guards had forced a passage cast a bewildered look on the multitude of faces around her which seemed to tapestry as it were the walls in one broad slope from the ceiling to the floor with human countenances and instinctively obeyed a command which rung in her ears like the trumpet of the judgmentday  put back your hair effie said one of the macers for her beautiful and abundant tresses of long fair hair which according to the costume of the country unmarried women were not allowed to cover with any sort of cap and which alas effie dared no longer confine with the snood or riband which implied purity of maidenfame now hung unbound and dishevelled over her face and almost concealed her features on receiving this hint from the attendant the unfortunate young woman with a hasty trembling and apparently mechanical compliance shaded back from her face her luxuriant locks and showed to the whole court excepting one individual a countenance which though pale and emaciated was so lovely amid its agony that it called forth a universal murmur of compassion and sympathy apparently the expressive sound of human feeling recalled the poor girl from the stupor of fear which predominated at first over every other sensation and awakened her to the no less painful sense of shame and exposure attached to her present situation her eye which had at first glanced wildly around was turned on the ground her cheek at first so deadly pale began gradually to be overspread with a faint blush which increased so fast that when in agony of shame she strove to conceal her face her temples her brow her neck and all that her slender fingers and small palms could not cover became of the deepest crimson  all marked and were moved by these changes excepting one it was old deans who motionless in his seat and concealed as we have said by the corner of the bench from seeing or being seen did nevertheless keep his eyes firmly fixed on the ground as if determined that by no possibility whatever would he be an ocular witness of the shame of his house  ichabod he said to himselfichabod my glory is departed  while these reflections were passing through his mind the indictment which set forth in technical form the crime of which the panel stood accused was read as usual and the prisoner was asked if she was guilty or not guilty  not guilty of my poor bairns death said effie deans in an accent corresponding in plaintive softness of tone to the beauty of her features and which was not heard by the audience without emotion  the presiding judge next directed the counsel to plead to the relevancy that is to state on either part the arguments in point of law and evidence in point of fact against and in favour of the criminal after which it is the form of the court to pronounce a preliminary judgment sending the cause to the cognisance of the jury or assize  the counsel for the crown briefly stated the frequency of the crime of infanticide which had given rise to the special statute under which the panel stood indicted he mentioned the various instances many of them marked with circumstances of atrocity which had at length induced the kings advocate though with great reluctance to make the experiment whether by strictly enforcing the act of parliament which had been made to prevent such enormities their occurrence might be prevented he expected he said to be able to establish by witnesses as well as by the declaration of the panel herself that she was in the state described by the statute according to his information the panel had communicated her pregnancy to no one nor did she allege in her own declaration that she had done so this secrecy was the first requisite in support of the indictment the same declaration admitted that she had borne a male child in circumstances which gave but too much reason to believe it had died by the hands or at least with the knowledge or consent of the unhappy mother it was not however necessary for him to bring positive proof that the panel was accessory to the murder nay nor even to prove that the child was murdered at all it was sufficient to support the indictment that it could not be found according to the stern but necessary severity of this statute she who should conceal her pregnancy who should omit to call that assistance which is most necessary on such occasions was held already to have meditated the death of her offspring as an event most likely to be the consequence of her culpable and cruel concealment and if under such circumstances she could not alternatively show by proof that the infant had died a natural death or produce it still in life she must under the construction of the law be held to have murdered it and suffer death accordingly  the counsel for the prisoner mr fairbrother a man of considerable fame in his profession did not pretend directly to combat the arguments of the kings advocate he began by lamenting that his senior at the bar mr langtale had been suddenly called to the county of which he was sheriff and that he had been applied to on short warning to give the panel his assistance in this interesting case he had had little time he said to make up for his inferiority to his learned brother by long and minute research and he was afraid he might give a specimen of his incapacity by being compelled to admit the accuracy of the indictment under the statute it was enough for their lordships he observed to know that such was the law and he admitted the advocate had a right to call for the usual interlocutor of relevancy but he stated that when he came to establish his case by proof he trusted to make out circumstances which would satisfactorily elide the charge in the libel his clients story was a short but most melancholy one she was bred up in the strictest tenets of religion and virtue the daughter of a worthy and conscientious person who in evil times had established a character for courage and religion by becoming a sufferer for conscience sake  david deans gave a convulsive start at hearing himself thus mentioned and then resumed the situation in which with his face stooped against his hands and both resting against the corner of the elevated bench on which the judges sate he had hitherto listened to the procedure in the trial the whig lawyers seemed to be interested the tories put up their lip  whatever may be our difference of opinion resumed the lawyer whose business it was to carry his whole audience with him if possible concerning the peculiar tenets of these people here deans groaned deeply it is impossible to deny them the praise of sound and even rigid morals or the merit of training up their children in the fear of god and yet it was the daughter of such a person whom a jury would shortly be called upon in the absence of evidence and upon mere presumptions to convict of a crime more properly belonging to a heathen or a savage than to a christian and civilised country it was true he admitted that the excellent nurture and early instruction which the poor girl had received had not been sufficient to preserve her from guilt and error she had fallen a sacrifice to an inconsiderate affection for a young man of prepossessing manners as he had been informed but of a very dangerous and desperate character she was seduced under promise of marriagea promise which the fellow might have perhaps done her justice by keeping had he not at that time been called upon by the law to atone for a crime violent and desperate in itself but which became the preface to another eventful history every step of which was marked by blood and guilt and the final termination of which had not even yet arrived he believed that no one would hear him without surprise when he stated that the father of this infant now amissing and said by the learned advocate to have been murdered was no other than the notorious george robertson the accomplice of wilson the hero of the memorable escape from the tolbooth church and as no one knew better than his learned friend the advocate the principal actor in the porteous conspiracy  i am sorry to interrupt a counsel in such a case as the present said the presiding judge but i must remind the learned gentleman that he is travelling out of the case before us  the counsel bowed and resumed he only judged it necessary he said to mention the name and situation of robertson because the circumstance in which that character was placed went a great way in accounting for the silence on which his majestys counsel had laid so much weight as affording proof that his client proposed to allow no fair play for its life to the helpless being whom she was about to bring into the world she had not announced to her friends that she had been seduced from the path of honourand why had she not done sobecause she expected daily to be restored to character by her seducer doing her that justice which she knew to be in his power and believed to be in his inclination was it naturalwas it reasonablewas it fair to expect that she should in the interim become felo de se of her own character and proclaim her frailty to the world when she had every reason to expect that by concealing it for a season it might be veiled for ever was it not on the contrary pardonable that in such an emergency a young woman in such a situation should be found far from disposed to make a confidant of every prying gossip who with sharp eyes and eager ears pressed upon her for an explanation of suspicious circumstances which females in the lowerhe might say which females of all ranks are so alert in noticing that they sometimes discover them where they do not exist was it strange or was it criminal that she should have repelled their inquisitive impertinence with petulant denials the sense and feeling of all who heard him would answer directly in the negative but although his client had thus remained silent towards those to whom she was not called upon to communicate her situationto whom said the learned gentleman i will add it would have been unadvised and improper in her to have done so yet i trust i shall remove this case most triumphantly from under the statute and obtain the unfortunate young woman an honourable dismission from your lordships bar by showing that she did in due time and place and to a person most fit for such confidence mention the calamitous circumstances in which she found herself this occurred after robertsons conviction and when he was lying in prison in expectation of the fate which his comrade wilson afterwards suffered and from which he himself so strangely escaped it was then when all hopes of having her honour repaired by wedlock vanished from her eyeswhen an union with one in robertsons situation if still practicable might perhaps have been regarded rather as an addition to her disgraceit was then that i trust to be able to prove that the prisoner communicated and consulted with her sister a young woman several years older than herself the daughter of her father if i mistake not by a former marriage upon the perils and distress of her unhappy situation  if indeed you are able to instruct that point mr fairbrother said the presiding judge  if i am indeed able to instruct that point my lord resumed mr fairbrother i trust not only to serve my client but to relieve your lordships from that which i know you feel the most painful duty of your high office and to give all who now hear me the exquisite pleasure of beholding a creature so young so ingenuous and so beautiful as she that is now at the bar of your lordships court dismissed from thence in safety and in honour  this address seemed to affect many of the audience and was followed by a slight murmur of applause deans as he heard his daughters beauty and innocent appearance appealed to was involuntarily about to turn his eyes towards her but recollecting himself he bent them again on the ground with stubborn resolution  will not my learned brother on the other side of the bar continued the advocate after a short pause share in this general joy since i know while he discharges his duty in bringing an accused person here no one rejoices more in their being freely and honourably sent hence my learned brother shakes his head doubtfully and lays his hand on the panels declaration i understand him perfectlyhe would insinuate that the facts now stated to your lordships are inconsistent with the confession of euphemia deans herself i need not remind your lordships that her present defence is no whit to be narrowed within the bounds of her former confession and that it is not by any account which she may formerly have given of herself but by what is now to be proved for or against her that she must ultimately stand or fall i am not under the necessity of accounting for her choosing to drop out of her declaration the circumstances of her confession to her sister she might not be aware of its importance she might be afraid of implicating her sister she might even have forgotten the circumstance entirely in the terror and distress of mind incidental to the arrest of so young a creature on a charge so heinous any of these reasons are sufficient to account for her having suppressed the truth in this instance at whatever risk to herself and i incline most to her erroneous fear of criminating her sister because i observe she has had a similar tenderness towards her lover however undeserved on his part and has never once mentioned robertsons name from beginning to end of her declaration  but my lords continued fairbrother i am aware the kings advocate will expect me to show that the proof i offer is consistent with other circumstances of the case which i do not and cannot deny he will demand of me how effie deanss confession to her sister previous to her delivery is reconcilable with the mystery of the birthwith the disappearance perhaps the murder for i will not deny a possibility which i cannot disprove of the infant my lords the explanation of this is to be found in the placability perchance i may say in the facility and pliability of the female sex the dulcis amaryllidis irae as your lordships well know are easily appeased nor is it possible to conceive a woman so atrociously offended by the man whom she has loved but that she will retain a fund of forgiveness upon which his penitence whether real or affected may draw largely with a certainty that his bills will be answered we can prove by a letter produced in evidence that this villain robertson from the bottom of the dungeon whence he already probably meditated the escape which he afterwards accomplished by the assistance of his comrade contrived to exercise authority over the mind and to direct the motions of this unhappy girl it was in compliance with his injunctions expressed in that letter that the panel was prevailed upon to alter the line of conduct which her own better thoughts had suggested and instead of resorting when her time of travail approached to the protection of her own family was induced to confide herself to the charge of some vile agent of this nefarious seducer and by her conducted to one of those solitary and secret purlieus of villany which to the shame of our police still are suffered to exist in the suburbs of this city where with the assistance and under the charge of a person of her own sex she bore a male child under circumstances which added treble bitterness to the woe denounced against our original mother what purpose robertson had in all this it is hard to tell or even to guess he may have meant to marry the girl for her father is a man of substance but for the termination of the story and the conduct of the woman whom he had placed about the person of euphemia deans it is still more difficult to account the unfortunate young woman was visited by the fever incidental to her situation in this fever she appears to have been deceived by the person that waited on her and on recovering her senses she found that she was childless in that abode of misery her infant had been carried off perhaps for the worst purposes by the wretch that waited on her it may have been murdered for what i can tell  he was here interrupted by a piercing shriek uttered by the unfortunate prisoner she was with difficulty brought to compose herself her counsel availed himself of the tragical interruption to close his pleading with effect  my lords said he in that piteous cry you heard the eloquence of maternal affection far surpassing the force of my poor wordsrachel weeping for her children nature herself bears testimony in favour of the tenderness and acuteness of the prisoners parental feelings i will not dishonour her plea by adding a word more  heard ye ever the like o that laird said saddletree to dumbiedikes when the counsel had ended his speech theres a chield can spin a muckle pirn out of a wee tait of tow deil haet he kens mair about it than whats in the declaration and a surmise that jeanie deans suld hae been able to say something

garrd my father no send me to utrechtbut whisht the court is gaun to pronounce the interlocutor of relevancy  and accordingly the judges after a few words recorded their judgment which bore that the indictment if proved was relevant to infer the pains of law and that the defence that the panel had communicated her situation to her sister was a relevant defence and finally appointed the said indictment and defence to be submitted to the judgment of an assize     chapter twentysecond              most righteous judge a sentencecome prepare                                     merchant of venice  it is by no means my intention to describe minutely the forms of a scottish criminal trial nor am i sure that i could draw up an account so intelligible and accurate as to abide the criticism of the gentlemen of the long robe it is enough to say that the jury was impanelled and the case proceeded the prisoner was again required to plead to the charge and she again replied not guilty in the same heartthrilling tone as before  the crown counsel then called two or three female witnesses by whose testimony it was established that effies situation had been remarked by them that they had taxed her with the fact and that her answers had amounted to an angry and petulant denial of what they charged her with but as very frequently happens the declaration of the panel or accused party herself was the evidence which bore hardest upon her case  in the event of these tales ever finding their way across the border it may be proper to apprise the southern reader that it is the practice in scotland on apprehending a suspected person to subject him to a judicial examination before a magistrate he is not compelled to answer any of the questions asked of him but may remain silent if he sees it his interest to do so but whatever answers he chooses to give are formally written down and being subscribed by himself and the magistrate are produced against the accused in case of his being brought to trial it is true that these declarations are not produced as being in themselves evidence properly so called but only as adminicles of testimony tending to corroborate what is considered as legal and proper evidence notwithstanding this nice distinction however introduced by lawyers to reconcile this procedure to their own general rule that a man cannot be required to bear witness against himself it nevertheless usually happens that these declarations become the means of condemning the accused as it were out of their own mouths the prisoner upon these previous examinations has indeed the privilege of remaining silent if he pleases but every man necessarily feels that a refusal to answer natural and pertinent interrogatories put by judicial authority is in itself a strong proof of guilt and will certainly lead to his being committed to prison and few can renounce the hope of obtaining liberty by giving some specious account of themselves and showing apparent frankness in explaining their motives and accounting for their conduct it therefore seldom happens that the prisoner refuses to give a judicial declaration in which nevertheless either by letting out too much of the truth or by endeavouring to substitute a fictitious story he almost always exposes himself to suspicion and to contradictions which weigh heavily in the minds of the jury  the declaration of effie deans was uttered on other principles and the following is a sketch of its contents given in the judicial form in which they may still be found in the books of adjournal  the declarant admitted a criminal intrigue with an individual whose name she desired to conceal being interrogated what her reason was for secrecy on this point she declared that she had no right to blame that persons conduct more than she did her own and that she was willing to confess her own faults but not to say anything which might criminate the absent interrogated if she confessed her situation to any one or made any preparation for her confinement declares she did not and being interrogated why she forbore to take steps which her situation so peremptorily required declares she was ashamed to tell her friends and she trusted the person she has mentioned would provide for her and the infant interrogated if he did so declares that he did not do so personally but that it was not his fault for that the declarant is convinced he would have laid down his life sooner than the bairn or she had come to harm interrogated what prevented him from keeping his promise declares that it was impossible for him to do so he being under trouble at the time and declines farther answer to this question interrogated where she was from the period she left her master mr saddletrees family until her appearance at her fathers at st leonards the day before she was apprehended declares she does not remember and on the interrogatory being repeated declares she does not mind muckle about it for she was very ill on the question being again repeated she declares she will tell the truth if it should be the undoing of her so long as she is not asked to tell on other folk and admits that she passed that interval of time in the lodging of a woman an acquaintance of that person who had wished her to that place to be delivered and that she was there delivered accordingly of a male child interrogated what was the name of that person declares and refuses to answer this question interrogated where she lives declares she has no certainty for that she was taken to the lodging aforesaid under cloud of night interrogated if the lodging was in the city or suburbs declares and refuses to answer that question interrogated whether when she left the house of mr saddletree she went up or down the street declares and refuses to answer the question interrogated whether she had ever seen the woman before she was wished to her as she termed it by the person whose name she refuses to answer declares and replies not to her knowledge interrogated whether this woman was introduced to her by the said person verbally or by word of mouth declares she has no freedom to answer this question interrogated if the child was alive when it was born declares thatgod help her and itit certainly was alive interrogated if it died a natural death after birth declares not to her knowledge interrogated where it now is declares she would give her right hand to ken but that she never hopes to see mair than the banes of it and being interrogated why she supposes it is now dead the declarant wept bitterly and made no answer interrogated if the woman in whose lodging she was seemed to be a fit person to be with her in that situation declares she might be fit enough for skill but that she was an hardhearted bad woman interrogated if there was any other person in the lodging excepting themselves two declares that she thinks there was another woman but her head was so carried with pain of body and trouble of mind that she minded her very little interrogated when the child was taken away from her declared that she fell in a fever and was lightheaded and when she came to her own mind the woman told her the bairn was dead and that the declarant answered if it was dead it had had foul play that thereupon the woman was very sair on her and gave her much ill language and that the deponent was frightened and crawled out of the house when her back was turned and went home to saint leonards crags as well as a woman in her condition dought   ie was able to do  interrogated why she did not tell her story to her sister and father and get force to search the house for her child dead or alive declares it was her purpose to do so but she had not time interrogated why she now conceals the name of the woman and the place of her abode the declarant remained silent for a time and then said that to do so could not repair the skaith that was done but might be the occasion of more interrogated whether she had herself at any time had any purpose of putting away the child by violence declares never so might god be merciful to herand then again declares never when she was in her perfect senses but what bad thoughts the enemy might put into her brain when she was out of herself she cannot answer and again solemnly interrogated declares that she would have been drawn with wild horses rather than have touched the bairn with an unmotherly hand interrogated declares that among the illlanguage the woman gave her she did say sure enough that the declarant had hurt the bairn when she was in the brain fever but that the declarant does not believe that she said this from any other cause than to frighten her and make her be silent interrogated what else the woman said to her declares that when the declarant cried loud for her bairn and was like to raise the neighbours the woman threatened her that they that could stop the weans skirling would stop hers if she did not keep a the founder   ie the quieter  and that this threat with the manner of the woman made the declarant conclude that the bairns life was gone and her own in danger for that the woman was a desperate bad woman as the declarant judged from the language she used interrogated declares that the fever and delirium were brought on her by hearing bad news suddenly told to her but refuses to say what the said news related to interrogated why she does not now communicate these particulars which might perhaps enable the magistrate to ascertain whether the child is living or dead and requested to observe that her refusing to do so exposes her own life and leaves the child in bad hands as also that her present refusal to answer on such points is inconsistent with her alleged intention to make a clean breast to her sister declares that she kens the bairn is now dead or if living there is one that will look after it that for her own living or dying she is in gods hands who knows her innocence of harming her bairn with her will or knowledge and that she has altered her resolution of speaking out which she entertained when she left the womans lodging on account of a matter which she has since learned and declares in general that she is wearied and will answer no more questions at this time  upon a subsequent examination euphemia deans adhered to the declaration she had formerly made with this addition that a paper found in her trunk being shown to her she admitted that it contained the credentials in consequence of which she resigned herself to the conduct of the woman at whose lodgings she was delivered of the child its tenor ran thus  dearest effiei have gotten the means to send to you by a woman who is well qualified to assist you in your approaching streight she is not what i could wish her but i cannot do better for you in my present condition i am obliged to trust to her in this present calamity for myself and you too i hope for the best though i am now in a sore pinch yet thought is freei think handie dandie and i may queer the stifler for all that is come and gone   avoid the gallows  you will be angry for me writing this to my little cameronian lily but if i can but live to be a comfort to you and a father to your babie you will have plenty of time to scoldonce more let none knew your counselmy life depends on this hag dn hershe is both deep and dangerous but she has more

must truss me i will repent of nothing so much even at the last hard pinch as of the injury i have done my lily  effie refused to say from whom she had received this letter but enough of the story was now known to ascertain that it came from robertson and from the date it appeared to have been written about the time when andrew wilson called for a nickname handie dandie and he were meditating their first abortive attempt to escape which miscarried in the manner mentioned in the beginning of this history  the evidence of the crown being concluded the counsel for the prisoner began to lead a proof in her defence the first witnesses were examined upon the girls character all gave her an excellent one but none with more feeling than worthy mrs saddletree who with the tears on her cheeks declared that she could not have had a higher opinion of effie deans nor a more sincere regard for her if she had been her own daughter all present gave the honest woman credit for her goodness of heart excepting her husband who whispered to dumbiedikes that nichil novit of yours is but a raw hand at leading evidence im thinking what signified his bringing a woman here to snotter and snivel and bather their lordships he should hae ceeted me sir and i should hae gien them sic a screed o testimony they shauldna hae touched a hair o her head  hadna ye better get up and tryt yet said the laird ill mak a sign to novit  na na said saddletree thank ye for naething neighbourthat would be ultroneous evidence and i ken what belangs to that but nichil novit suld hae had me ceeted debito tempore and wiping his mouth with his silk handkerchief with great importance he resumed the port and manner of an edified and intelligent auditor  mr fairbrother now premised in a few words that he meant to bring forward his most important witness upon whose evidence the cause must in a great measure depend what his client was they had learned from the preceding witnesses and so far as general character given in the most forcible terms and even with tears could interest every one in her fate she had already gained that advantage it was necessary he admitted that he should produce more positive testimony of her innocence than what arose out of general character and this he undertook to do by the mouth of the person to whom she had communicated her situationby the mouth of her natural counsellor and guardianher sistermacer call into court jean or jeanie deans daughter of david deans cowfeeder at saint leonards crags  when he uttered these words the poor prisoner instantly started up and stretched herself halfway over the bar towards the side at which her sister was to enter and when slowly following the officer the witness advanced to the foot of the table effie with the whole expression of her countenance altered from that of confused shame and dismay to an eager imploring and almost ecstatic earnestness of entreaty with outstretched hands hair streaming back eyes raised eagerly to her sisters face and glistening through tears exclaimed in a tone which went through the heart of all who heard hero jeanie jeanie save me save me  with a different feeling yet equally appropriated to his proud and selfdependent character old deans drew himself back still farther under the cover of the bench so that when jeanie as she entered the court cast a timid glance towards the place at which she had left him seated his venerable figure was no longer visible he sate down on the other side of dumbiedikes wrung his hand hard and whispered ah laird this is warst of aif i can but win ower this parti feel my head unco dizzy but my master is strong in his servants weakness after a moments mental prayer he again started up as if impatient of continuing in any one posture and gradually edged himself forward towards the place he had just quitted  jeanie in the meantime had advanced to the bottom of the table when unable to resist the impulse of affections she suddenly extended her hand to her sister effie was just within the distance that she could seize it with both hers press it to her mouth cover it with kisses and bathe it in tears with the fond devotion that a catholic would pay to a guardian saint descended for his safety while jeanie hiding her own face with her other hand wept bitterly the sight would have moved a heart of stone much more of flesh and blood many of the spectators shed tears and it was some time before the presiding judge himself could so far subdue his emotion as to request the witness to compose herself and the prisoner to forbear those marks of eager affection which however natural could not be permitted at that time and in that presence  the solemn oaththe truth to tell and no truth to conceal as far as she knew or should be asked was then administered by the judge in the name of god and as the witness should answer to god at the great day of judgment an awful adjuration which seldom fails to make impression even on the most hardened characters and to strike with fear even the most upright jeanie educated in deep and devout reverence for the name and attributes of the deity was by the solemnity of a direct appeal to his person and justice awed but at the same time elevated above all considerations save those which she could with a clear conscience call him to witness she repeated the form in a low and reverent but distinct tone of voice after the judge to whom and not to any inferior officer of the court the task is assigned in scotland of directing the witness in that solemn appeal which is the sanction of his testimony  when the judge had finished the established form he added in a feeling but yet a monitory tone an advice which the circumstances appeared to him to call for  young woman these were his words you come before this court in circumstances which it would be worse than cruel not to pity and to sympathise with yet it is my duty to tell you that the truth whatever its consequences may be the truth is what you owe to your country and to that god whose word is truth and whose name you have now invoked use your own time in answering the questions that gentleman pointing to the counsel shall put to youbut remember that what you may be tempted to say beyond what is the actual truth you must answer both here and hereafter  the usual questions were then put to herwhether any one had instructed her what evidence she had to deliver whether any one had given or promised her any good deed hire or reward for her testimony whether she had any malice or illwill at his majestys advocate being the party against whom she was cited as a witness to which questions she successively answered by a quiet negative but their tenor gave great scandal and offence to her father who was not aware that they are put to every witness as a matter of form  na na he exclaimed loud enough to be heard my bairn is no like the widow of tekoahnae man has putten words into her mouth  one of the judges better acquainted perhaps with the books of adjournal than with the book of samuel was disposed to make some instant inquiry after this widow of tekoah who as he construed the matter had been tampering with the evidence but the presiding judge better versed in scripture history whispered to his learned brother the necessary explanation and the pause occasioned by this mistake had the good effect of giving jeanie deans time to collect her spirits for the painful task she had to perform  fairbrother whose practice and intelligence were considerable saw the necessity of letting the witness compose herself in his heart he suspected that she came to bear false witness in her sisters cause  but that is her own affair thought fairbrother and it is my business to see that she has plenty of time to regain composure and to deliver her evidence be it true or be it falsevaleat quantum  accordingly he commenced his interrogatories with uninteresting questions which admitted of instant reply  you are i think the sister of the prisoner  yes sir  not the full sister however  no sirwe are by different mothers  true and you are i think several years older than your sister  yes sir etc  after the advocate had conceived that by these preliminary and unimportant questions he had familiarised the witness with the situation in which she stood he asked whether she had not remarked her sisters state of health to be altered during the latter part of the term when she had lived with mrs saddletree  jeanie answered in the affirmative  and she told you the cause of it my dear i suppose said fairbrother in an easy and as one may say an inductive sort of tone  i am sorry to interrupt my brother said the crown counsel rising but i am in your lordships judgment whether this be not a leading question  if this point is to be debated said the presiding judge the witness must be removed  for the scottish lawyers regard with a sacred and scrupulous horror every question so shaped by the counsel examining as to convey to a witness the least intimation of the nature of the answer which is desired from him these scruples though founded on an excellent principle are sometimes carried to an absurd pitch of nicety especially as it is generally easy for a lawyer who has his wits about him to elude the objection fairbrother did so in the present case  it is not necessary to waste the time of the court my lord since the kings counsel thinks it worth while to object to the form of my question i will shape it otherwisepray young woman did you ask your sister any question when you observed her looking unwelltake couragespeak out  i asked her replied jeanie what ailed her  very welltake your own timeand what was the answer she made continued mr fairbrother  jeanie was silent and looked deadly pale it was not that she at any one instant entertained an idea of the possibility of prevaricationit was the natural hesitation to extinguish the last spark of hope that remained for her sister  take courage young woman said fairbrotheri asked what your sister said ailed her when you inquired  nothing answered jeanie with a faint voice which was yet heard distinctly in the most distant corner of the courtroomsuch an awful and profound silence had been preserved during the anxious interval which had interposed betwixt the lawyers question and the answer of the witness  fairbrothers countenance fell but with that ready presence of mind which is as useful in civil as in military emergencies he immediately ralliednothing true you mean nothing at firstbut when you asked her again did she not tell you what ailed her  the question was put in a tone meant to make her comprehend the importance of her answer had she not been already aware of it the ice was broken however and with less pause than at first she now repliedalack alack she never breathed word to me about it  a deep groan passed through the court it was echoed by one deeper and more agonised from the unfortunate father the hope to which unconsciously and in spite of himself he had still secretly clung had now dissolved and the venerable old man fell forward senseless on the floor of the courthouse with his head at the foot of his terrified daughter the unfortunate prisoner with impotent passion strove with the guards betwixt whom she was placed let me gang to my fatheri will gang to himi will gang to himhe is deadhe is killedi hae killed himshe repeated in frenzied tones of grief which those who heard them did not speedily forget  even in this moment of agony and general confusion jeanie did not lose that superiority which a deep and firm mind assures to its possessor under the most trying circumstances  he is my fatherhe is our father she mildly repeated to those who endeavoured to separate them as she stoopedshaded aside his grey hairs and began assiduously to chafe his temples  the judge after repeatedly wiping his eyes gave directions that they should be conducted into a neighbouring apartment and carefully attended the prisoner as her father was borne from the court and her sister slowly followed pursued them with her eyes so earnestly fixed as if they would have started from their sockets but when they were no longer visible she seemed to find in her despairing and deserted state a courage which she had not yet exhibited  the bitterness of it is now past she said and then boldly addressed the court my lords if it is your pleasure to gang on wi this matter the weariest day will hae its end at last  the judge who much to his honour had shared deeply in the general sympathy was surprised at being recalled to his duty by the prisoner he collected himself and requested to know if the panels counsel had more evidence to produce fairbrother replied with an air of dejection that his proof was concluded  the kings counsel addressed the jury for the crown he said in a few words that no one could be more concerned than he was for the distressing scene which they had just witnessed but it was the necessary consequence of great crimes to bring distress and ruin upon all connected with the perpetrators he briefly reviewed the proof in which he showed that all the circumstances of the case concurred with those required by the act under which the unfortunate prisoner was tried that the counsel for the panel had totally failed in proving that euphemia deans had communicated her situation to her sister that respecting her previous good character he was sorry to observe that it was females who possessed the worlds good report and to whom it was justly valuable who were most strongly tempted by shame and fear of the worlds censure to the crime of infanticide that the child was murdered he professed to entertain no doubt the vacillating and inconsistent declaration of the prisoner herself marked as it was by numerous refusals to speak the truth on subjects when according to her own story it would have been natural as well as advantageous to have been candid even this imperfect declaration left no doubt in his mind as to the fate of the unhappy infant neither could he doubt that the panel was a partner in this guilt who else had an interest in a deed so inhuman surely neither robertson nor robertsons agent in whose house she was delivered had the least temptation to commit such a crime unless upon her account with her connivance and for the sake of saying her reputation but it was not required of him by the law that he should bring precise proof of the murder or of the prisoners accession to it it was the very purpose of the statute to substitute a certain chain of presumptive evidence in place of a probation which in such cases it was peculiarly difficult to obtain the jury might peruse the statute itself and they had also the libel and interlocutor of relevancy to direct them in point of law he put it to the conscience of the jury that under both he was entitled to a verdict of guilty  the charge of fairbrother was much cramped by his having failed in the proof which he expected to lead but he fought his losing cause with courage and constancy he ventured to arraign the severity of the statute under which the young woman was tried in all other cases he said the first thing required of the criminal prosecutor was to prove unequivocally that the crime libelled had actually been committed which lawyers called proving the corpus delicti but this statute made doubtless with the best intentions and under the impulse of a just horror for the unnatural crime of infanticide ran the risk of itself occasioning the worst of murders the death of an innocent person to atone for a supposed crime which may never have been committed by anyone he was so far from acknowledging the alleged probability of the childs violent death that he could not even allow that there was evidence of its having ever lived  the kings counsel pointed to the womans declaration to which the counsel replieda production concocted in a moment of terror and agony and which approached to insanity he said his learned brother well knew was no sound evidence against the party who emitted it it was true that a judicial confession in presence of the justices themselves was the strongest of all proof insomuch that it is said in law that in confitentem nullae sunt partes judicis but this was true of judicial confession only by which law meant that which is made in presence of the justices and the sworn inquest of extrajudicial confession all authorities held with the illustrious farinaceus and matthaeus confessio extrajudicialis in se nulla est et quod nullum est non potest adminiculari it was totally inept and void of all strength and effect from the beginning incapable therefore of being bolstered up or supported or according to the law phrase adminiculated by other presumptive circumstances in the present case therefore letting the extrajudicial confession go as it ought to go for nothing he contended the prosecutor had not made out the second quality of the statute that a live child had been born and that at least ought to be established before presumptions were received that it had been murdered if any of the assize he said should be of opinion that this was dealing rather narrowly with the statute they ought to consider that it was in its nature highly penal and therefore entitled to no favourable construction  he concluded a learned speech with an eloquent peroration on the scene they had just witnessed during which saddletree fell fast asleep  it was now the presiding judges turn to address the jury he did so briefly and distinctly  it was for the jury he said to consider whether the prosecutor had made out his plea for himself he sincerely grieved to say that a shadow of doubt remained not upon his mind concerning the verdict which the inquest had to bring in he would not follow the prisoners counsel through the impeachment which he had brought against the statute of king william and queen mary he and the jury were sworn to judge according to the laws as they stood not to criticise or evade or even to justify them in no civil case would a counsel have been permitted to plead his clients case in the teeth of the law but in the hard situation in which counsel were often placed in the criminal court as well as out of favour to all presumptions of innocence he had not inclined to interrupt the learned gentleman or narrow his plea the present law as it now stood had been instituted by the wisdom of their fathers to check the alarming progress of a dreadful crime when it was found too severe for its purpose it would doubtless be altered by the wisdom of the legislature at present it was the law of the land the rule of the court and according to the oath which they had taken it must be that of the jury this unhappy girls situation could not be doubted that she had borne a child and that the child had disappeared were certain facts the learned counsel had failed to show that she had communicated her situation all the requisites of the case required by the statute were therefore before the jury the learned gentleman had indeed desired them to throw out of consideration the panels own confession which was the plea usually urged in penury of all others by counsel in his situation who usually felt that the declarations of their clients bore hard on them but that the scottish law designed that a certain weight should be laid on these declarations which he admitted were quodammodo extrajudicial was evident from the universal practice by which they were always produced and read as part of the prosecutors probation in the present case no person who had heard the witnesses describe the appearance of the young woman before she left saddletrees house and contrasted it with that of her state and condition at her return to her fathers could have any doubt that the fact of delivery had taken place as set forth in her own declaration which was therefore not a solitary piece of testimony but adminiculated and supported by the strongest circumstantial proof  he did not he said state the impression upon his own mind with the purpose of biassing theirs he had felt no less than they had done from the scene of domestic misery which had been exhibited before them and if they having god and a good conscience the sanctity of their oath and the regard due to the law of the country before their eyes could come to a conclusion favourable to this unhappy prisoner he should rejoice as much as anyone in court for never had he found his duty more distressing than in discharging it that day and glad he would be to be relieved from the still more painful task which would otherwise remain for him  the jury having heard the judges address bowed and retired preceded by a macer of court to the apartment destined for their deliberation     chapter twentythird                law take thy victimmay she find the mercy              in yon mild heaven which this hard world denies her  it was an hour ere the jurors returned and as they traversed the crowd with slow steps as men about to discharge themselves of a heavy and painful responsibility the audience was hushed into profound earnest and awful silence  have you agreed on your chancellor gentlemen was the first question of the judge  the foreman called in scotland the chancellor of the jury usually the man of best rank and estimation among the assizers stepped forward and with a low reverence delivered to the court a sealed paper containing the verdict which until of late years that verbal returns are in some instances permitted was always couched in writing the jury remained standing while the judge broke the seals and having perused the paper handed it with an air of mournful gravity down to the clerk of court who proceeded to engross in the record the yet unknown verdict of which however all omened the tragical contents a form still remained trifling and unimportant in itself but to which imagination adds a sort of solemnity from the awful occasion upon which it is used a lighted candle was placed on the table the original paper containing the verdict was enclosed in a sheet of paper and sealed with the judges own signet was transmitted to the crown office to be preserved among other records of the same kind as all this is transacted in profound silence the producing and extinguishing the candle seems a type of the human spark which is shortly afterwards doomed to be quenched and excites in the spectators something of the same effect which in england is obtained by the judge assuming the fatal cap of judgment when these preliminary forms had been gone through the judge required euphemia deans to attend to the verdict to be read  after the usual words of style the verdict set forth that the jury having made choice of john kirk esq to be their chancellor and thomas moore merchant to be their clerk did by a plurality of voices find the said euphemia deans guilty of the crime libelled but in consideration of her extreme youth and the cruel circumstances of her case did earnestly entreat that the judge would recommend her to the mercy of the crown  gentlemen said the judge you have done your dutyand a painful one it must have been to men of humanity like you i will undoubtedly transmit your recommendation to the throne but it is my duty to tell all who now hear me but especially to inform that unhappy young woman in order that her mind may be settled accordingly that i have not the least hope of a pardon being granted in the present case you know the crime has been increasing in this land and i know farther that this has been ascribed to the lenity in which the laws have been exercised and that there is therefore no hope whatever of obtaining a remission for this offence the jury bowed again and released from their painful office dispersed themselves among the mass of bystanders  the court then asked mr fairbrother whether he had anything to say why judgment should not follow on the verdict the counsel had spent some time in persuing and reperusing the verdict counting the letters in each jurors name and weighing every phrase nay every syllable in the nicest scales of legal criticism but the clerk of the jury had understood his business too well no flaw was to be found and fairbrother mournfully intimated that he had nothing to say in arrest of judgment  the presiding judge then addressed the unhappy prisonereuphemia deans attend to the sentence of the court now to be pronounced against you  she rose from her seat and with a composure far greater than could have been augured from her demeanour during some parts of the trial abode the conclusion of the awful scene so nearly does the mental portion of our feelings resemble those which are corporeal that the first severe blows which we receive bring with them a stunning apathy which renders us indifferent to those that follow them thus said mandrin when he was undergoing the punishment of the wheel and so have all felt upon whom successive inflictions have descended with continuous and reiterated violence   the notorious mandrin was known as the captaingeneral of french  smugglers see a tract on his exploits printed 1753  young woman said the judge it is my painful duty to tell you that your life is forfeited under a law which if it may seem in some degree severe is yet wisely so to render those of your unhappy situation aware what risk they run by concealing out of pride or false shame their lapse from virtue and making no preparation to save the lives of the unfortunate infants whom they are to bring into the world when you concealed your situation from your mistress your sister and other worthy and compassionate persons of your own sex in whose favour your former conduct had given you a fair place you seem to me to have had in your contemplation at least the death of the helpless creature for whose life you neglected to provide how the child was disposed ofwhether it was dealt upon by another or by yourselfwhether the extraordinary story you have told is partly false or altogether so is between god and your own conscience i will not aggravate your distress by pressing on that topic but i do most solemnly adjure you to employ the remaining space of your time in making your peace with god for which purpose such reverend clergymen as you yourself may name shall have access to you notwithstanding the humane recommendation of the jury i cannot afford to you in the present circumstances of the country the slightest hope that your life will be prolonged beyond the period assigned for the execution of your sentence forsaking therefore the thoughts of this world let your mind be prepared by repentance for those of more awful momentsfor death judgment and eternitydoomster read the sentence   note n doomster or dempster of court  when the doomster showed

foot of the table as this office was held by the common executioner men shouldered each other backward to avoid even the touch of his garment and some were seen to brush their own clothes which had accidentally become subject to such contamination a sound went through the court produced by each person drawing in their breath hard as men do when they expect or witness what is frightful and at the same time affecting the caitiff villain yet seemed amid his hardened brutality to have some sense of his being the object of public detestation which made him impatient of being in public as birds of evil omen are anxious to escape from daylight and from pure air  repeating after the clerk of court he gabbled over the words of the sentence which condemned euphemia deans to be conducted back to the tolbooth of edinburgh and detained there until wednesday the day of  and upon that day betwixt the hours of two and four oclock afternoon to be conveyed to the common place of execution and there hanged by the neck upon a gibbet and this said the doomster aggravating his harsh voice i pronounce for doom  he vanished when he had spoken the last emphatic word like a foul fiend after the purpose of his visitation had been accomplished but the impression of horror excited by his presence and his errand remained upon the crowd of spectators  the unfortunate criminalfor so she must now be termedwith more susceptibility and more irritable feelings than her father and sister was found in this emergence to possess a considerable share of their courage she had remained standing motionless at the bar while the sentence was pronounced and was observed to shut her eyes when the doomster appeared but she was the first to break silence when that evil form had left his place  god forgive ye my lords she said and dinna be angry wi me for wishing itwe a need forgivenessas for myself i canna blame ye for ye act up to your lights and if i havena killed my poor infant ye may witness a that hae seen it this day that i hae been the means of killing my greyheaded fatheri deserve the warst frae man and frae god toobut god is mair mercifu to us than we are to each other  with these words the trial concluded the crowd rushed bearing forward and shouldering each other out of the court in the same tumultuary mode in which they had entered and in excitation of animal motion and animal spirits soon forgot whatever they had felt as impressive in the scene which they had witnessed the professional spectators whom habit and theory had rendered as callous to the distress of the scene as medical men are to those of a surgical operation walked homeward in groups discussing the general principle of the statute under which the young woman was condemned the nature of the evidence and the arguments of the counsel without considering even that of the judge as exempt from their criticism  the female spectators more compassionate were loud in exclamation against that part of the judges speech which seemed to cut off the hope of pardon  set him up indeed said mrs howden to tell us that the poor lassie behoved to die when mr john kirk as civil a gentleman as is within the ports of the town took the pains to prigg for her himsell  ay but neighbour said miss damahoy drawing up her thin maidenly form to its full height of prim dignityi really think this unnatural business of having

last riding of the scots parliament and that was in the gracious year seven sae ye can be nae sic chicken at ony rate  plumdamas who acted as squire of the body to the two contending dames instantly saw the hazard of entering into such delicate points of chronology and being a lover of peace and good neighbourhood lost no time in bringing back the conversation to its original subject  the judge didna tell us a he could hae telld us if he had liked about the application for pardon neighbours said he there is aye a wimple in a lawyers clew but its a wee bit of a secret  and what istwhat ist neighbour plumdamas said mrs howden and miss damahoy at once the acid fermentation of their dispute being at once neutralised by the powerful alkali implied in the word secret  heres mr saddletree can tell ye that better than me for it was him that tauld me said plumdamas as saddletree came up with his wife hanging on his arm and looking very disconsolate  when the question was put to saddletree he looked very scornful they speak about stopping the frequency of childmurder said he in a contemptuous tone do ye think our auld enemies of england as glendook aye cas them in his printed statutebook care a boddle whether we didna kill ane anither skin and birn horse and foot man woman and bairns all and sindry omnes et singulos as mr crossmyloof says na na its no that hinders them frae pardoning the bit lassie but here is the pinch of the plea the king and queen are sae ill pleased wi that mistak about porteous that deil a kindly scot will they pardon again either by reprieve or remission if the haill town o edinburgh should be a hanged on ae tow  deil that they were back at their german kaleyard then as my neighbour maccroskie cas it said mrs howden an thats the way theyre gaun to guide us  they say for certain said miss damahoy that king george flang his periwig in the fire when he heard o the porteous mob  he has done that they say replied saddletree for less thing  aweel said miss damahoy he might keep mair wit in his angerbut its a the better for his wigmaker ise warrant  the queen tore her biggonets for perfect angeryell hae heard o that too said plumdamas and the king they say kickit sir robert walpole for no keeping down the mob of edinburgh but i dinna believe he wad behave sae ungenteel  its dooms truth though said saddletree and he was for kickin the duke of argyle too   note o john duke of argyle and greenwich  kickin the duke of argyle exclaimed the hearers at once in all the various combined keys of utter astonishment  ay but maccallummores blood wadna sit down wi that there was risk of andro ferrara coming in thirdsman  the duke is a real scotsmana true friend to the country answered saddletrees hearers  ay troth is he to king and country baith as ye sall hear continued the orator if ye will come in bye to our house for its safest speaking of sic things inter parietes  when they entered his shop he thrust his prentice boy out of it and unlocking his desk took out with an air of grave and complacent importance a dirty and crumpled piece of printed paper he observed this is new cornits no every body could show you the like o this its the dukes

a foolish bill of exchange that the man wanted me to renew for him i wish ye wad see about it mrs saddletree  honest mrs saddletree had hitherto been so sincerely distressed about the situation of her unfortunate protegee that she had suffered her husband to proceed in his own way without attending to what he was saying the words bills and renew had however an awakening sound in them and she snatched the letter which her husband held towards her and wiping her eyes and putting on her spectacles endeavoured as fast as the dew which collected on her glasses would permit to get at the meaning of the needful part of the epistle while her husband with pompous elevation read an extract from the speech  i am no minister i never was a minister and i never will be one  i didna ken his grace was ever designed for the ministry interrupted mrs howden  he disna mean a minister of the gospel mrs howden but a minister of state said saddletree with condescending goodness and then proceeded the time was when i might have been a piece of a minister but i was too sensible of my own incapacity to engage in any state affair and i thank god that i had always too great a value for those few abilities which nature has given me to employ them in doing any drudgery or any job of what kind soever i have ever since i set out in the world and i believe few have set out more early served my prince with my tongue i have served him with any little interest i had and i have served him with my sword and in my profession of arms i have held employments which i have lost and were i to be tomorrow deprived of those which still remain to me and which i have endeavoured honestly to deserve i would still serve him to the last acre of my inheritance and to the last drop of my blood  mrs saddletree here broke in upon the oratormr saddletree what is the meaning of a this here are ye clavering about the duke of argyle and this man martingale gaun to break on our hands and lose us gude sixty poundsi wonder what duke will pay that quothai wish the duke of argyle would pay his ain accountshe is in a thousand punds scots on thae very books when he was last at roystounim no saying but hes a just nobleman and that its gude sillerbut it wad drive ane daft to be confused wi deukes and drakes and thae distressed folk upstairs thats jeanie deans and her father and then putting the

upper and under parliaments and parliament houses here and in london the gudemans gane clean gyte i think  the gossips understood civility and the rule of doing as they would be done by too well to tarry upon the slight invitation implied in the conclusion of this speech and therefore made their farewells and departure as fast as possible saddletree whispering to plundamas that he would meet him at maccroskies the lowbrowed shop in the luckenbooths already mentioned in the hour of cause and put maccallummores speech in his pocket for a the gudewifes din  when mrs saddletree saw the house freed of her importunate visitors and the little boy reclaimed from the pastimes of the wynd to the exercise of the awl she went to visit her unhappy relative david deans and his elder daughter who

entered the apartment in which her guests had shrouded their misery she found the window darkened the feebleness which followed his long swoon had rendered it necessary to lay the old man in bed the curtains were drawn around him and jeanie sate motionless by the side of the bed mrs saddletree was a woman of kindness nay of feeling but not of delicacy she opened the halfshut window drew aside the curtain and taking her kinsman by the hand exhorted him to sit up and bear his sorrow like a good man and a christian man as he was but when she quitted his hand it fell powerless by his side nor did he attempt the least reply  is all over asked jeanie with lips and cheeks as pale as ashesand is there nae hope for her  nane or next to nane said mrs saddletree i heard the judgecarle say it with my

lady to her lecture upon worldly vanities we must transport our reader to the cell in which the unfortunate effie deans was now immured being restricted of several liberties which she had enjoyed before the sentence was pronounced  when she had remained about an hour in the state of stupified horror so natural in her situation she was disturbed by the opening of the jarring bolts of her place of confinement and ratcliffe showed himself its your sister he said wants to speak tye effie  i canna see naebody said effie with the hasty irritability which misery had rendered more acutei canna see naebody and least of a herbid her take care o the auld mani am naething to ony o them now nor them to me  she says she maun see ye though said ratcliffe and jeanie rushing into the apartment threw her arms round her sisters neck who writhed to extricate herself from her embrace  what signifies coming to greet ower me said poor effie when you have killed mekilled me when a word of your mouth would have saved mekilled me when i am an innocent creatureinnocent of that guilt at leastand me that wad hae wared body and soul to save your finger from being hurt  you shall not die said jeanie with

weeks but they aye bide the sax weeks out for a that i ken the gate ot weel i hae fronted the doomster three times and here i stand jim ratcliffe for a that had i tied my napkin strait the first time as i had a great mind tilltand it was a about a bit grey cowt wasna worth ten punds sterlingwhere would i have been now  and how did you escape said jeanie the fates of this man at first so odious to her having acquired a sudden interest in her eyes from their correspondence with those of her sister  how did i escape said ratcliffe with a knowing winki tell ye i scapit in a way that naebody will escape from this tolbooth while i keep the keys  my sister shall come out in the face of the sun said jeanie i will go to london and beg her pardon from the king and queen if they pardoned porteous they may pardon her if a sister asks a sisters life on her bended knees they will pardon herthey shall pardon herand they will win a thousand hearts by it  effie listened in bewildered astonishment and so earnest was her sisters enthusiastic assurance that she almost involuntarily caught a gleam of hope but it instantly faded away  ah jeanie the king and queen live in london a thousand miles from thisfar ayont the saut sea ill be gane before ye win there  you are mistaen said jeanie it is no sae far and they go to it by land i learned something about thae things from reuben butler  ah

small room she obeyed his signal but not without trembling  whats the fule thing shaking for said he i mean nothing but civility to you dn me i respect you and i cant help it you have so much spunk that dn me but i think theres some chance of your carrying the day but you must not go to the king till you have made some friend try the duketry maccallummore hes scotlands friendi ken that the great

to that argyle that suffered in my fathers timein the persecution  his son or grandson im thinking said ratcliffe but what o that  thank god said jeanie devoutly clasping her hands  you whigs are aye thanking god for something said the ruffian but hark ye hinny ill tell ye a secret ye may meet wi rough customers on the border or in the midland afore ye get to lunnon now deil ane o them will touch

ruffler or padder but he knows my gybe as well as the jark of eer a queer cuffin in englandand theres rogues latin for you   pass  seal  justice of peace  it was indeed totally unintelligible to jeanie deans who was only impatient to escape from him he hastily scrawled a line or two on a dirty piece of paper and said to her as she drew back when he offered it heywhat the deilit wunna bite you my lassif it does nae gude it can do nae ill but i wish you to show it if you have ony fasherie wi ony o st nicholass clerks  alas said she i do not understand what you mean  i mean if ye fall among thieves my preciousthat is a scripture phrase if ye will hae anethe bauldest of them will ken a scart o my guse feather and now awa wi yeand stick to argyle if onybody can do the job it maun be him  after casting an anxious look at the grated windows and blackened walls of the old tolbooth and another scarce less anxious at the hospitable lodging of mrs saddletree jeanie turned her back on that quarter and soon after on the city itself she reached st leonards crags without meeting any one whom she knew which in the state of her mind she considered as a great blessing i must do naething she thought as she went along that can soften or weaken my heartits ower weak already for what i hae to do i will think and act as firmly as i can and speak as little  there was an ancient servant or rather cottar of her fathers who had lived under him for many years and whose fidelity was worthy of full confidence she sent for this woman and explaining to her that the circumstances of her family required that she should undertake a journey which would detain her for some weeks from home she gave her full instructions concerning the management of the domestic concerns in her absence with a precision which upon reflection she herself could not help wondering at she described and detailed the most minute steps which were to be taken and especially such as were necessary for her fathers comfort it was probable she said that he would return to st leonards tomorrow certain that he would return very soonall must be in order for him he had eneugh to distress him without being fashed about warldly matters  in the meanwhile she toiled busily along with may hettly to leave nothing unarranged  it was deep in the night when all these matters were settled and when they had partaken of some food the first which jeanie had tasted on that eventful day may hettly whose usual residence was a cottage at a little distance from deanss house asked her young mistress whether she would not permit her to remain in the house all night ye hae had an awfu day she said and sorrow and fear are but bad companions in the watches of the night as i hae heard the gudeman say himself  they are ill companions indeed said jeanie but i maun learn to abide their presence and better begin in the house than in the field  she dismissed her aged assistant accordinglyfor so slight was the gradation in their rank of life that we can hardly term may a servantand proceeded to make a few preparations for her journey  the simplicity of her education and country made these preparations very brief and easy her tartan screen served all the purposes of a ridinghabit and of an umbrella a small bundle contained such changes of linen as were absolutely necessary barefooted as sancho says she had come into the world and barefooted she proposed to perform her pilgrimage and her clean shoes and change of snowwhite thread stockings were to be reserved for special occasions of ceremony she was not aware that the english habits of comfort attach an idea of abject misery to the idea of a barefooted traveller and if the objection of cleanliness had been made to the practice she would have been apt to vindicate herself upon the very frequent ablutions to which with mahometan scrupulosity a scottish damsel of some condition usually subjects herself thus far therefore all was well  from an oaken press or cabinet in which her father kept a few old books and two or three bundles of papers besides his ordinary accounts and receipts she sought out and extracted from a parcel of notes of sermons calculations of interest records of dying speeches of the martyrs and the like one or two documents which she thought might be of some use to her upon her mission but the most important difficulty remained behind and it had not occurred to her until that very evening it was the want of money without which it was impossible she could undertake so distant a journey as she now meditated  david deans as we have said was easy and even opulent in his circumstances but his wealth like that of the patriarchs of old consisted in his kine and herds and in two or three sums lent out at interest to neighbours or relatives who far from being in circumstances to pay anything to account of the principal sums thought they did all that was incumbent on them when with considerable difficulty they discharged the annual rent to these debtors it would be in vain therefore to apply even with her fathers concurrence nor could she hope to obtain such concurrence or assistance in any mode without such a series of explanations and debates as she felt might deprive her totally of the power of taking the step which however daring and hazardous she felt was absolutely necessary for trying the last chance in favour of her sister without departing from filial reverence jeanie had an inward conviction that the feelings of her father however just and upright and honourable were too little in unison with the spirit of the time to admit of his being a good judge of the measures to be adopted in this crisis herself more flexible in manner though no less upright in principle she felt that to ask his consent to her pilgrimage would be to encounter the risk of drawing down his positive prohibition and under that she believed her journey could not be blessed in its progress and event accordingly she had determined upon the means by which she might communicate to him her undertaking and its purpose shortly after her actual departure but it was impossible to apply to him for money without altering this arrangement and discussing fully the propriety of her journey pecuniary assistance from that quarter therefore was laid out of the question  it now occurred to jeanie that she should have consulted with mrs saddletree on this subject but besides the time that must now necessarily be lost in recurring to her assistance jeanie internally revolted from it her heart acknowledged the goodness of mrs saddletrees general character and the kind interest she took in their family misfortunes but still she felt that mrs saddletree was a woman of an ordinary and worldly way of thinking incapable from habit and temperament of taking a keen or enthusiastic view of such a resolution as she had formed and to debate the point with her and to rely upon her conviction of its propriety for the means of carrying it into execution would have been gall and wormwood  butler whose assistance she might have been assured of was greatly poorer than herself in these circumstances she formed a singular resolution for the purpose of surmounting this difficulty the execution of which will form the subject of the next chapter      chapter second             tis the voice of the sluggard ive heard him complain           you have waked me too soon i must slumber again              as the door on its hinges so he on his bed            turns his side and his shoulders and his heavy head                                            dr watts  the mansionhouse of dumbiedikes to which we are now to introduce our readers lay three or four milesno matter for the exact topographyto the southward of st leonards it had once borne the appearance of some little celebrity for the auld laird whose humours and pranks were often mentioned in the alehouses for about a mile round it wore a sword kept a good horse and a brace of greyhounds brawled swore and betted at cockfights and horsematches followed somerville of drums hawks and the lord rosss hounds and called himself point devise a gentleman but the line had been veiled of its splendour in the present proprietor who cared for no rustic amusements and was as saying timid and retired as his father had been at once grasping and selfishly extravagantdaring wild and intrusive  dumbiedikes was what is called in scotland a single house that is having only one room occupying its whole depth from back to front each of which single apartments was illuminated by six or eight cross lights whose diminutive panes and heavy frames permitted scarce so much light to enter as shines through one wellconstructed modern window this inartificial edifice exactly such as a child would build with cards had a steep roof flagged with coarse grey stones instead of slates a halfcircular turret battlemented or to use the appropriate phrase bartizand on the top served as a case for a narrow turnpike stair by which an ascent was gained from storey to storey and at the bottom of the said turret was a door studded with largeheaded nails there was no lobby at the bottom of the tower and scarce a landingplace opposite to the doors which gave access to the apartments one or two low and dilapidated outhouses connected by a courtyard wall equally ruinous surrounded the mansion the court had been paved but the flags being partly displaced and partly renewed a gallant crop of docks and thistles sprung up between them and the small garden which opened by a postern through the wall seemed not to be in a much more orderly condition over the lowarched gateway which led into the yard there was a carved stone exhibiting some attempt at armorial bearings and above the inner entrance hung and had hung for many years the mouldering hatchment which announced that umquhile laurence dumbie of dumbiedikes had been gathered to his fathers in newbattle kirkyard the approach to this palace of pleasure was by a road formed by the rude fragments of stone gathered from the fields and it was surrounded by ploughed but unenclosed land upon a baulk that is an unploughed ridge of land interposed among the corn the lairds trusty palfrey was tethered by the head and picking a meal of grass the whole argued neglect and discomfort the consequence however of idleness and indifference not of poverty  in this inner court not without a sense of bashfulness and timidity stood jeanie deans at an early hour in a fine spring morning she was no heroine of romance and therefore looked with some curiosity and interest on the mansionhouse and domains of which it might at that moment occur to her a little encouragement such as women of all ranks know by instinct how to apply might have made her mistress moreover she was no person of taste beyond her time rank and country and certainly thought the house of dumbiedikes though inferior to holyrood house or the palace at dalkeith was still a stately structure in its way and the land a very bonny bit if it were better seen to and done to but jeanie deans was a plain truehearted honest girl who while she acknowledged all the splendour of her old admirers habitation and the value of his property never for a moment harboured a thought of doing the laird butler or herself the injustice which many ladies of higher rank would not have hesitated to do to all three on much less temptation  her present errand being with the laird she looked round the offices to see if she could find any domestic to announce that she wished to see him as all was silence she ventured to open one doorit was the old lairds dogkennel now deserted unless when occupied as one or two tubs seemed to testify as a washinghouse she tried anotherit was the rootless shed where the hawks had been once kept as appeared from a perch or two not yet completely rotten and a lure and jesses which were mouldering on the wall a third door led to the coalhouse which was well stocked to keep a very good fire was one of the few points of domestic management in which dumbiedikes was positively active in all other matters of domestic economy he was completely passive and at the mercy of his housekeeperthe same buxom dame whom his father had long since bequeathed to his charge and who if fame did her no injustice had feathered her nest pretty well at his expense  jeanie went on opening doors like the second calender wanting an eye in the castle of the hundred obliging damsels until like the said prince errant she came to a stable the highland pegasus rory bean to which belonged the single entire stall was her old acquaintance whom she had seen grazing on the baulk as she failed not to recognise by the wellknown ancient riding furniture and demipique saddle which half hung on the walls half trailed on the litter beyond the treviss which formed one side of the stall stood a cow who turned her head and lowed when jeanie came into the stable an appeal which her habitual occupations enabled her perfectly to understand and with which she could not refuse complying by shaking down some fodder to the animal which had been neglected like most things else in the castle of the sluggard  while she was accommodating the milky mother with the food which she should have received two hours sooner a slipshod wench peeped into the stable and perceiving that a stranger was employed in discharging the task which she at length and reluctantly had quitted her slumbers to perform ejaculated  eh sirs the brownie the brownie and fled yelling as if she had seen the devil  to explain her terror it may be necessary to notice that the old house of dumbiedikes had according to report been long haunted by a brownie one of those familiar spirits who were believed in ancient times to supply the deficiencies of the ordinary labourer   whirl the long mop and ply the airy flail  certes the convenience of such a supernatural assistance could have been nowhere more sensibly felt than in a family where the domestics were so little disposed to personal activity yet this serving maiden was so far from rejoicing in seeing a supposed aerial substitute discharging a task which she should have long since performed herself that she proceeded to raise the family by her screams of horror uttered as thick as if the brownie had been flaying her jeanie who had immediately resigned her temporary occupation and followed the yelling damsel into the courtyard in order to undeceive and appease her was there met by mrs janet balchristie the favourite sultana of the last laird as scandal wentthe housekeeper of the present the goodlooking buxom woman betwixt forty and fifty for such we described her at the death of the last laird was now a fat redfaced old dame of seventy or thereabouts fond of her place and jealous of her authority conscious that her administration did not rest on so sure a basis as in the time of the old proprietor this considerate lady had introduced into the family the screamer aforesaid who added good features and bright eyes to the powers of her lungs she made no conquest of the laird however who seemed to live as if there was not another woman in the world but jeanie deans and to bear no very ardent or overbearing affection even to her mrs janet balchristie notwithstanding had her own uneasy thoughts upon the almost daily visits to st leonards crags and often when the laird looked at her wistfully and paused according to his custom before utterance she expected him to say jenny i am gaun to change my condition but she was relieved by jenny i am gaun to change my shoon  still however mrs balchristie regarded jeanie deans with no small portion of malevolence the customary feeling of such persons towards anyone who they think has the means of doing them an injury but she had also a general aversion to any female tolerably young and decently welllooking who showed a wish to approach the house of dumbiedikes and the proprietor thereof and as she had raised her mass of mortality out of bed two hours earlier than usual to come to the rescue of her clamorous niece she was in such extreme bad humour against all and sundry that saddletree would have pronounced that she harboured inimicitiam contra omnes mortales  wha the deil are ye said the fat dame to poor jeanie whom she did not immediately recognise scouping about a decent house at sic an hour in the morning  it was ane wanting to speak to the laird said jeanie who felt something of the intuitive terror which she had formerly entertained for this termagant when she was occasionally at dumbiedikes on business of her fathers  aneand what sort of ane are yehae ye nae namedye think his honour has naething else to do than to speak wi ilka idle tramper that comes about the town and him in his bed yet honest man  dear mrs balchristie replied jeanie in a submissive tone dye no mind medye no mind jeanie deans  jeanie deans said the termagant in accents affecting the utmost astonishment then taking two strides nearer to her she peered into her face with a stare of curiosity equally scornful and malignanti say jeanie deans indeedjeanie deevil they had better hae caed yea bonny spot o wark your tittie and you hae made out murdering ae puir wean and your light limmer of a sisters to be hanged fort as weel she deservesand the like o you to come to ony honest mans house and want to be into a decent bachelor gentlemans room at this time in the morning and him in his bedgae wa gae wa  jeanie was struck mute with shame at the unfeeling brutality of this accusation and could not even find words to justify herself from the vile construction put upon her visit when mrs balchristie seeing her advantage continued in the same tone come come bundle up your pipes and tramp awa wi yeye may be seeking a father to another wean for ony thing i ken if it warna that your father auld david deans had been a tenant on our land i would cry up the menfolk and hae ye dookit in the burn for your impudence  jeanie had already turned her back and was walking towards the door of the courtyard so that mrs balchristie to make her last threat impressively audible to her had raised her stentorian voice to its utmost pitch but like many a general she lost the engagement by pressing her advantage too far  the laird had been disturbed in his morning slumbers by the tones of mrs balchristies objurgation sounds in themselves by no means uncommon but very remarkable in respect to the early hour at which they were now heard he turned himself on the other side however in hopes the squall would blow by when in the course of mrs balchristies second explosion of wrath the name of deans distinctly struck the tympanum of his ear as he was in some degree aware of the small portion of benevolence with which his housekeeper regarded the family at st leonards he instantly conceived that some message from thence was the cause of this untimely ire and getting out of his bed he slipt as speedily as possible into an old brocaded nightgown and some other necessary garments clapped on his head his fathers goldlaced hat for though he was seldom seen without it yet it is proper to contradict the popular report that he slept in it as don quixote did in his helmet and opening the window of his bedroom beheld to his great astonishment the wellknown figure of jeanie deans herself retreating from his gate while his housekeeper with arms akimbo fist clenched and extended body erect and head shaking with rage sent after her a volley of billingsgate oaths his choler rose in proportion to the surprise and perhaps to the disturbance of his repose hark ye he exclaimed from the window ye auld limb of satanwha the deil gies you commission to guide an honest mans daughter that gate  mrs balchristie was completely caught in the manner she was aware from the unusual warmth with which the laird expressed himself that he was quite serious in this matter and she knew that with all his indolence of nature there were points on which he might be provoked and that being provoked he had in him something dangerous which her wisdom taught her to fear accordingly she began therefore to retract her false step as fast as she could she was but speaking for the houses credit and she couldna think of disturbing his honour in the morning sae early when the young woman might as weel wait or call again and to be sure she might make a mistake between the twa sisters for ane o them wasna sae creditable an acquaintance  haud your peace ye auld jade said dumbiedikes the warst quean eer stude in their shoon may ca you cousin an a be true that i have

whose walks were of a very circumscribed diameterye maun never think o thatcome in by  i canna do that laird replied jeanie the twa words i have to say to ye i can say here forby that mrs balchristie

necessity of entering upon her business that i was gaun a lang journey outby of my fathers knowledge  outby his knowledge jeanieis that right ye maun think ot againits no right said dumbiedikes with a countenance of great concern  if i were ance at lunnon said jeanie in exculpation i am amaist sure i could get means to speak to the queen about my sisters life  lunnonand the queenand her sisters

maun unless ye wad lend me a small sum to pay my expenseslittle thing will do it and ye ken my fathers a man of substance and wad see nae man far less you laird come to loss by me  dumbiedikes on comprehending the nature of this application could scarce trust his earshe made no answer whatever but stood with his eyes rivetted on the ground  i see ye are no for assisting me laird said jeanie sae fare ye weeland gang and see my poor father as aften as ye canhe will be lonely eneugh now  where is the silly bairn gaun said dumbiedikes and laying hold of her hand he led her into the house its no that i didna think ot before he said but it stack in my throat  thus speaking to himself he led her into an oldfashioned parlour shut the door behind them and fastened it with a bolt while jeanie surprised at this manoeuvre remained as near the door as possible the laird quitted her hand and pressed upon a spring lock fixed in an oak panel in the wainscot which instantly slipped aside an iron strongbox was discovered in a recess of the wall he opened this also and pulling out two or three drawers showed that they were filled with leathern bags full of gold and silver coin  this is my bank jeanie lass he said looking first at her and then at the treasure with an air of great complacencynane o your goldsmiths bills for methey bring folk to ruin  then suddenly changing his tone he resolutely saidjeanie i will make ye lady dumbiedikes afore the sun sets and ye may ride to lunnon in your ain coach if ye like  na laird said jeanie that can never bemy fathers griefmy sisters

your hearts ower fu take what siller will serve ye and let it be when ye come back againas gude syne as sune  but laird said jeanie who felt the necessity of being explicit with so extraordinary a lover i like another man better than you and i canna marry ye  another man better than me jeanie said dumbiedikes how is that possible its no possible womanye hae kend me sae lang  ay but laird said jeanie with persevering simplicity i hae kend him langer  langer its no possible exclaimed the poor laird it canna be ye were born on the land o jeanie woman ye haena lookitye haena seen the half o

chamber of deasoh jeanie gang up the stair and look at them   illustration jeanie and the laird of dumbiedykesfrontispiece   but jeanie held fast her integrity though beset with temptations which perhaps the laird of dumbiedikes did not greatly err in supposing were those most affecting to her sex  it canna be lairdi have said itand i canna break my word till him if ye wad gie me the haill barony of dalkeith and lugton into the bargain  your word to him said the laird somewhat pettishly but wha is he jeaniewha is hei haena heard his name yetcome now jeanie ye are but queering usi am no trowing that there is sic a ane in the warldye are but making fashionwhat is hewha is he  just reuben butler thats schulemaster at liberton said jeanie  reuben butler reuben butler echoed the laird of dumbiedikes pacing the apartment in high disdainreuben butler the dominie at libertonand a dominie depute tooreuben the son of my cottarvery weel jeanie lass wilfu woman will hae her wayreuben butler he hasna in his pouch the value o the auld black coat he wearsbut it disna signify and as he spoke he shut successively and with vehemence the drawers of his treasury a fair offer jeanie is nae cause of feudae man may bring a horse to the water but twenty winna gar him drinkand as for wasting my substance on other folks joes  there was something in the last hint that nettled jeanies honest pride i was begging nane frae your honour she said least of a on sic a score as ye pit it ongude morning to ye sir ye hae been kind to my father and it isna in my heart to think otherwise than kindly of you  so saying she left the room without listening to a faint but jeaniejeaniestay woman and traversing the courtyard with a quick step she set out on her forward journey her bosom glowing with that natural indignation and shame which an honest mind feels at having subjected itself to ask a favour which had been unexpectedly refused when out of the lairds ground and once more upon the public road her pace slackened her anger cooled and anxious anticipations of the consequence of this unexpected disappointment began to influence her with other feelings must she then actually beg her way to london for such seemed the alternative or must she turn back and solicit her father for money and by doing so lose time which was precious besides the risk of encountering his positive prohibition respecting the journey yet she saw no medium between these alternatives and while she walked slowly on was still meditating whether it were not better to return  while she was thus in an uncertainty she heard the clatter of a horses hoofs and a wellknown voice calling her name she looked round and saw advancing towards her on a pony whose bare back and halter assorted ill with the nightgown slippers and laced cockedhat of the rider a cavalier of no less importance than dumbiedikes himself in the energy of his pursuit he had overcome even the highland obstinacy of rory bean and compelled that selfwilled palfrey to canter the way his rider chose which rory however performed with all the symptoms of reluctance turning his head and accompanying every bound he made in advance with a sidelong motion which indicated his extreme wish to turn rounda manoeuvre which nothing but the constant exercise of the lairds heels and cudgel could possibly have counteracted  when the laird came up with jeanie the first words he uttered werejeanie they say ane shouldna aye take a woman at her first word  ay but ye maun take me at mine laird said jeanie looking on the ground and walking on without a pausei hae but ae word to bestow on ony body and thats aye a true ane  then said dumbiedikes at least ye suldna aye take a man at his first word ye maunna gang this wilfu gate sillerless come ot what likehe put a purse into her hand i wad gie you rory too but hes as wilfu as yoursell and hes ower weel used to a gate that maybe he and i hae gaen ower aften and hell gang nae road else  but laird said jeanie though i ken my father will satisfy every penny of this siller whatever theres ot yet i wadna like to borrow it frae ane that maybe thinks of something mair than the paying ot back again  theres just twentyfive guineas ot said dumbiedikes with a gentle sigh and whether your father pays or disna pay i make ye free tillt without another word gang where ye likedo what ye likeand marry a the butlers in the country gin ye likeand sae gude morning to you jeanie  and god bless you laird wi mony a gude morning said jeanie her heart more softened by the unwonted generosity of this uncouth character than perhaps butler might have approved had he known her feelings at that moment and comfort and the lords peace and the peace of the world be with you if we suld never meet again  dumbiedikes turned and waved his hand and his pony much more willing to return than he had been to set out hurried him homeward so fast that wanting the aid of a regular bridle as well as of saddle and stirrups he was too much puzzled to keep his seat to permit of his looking behind even to give the parting glance of a forlorn swain i am ashamed to say that the sight of a lover ran away with in nightgown and slippers and a laced hat by a barebacked highland pony had something in it of a sedative even to a grateful and deserved burst of affectionate esteem the figure of dumbiedikes was too ludicrous not to confirm jeanie in the original sentiments she entertained towards him  hes a gude creature said she and a kindits a pity he has sae willyard a powny and she immediately turned her thoughts to the important journey which she had commenced reflecting with pleasure that according to her habits of life and of undergoing fatigue she was now amply or even superfluously provided with the means of encountering the expenses of the road up and down from london and all other expenses whatever       chapter third                       what strange and wayward thoughts will slide                          into a lovers head                      o mercy to myself i cried                         if lucy should be dead                                               wordsworth  in pursuing her solitary journey our heroine soon after passing the house of dumbiedikes gained a little eminence from which on looking to the eastward down a prattling brook whose meanders were shaded with straggling widows and alder trees she could see the cottages of woodend and beersheba the haunts and habitation of her early life and could distinguish the common on which she had so often herded sheep and the recesses of the rivulet where she had pulled rushes with butler to plait crowns and sceptres for her sister effie then a beautiful but spoiled child of about three years old the recollections which the scene brought with them were so bitter that had she indulged them she would have sate down and relieved her heart with tears  but i kend said jeanie when she gave an account of her pilgrimage that greeting would do but little good and that it was mair beseeming to thank the lord that had showed me kindness and countenance by means of a man that mony cad a nabal and churl but wha was free of his gudes to me as ever the fountain was free of the stream and i minded the scripture about the sin of israel at meribah when the people murmured although moses had brought water from the dry rock that the congregation might drink and live sae i wad not trust mysell with another look at puir woodend for the very blue reek that came out of the lumhead pat me in mind of the change of market days with us  in this resigned and christian temper she pursued her journey until she was beyond this place of melancholy recollections and not distant from the village where butler dwelt which with its oldfashioned church and steeple rises among a tuft of trees occupying the ridge of an eminence to the south of edinburgh at a quarter of a miles distance is a clumsy square tower the residence of the laird of liberton who in former times with the habits of the predatory chivalry of germany is said frequently to have annoyed the city of edinburgh by intercepting the supplies and merchandise which came to the town from the southward  this village its tower and its church did not lie precisely in jeanies road towards england but they were not much aside from it and the village was the abode of butler she had resolved to see him in the beginning of her journey because she conceived him the most proper person to write to her father concerning her resolution and her hopes there was probably another reason latent in her affectionate bosom she wished once more to see the object of so early and so sincere an attachment before commencing a pilgrimage the perils of which she did not disguise from herself although she did not allow them so to press upon her mind as to diminish the strength and energy of her resolution a visit to a lover from a young person in a higher rank of life than jeanies would have had something forward and improper in its character but the simplicity of her rural habits was unacquainted with these punctilious ideas of decorum and no notion therefore of impropriety crossed her imagination as setting out upon a long journey she went to bid adieu to an early friend  there was still another motive that pressed upon her mind with additional force as she approached the village she had looked anxiously for butler in the courthouse and had expected that certainly in some part of that eventful day he would have appeared to bring such countenance and support as he could give to his old friend and the protector of his youth even if her own claims were laid aside  she know indeed that he was under a certain degree of restraint but she still had hoped that he would have found means to emancipate himself from it at least for one day in short the wild and wayward thoughts which wordsworth has described as rising in an absent lovers imagination suggested as the only explanation of his absence that butler must be very ill and so much had this wrought on her imagination that when she approached the cottage where her lover occupied a small apartment and which had been pointed out to her by a maiden with a milkpail on her head she trembled at anticipating the answer she might receive on inquiring for him  her fears in this case had indeed only hit upon the truth butler whose constitution was naturally feeble did not soon recover the fatigue of body and distress of mind which he had suffered in consequence of the tragical events with which our narrative commenced the painful idea that his character was breathed on by suspicion was an aggravation to his distress  but the most cruel addition was the absolute prohibition laid by the magistrates on his holding any communication with deans or his family it had unfortunately appeared likely to them that some intercourse might be again attempted with that family by robertson through the medium of butler and this they were anxious to intercept or prevent if possible the measure was not meant as a harsh or injurious severity on the part of the magistrates but in butlers circumstances it pressed cruelly hard he felt he must be suffering under the bad opinion of the person who was dearest to him from an imputation of unkind desertion the most alien to his nature  this painful thought pressing on a frame already injured brought on a succession of slow and lingering feverish attacks which greatly impaired his health and at length rendered him incapable even of the sedentary duties of the school on which his bread depended fortunately old mr whackbairn who was the principal teacher of the little parochial establishment was sincerely attached to butler besides that he was sensible of his merits and value as an assistant which had greatly raised the credit of his little school the ancient pedagogue who had himself been tolerably educated retained some taste for classical lore and would gladly relax after the drudgery of the school was over by conning over a few pages of horace or juvenal with his usher a similarity of taste begot kindness and accordingly he saw butlers increasing debility with great compassion roused up his own energies to teaching the school in the morning hours insisted upon his assistants reposing himself at that period and besides supplied him with such comforts as the patients situation required and his own means were inadequate to compass  such was butlers situation scarce able to drag himself to the place where his daily drudgery must gain his daily bread and racked with a thousand fearful anticipations concerning the fate of those who were dearest to him in the world when the trial and condemnation of effie deans put the copestone upon his mental misery  he had a particular account of these events from a fellowstudent who resided in the same village and who having been present on the melancholy occasion was able to place it in all its agony of horrors before his excruciated imagination that sleep should have visited his eyes after such a curfewnote was impossible a thousand dreadful visions haunted his imagination all night and in the morning he was awaked from a feverish slumber by the only circumstance which could have added to his distressthe visit of an intrusive ass  this unwelcome visitant was no other than bartoline saddletree the worthy and sapient burgher had kept his appointment at maccroskies with plumdamas and some other neighbours to discuss the duke of argyles speech the justice of effie deanss condemnation and the improbability of her obtaining a reprieve this sage conclave disputed high and drank deep and on the next morning bartoline felt as he expressed it as if his head was like a confused progress of writs  to bring his reflective powers to their usual serenity saddletree resolved to take a mornings ride upon a certain hackney which he plumdamas and another honest shopkeeper combined to maintain by joint subscription for occasional jaunts for the purpose of business or exercise as saddletree had two children boarded with whackbairn and was as we have seen rather fond of butlers society he turned his palfreys head towards liberton and came as we have already said to give the unfortunate usher that additional vexation of which imogene complains so feelingly when she says                        im sprighted with a fool                      sprighted and angerd worse  if anything could have added gall to bitterness it was the choice which saddletree made of a subject for his prosing harangues being the trial of effie deans and the probability of her being executed every word fell on butlers ear like the knell of a deathbell or the note of a screechowl  jeanie paused at the door of her lovers humble abode upon hearing the loud and pompous tones of saddletree sounding from the inner apartment credit me it will be sae mr butler brandy cannot save her she maun gang down the bow wi the lad in the pioted coat at her heels   the executioner in livery of black or dark grey and silver likened by low wit to a magpie  i am sorry for the lassie but the law sir maun hae its course                                vivat rex                               currat lex  as the poet has it in whilk of horaces odes i know not  here butler groaned in utter impatience of the brutality and ignorance which bartoline had contrived to amalgamate into one sentence but saddletree like other prosers was blessed with a happy obtuseness of perception concerning the unfavourable impression which he sometimes made on his auditors he proceeded to deal forth his scraps of legal knowledge without mercy and concluded by asking butler with great selfcomplacency was it na a pity my father didna send me to utrecht havena i missed the chance to turn out as clarissimus an ictus as auld grunwiggin himselfwhatfor dinna ye speak mr butler wad i no hae been a clarissimus ictuseh man  i really do not understand you mr saddletree said butler thus pushed hard for an answer his faint and exhausted tone of voice was instantly drowned in the sonorous bray of bartoline  no understand me man ictus is latin for a lawyer is it not  not that ever i heard of answered butler in the same dejected tone  the deil ye didnasee man i got the word but this morning out of a memorial of mr crossmyloofssee there it is ictus clarissimus et pertiperitissimusits a latin for its printed in the italian types  o you mean jurisconsultusictus is an abbreviation for jurisconsultus  dinna tell me man persevered saddletree theres nae abbreviates except in adjudications and this is a about a servitude of waterdrapthat is to say tillicidian maybe yell say thats no latin neither in mary kings close in the high street   he meant probably stillicidium  very likely said poor butler overwhelmed by the noisy perseverance of his visitor iam not able to dispute with you  few folk arefew folk are mr butler though i say it that shouldna say it returned bartoline with great delight now it will be twa hours yet or yere wanted in the schule and as ye are no weel ill sit wi you to divert ye and explain tye the nature of a tillicidian ye maun ken the petitioner mrs crombie a very decent woman is a friend of mine and i hae stude her friend in this case and brought her wi credit into the court and i doubtna that in due time she will win out ot wi credit win she or lose she ye see being an inferior tenement or laigh house we grant ourselves to be burdened wi the tillicide that is that we are obligated to receive the natural waterdrap of the superior tenement sae far as the same fas frae the heavens or the roof of our neighbours house and from thence by the gutters or eaves upon our laigh tenement but the other night comes a highland quean of a lass and she flashes god kens what out at the eastmost window of mrs macphails house thats the superior tenement i believe the auld women wad hae agreed for luckie macphail sent down the lass to tell my friend mrs crombie that she had made the gardyloo out of the wrang window out of respect for twa highlandmen that were speaking gaelic in the close below the right ane but luckily for mrs crombie i just chanced to come in in time to break aff the communing for its a pity the point suldna be tried we had mrs macphail into the tenmark courtthe hieland limmer of a lass wanted to swear herself freebut haud ye there says i  the detailed account of this important suit might have lasted until poor butlers hour of rest was completely exhausted had not saddletree been interrupted by the noise of voices at the door the woman of the house where butler lodged on returning with her pitcher from the well whence she had been fetching water for the family found our heroine jeanie deans standing at the door impatient of the prolix harangue of saddletree yet unwilling to enter until he should have taken his leave  the good woman abridged the period of hesitation by inquiring was ye wanting the gudeman or me lass  i wanted to speak with mr butler if hes at leisure replied jeanie  gang in by then my woman answered the goodwife and opening the door of a room she announced the additional visitor with mr butler heres a lass wants to speak tye  the surprise of butler was extreme when jeanie who seldom stirred halfamile from home entered his apartment upon this annunciation  good god he said starting from his chair while alarm restored to his cheek the colour of which sickness had deprived it some new misfortune must have happened  none mr reuben but what you must hae heard ofbut oh ye are looking ill yoursellfor the hectic of a moment had not concealed from her affectionate eyes the ravages which lingering disease and anxiety of mind had made in her lovers person  no i am wellquite well said butler with eagerness if i can do anything to assist you jeanieor your father  ay to be sure said saddletree the family may be considered as limited to them twa now just as if effie had never been in the tailzie puir thing but jeanie lass what brings you out to liberton sae air in the morning and your father lying ill in the luckenbooths  i had a message frae my father to mr butler said jeanie with embarrassment but instantly feeling ashamed of the fiction to which she had resorted for her love of and veneration for truth was almost quakerlike she corrected herselfthat is to say i wanted to speak with mr butler about some business of my fathers and puir effies  is it law business said bartoline because if it be ye had better take my opinion on the subject than his  it is not just law business said jeanie who saw considerable inconvenience might arise from letting mr saddletree into the secret purpose of her journey but i want mr butler to write a letter for me  very right said mr saddletree and if yell tell me what it is about ill dictate to mr butler as mr crossmyloof does to his clerkget your pen and ink in initialibus mr butler  jeanie looked at butler and wrung her hands with vexation and impatience  i believe mr saddletree said butler who saw the necessity of getting rid of him at all events that mr whackbairn will be somewhat affronted if you do not hear your boys called up to their lessons  indeed mr butler and thats as true and i promised to ask a half playday to the schule so that the bairns might gang and see the hanging which canna but have a pleasing effect on their young minds seeing there is no knowing what they may come to themselvesodd so i didna mind ye were here jeanie deans but ye maun use yoursell to hear the matter spoken okeep jeanie here till i come back mr butler i winna bide ten minutes  and with this unwelcome assurance of an immediate return he relieved them of the embarrassment of his presence  reuben said jeanie who saw the necessity of using the interval of his absence in discussing what had brought her there i am bound on a lang journeyi am gaun to lunnon to ask effies life of the king and of the queen  jeanie you are surely not yourself answered butler in the utmost surpriseyou go to londonyou address the king and queen  and what for no reuben said jeanie with all the composed simplicity of her character its but speaking to a mortal man and woman when a is done and their hearts maun be made o flesh and blood like other folks and effies story wad melt them were they stane forby i hae heard that they are no sic bad folk as what the jacobites ca them  yes jeanie said butler but their magnificencetheir retinuethe difficulty of getting audience  i have thought of a that reuben and it shall not break my spirit nae doubt their claiths will be very grand wi their crowns on their heads and their sceptres in their hands like the great king ahasuerus when he sate upon his royal throne fornent the gate of his house as we are told in scripture but i have that within me that will keep my heart from failing and i am amaist sure that i will be strengthened to speak the errand i came for  alas alas said butler the kings nowadays do not sit in the gate to administer justice as in patriarchal times i know as little of courts as you do jeanie by experience but by reading and report i know that the king of britain does everything by means of his ministers  and if they be upright godfearing ministers said jeanie its sae muckle the better chance for effie and me  but you do not even understand the most ordinary words relating to a court said butler by the ministry is meant not clergymen but the kings official servants  nae doubt returned jeanie he maun hae a great number mair i daur to say than the duchess has at dalkeith and great folks servants are aye mair saucy than themselves but ill be decently put on and ill offer them a trifle o siller as if i came to see the palace or if they scruple that ill tell them im come on a business of life and death and then they will surely bring me to speech of the king and queen  butler shook his head o jeanie this is entirely a wild dream you can never see them but through some great lords intercession and i think it is scarce possible even then  weel but maybe i can get that too said jeanie with a little helping from you  from me jeanie this is the wildest imagination of all  ay but it is not reuben havena i heard you say that your grandfather that my father never likes to hear about did some gude langsyne to the forbear of this maccallummore when he was lord of lorn  he did so said butler eagerly and i can prove iti will write to the duke of argylereport speaks him a good kindly man as he is known for a brave soldier and true patrioti will conjure him to stand between your sister and this cruel fate there is but a poor chance of success but we will try all means  we must try all means replied jeanie but writing winna do ita letter canna look and pray and beg and beseech as the human voice can do to the human heart a letters like the music that the ladies have for their spinetsnaething but black scores compared to the same tune played or sung its word of mouth maun do it or naething reuben  you are right said reuben recollecting his firmness and i will hope that heaven has suggested to your kind heart and firm courage the only possible means of saving the life of this unfortunate girl but jeanie you must not take this most perilous journey alone i have an interest in you and i will not agree that my jeanie throws herself away you must even in the present circumstances give me a husbands right to protect you and i will go with you myself on this journey and assist you to do your duty by your family  alas reuben said jeanie in her turn this must not be a pardon will not gie my sister her fair fame again or make me a bride fitting for an honest man and an usefu minister wha wad mind what he said in the pupit that had to wife the sister of a woman that was condemned for sic wickedness  but jeanie pleaded her lover i do not believe and i cannot believe that effie has done this deed  heaven bless ye for saying sae reuben answered jeanie but she maun bear the blame ot after all  but the blame were it even justly laid on her does not fall on you  ah reuben reuben replied the young woman ye ken it is a blot that spreads to kith and kinichabodas my poor father saysthe glory is departed from our house for the poorest mans house has a glory where there are true hands a divine heart and an honest fameand the last has gane frae us a  but jeanie consider your word and plighted faith to me and would you undertake such a journey without a man to protect youand who should that protector be but your husband  you are kind and good reuben and wad take me wi a my shame i doubtna but ye canna but own that this is no time to marry or be given in marriage na if that suld ever be it maun be in another and a better seasonand dear reuben ye speak of protecting me on my journeyalas who will protect and take care of youyour very limbs tremble with standing for ten minutes on the floor how could you undertake a journey as far as lunnon  but i am strongi am well continued butler sinking in his seat totally exhausted at least i shall be quite well tomorrow  ye see and ye ken ye maun just let me depart said jeanie after a pause and then taking his extended hand and gazing kindly in his face she added its een a grief the mair to me to see you in this way but ye maun keep up your heart for jeanies sake for if she isna your wife she will never be the wife of living man and now gie me the paper for maccallummore and bid god speed me on my way  there was something of romance in jeanies venturous resolution yet on consideration as it seemed impossible to alter it by persuasion or to give her assistance but by advice butler after some farther debate put into her hands the paper she desired which with the musterroll in which it was folded up were the sole memorials of the stout and enthusiastic bible butler his grandfather while butler sought this document jeanie had time to take up his pocket bible i have marked a scripture she said as she again laid it down with your kylevine pen that will be useful to us baith and ye maun tak the trouble reuben to write a this to my father for god help me i have neither head nor hand for lang letters at ony time forby now and i trust him entirely to you and i trust you will soon be permitted to see him and reuben when ye do win to the speech o him mind a the auld mans bits o ways for jeanies sake and

maunna speak mair about her for i maunna take leave o ye wi the tear in my ee for that wouldna be cannygod bless ye reuben  to avoid so ill an omen she left the room hastily while her features yet retained the mournful and affectionate smile which she had compelled them to wear in order to support butlers spirits  it seemed as if the power of sight of speech and of reflection had left him as she disappeared from the room which she had entered and retired from so like an apparition saddletree who entered immediately afterwards overwhelmed him with questions which he answered without understanding them and with legal disquisitions which conveyed to him no iota of meaning at length the learned burgess recollected that there was a baron court to be held at loanhead that day and though it was hardly worth while he might as weel go to see if there was onything doing as he was acquainted with the baron bailie who was a decent man and would be glad of a word of legal advice  so soon as he departed butler flew to the bible the last book which jeanie had touched to his extreme surprise a paper containing two or three pieces of gold dropped from the book with a blacklead pencil she had marked the sixteenth and twentyfifth verses of the thirtyseventh psalma little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of the wickedi have been young and am now old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  deeply impressed with the affectionate delicacy which shrouded its own generosity under the cover of a providential supply to his wants he pressed the gold to his lips with more ardour than ever the metal was greeted with by a miser to emulate her devout firmness and confidence seemed now the pitch of his ambition and his first task was to write an account to david deans of his daughters resolution and journey southward he studied every sentiment and even every phrase which he thought could reconcile the old man to her extraordinary resolution the effect which this epistle produced will be hereafter adverted to butler committed it to the charge of an honest clown who had frequent dealings with deans in the sale of his dairy produce and who readily undertook a journey to edinburgh to put the letter into his own hands   by dint of assiduous research i am enabled to certiorate the reader that the name of this person was saunders broadfoot and that he dealt in the wholesome commodity called kirnmilk anglice buttermilk j c      chapter fourth                         my native land good night                                       lord byron  in the present day a journey from edinburgh to london is a matter at once safe brief and simple however inexperienced or unprotected the traveller numerous coaches of different rates of charge and as many packets are perpetually passing and repassing betwixt the capital of britain and her northern sister so that the most timid or indolent may execute such a journey upon a few hours notice but it was different in 1737 so slight and infrequent was the intercourse betwixt london and edinburgh that men still alive remember that upon one occasion the mail from the former city arrived at the general postoffice in scotland with only one letter in it   the fact is certain the single epistle was addressed to the principal director of the british linen company  the usual mode of travelling was by means of posthorses the traveller occupying one and his guide another in which manner by relays of horses from stage to stage the journey might be accomplished in a wonderfully short time by those who could endure fatigue to have the bones shaken to pieces by a constant change of those hacks was a luxury for the richthe poor were under the necessity of using the mode of conveyance with which nature had provided them  with a strong heart and a frame patient of fatigue jeanie deans travelling at the rate of twenty miles aday and sometimes farther traversed the southern part of scotland and advanced as far as durham  hitherto she had been either among her own countryfolk or those to whom her bare feet and tartan screen were objects too familiar to attract much attention but as she advanced she perceived that both circumstances exposed her to sarcasm and taunts which she might otherwise have escaped and although in her heart she thought it unkind and inhospitable to sneer at a passing stranger on account of the fashion of her attire yet she had the good sense to alter those parts of her dress which attracted illnatured observation her chequed screen was deposited carefully in her bundle and she conformed to the national extravagance of wearing shoes and stockings for the whole day she confessed afterwards that besides the wastrife it was lang or she could walk sae comfortably with the shoes as without them but there was often a bit saft heather by the roadside and that helped her weel on the want of the screen which was drawn over the head like a veil she supplied by a bongrace as she called it a large straw bonnet like those worn by the english maidens when labouring in the fields but i thought unco shame o mysell she said the first time i put on a married womans bongrace and me a single maiden  with these changes she had little as she said to make her kenspeckle when she didna speak but her accent and language drew down on her so many jests and gibes couched in a worse patois by far than her own that she soon found it was her interest to talk as little and as seldom as possible she answered therefore civil salutations of chance passengers with a civil courtesy and chose with anxious circumspection such places of repose as looked at once most decent and sequestered she found the common people of england although inferior in courtesy to strangers such as was then practised in her own more unfrequented country yet upon the whole by no means deficient in the real duties of hospitality she readily obtained food and shelter and protection at a very moderate rate which sometimes the generosity of mine host altogether declined with a blunt apologythee hast a long way afore thee lass and ise neer take penny out o a single womans purse its the best friend thou can have on the road  it often happened too that mine hostess was struck with the tidy nice scotch body and procured her an escort or a cast in a waggon for some part of the way or gave her a useful advice and recommendation respecting her restingplaces  at york our pilgrim stopped for the best part of a day partly to recruit her strengthpartly because she had the good luck to obtain a lodging in an inn kept by a countrywomanpartly to indite two letters to her father and reuben butler an operation of some little difficulty her habits being by no means those of literary composition that to her father was in the following words  dearest fatheri make my present pilgrimage more heavy and burdensome through the sad occasion to reflect that it is without your knowledge which god knows was far contrary to my heart for scripture says that the vow of the daughter should not be binding without the consent of the father wherein it may be i have been guilty to tak this wearie journey without your consent nevertheless it was borne in upon my mind that i should be an instrument to help my poor sister in this extremity of needcessity otherwise i wad not for wealth or for worlds gear or for the haill lands of dakeith and lugton have done the like o this without your free will and knowledge oh dear father as ye wad desire a blessing on my journey and upon your household speak a word or write a line of comfort to yon poor prisoner if she has sinned she has sorrowed and suffered and ye ken better than me that we maun forgie others as we pray to be forgien dear father forgive my saying this muckle for it doth not become a young head to instruct grey hairs but i am sae far frae ye that my heart yearns to ye a and fain wad i hear that ye had forgien her trespass and sae i nae doubt say mair than may become me the folk here are civil and like the barbarians unto the holy apostle hae shown me much kindness and there are a sort of chosen people in the land for they hae some kirks without organs that are like ours and are called meetinghouses where the minister preaches without a gown but most of the country are prelatists whilk is awfu to think and i saw twa men that were ministers following hunds as bauld as roslin or driden the young laird of loupthedike or ony wild gallant in lothian a sorrowfa sight to behold oh dear father may a blessing be with your downlying and uprising and remember in your prayers your affectionate daughter to command                                                       jean deans  a postscript bore i learned from a decent woman a graziers widow that they hae a cure for the muirill in cumberland whilk is ane pint as they cat of yill whilk is a dribble in comparison of our gawsie

down your spleuchanfu anes a year and as she must be well kend in lunnon i doubt not easily to find out where she lives  being seduced into betraying our heroines confidence thus far we will stretch our communication a step beyond and impart to the reader her letter to her lover  mr reuben butlerhoping this will find you better this comes to say that i have reached this great town safe and am not wearied with walking but the better for it and i have seen many things which i trust to tell you one day also the muckle kirk of this place and all around the city are mills whilk havena muckle wheels nor milldams but gang by the windstrange to behold ane miller asked me to gang in and see it work but i wad not for i am not come to the south to make acquaintance with strangers i keep the straight road and just beck if onybody speaks to me ceevilly and answers naebody with the tong but women of my ain sect i wish mr butler i kend onything that wad mak ye weel for they hae mair medicines in this town of york than wad cure a scotland and surely some of them wad be gude for your complaints if ye had a kindly motherly body to nurse ye and no to let ye waste yoursell wi readingwhilk ye read mair than eneugh wi the bairns in the schuleand to gie ye warm milk in the morning i wad be mair easy for ye dear mr butler keep a good heart for we are in the hands of ane that kens better what is gude for us than we ken what is for oursells i hae nae doubt to do that for which i am comei canna doubt iti winna think to doubt itbecause if i haena full assurance how shall i bear myself with earnest entreaties in the great folks presence but to ken that anes purpose is right and to make their heart strong is the way to get through the warst days darg the bairns rime says the warst blast of the borrowing days couldna kill the three silly poor hoglams   the last three days of march old style are called the borrowing days for as they are remarked to be unusually stormy it is feigned that march had borrowed them from april to extend the sphere of his rougher sway the rhyme on the subject is quoted in the glossary to leydens edition of the complaynt of scotland                 march said to aperill                    i see three hogs upon a hill                 a young sheep before it has lost its first fleece                    but when the borrowed days were gane                 the three silly hogs came hirplin hame  and if it be gods pleasure we that are sindered in sorrow may meet again in joy even on this hither side of jordan i dinna bid ye mind what i said at our partin anent my poor father and that misfortunate lassie for i ken you will do sae for the sake of christian charity whilk is mair than the entreaties of her that is your servant to command                                                      jeanie deans  this letter also had a postscript dear reuben if ye think that it wad hae been right for me to have said mair and kinder things to ye just think that i hae written sae since i am sure that i wish a that is kind and right to ye and by ye ye will think i am turned waster for i wear clean hose and shoon every day but its the fashion here for decent bodies and ilka land has its ain landlaw ower and aboon a if laughing days were eer to come back again till us ye wad laugh weel to see my round face at the far end of a strae bongrace that looks as muckle and round as the middell aisle in libberton kirk but it sheds the sun weel aff and keeps uncivil folk frae staring as if ane were a worrycow i sall tell ye by writ how i come on wi the duke of argyle when i won up to lunnon direct a line to say how ye are to me to the charge of mrs margaret glass tobacconist at the sign of the thistle lunnon whilk if it assures me of your health will make my mind sae muckle easier excuse bad spelling and writing as i have ane ill pen  the orthography of these epistles may seem to the southron to require a better apology than the letter expresses though a bad pen was the excuse of a certain galwegian laird for bad spelling but on behalf of the heroine i would have them to know that thanks to the care of butler jeanie deans wrote and spelled fifty times better than half the women of rank in scotland at that period whose strange orthography and singular diction form the strongest contrast to the good sense which their correspondence usually intimates  for the rest in the tenor of these epistles jeanie expressed perhaps more hopes a firmer courage and better spirits than she actually felt but this was with the amiable idea of relieving her father and lover from apprehensions on her account which she was sensible must greatly add to their other troubles if they think me weel and like to do weel said the poor pilgrim to herself my father will be kinder to effie and butler will be kinder to himself for i ken weel that they will think mair o me than i do o mysell  accordingly she sealed her letters carefully and put them into the postoffice with her own hand after many inquiries concerning the time in which they were likely to reach edinburgh when this duty was performed she readily accepted her landladys pressing invitation to dine with her and remain till the next morning the hostess as we have said was her countrywoman and the eagerness with which scottish people meet communicate and to the extent of their power assist each other although it is often objected to us as a prejudice and narrowness of sentiment seems on the contrary to arise from a most justifiable and honourable feeling of patriotism combined with a conviction which if undeserved would long since have been confuted by experience that the habits and principles of the nation are a sort of guarantee for the character of the individual at any rate if the extensive influence of this national partiality be considered as an additional tie binding man to man and calling forth the good offices of such as can render them to the countryman who happens to need them we think it must be found to exceed as an active and efficient motive to generosity that more impartial and wider principle of general benevolence which we have sometimes seen pleaded as an excuse for assisting no individual whatever  mrs bickerton lady of the ascendant of the seven stars in the castlegate york was deeply infected with the unfortunate prejudices of her country indeed she displayed so much kindness to jeanie deans because she herself being a merse woman marched with midlothian in which jeanie was born showed such motherly regard to her and such anxiety for her farther progress that jeanie thought herself safe though by temper sufficiently cautious in communicating her whole story to her  mrs bickerton raised her hands and eyes at the recital and exhibited much wonder and pity but she also gave some effectual good advice  she required to know the strength of jeanies purse reduced by her deposit at liberton and the necessary expense of her journey to about fifteen pounds this she said would do very well providing she would carry it a safe to london  safe answered jeanie ise warrant my carrying it safe bating the needful expenses  ay but highwaymen lassie said mrs bickerton for ye are come into a more civilised that is to say a more roguish country than the north and how ye are to get forward i do not profess to know if ye could wait here eight days our waggons would go up and i would recommend you to joe broadwheel who would see you safe to the swan and two necks and dinna sneeze at joe if he should be for drawing up wi you continued mrs bickerton her acquired english mingling with her national or original dialect hes a handy boy and a wanter and no lad better thought o on the road and the english make good husbands enough witness my poor man moses bickerton as is i the kirkyard  jeanie hastened to say that she could not possibly wait for the setting forth of joe broadwheel being internally by no means gratified with the idea of becoming the object of his attention during the journey  aweel lass answered the good landlady then thou must pickle in thine ain pokenook and buckle thy girdle thine ain gate but take my advice and hide thy gold in thy stays and keep a piece or two and some silver in case thou best spoke withal for theres as wud lads haunt within a days walk from hence as on the braes of doune in perthshire and lass thou maunna gang staring through lunnon asking wha kens mrs glass at the sign o the thistle marry they would laugh thee to scorn but gang thou to this honest man and she put a direction into jeanies hand he kens maist part of the sponsible scottish folk in the city and he will find out your friend for thee  jeanie took the little introductory letter with sincere thanks but something alarmed on the subject of the highway robbers her mind recurred to what ratcliffe had mentioned to her and briefly relating the circumstances which placed a document so extraordinary in her hands she put the paper he had given her into the hand of mrs bickerton  the lady of the seven stars did not indeed ring a bell because such was not the fashion of the time but she whistled on a silver call which was hung by her side and a tight servingmaid entered the room  tell dick ostler to come here said mrs bickerton  dick ostler accordingly made his appearancea queer knowing shambling animal with a hatchetface a squint a gamearm and a limp  dick ostler said mrs bickerton in a tone of authority that showed she was at least by adoption yorkshire too thou knowest most people and most things o the road  eye eye god help me mistress said dick shrugging his shoulders betwixt a repentant and a knowing expressioneye i ha knowd a thing or twa i ma day mistress he looked sharp and laughedlooked grave and sighed as one who was prepared to take the matter either way  kenst thou this wee bit paper amang the rest man said mrs bickerton handing him the protection which ratcliffe had given jeanie deans  when dick had looked at the paper he winked with one eye extended his grotesque mouth from ear to ear like a navigable canal scratched his head powerfully and then said kenaymaybe we ken summat an it werena for harm to him mistress  none in the world said mrs bickerton only a dram of hollands to thyself man an thou wilt speak  why then said dick giving the headband of his breeches a knowing hoist with one hand and kicking out one foot behind him to accommodate the adjustment of that important habiliment i dares to say the pass will be kend weel eneugh on the road an that be all  but what sort of a lad was he said mrs bickerton winking to jeanie as proud of her knowing ostler  why what ken ijim the ratwhy he was cock o the north within this twelmonthhe and scotch wilson handle dandie as they called himbut hes been out o this country a while as i rackon but ony gentleman as keeps the road o this side stamford will respect jims pass  without asking farther questions the landlady filled dick ostler a bumper of hollands he ducked with his head and shoulders scraped with his more advanced hoof bolted the alcohol to use the learned phrase and withdrew to his own domains  i would advise thee jeanie said mrs bickerton an thou meetest with ugly customers o the road to show them this bit paper for it will serve thee assure thyself  a neat little supper concluded the evening the exported scotswoman mrs bickerton by name ate heartily of one or two seasoned dishes drank some sound old ale and a glass of stiff negus while she gave jeanie a history of her gout admiring how it was possible that she whose fathers and mothers for many generations had been farmers in lammermuir could have come by a disorder so totally unknown to them jeanie did not choose to offend her friendly landlady by speaking her mind on the probable origin of this complaint but she thought on the fleshpots of egypt and in spite of all entreaties to better fare made her evening meal upon vegetables with a glass of fair water  mrs bickerton assured her that the acceptance of any reckoning was entirely out of the question furnished her with credentials to her correspondent in london and to several inns upon the road where she had some influence or interest reminded her of the precautions she should adopt for concealing her money and as she was to depart early in the morning took leave of her very affectionately taking her word that she would visit her on her return to scotland and tell her how she had managed and that summum bonum for a gossip all how and about it this jeanie faithfully promised     chapter fifth                and need and misery vice and danger bind               in sad alliance each degraded mind  as our traveller set out early on the ensuing morning to prosecute her journey and was in the act of leaving the innyard dick ostler who either had risen early or neglected to go to bed either circumstance being equally incident to his calling hollowed out after herthe top of the morning to you moggie have a care o gunderby hill young one robin hoods dead and gwone but there be takers yet in the vale of bever jeanie looked at him as if to request a farther explanation but with a leer a shuffle and a shrug inimitable unless by emery dick turned again to the rawboned steed which he was currying and sung as he employed the comb and brush                 robin hood was a yeoman right good                     and his bow was of trusty yew                 and if robin said stand on the kings lealand                     pray why should not we say so too   john emery an eminent comedian played successfully at covent garden theatre between 1798 and 1820 among his characters were those of dandie dinmont in guy mannering dougal in rob roy and ratcliffe in the heart of midlothian  jeanie pursued her journey without farther inquiry for there was nothing in dicks manner that inclined her to prolong their conference a painful days journey brought her to ferrybridge the best inn then and since upon the great northern road and an introduction from mrs bickerton added to her own simple and quiet manners so propitiated the landlady of the swan in her favour that the good dame procured her the convenient accommodation of a pillion and posthorse then returning to tuxford so that she accomplished upon the second day after leaving york the longest journey she had yet made she was a good deal fatigued by a mode of travelling to which she was less accustomed than to walking and it was considerably later than usual on the ensuing morning that she felt herself able to resume her pilgrimage at noon the hundredarmed trent and the blackened ruins of newark castle demolished in the great civil war lay before her it may easily be supposed that jeanie had no curiosity to make antiquarian researches but entering the town went straight to the inn to which she had been directed at ferrybridge while she procured some refreshment she observed the girl who brought it to her looked at her several times with fixed and peculiar interest and at last to her infinite surprise inquired if her name was not deans and if she was not a scotchwoman going to london upon justice business jeanie with all her simplicity of character had some of the caution of her country and according to scottish universal custom she answered the question by another requesting the girl would tell her why she asked these questions  the maritornes of the saracens head newark replied two women had passed that morning who had made inquiries after one jeanie deans travelling to london on such an errand and could scarce be persuaded that she had not passed on  much surprised and somewhat alarmed for what is inexplicable is usually alarming jeanie questioned the wench about the particular appearance of these two women but could only learn that the one was aged and the other young that the latter was the taller and that the former spoke most and seemed to maintain an authority over her companion and that both spoke with the scottish accent  this conveyed no information whatever and with an indescribable presentiment of evil designed towards her jeanie adopted the resolution of taking posthorses for the next stage in this however she could not be gratified some accidental circumstances had occasioned what is called a run upon the road and the landlord could not accommodate her with a guide and horses after waiting some time in hopes that a pair of horses that had gone southward would return in time for her use she at length feeling ashamed at her own pusillanimity resolved to prosecute her journey in her usual manner  it was all plain road she was assured except a high mountain called gunnerby hill about three miles from grantham which was her stage for the night  im glad to hear theres a hill said jeanie for baith my sight and my very feet are weary o sic tracts o level groundit looks a the way between this and york as if a the land had been trenched and levelled whilk is very wearisome to my scotch een when i lost sight of a muckle blue hill they ca ingleboro i thought i hadna a friend left in this strange land  as for the matter of that young woman said mine host an you be so fond o hill i carena an thou couldst carry gunnerby away with thee in thy lap for its a murder to posthorses but heres to thy journey and mayst thou win well through it for thou is a bold and a canny lass  so saying he took a powerful pull at a solemn tankard of homebrewed ale  i hope there is nae bad company on the road sir said jeanie  why when its clean without them ill thatch groby pool wi pancakes but there arena sae mony now and since they hae lost jim the rat they hold together no better than the men of marsham when they lost their common take a drop ere thou goest he concluded offering her the tankard thou wilt get naething at night save grantham gruel nine grots and a gallon of water  jeanie courteously declined the tankard and inquired what was her lawing  thy lawing heaven help thee wench what cast thou that  it isi was wanting to ken what was to pay replied jeanie  pay lord help theewhy nought womanwe hae drawn no liquor but a gill o beer and the saracens head can spare a mouthful o meat to a stranger like o thee that cannot speak christian language so heres to thee once more the same again quoth mark of bellgrave and he took another profound pull at the tankard  the travellers who have visited newark more lately will not fail to remember the remarkably civil and gentlemanly manners of the person who now keeps the principal inn there and may find some amusement in contrasting them with those of his more rough predecessor but we believe it will be found that the polish has worn off none of the real worth of the metal  taking leave of her lincolnshire gaius jeanie resumed her solitary walk and was somewhat alarmed when evening and twilight overtook her in the open ground which extends to the foot of gunnerby hill and is intersected with patches of copse and with swampy spots the extensive commons on the north road most of which are now enclosed and in general a relaxed state of police exposed the traveller to a highway robbery in a degree which is now unknown except in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis aware of this circumstance jeanie mended her pace when she heard the trampling of a horse behind and instinctively drew to one side of the road as if to allow as much room for the rider to pass as might be possible when the animal came up she found that it was bearing two women the one placed on a sidesaddle the other on a pillion behind her as may still occasionally be seen in england  a braw goodnight to ye jeanie deans said the foremost female as the horse passed our heroine what think ye o yon bonny hill yonder lifting its brow to the moon trow ye yons the gate to heaven that ye are sae fain ofmaybe we will win there the night yet god sain us though our minny heres rather dreigh in the upgang  the speaker kept changing her seat in the saddle and half stopping the horse as she brought her body round while the woman that sate behind her on the pillion seemed to urge her on in words which jeanie heard but imperfectly  hand your tongue ye moonraised b what is your business with  or with heaven or hell either  troth mither no muckle wi heaven i doubt considering wha i carry ahint meand as for hell it will fight its ain battle at its ain time ise be boundcome naggie trot awa man an as thou wert a broomstick for a witch rides thee        with my curtch on my foot and my shoe on my hand       i glance like the wildfire through brugh and through land  the tramp of the horse and the increasing distance drowned the rest of her song but jeanie heard for some time the inarticulate sounds ring along the waste  our pilgrim remained stupified with undefined apprehensions the being named by her name in so wild a manner and in a strange country without farther explanation or communing by a person who thus strangely flitted forward and disappeared before her came near to the supernatural sounds in comus               the airy tongues which syllable mens names              on sands and shores and desert wildernesses  and although widely different in features deportment and rank from the lady of that enchanting masque the continuation of the passage may be happily applied to jeanie deans upon this singular alarm                these thoughts may startle well but not astound               the virtuous mind that ever walks attended               by a strong siding championconscience  in fact it was with the recollection of the affectionate and dutiful errand on which she was engaged her right if such a word could be applicable to expect protection in a task so meritorious she had not advanced much farther with a mind calmed by these reflections when she was disturbed by a new and more instant subject of terror two men who had been lurking among some copse started up as she advanced and met her on the road in a menacing manner stand and deliver said one of them a short stout fellow in a smockfrock such as are worn by waggoners  the woman said the other a tall thin figure does not understand the words of actionyour money my precious or your life  i have but very little money gentlemen said poor jeanie tendering that portion which she had separated from her principal stock and kept apart for such an emergency but if you are resolved to have it to be sure you must have it  this wont do my girl dn me if it shall pass said the shorter ruffian do ye think gentlemen are to hazard their lives on the road to be cheated in this way well have every farthing you have got or we will strip you to the skin curse me  his companion who seemed to have something like compassion for the horror which jeanies countenance now expressed said no no tom this is one of the precious sisters and well take her word for once without putting her to the stripping proofhark ye my lass if ye look up to heaven and say this is the last penny you have about ye why hang it well let you pass  i am not free answered jeanie to say what i have about me gentlemen for theres life and death depends on my journey but if you leave me as much as finds me bread and water ill be satisfied and thank you and pray for you  dn your prayers said the shorter fellow thats a coin that wont pass with us and at the same time made a motion to seize her  stay gentlemen ratcliffes pass suddenly occurring to her perhaps you know this paper  what the devil is she after now frank said the more savage ruffiando you look at it for dn me if i could read it if it were for the benefit of my clergy  this is a jark from jim ratcliffe said the taller having looked at the bit of paper the wench must pass by our cutters law  i say no answered his companion rat has left the lay and turned bloodhound they say  we may need a good turn from him all the same said the taller ruffian again  but what are we to do then said the shorter manwe promised you know to strip the wench and send her begging back to her own beggarly country and now you are for letting her go on  i did not say that said the other fellow and whispered to his companion who replied be alive about it then and dont keep chattering till some travellers come up to nab us  you must follow us off the road young woman said the taller  for the love of god exclaimed jeanie as you were born of woman dinna ask me to leave the road rather take all i have in the world  what the devil is the wench afraid of said the other fellow i tell you you shall come to no harm but if you will not leave the road and come with us dn me but ill beat your brains out where you stand  thou art a rough bear tom said his companionan ye touch her ill give ye a shake by the collar shall make the leicester beans rattle in thy gutsnever mind him girl i will not allow him to lay a finger on you if you walk quietly on with us but if you keep jabbering there dn me but ill leave him to settle it with you  this threat conveyed all that is terrible to the imagination of poor jeanie who saw in him that was of milder mood her only protection from the most brutal treatment she therefore not only followed him but even held him by the sleeve lest he should escape from her and the fellow hardened as he was seemed something touched by these marks of confidence and repeatedly assured her that he would suffer her to receive no harm  they conducted their prisoner in a direction leading more and more from the public road but she observed that they kept a sort of track or bypath which relieved her from part of her apprehensions which would have been greatly increased had they not seemed to follow a determined and ascertained route after about halfanhours walking all three in profound silence they approached an old barn which stood on the edge of some cultivated ground but remote from everything like a habitation it was itself however tenanted for there was light in the windows  one of the footpads scratched at the door which was opened by a female and they entered with their unhappy prisoner an old woman who was preparing food by the assistance of a stifling fire of lighted charcoal asked them in the name of the devil what they brought the wench there for and why they did not strip her and turn her abroad on the common  come come mother blood said the tall man well do whats right to oblige you and well do no more we are bad enough but not such as you would make usdevils incarnate  she has got a jark from jim ratcliffe said the short fellow and frank here wont hear of our putting her through the mill  no that i will not by gd answered frank but if old mother blood could keep her here for a little while or send her back to scotland without hurting her why i see no harm in thatnot i  ill tell you what frank levitt said the old woman if you call me mother blood again ill paint this gully and she held a knife up as if about to make good her threat in the best blood in your body my bonny boy  the price of ointment must be up in the north said frank that puts mother blood so much out of humour  without a moments hesitation the fury darted her knife at him with the vengeful dexterity of a wild indian as he was on his guard he avoided the missile by a sudden motion of his head but it whistled past his ear and stuck deep in the clay wall of a partition behind  come come mother said the robber seizing her by both wrists i shall teach you whos master and so saying he forced the hag backwards by main force who strove vehemently until she sunk on a bunch of straw and then letting go her hands he held up his finger towards her in the menacing posture by which a maniac is intimidated by his keeper it appeared to produce the desired effect for she did not attempt to rise from the seat on which he had placed her or to resume any measures of actual violence but wrung her withered hands with impotent rage and brayed and howled like a demoniac  i will keep my promise with you you old devil said frank the wench shall not go forward on the london road but i will not have you touch a hair of her head if it were but for your insolence  this intimation seemed to compose in some degree the vehement passion of the old hag and while her exclamations and howls sunk into a low maundering growling tone of voice another personage was added to this singular party  eh frank levitt said this newcomer who entered with a hop step and jump which at once conveyed her from the door into the centre of the party were ye killing our mother or were ye cutting the grunters weasand that tam brought in this morning or have ye been reading your prayers backward to bring up my auld acquaintance the deil amang ye  the tone of the speaker was so particular that jeanie immediately recognised the woman who had rode foremost of the pair which passed her just before she met the robbers a circumstance which greatly increased her terror as it served to show that the mischief designed against her was premeditated though by whom or for what cause she was totally at a loss to conjecture from the style of her conversation the reader also may probably acknowledge in this female an old acquaintance in the earlier part of our narrative  out ye mad devil said tom whom she had disturbed in the middle of a draught of some liquor with which he had found means of accommodating himself betwixt your bess of bedlam pranks and your dams frenzies a man might live quieter in the devils ken than hereand he again resumed the broken jug out of which he had been drinking  and whas this ot said the mad woman dancing up to jeanie deans who although in great terror yet watched the scene with a resolution to let nothing pass unnoticed which might be serviceable in assisting her to escape or informing her as to the true nature of her situation and the danger attending itwhas this ot again exclaimed madge wildfire  douce davie deans the auld doited whig bodys daughter in a gipsys barn and the night setting in this is a sight for sair eeneh sirs the falling off o the godlyand the tother sisters in the tolbooth of edinburgh i am very sorry for her for my shareits my mother wusses ill to her and no methough maybe i hae as muckle cause  hark ye madge said the taller ruffian you have not such a touch of the devils blood as the hag your mother who may be his dam for what i knowtake this young woman to your kennel and do not let the devil enter though he should ask in gods name  ou ay that i will frank said madge taking hold of jeanie by the arm and pulling her along for its no for decent christian young leddies like her and me to be keeping the like o you and tyburn tam company at this time o night sae gudeeen tye sirs and mony o them and may ye a sleep till the hangman wauken ye and then it will be weel for the country  she then as her wild fancy seemed suddenly to prompt her walked demurely towards her mother who seated by the charcoal fire with the reflection of the red light on her withered and distorted features marked by every evil passion seemed the very picture of hecate at her infernal rites and suddenly dropping on her knees said with the manner of a six years old child mammie hear me say my prayers before i go to bed and say god bless my bonny face as ye used to do lang syne  the deil flay the hide o it to sole his brogues wi said the old lady aiming a buffet at the supplicant in answer to her duteous request  the blow missed madge who being probably acquainted by experience with the mode in which her mother was wont to confer her maternal benedictions slipt out of arms length with great dexterity and quickness the hag then started up and seizing a pair of old firetongs would have amended her motion by beating out the brains either of her daughter or jeanie she did not seem greatly to care which when her hand was once more arrested by the man whom they called frank levitt who seizing her by the shoulder flung her from him with great violence exclaiming what mother damnableagain and in my sovereign presencehark ye madge of bedlam get to your hole with your playfellow or we shall have the devil to pay here and nothing to pay him with  madge took levitts advice retreating as fast as she could and dragging jeanie along with her into a sort of recess partitioned off from the rest of the barn and filled with straw from which it appeared that it was intended for the purpose of slumber the moonlight shone through an open hole upon a pillion a packsaddle and one or two wallets the travelling furniture of madge and her amiable mothernow saw ye eer in your life said madge sae dainty a chamber of deas see as the moon shines down sae caller on the fresh strae theres no a pleasanter cell in bedlam for as braw a place as it is on the outsidewere ye ever in bedlam  no answered jeanie faintly appalled by the question and the way in which it was put yet willing to soothe her insane companion being in circumstances so unhappily precarious that even the society of this gibbering madwoman seemed a species of protection  never in bedlam said madge as if with some surprisebut yell hae been in the cells at edinburgh  never repeated jeanie  weel i think thae daft carles the magistrates send naebody to bedlam but methae maun hae an unco respect for me for whenever i am brought to them thae aye hae me back to bedlam but troth jeanie she said this in a very confidential tone to tell ye my private mind about it i think ye are at nae great loss for the keepers a crosspatch and he maun hae it a his ain gate to be sure or he makes the place waur than hell i often tell him hes the daftest in a the housebut

the other robber but what the country will say to us tomorrow when they see him in such quartersgo tom and bring him in and avoid the soft ground my lad leave no hooftrack behind you  i think you give me always the fag of it whatever is to be done grumbled his companion  leap laurence youre long enough said the other and the fellow left the barn accordingly without farther remonstrance  in the meanwhile madge had arranged herself for repose on the straw but still in a halfsitting posture with her back resting against the door of the hovel which as it opened inwards was in this manner kept shut by the weight of the person  theres mair shifts by stealing jeanie said madge wildfire though whiles i can hardly get our mother to think sae wha wad hae thought but mysell of making a bolt of my ain backbane but its no sae strong as thae that i hae seen in the tolbooth at edinburgh the hammermen of edinburgh are to my mind afore the warld for making stancheons ringbolts fetterbolts bars and locks and they arena that bad at girdles for carcakes neither though the cuross hammermen have the gree for that my mother had ance a bonny cuross girdle and i thought to have baked carcakes on it for my puir wean thats dead and gane nae fair waybut we maun a dee ye ken jeanieyou cameronian bodies ken that brawlies and yere for making a hell upon earth that ye may be less unwillin to part wi it but as touching bedlam that ye were speaking about ise neer recommend it muckle the tae gate or the other be it rightbe it wrang but ye ken what the sang says and pursuing the unconnected and floating wanderings of her mind she sung aloud                      in the bonny cells of bedlam                         ere i was aneandtwenty                     i had hempen bracelets strong                        and merry whips dingdong                     and prayer and fasting plenty  weel jeanie i am something herse the night and i canna sing muckle mair and troth i think i am gaun to sleep  she drooped her head on her breast a posture from which jeanie who would have given the world for an opportunity of quiet to consider the means and the probability of her escape was very careful not to disturb her after nodding however for a minuteor two with her eyes halfclosed the unquiet and restless spirit of her malady again assailed madge she raised her head and spoke but with a lowered tone which was again gradually overcome by drowsiness to which the fatigue of a days journey on horseback had probably given unwonted occasioni dinna ken what makes me sae sleepyi amaist never sleep till my bonny lady moon gangs till her bedmair by token when shes at the full ye ken rowing aboon us yonder in her grand silver coachi have danced to her my lane sometimes for very joyand whiles dead folk came and danced wi methe like o jock porteous or ony body i had kend when i was livingfor ye maun ken i was ance dead mysell here the poor maniac sung in a low and wild tone                   my banes are buried in yon kirkyard                         sae far ayont the sea                   and it is but my blithesome ghaist                         thats speaking now to thee  but after a jeanie my woman naebody kens weel whas living and whas deador whas gone to fairylandtheres another question whiles i think my puir bairns deadye ken very weel its buriedbut that signifies naething i have had it on my knee a hundred times and a hundred till that since it was buriedand how could that be were it dead ye kenits merely impossibleand here some conviction halfovercoming the reveries of her imagination she burst into a fit of crying and ejaculation waes me waes me waes me till at length she moaned and sobbed herself into a deep sleep which was soon intimated by her breathing hard leaving jeanie to her own melancholy reflections and observations      chapter sixth                  bind her quickly or by this steel                ill tell although i truss for company                                        fletcher  the imperfect light which shone into the window enabled jeanie to see that there was scarcely any chance of making her escape in that direction for the aperture was high in the wall and so narrow that could she have climbed up to it she might well doubt whether it would have permitted her to pass her body through it an unsuccessful attempt to escape would be sure to draw down worse treatment than she now received and she therefore resolved to watch her opportunity carefully ere making such a perilous effort for this purpose she applied herself to the ruinous clay partition which divided the hovel in which she now was from the rest of the waste barn it was decayed and full of cracks and chinks one of which she enlarged with her fingers cautiously and without noise until she could obtain a plain view of the old hag and the taller ruffian whom they called levitt seated together beside the decayed fire of charcoal and apparently engaged in close conference she was at first terrified by the sight for the features of the old woman had a hideous cast of hardened and inveterate malice and illhumour and those of the man though naturally less unfavourable were such as corresponded well with licentious habits and a lawless profession  but i remembered said jeanie my worthy fathers tales of a winter evening how he was confined with the blessed martyr mr james renwick who lifted up the fallen standard of the true reformed kirk of scotland after the worthy and renowned daniel cameron our last blessed bannerman had fallen among the swords of the wicked at airsmoss and how the very hearts of the wicked malefactors and murderers whom they were confined withal were melted like wax at the sound of their doctrine and i bethought mysell that the same help that was wi them in their strait wad be wi me in mine an i could but watch the lords time and opportunity for delivering my feet from their snare and i minded the scripture of the blessed psalmist whilk he insisteth on as weel in the fortysecond as in the fortythird psalmwhy art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god  strengthened in a mind naturally calm sedate and firm by the influence of religious confidence this poor captive was enabled to attend to and comprehend a great part of an interesting conversation which passed betwixt those into whose hands she had fallen notwithstanding that their meaning was partly disguised by the occasional use of cant terms of which jeanie knew not the import by the low tone in which they spoke and by their mode of supplying their broken phrases by shrugs and signs as is usual amongst those of their disorderly profession  the man opened the conversation by saying now dame you see i am true to my friend i have not forgot that you planked a chury which helped me through the bars of the castle of york and i came to do your work without asking questions for one good turn deserves another   concealed a knife  but now that madge who is as loud as tom of lincoln is somewhat still and this same tyburn neddie is shaking his heels after the old nag why you must tell me what all this is about and whats to be donefor dn me if i touch the girl or let her be touched and she with jim rats pass too  thou art an honest lad frank answered the old woman but een too good for thy trade thy tender heart will get thee into trouble i will see ye gang up holborn hill backward and a on the word of some silly loon that could never hae rapped to ye had ye drawn your knife across his weasand  you may be balked there old one answered the robber i have known many a pretty lad cut short in his first summer upon the road because he was something hasty with his flats and sharps besides a man would fain live out his two years with a good conscience so tell me what all this is about and whats to be done for you that one can do decently  why you must know frankbut first taste a snap of right hollands she drew a flask from her pocket and filled the fellow a large bumper which he pronounced to be the right thingyou must know then frankwunna ye mend your hand again offering the flask  no nowhen a woman wants mischief from you she always begins by filling you drunk dn all dutch courage what i do i will do soberlyill last the longer for that too  well then you must know resumed the old woman without any further attempts at propitiation that this girl is going to london  here jeanie could only distinguish the word sister  the robber answered in a louder tone fair enough that and what the devil is your business with it  business enough i think if the bqueers the noose that silly cull will marry her  and who cares if he does said the man  who cares ye donnard neddie i care and i will strangle her with my own hands rather than she should come to madges preferment  madges preferment does your old blind eyes see no farther than that if he is as you say dye think hell ever marry a mooncalf like madge ecod thats a good onemarry madge wildfireha ha ha  hark ye ye crackrope padder born beggar and bred thief replied the hag suppose he never marries the wench is that a reason he should marry another and that other to hold my daughters place and she crazed and i a beggar and all along of him but i know that of him will hang himi know that of him will hang him if he had a thousand livesi know that of him will hanghanghang him  she grinned as she repeated and dwelt upon the fatal monosyllable with the emphasis of a vindictive fiend  then why dont you hanghanghang him said frank repeating her words contemptuously there would be more sense in that than in wreaking yourself here upon two wenches that have done you and your daughter no ill  no ill answered the old womanand he to marry this jailbird if ever she gets her foot loose  but as there is no chance of his marrying a bird of your brood i cannot for my soul see what you have to do with all this again replied the robber shrugging his shoulders where there is aught to be got ill go as far as my neighbours but i hate mischief for mischiefs sake  and would you go nae length for revenge said the hagfor revengethe sweetest morsel to the mouth that over was cooked in hell  the devil may keep it for his own eating then said the robber for hang me if i like the sauce he dresses it with  revenge continued the old woman why it is the best reward the devil gives us for our time here and hereafter i have wrought hard for iti have suffered for itand i have sinned for itand i will have itor there is neither justice in heaven or in hell  levitt had by this time lighted a pipe and was listening with great composure to the frantic and vindictive ravings of the old hag he was too much hardened by his course of life to be shocked with themtoo indifferent and probably too stupid to catch any part of their animation or energy but mother he said after a pause still i say that if revenge is your wish you should take it on the young fellow himself  i wish i could she said drawing in her breath with the eagerness of a thirsty person while mimicking the action of drinkingi wish i couldbut noi cannoti cannot  and why notyou would think little of peaching and hanging him for this scotch affairrat me one might have milled the bank of england and less noise about it  i have nursed him at this withered breast answered the old woman folding her hands on her bosom as if pressing an infant to it and though he has proved an adder to methough he has been the destruction of me and minethough he has made me company for the devil if there be a devil and food for hell if there be such a place yet i cannot take his lifeno i cannot she continued with an appearance of rage against herself i have thought of iti have tried itbut francis levitt i canna gang through witna nahe was the first bairn i ever nurstill i had beenand man can never ken what woman feels for the bairn she has held first to her bosom  to be sure said levitt we have no experience but mother they say you hant been so kind to other bairns as you call them that have come in your waynay dn me never lay your hand on the whittle for i am captain and leader here and i will have no rebellion  the hag whose first motion had been upon hearing the question to grasp the haft of a large knife now unclosed her hand stole it away from the weapon and suffered it to fall by her side while she proceeded with a sort of smilebairns ye are joking ladwha wad touch bairns madge puir thing had a misfortune wi aneand the totherhere her voice sunk so much that jeanie though anxiously upon the watch could not catch a word she said until she raised her tone at the conclusion of the sentenceso madge in her daffin threw it into the norlock i trow  madge whose slumbers like those of most who labour under mental malady had been short and were easily broken now made herself heard from her place of repose  indeed mother thats a great lie for i did nae sic thing  hush thou hellicat devil said her motherby heaven the other wench will be waking too  that may be dangerous said frank and he rose and followed meg murdockson across the floor  rise said the hag to her daughter or i sall drive the knife between the planks into the bedlam back of thee  apparently she at the same time seconded her threat by pricking her with the point of a knife for madge with a faint scream changed her place and the door opened   illustration jennie in the outlaws hut80   the old woman held a candle in one hand and a knife in the other levitt appeared behind her whether with a view of preventing or assisting her in any violence she might meditate could not be well guessed jeanies presence of mind stood her friend in this dreadful crisis she had resolution enough to maintain the attitude and manner of one who sleeps profoundly and to regulate even her breathing notwithstanding the agitation of instant terror so as to correspond with her attitude  the old woman passed the light across her eyes and although jeanies fears were so powerfully awakened by this movement that she often declared afterwards that she thought she saw the figures of her destined murderers through her closed eyelids she had still the resolution to maintain the feint on which her safety perhaps depended  levitt looked at her with fixed attention he then turned the old woman out of the place and followed her himself having regained the outward apartment and seated themselves jeanie heard the highwayman say to her no small relief shes as fast as if she were in bedfordshirenow old meg dn me if i can understand a glim of this story of yours or what good it will do you to hang the one wench and torment the other but rat me i will be true to my friend and serve ye the way ye like it i see it will be a bad job but i do think i could get her down to surfleet on the wash and so on board tom moonshines neat lugger and keep her out of the way three or four weeks if that will please yebut dn me if any one shall harm her unless they have a mind to choke on a brace of blue plumsits a cruel bad job and i wish you and it meg were both at the devil  never mind hinny levitt said the old woman you are a ruffler and will have a your ain gateshe shanna gang to heaven an hour sooner for me i carena whether she live or dieits her sisteray her sister  well well say no more about it i hear tom coming in well couch a hogshead and so better had you   lay ourselves down to sleep  they retired to repose accordingly and all was silent in this asylum of iniquity  jeanie lay for a long time awake at break of day she heard the two ruffians leave the barn after whispering to the old woman for some time the sense that she was now guarded by persons of her own sex gave her some confidence and irresistible lassitude at length threw her into slumber  when the captive awakened the sun was high in heaven and the morning considerably advanced madge wildfire was still in the hovel which had served them for the night and immediately bid her goodmorning with her usual air of insane glee and dye ken lass said madge theres queer things chanced since ye hae been in the land of nod the constables hae been here woman and they met wi my minnie at the door and they whirld her awa to the justices about the mans wheatdear thae english churls think as muckle about a blade of wheat or grass as a scotch laird does about his maukins and his muirpoots now lass if ye like well play them a fine jink we will awa out and take a walkthey will mak unco wark when they miss us but we can easily be back by dinner time or before dark night at ony rate and it will be some frolic and fresh airbut maybe ye wad like to take some breakfast and then lie down again i ken by mysell theres whiles i can sit wi my head in my hand the haill day and havena a word to cast at a dogand other whiles that i canna sit still a moment thats when the folk think me warst but i am aye canny eneughye needna be feared to walk wi me  had madge wildfire been the most raging lunatic instead of possessing a doubtful uncertain and twilight sort of rationality varying probably from the influence of the most trivial causes jeanie would hardly have objected to leave a place of captivity where she had so much to apprehend she eagerly assured madge that she had no occasion for further sleep no desire whatever for eating and hoping internally that she was not guilty of sin in doing so she flattered her keepers crazy humour for walking in the woods  its no athegither for that neither said poor madge but i am judging ye will wun the better out o thae folks hands no that they are athegither bad folk neither but they have queer ways wi them and i whiles dinna think it has ever been weel wi my mother and me since we kept siclike company  with the haste the joy the fear and the hope of a liberated captive jeanie snatched up her little bundle followed madge into the free air and eagerly looked round her for a human habitation but none was to be seen the ground was partly cultivated and partly left in its natural state according as the fancy of the slovenly agriculturists had decided in its natural state it was waste in some places covered with dwarf trees and bushes in others swamp and elsewhere firm and dry downs or pasture grounds  jeanies active mind next led her to conjecture which way the highroad lay whence she had been forced if she regained that public road she imagined she must soon meet some person or arrive at some house where she might tell her story and request protection but after a glance around her she saw with regret that she had no means whatever of directing her course with any degree of certainty and that she was still in dependence upon her crazy companion shall we not walk upon the highroad said she to madge in such a tone as a nurse uses to coax a child its brawer walking on the road than amang thae wild bushes and whins  madge who was walking very fast stopped at this question and looked at jeanie with a sudden and scrutinising glance that seemed to indicate complete acquaintance with her purpose aha lass she exclaimed are ye gaun to guide us that gateyell be for making your heels save your head i am judging  jeanie hesitated for a moment on hearing her companion thus express herself whether she had not better take the hint and try to outstrip and get rid of her but she knew not in which direction to fly she was by no means sure that she would prove the swiftest and perfectly conscious that in the event of her being pursued and overtaken she would be inferior to the madwoman in strength she therefore gave up thoughts for the present of attempting to escape in that manner and saying a few words to allay madges suspicions she followed in anxious apprehension the wayward path by which her guide thought proper to lead her madge infirm of purpose and easily reconciled to the present scene whatever it was began soon to talk with her usual diffuseness of ideas  its a dainty thing to be in the woods on a fine morning like this i like it far better than the town for there isna a wheen duddie bairns to be crying after ane as if ane were a warlds wonder just because ane maybe is a thought bonnier and better puton than their neighboursthough jeanie ye suld never be proud o braw claiths or beauty neitherwaes me theyre but a snarei ance thought better othem and what came ot  are ye sure ye ken the way ye are taking us said jeanie who began to imagine that she was getting deeper into the woods and more remote from the highroad  do i ken the roadwasna i mony a day living here and what for shouldna i ken the road i might hae forgotten too for it was afore my accident but there are some things ane can never forget let them try it as muckle as they like  by this time they had gained the deepest part of a patch of woodland the trees were a little separated from each other and at the foot of one of them a beautiful poplar was a hillock of moss such as the poet of grasmere has described so soon as she arrived at this spot madge wildfire joining her hands above her head with a loud scream that resembled laughter flung herself all at once upon the spot and remained lying there motionless  jeanies first idea was to take the opportunity of flight but her desire to escape yielded for a moment to apprehension for the poor insane being who she thought might perish for want of relief with an effort which in her circumstances might be termed heroic she stooped down spoke in a soothing tone and endeavoured to raise up the forlorn creature she effected this with difficulty and as she placed her against the tree in a sitting posture she observed with surprise that her complexion usually florid was now deadly pale and that her face was bathed in tears notwithstanding her own extreme danger jeanie was affected by the situation of her companion and the rather that through the whole train of her wavering and inconsistent state of mind and line of conduct she discerned a general colour of kindness towards herself for which she felt gratitude  let me alanelet me alane said the poor young woman as her paroxysm of sorrow began to abatelet me alaneit does me good to weep i canna shed tears but maybe ance or twice a year and i aye come to wet this turf with them that the flowers may grow fair and the grass may be green  but what is the matter with you said jeaniewhy do you weep so bitterly  theres matter enow replied the lunaticmair than ae puir mind can bear i trow stay a bit and ill tell you a about it for i like ye jeanie deansabody spoke weel about ye when we lived in the pleasaunts and i mind aye the drink o milk ye gae me yon day when i had been on arthurs seat for fourandtwenty hours looking for the ship that somebody was sailing in  these words recalled to jeanies recollection that in fact she had been one morning much frightened by meeting a crazy young woman near her fathers house at an early hour and that as she appeared to be harmless her apprehension had been changed into pity and she had relieved the unhappy wanderer with some food which she devoured with the haste of a famished person the incident trifling in itself was at present of great importance if it should be found to have made a favourable and permanent impression in her favour on the mind of the object of her charity  yes said madge ill tell ye a about it for ye are a decent mans daughterdouce davie deans ye kenand maybe yell can teach me to find out the narrow way and the straight path for i have been burning bricks in egypt and walking through the weary wilderness of sinai for lang and mony a day but whenever i think about mine errors i am like to cover my lips for shamehere she looked up and smiledits a strange thing nowi hae spoke mair gude words to you in ten minutes than i wad speak to my mother in as mony yearsits no that i dinna think on themand whiles they are just at my tongues end but then comes the devil and brushes my lips with his black wing and lays his broad black loof on my mouthfor a black loof it is jeanieand sweeps away a my gude thoughts and dits up my gude words and pits a wheen fule sangs and idle vanities in their place  try madge said jeanietry to settle your mind and make your breast clean and youll find your heart easierjust resist the devil and he will flee from youand mind that as my worthy father tells me there is nae devil sae deceitfu as our ain wandering thoughts  and thats true too lass said madge starting up and ill gang a gate where the devil daurna follow me and its a gate that you will like dearly to gangbut ill keep a fast haud o your arm for fear apollyon should stride across the path as he did in the pilgrims progress  accordingly she got up and taking jeanie by the arm began to walk forward at a great pace and soon to her companions no small joy came into a marked path with the meanders of which she seemed perfectly acquainted jeanie endeavoured to bring her back to the confessional but the fancy was gone by in fact the mind of this deranged being resembled nothing so much as a quantity of dry leaves which may for a few minutes remain still but are instantly discomposed and put in motion by the first casual breath of air she had now got john bunyans parable into her head to the exclusion of everything else and on she went with great volubility  did ye never read the pilgrims progress and you shall be the woman christiana and i will be the maiden mercyfor ye ken mercy was of the fairer countenance and the more alluring than her companionand if i had my little messan dog here it would be greatheart their guide ye ken for he was een as bauld that he wad bark at ony thing twenty times his size and that was een the death of him for he bit corporal macalpines heels ae morning when they were hauling me to the guardhouse and corporal macalpine killed the bit faithfu thing wi his lochaber axedeil pike the highland banes o him  o fie madge said jeanie ye should not speak such words  its very true said madge shaking her head but then i maunna think o my puir bit doggie snap when i saw it lying dying in the gutter but its just as weel for it suffered baith cauld and hunger when it was living and in the grave there is rest for a thingsrest for the doggie and my puir bairn and me  your bairn said jeanie conceiving that by speaking on such a topic supposing it to be a real one she could not fail to bring her companion to a more composed temper  she was mistaken however for madge coloured and replied with some anger my bairn ay to be sure my bairn whatfor shouldna i hae a bairn and lose a bairn too as weel as your bonnie tittie the lily of st leonards  the answer struck jeanie with some alarm and she was anxious to soothe the irritation she had unwittingly given occasion to i am very sorry for your misfortune  sorry what wad ye be sorry for answered madge the bairn was a blessingthat is jeanie it wad hae been a blessing if it hadna been for my mother but my mothers a queer womanye see there was an auld carle wi a bit land and a gude clat o siller besides just the very picture of old mr feeblemind or mr readytohalt that greatheart delivered from slaygood the giant when he was rifling him and about to pick his bones for slaygood was of the nature of the flesheatersand greatheart killed giant despair toobut i am doubting giant despairs come alive again for a the story booki find him busy at my heart whiles  weel and so the auld carle said jeanie for she was painfully interested in getting to the truth of madges history which she could not but suspect was in some extraordinary way linked and entwined with the fate of her sister she was also desirous if possible to engage her companion in some narrative which might be carried on in a lower tone of voice for she was in great apprehension lest the elevated notes of madges conversation should direct her mother or the robbers in search of them  and so the auld carle said madge repeating her wordsi wish ye had seen him stoiting about aff ae leg on to the other wi a kind o dotandgoone sort o motion as if ilk ane o his twa legs had belanged to sindry folkbut gentle george could take him aff brawlyeh as i used to laugh to see george gang hiphop like himi dinna ken i think i laughed heartier then than what i do now though maybe no just sae muckle  and who was gentle george said jeanie endeavouring to bring her back to her story  o he was geordie robertson ye ken when he was in edinburgh but thats no his right name neitherhis name isbut what is your business wi his name said she as if upon sudden recollection what have ye to do asking for folks nameshave ye a mind i should scour my knife between your ribs as my mother says  as this was spoken with a menacing tone and gesture jeanie hastened to protest her total innocence of purpose in the accidental question which she had asked and madge wildfire went on somewhat pacified  never ask folks names jeanieits no civili hae seen halfadozen o folk in my mothers at ance and neer ane a them cad the ither by his name and daddie ratton says it is the most uncivil thing may be because the bailie bodies are aye asking fashions questions when ye saw sic a man or sic a man and if ye dinna ken their names ye ken there can be nae mair speerd about it  in what strange school thought jeanie to herself has this poor creature been bred up where such remote precautions are taken against the pursuits of justice what would my father or reuben butler think if i were to tell them there are sic folk in the world and to abuse the simplicity of this demented creature oh that i were but safe at hame amang mine ain leal and true people and ill bless god while i have breath that placed me amongst those who live in his fear and under the shadow of his wing  she was interrupted by the insane laugh of madge wildfire as she saw a magpie hop across the path  see therethat was the gate my auld joe used to cross the country but no just sae lightlyhe hadna wings to help his auld legs i trow but i behoved to have married him for a that jeanie or my mother wad hae been the dead o me but then came in the story of my poor bairn and my mother thought he wad be deaved wi its skirling and she pat it away in below the bit bourock of turf yonder just to be out o the gate and i think she buried my best wits with it for i have never been just mysell since and only think jeanie after my mother had been at a these pains the auld doited body johnny drottle turned up his nose and wadna hae aught to say to me but its little i care for him for i have led a merry life ever since and neer a braw gentleman looks at me but ye wad think he was gaun to drop off his horse for mere love of me i have kend some o them put their hand in their pocket and gie me as muckle as sixpence at a time just for my weelfaured face  this speech gave jeanie a dark insight into madges history she had been courted by a wealthy suitor whose addresses her mother had favoured notwithstanding the objection of old age and deformity she had been seduced by some profligate and to conceal her shame and promote the advantageous match she had planned her mother had not hesitated to destroy the offspring of their intrigue that the consequence should be the total derangement of amind which was constitutionally unsettled by giddiness and vanity was extremely natural and such was in fact the history of madge wildfires insanity     chapter seventh                so free from danger free from fear              they crossed the courtright glad they were                                             christabel  pursuing the path which madge had chosen jeanie deans observed to her no small delight that marks of more cultivation appeared and the thatched roofs of houses with their blue smoke arising in little columns were seen embosomed in a tuft of trees at some distance the track led in that direction and jeanie therefore resolved while madge continued to pursue it that she would ask her no questions having had the penetration to observe that by doing so she ran the risk of irritating her guide or awakening suspicions to the impressions of which persons in madges unsettled state of mind are particularly liable  madge therefore uninterrupted went on with the wild disjointed chat which her rambling imagination suggested a mood in which she was much more communicative respecting her own history and that of others than when there was any attempt made by direct queries or crossexaminations to extract information on these subjects  its a queer thing she said but whiles i can speak about the bit bairn and the rest of it just as if it had been another bodys and no my ain and whiles i am like to break my heart about ithad you ever a bairn jeanie  jeanie replied in the negative  ay but your sister had thoughand i ken what came ot too  in the name of heavenly mercy said jeanie forgetting the line of conduct which she had hitherto adopted tell me but what became of that unfortunate babe and  madge stopped looked at her gravely and fixedly and then broke into a great fit of laughingaha lasscatch me if you cani think its easy to gar you trow ony thinghow suld i ken onything o your sisters wean lasses suld hae naething to do wi weans till they are marriedand then a the gossips and cummers come in and feast as if it were the blithest day in the warldthey say maidens bairns are weel guided i wot that wasna true of your titties and mine but these are sad tales to telli maun just sing a bit to keep up my heartits a sang that gentle george made on me lang syne when i went with him to lockington wake to see him act upon a stage in fine clothes with the player folk he might hae dune waur than married me that night as he promisedbetter wed over the mixen as over the moor as they say in yorkshire   a homely proverb signifying better wed a neighbour than one fetched from a distancemixen signifies dunghill  he may gang

          the wildfire that flashes so fair and so free                was never so bright or so bonny as me  i like that the best o a my sangs continued the maniac because he made it i am often singing it and thats maybe the reason folk ca me madge wildfire i aye answer to the name though its no my ain for whats the use of making a fash  but ye shouldna sing upon the sabbath at least said jeanie who amid all her distress and anxiety could not help being scandalised at the deportment of her companion especially as they now approached near to the little village  ay is this sunday said madge my mother leads sic a life wi turning night into day that ane loses a count o the days o the week and disna ken sunday frae saturday besides its a your whiggeryin england folk sings when they likeand then ye ken you are christiana and i am mercyand ye ken as they went on their way they sangand she immediately raised one of john bunyans ditties                    he that is down need fear no fall                        he that is low no pride                    he that is humble ever shall                        have god to be his guide                     fulness to such a burthen is                        that go on pilgrimage                    here little and hereafter bliss                        is best from age to age  and do ye ken jeanie i think theres much truth in that book the pilgrims progress the boy that sings that song was feeding his fathers sheep in the valley of humiliation and mr greatheart says that he lived a merrier life and had more of the herb called heartsease in his bosom than they that wear silk and velvet like me and are as bonny as i am  jeanie deans had never read the fanciful and delightful parable to which madge alluded bunyan was indeed a rigid calvinist but then he was also a member of a baptist congregation so that his works had no place on david deanss shelf of divinity madge however at some time of her life had been well acquainted as it appeared with the most popular of his performances which indeed rarely fails to make a deep impression upon children and people of the lower rank  i am sure she continued i may weel say i am come out of the city of destruction for my mother is mrs batseyes that dwells at deadmans corner and frank levitt and tyburn tam they may be likened to mistrust and guilt that came galloping up and struck the poor pilgrim to the ground with a great club and stole a bag of silver which was most of his spending money and so have they done to many and will do to more but now we will gang to the interpreters house for i ken a man that will play the interpreter right weel for he has eyes lifted up to heaven the best of books in his hand the law of truth written on his lips and he stands as if he pleaded wi menoh if i had minded what he had said to me i had never been the cutaway creature that i ambut it is all over nowbut well knock at the gate and then the keeper will admit christiana but mercy will be left outand then ill stand at the door trembling and crying and then christianathats you jeaniewill intercede for me and then mercythats me ye ken will faint and then the interpreteryes the interpreter thats mr staunton himself will come out and take methats poor lost demented meby the hand and give me a pomegranate and a piece of honeycomb and a small bottle of spirits to stay my faintingand then the good times will come back again and well be the happiest folk you ever saw  in the midst of the confused assemblage of ideas indicated in this speech jeanie thought she saw a serious purpose on the part of madge to endeavour to obtain the pardon and countenance of some one whom she had offended an attempt the most likely of all others to bring them once more into contact with law and legal protection she therefore resolved to be guided by her while she was in so hopeful a disposition and act for her own safety according to circumstances  they were now close by the village one of those beautiful scenes which are so often found in merry england where the cottages instead of being built in two direct lines on each side of a dusty highroad stand in detached groups interspersed not only with large oaks and elms but with fruittrees so many of which were at this time in flourish that the grove seemed enamelled with their crimson and white blossoms in the centre of the hamlet stood the parish church and its little gothic tower from which at present was heard the sunday chime of bells  we will wait here until the folk are a in the churchthey ca the kirk a church in england jeanie be sure you mind thatfor if i was gaun forward amang them a the gaitts o boys and lasses wad be crying at madge wildfires tail the little hellrakers and the beadle would be as hard upon us as if it was our fault i like their skirting as ill as he does i can tell him im sure i often wish there was a het peat doun their throats when they set them up that gate  conscious of the disorderly appearance of her own dress after the adventure of the preceding night and of the grotesque habit and demeanour of her guide and sensible how important it was to secure an attentive and impatient audience to her strange story from some one who might have the means to protect her jeanie readily acquiesced in madges proposal to rest under the trees by which they were still somewhat screened until the commencement of service should give them an opportunity of entering the hamlet without attracting a crowd around them she made the less opposition that madge had intimated that this was not the village where her mother was in custody and that the two squires of the pad were absent in a different direction  she sate herself down therefore at the foot of an oak and by the assistance of a placid fountain which had been dammed up for the use of the villagers and which served her as a natural mirror she beganno uncommon thing with a scottish maiden of her rankto arrange her toilette in the open air and bring her dress soiled and disordered as it was into such order as the place and circumstances admitted  she soon perceived reason however to regret that she had set about this task however decent and necessary in the present time and society madge wildfire who among other indications of insanity had a most overweening opinion of those charms to which in fact she had owed her misery and whose mind like a raft upon a lake was agitated and driven about at random by each fresh impulse no sooner beheld jeanie begin to arrange her hair place her bonnet in order rub the dust from her shoes and clothes adjust her neckhandkerchief and mittans and so forth than with imitative zeal she began to bedizen and trick herself out with shreds and remnants of beggarly finery which she took out of a little bundle and which when disposed around her person made her appearance ten times more fantastic and apish than it had been before  jeanie groaned in spirit but dared not interfere in a matter so delicate across the mans cap or riding hat which she wore madge placed a broken and soiled white feather intersected with one which had been shed from the train of a peacock to her dress which was a kind of ridinghabit she stitched pinned and otherwise secured a large furbelow of artificial flowers all crushed wrinkled and dirty which had at first bedecked a lady of quality then descended to her abigail and dazzled the inmates of the servants hall a tawdry scarf of yellow silk trimmed with tinsel and spangles which had seen as hard service and boasted as honourable a transmission was next flung over one shoulder and fell across her person in the manner of a shoulderbelt or baldrick madge then stripped off the coarse ordinary shoes which she wore and replaced them by a pair of dirty satin ones spangled and embroidered to match the scarf and furnished with very high heels she had cut a willow switch in her mornings walk almost as long as a boys fishingrod this she set herself seriously to peel and when it was transformed into such a wand as the treasurer or high steward bears on public occasions she told jeanie that she thought they now looked decent as young women should do upon the sunday morning and that as the bells had done ringing she was willing to conduct her to the interpreters house  jeanie sighed heavily to think it should be her lot on the lords day and during kirk time too to parade the street of an inhabited village with so very grotesque a comrade but necessity had no law since without a positive quarrel with the madwoman which in the circumstances would have been very unadvisable she could see no means of shaking herself free of her society  as for poor madge she was completely elated with personal vanity and the most perfect satisfaction concerning her own dazzling dress and superior appearance they entered the hamlet without being observed except by one old woman who being nearly highgravel blind was only conscious that something very fine and glittering was passing by and dropped as deep a reverence to madge as she would have done to a countess this filled up the measure of madges selfapprobation she minced she ambled she smiled she simpered and waved jeanie deans forward with the condescension of a noble chaperone who has undertaken the charge of a country miss on her first journey to the capital  jeanie followed in patience and with her eyes fixed on the ground that she might save herself the mortification of seeing her companions absurdities but she started when ascending two or three steps she found herself in the churchyard and saw that madge was making straight for the door of the church as jeanie had no mind to enter the congregation in such company she walked aside from the pathway and said in a decided tone madge i will wait here till the church comes outyou may go in by yourself if you have a mind  as she spoke these words she was about to seat herself upon one of the gravestones  madge was a little before jeanie when she turned aside but suddenly changing her course she followed her with long strides and with every feature inflamed with passion overtook and seized her by the arm do ye think ye ungratefu wretch that i am gaun to let you sit doun upon my fathers grave the deil settle ye doun if ye dinna rise and come into the interpreters house thats the house of god wi me but ill rive every dud aft your back  she adapted the action to the phrase for with one clutch she stripped jeanie of her straw bonnet and a handful of her hair to boot and threw it up into an old yewtree where it stuck fast jeanies first impulse was to scream but conceiving she might receive deadly harm before she could obtain the assistance of anyone notwithstanding the vicinity of the church she thought it wiser to follow the madwoman into the congregation where she might find some means of escape from her or at least be secured against her violence but when she meekly intimated her consent to follow madge her guides uncertain brain had caught another train of ideas she held jeanie fast with one hand and with the other pointed to the inscription on the gravestone and commanded her to read it jeanie obeyed and read these words             this monument was erected to the memory of donald              murdockson of the kings xxvi or cameronian           regiment a sincere christian a brave soldier and            a faithful servant by his grateful and sorrowing                        master robert staunton  its very weel read jeanie its just the very words said madge whose ire had now faded into deep melancholy and with a step which to jeanies great joy was uncommonly quiet and mournful she led her companion towards the door of the church   illustration madge and jennie103   it was one of those oldfashioned gothic parish churches which are frequent in england the most cleanly decent and reverential places of worship that are perhaps anywhere to be found in the christian world yet notwithstanding the decent solemnity of its exterior jeanie was too faithful to the directory of the presbyterian kirk to have entered a prelatic place of worship and would upon any other occasion have thought that she beheld in the porch the venerable figure of her father waving her back from the entrance and pronouncing in a solemn tone cease my child to hear the instruction which causeth to err from the words of knowledge but in her present agitating and alarming situation she looked for safety to this forbidden place of assembly as the hunted animal will sometimes seek shelter from imminent danger in the human habitation or in other places of refuge most alien to its nature and habits not even the sound of the organ and of one or two flutes which accompanied the psalmody prevented her from following her guide into the chancel of the church  no sooner had madge put her foot upon the pavement and become sensible that she was the object of attention to the spectators than she resumed all the fantastic extravagance of deportment which some transient touch of melancholy had banished for an instant she swam rather than walked up the centre aisle dragging jeanie after her whom she held fast by the hand she would indeed have fain slipped aside into the pew nearest to the door and left madge to ascend in her own manner and alone to the high places of the synagogue but this was impossible without a degree of violent resistance which seemed to her inconsistent with the time and place and she was accordingly led in captivity up the whole length of the church by her grotesque conductress who with halfshut eyes a prim smile upon her lips and a mincing motion with her hands which corresponded with the delicate and affected pace at which she was pleased to move seemed to take the general stare of the congregation which such an exhibition necessarily excited as a high compliment and which she returned by nods and halfcourtesies to individuals amongst the audience whom she seemed to distinguish as acquaintances her absurdity was enhanced in the eyes of the spectators by the strange contrast which she formed to her companion who with dishevelled hair downcast eyes and a face glowing with shame was dragged as it were in triumph after her  madges airs were at length fortunately cut short by her encountering in her progress the looks of the clergyman who fixed upon her a glance at once steady compassionate and admonitory she hastily opened an empty pew which happened to be near her and entered dragging in jeanie after her kicking jeanie on the shins by way of hint that she should follow her example she sunk her head upon her hand for the space of a minute jeanie to whom this posture of mental devotion was entirely new did not attempt to do the like but looked round her with a bewildered stare which her neighbours judging from the company in which they saw her very naturally ascribed to insanity every person in their immediate vicinity drew back from this extraordinary couple as far as the limits of their pew permitted but one old man could not get beyond madges reach ere she had snatched the prayerbook from his hand and ascertained the lesson of the day she then turned up the ritual and with the most overstrained enthusiasm of gesture and manner showed jeanie the passages as they were read in the service making at the same time her own responses so loud as to be heard above those of every other person  notwithstanding the shame and vexation which jeanie felt in being thus exposed in a place of worship she could not and durst not omit rallying her spirits so as to look around her and consider to whom she ought to appeal for protection so soon as the service should be concluded her first ideas naturally fixed upon the clergyman and she was confirmed in the resolution by observing that he was an aged gentleman of a dignified appearance and deportment who read the service with an undisturbed and decent gravity which brought back to becoming attention those younger members of the congregation who had been disturbed by the extravagant behaviour of madge wildfire to the clergyman therefore jeanie resolved to make her appeal when the service was over  it is true she felt disposed to be shocked at his surplice of which she had heard so much but which she had never seen upon the person of a preacher of the word then she was confused by the change of posture adopted in different parts of the ritual the more so as madge wildfire to whom they seemed familiar took the opportunity to exercise authority over her pulling her up and pushing her down with a bustling assiduity which jeanie felt must make them both the objects of painful attention but notwithstanding these prejudices it was her prudent resolution in this dilemma to imitate as nearly as she could what was done around her the prophet she thought permitted naaman the syrian to bow even in the house of rimmon surely if i in this streight worship the god of my fathers in mine own language although the manner thereof be strange to me the lord will pardon me in this thing  in this resolution she became so much confirmed that withdrawing herself from madge as far as the pew permitted she endeavoured to evince by serious and composed attention to what was passing that her mind was composed to devotion her tormentor would not long have permitted her to remain quiet but fatigue overpowered her and she fell fast asleep in the other corner of the pew  jeanie though her mind in her own despite sometimes reverted to her situation compelled herself to give attention to a sensible energetic and wellcomposed discourse upon the practical doctrines of christianity which she could not help approving although it was every word written down and read by the preacher and although it was delivered in a tone and gesture very different from those of boanerges stormheaven who was her fathers favourite preacher the serious and placid attention with which jeanie listened did not escape the clergyman madge wildfires entrance had rendered him apprehensive of some disturbance to provide against which as far as possible he often turned his eyes to the part of the church where jeanie and she were placed and became soon aware that although the loss of her headgear and the awkwardness of her situation had given an uncommon and anxious air to the features of the former yet she was in a state of mind very different from that of her companion when he dismissed the congregation he observed her look around with a wild and terrified look as if uncertain what course she ought to adopt and noticed that she approached one or two of the most decent of the congregation as if to address them and then shrunk back timidly on observing that they seemed to shun and to avoid her the clergyman was satisfied there must be something extraordinary in all this and as a benevolent man as well as a good christian pastor he resolved to inquire into the matter more minutely     chapter eighth                  there governed in that year                a stern stout churlan angry overseer                                              crabbe  while mr staunton for such was this worthy clergymans name was laying aside his gown in the vestry jeanie was in the act of coming to an open rupture with madge  we must return to mummers barn directly said madge well be ower late and my mother will be angry  i am not going back with you madge said jeanie taking out a guinea and offering it to her i am much obliged to you but i maun gang my ain road  and me coming a this way out o my gate to pleasure you ye ungratefu cutty answered madge and me to be brained by my mother when i gang hame and a for your sakebut i will gar ye as good  for gods sake said jeanie to a man who stood beside them keep her offshe is mad  ey ey answered the boor i hae some guess of that and i trow thou best a bird of the same featherhowsomever madge i redd thee keep hand off her or ise lend thee a whisterpoop  several of the lower class of the parishioners now gathered round the strangers and the cry arose among the boys that there was agoing to be a fite between mad madge murdockson and another bess of bedlam but while the fry assembled with the humane hope of seeing as much of the fun as possible the laced cockedhat of the beadle was discerned among the multitude and all made way for that person of awful authority his first address was to madge  whats brought thee back again thou silly donnot to plague this parish hast thou brought ony more bastards wi thee to lay to honest mens doors or does thou think to burden us with this goose thats as harebrained as thysell as if rates were no up enow away wi thee to thy thief of a mother shes fast in the stocks at barkston townend away wi ye out o the parish or ise be at ye with the ratan  madge stood sulky for a minute but she had been too often taught submission to the beadles authority by ungentle means to feel courage enough to dispute it  and my mothermy puir auld mother is in the stocks at barkstonthis is a your wyte miss jeanie deans but ill be upsides wi you as sure as my names madge wildfirei mean murdocksongod help me i forget my very name in this confused waste  so saying she turned upon her heel and went off followed by all the mischievous imps of the village some crying madge canst thou tell thy name yet some pulling the skirts of her dress and all to the best of their strength and ingenuity exercising some new device or other to exasperate her into frenzy  jeanie saw her departure with infinite delight though she wished that in some way or other she could have requited the service madge had conferred upon her  in the meantime she applied to the beadle to know whether there was any house in the village where she could be civilly entertained for her money and whether she could be permitted to speak to the clergyman  ay ay wese ha reverend care on thee and i think answered the man of constituted authority that unless thou answer the rector all the better wese spare thy money and gie thee lodging at the parish charge young woman  where am i to go then said jeanie in some alarm  why i am to take thee to his reverence in the first place to gie an account o thysell and to see thou comena to be a burden upon the parish  i do not wish to burden anyone replied jeanie i have enough for my own wants and only wish to get on my journey safely  why thats another matter replied the beadle and if it be trueand i think thou dost not look so polrumptious as thy playfellow yonderthou wouldst be a mettle lass enow an thou wert snog and snod a bid better come thou away thenthe rector is a good man  is that the minister said jeanie who preached  the minister lord help thee what kind o presbyterian art thouwhy tis the rectorthe rectors sell woman and there isna the like o him in the county nor the four next to it come awayaway with theewe maunna bide here  i am sure i am very willing to go to see the minister said jeanie for though he read his discourse and wore that surplice as they call it here i canna but think he must be a very worthy godfearing man to preach the root of the matter in the way he did  the disappointed rabble finding that there was like to be no farther sport had by this time dispersed and jeanie with her usual patience followed her consequential and surly but not brutal conductor towards the rectory  this clerical mansion was large and commodious for the living was an excellent one and the advowson belonged to a very wealthy family in the neighbourhood who had usually bred up a son or nephew to the church for the sake of inducting him as opportunity offered into this very comfortable provision in this manner the rectory of willingham had always been considered as a direct and immediate appanage of willingham hall and as the rich baronets to whom the latter belonged had usually a son or brother or nephew settled in the living the utmost care had been taken to render their habitation not merely respectable and commodious but even dignified and imposing  it was situated about four hundred yards from the village and on a rising ground which sloped gently upward covered with small enclosures or closes laid out irregularly so that the old oaks and elms which were planted in hedgerows fell into perspective and were blended together in beautiful irregularity when they approached nearer to the house a handsome gateway admitted them into a lawn of narrow dimensions indeed but which was interspersed with large sweet chestnut trees and beeches and kept in handsome order the front of the house was irregular part of it seemed very old and had in fact been the residence of the incumbent in romish times successive occupants had made considerable additions and improvements each in the taste of his own age and without much regard to symmetry but these incongruities of architecture were so graduated and happily mingled that the eye far from being displeased with the combinations of various styles saw nothing but what was interesting in the varied and intricate pile which they displayed fruittrees displayed on the southern wall outer staircases various places of entrance a combination of roofs and chimneys of different ages united to render the front not indeed beautiful or grand but intricate perplexed or to use mr prices appropriate phrase picturesque the most considerable addition was that of the present rector who being a bookish man as the beadle was at the pains to inform jeanie to augment perhaps her reverence for the person before whom she was to appear had built a handsome library and parlour and no less than two additional bedrooms  mony men would hae scrupled such expense continued the parochial officer seeing as the living mun go as it pleases sir edmund to will it but his reverence has a canny bit land of his own and need not look on two sides of a penny  jeanie could not help comparing the irregular yet extensive and commodious pile of building before her to the manses in her own country where a set of penurious heritors professing all the while the devotion of their lives and fortunes to the presbyterian establishment strain their inventions to discover what may be nipped and clipped and pared from a building which forms but a poor accommodation even for the present incumbent and despite the superior advantage of stonemasonry must in the course of forty or fifty years again burden their descendants with an expense which once liberally and handsomely employed ought to have freed their estates from a recurrence of it for more than a century at least  behind the rectors house the ground sloped down to a small river which without possessing the romantic vivacity and rapidity of a northern stream was nevertheless by its occasional appearance through the ranges of willows and poplars that crowned its banks a very pleasing accompaniment to the landscape it was the best trouting stream said the beadle whom the patience of jeanie and especially the assurance that she was not about to become a burden to the parish had rendered rather communicative the best trouting stream in all lincolnshire for when you got lower there was nought to be done wi flyfishing  turning aside from the principal entrance he conducted jeanie towards a sort of portal connected with the older part of the building which was chiefly occupied by servants and knocking at the door it was opened by a servant in grave purple livery such as befitted a wealthy and dignified clergyman  how dost do tummas said the beadleand hows young measter staunton  why but poorlybut poorly measter stubbsare you wanting to see his reverence  ay ay tummas please to say i ha brought up the young woman as came to service today with mad madge murdockson seems to be a decentish koind o body but i ha asked her never a question only i can tell his reverence that she is a scotchwoman i judge and as flat as the fens of holland  tummas honoured jeanie deans with such a stare as the pampered domestics of the rich whether spiritual or temporal usually esteem it part of their privilege to bestow upon the poor and then desired mr stubbs and his charge to step in till he informed his master of their presence  the room into which he showed them was a sort of stewards parlour hung with a county map or two and three or four prints of eminent persons connected with the county as sir william monson james york the blacksmith of lincoln and the famous peregrine lord willoughby in complete armour looking as when he said in the words of the legend below the engraving   author of the union of honour a treatise on english heraldry london 1641                    stand to it noble pikemen                         and face ye well about                    and shoot ye sharp bold bowmen                        and we will keep them out                   ye musquet and callivermen                        do you prove true to me                   ill be the foremost man in fight                        said brave lord willoughbee   illustration a summat to eat and drink113   when they had entered this apartment tummas as a matter of course offered and as a matter of course mr stubbs accepted a summat to eat and drink being the respectable relies of a gammon of bacon and a whole whiskin or black pot of sufficient double ale to these eatables mr beadle seriously inclined himself and for we must do him justice not without an invitation to jeanie in which tummas joined that his prisoner or charge would follow his good example but although she might have stood in need of refreshment considering she had tasted no food that day the anxiety of the moment her own sparing and abstemious habits and a bashful aversion to eat in company of the two strangers induced her to decline their courtesy so she sate in a chair apart while mr stubbs and mr tummas who had chosen to join his friend in consideration that dinner was to be put back till after the afternoon service made a hearty luncheon which lasted for halfanhour and might not then have concluded had not his reverence rung his bell so that tummas was obliged to attend his master then and no sooner to save himself the labour of a second journey to the other end of the house he announced to his master the arrival of mr stubbs with the other madwoman as he chose to designate jeanie as an event which had just taken place he returned with an order that mr stubbs and the young woman should be instantly ushered up to the library the beadle bolted in haste his last mouthful of fat bacon washed down the greasy morsel with the last rinsings of the pot of ale and immediately marshalled jeanie through one or two intricate passages which led from the ancient to the more modern buildings into a handsome little hall or anteroom adjoining to the library and out of which a glass door opened to the lawn  stay here said stubbs till i tell his reverence you are come  so saying he opened a door and entered the library without wishing to hear their conversation jeanie as she was circumstanced could not avoid it for as stubbs stood by the door and his reverence was at the upper end of a large room their conversation was necessarily audible in the anteroom  so you have brought the young woman here at last mr stubbs i expected you some time since you know i do not wish such persons to remain in custody a moment without some inquiry into their situation  very true your reverence replied the beadle but the young woman had eat nought today and so measter tummas did set down a drap of drink and a morsel to be sure  thomas was very right mr stubbs and what has become of the other most unfortunate being  why replied mr stubbs i did think the sight on her would but vex your reverence and soa i did let her go her ways back to her mother who is in trouble in the next parish  in troublethat signifies in prison i suppose said mr staunton  ay truly something like it an it like your reverence  wretched unhappy incorrigible woman said the clergyman and what sort of person is this companion of hers  why decent enow an it like your reverence said stubbs for aught i sees of her theres no harm of her and she says she has cash enow to carry her out of the county  cash that is always what you think of stubbsbut has she sensehas she her witshas she the capacity of taking care of herself  why your reverence replied stubbs i cannot just sayi will be sworn she was not born at wittham for gaffer gibbs looked at her all the time of service and he says she could not turn up a single lesson like a christian even though she had madge murdockson to help herbut then as to fending for herself why shes a bit of a scotchwoman your reverence and they say the worst donnot of them can look out for their own turnand she is decently put on enow and not bechounched like tother   a proverbial and punning expression in that county to intimate that a person is not very clever  send her in here then and do you remain below mr stubbs  this colloquy had engaged jeanies attention so deeply that it was not until it was over that she observed that the sashed door which we have said led from the anteroom into the garden was opened and that there entered or rather was borne in by two assistants a young man of a very pale and sickly appearance whom they lifted to the nearest couch and placed there as if to recover from the fatigue of an unusual exertion just as they were making this arrangement stubbs came out of the library and summoned jeanie to enter it she obeyed him not without tremor for besides the novelty of the situation to a girl of her secluded habits she felt also as if the successful prosecution of her journey was to depend upon the impression she should be able to make on mr staunton  it is true it was difficult to suppose on what pretext a person travelling on her own business and at her own charge could be interrupted upon her route but the violent detention she had already undergone was sufficient to show that there existed persons at no great distance who had the interest the inclination and the audacity forcibly to stop her journey and she felt the necessity of having some countenance and protection at least till she should get beyond their reach while these things passed through her mind much faster than our pen and ink can record or even the readers eye collect the meaning of its traces jeanie found herself in a handsome library and in presence of the rector of willingham the wellfurnished presses and shelves which surrounded the large and handsome apartment contained more books than jeanie imagined existed in the world being accustomed to consider as an extensive collection two fir shelves each about three feet long which contained her fathers treasured volumes the whole pith and marrow as he used sometimes to boast of modern divinity an orrery globes a telescope and some other scientific implements conveyed to jeanie an impression of admiration and wonder not unmixed with fear for in her ignorant apprehension they seemed rather adapted for magical purposes than any other and a few stuffed animals as the rector was fond of natural history added to the impressive character of the apartment  mr staunton spoke to her with great mildness he observed that although her appearance at church had been uncommon and in strange and he must add discreditable society and calculated upon the whole to disturb the congregation during divine worship he wished nevertheless to hear her own account of herself before taking any steps which his duty might seem to demand he was a justice of peace he informed her as well as a clergyman  his honour for she would not say his reverence was very civil and kind was all that poor jeanie could at first bring out  who are you young woman said the clergyman more peremptorilyand what do you do in this country and in such companywe allow no strollers or vagrants here  i am not a vagrant or a stroller sir said jeanie a little roused by the supposition i am a decent scots lass travelling through the land on my own business and my own expenses and i was so unhappy as to fall in with bad company and was stopped a night on my journey and this puir creature who is something lightheaded let me out in the morning  bad company said the clergyman i am afraid young woman you have not been sufficiently anxious to avoid them  indeed sir returned jeanie i have been brought up to shun evil communication but these wicked people were thieves and stopped me by violence and mastery  thieves said mr staunton then you charge them with robbery i suppose  no sir they did not take so much as a boddle from me answered jeanie nor did they use me ill otherwise than by confining me  the clergyman inquired into the particulars of her adventure which she told him from point to point  this is an extraordinary and not a very probable tale young woman resumed mr staunton here has been according to your account a great violence committed without any adequate motive are you aware of the law of this countrythat if you lodge this charge you will be bound over to prosecute this gang  jeanie did not understand him and he explained that the english law in addition to the inconvenience sustained by persons who have been robbed or injured has the goodness to intrust to them the care and the expense of appearing as prosecutors  jeanie said that her business at london was express all she wanted was that any gentleman would out of christian charity protect her to some town where she could hire horses and a guide and finally she thought it would be her fathers mind that she was not free to give testimony in an english court of justice as the land was not under a direct gospel dispensation  mr staunton stared a little and asked if her father was a quaker  god forbid sir said jeaniehe is nae schismatic nor sectary nor ever treated for sic black commodities as theirs and thats weel kend o him  and what is his name pray said mr staunton  david deans sir the cowfeeder at saint leonards crags near edinburgh  a deep groan from the anteroom prevented the rector from replying and exclaiming good god that unhappy boy he left jeanie alone and hastened into the outer apartment  some noise and bustle was heard but no one entered the library for the best part of an hour      chapter ninth                    fantastic passions maddening brawl                      and shame and terror over all                  deeds to be hid which were not hid                  which all confused i could not know                      whether i sufferd or i did                  for all seemd guilt remorse or woe                      my own or others still the same                  lifestifling fear soulstifling shame                                          coleridge  during the interval while she was thus left alone jeanie anxiously revolved in her mind what course was best for her to pursue she was impatient to continue her journey yet she feared she could not safely adventure to do so while the old hag and her assistants were in the neighbourhood without risking a repetition of their violence she thought she could collect from the conversation which she had partly overheard and also from the wild confessions of madge wildfire that her mother had a deep and revengeful motive for obstructing her journey if possible and from whom could she hope for assistance if not from mr staunton his whole appearance and demeanour seemed to encourage her hopes his features were handsome though marked with a deep cast of melancholy his tone and language were gentle and encouraging and as he had served in the army for several years during his youth his air retained that easy frankness which is peculiar to the profession of arms he was besides a minister of the gospel and although a worshipper according to jeanies notions in the court of the gentiles and so benighted as to wear a surplice although he read the common prayer and wrote down every word of his sermon before delivering it and although he was moreover in strength of lungs as well as pith and marrow of doctrine vastly inferior to boanerges stormheaven jeanie still thought he must be a very different person from curate kilstoup and other prelatical divines of her fathers earlier days who used to get drunk in their canonical dress and hound out the dragoons against the wandering cameronians the house seemed to be in some disturbance but as she could not suppose she was altogether forgotten she thought it better to remain quiet in the apartment where she had been left till some one should take notice of her  the first who entered was to her no small delight one of her own sex a motherlylooking aged person of a housekeeper to her jeanie explained her situation in a few words and begged her assistance  the dignity of a housekeeper did not encourage too much familiarity with a person who was at the rectory on justicebusiness and whose character might seem in her eyes somewhat precarious but she was civil although distant  her young master she said had had a bad accident by a fall from his horse which made him liable to fainting fits he had been taken very ill just now and it was impossible his reverence could see jeanie for some time but that she need not fear his doing all that was just and proper in her behalf the instant he could get her business attended toshe concluded by offering to show jeanie a room where she might remain till his reverence was at leisure  our heroine took the opportunity to request the means of adjusting and changing her dress  the housekeeper in whose estimation order and cleanliness ranked high among personal virtues gladly complied with a request so reasonable and the change of dress which jeanies bundle furnished made so important an improvement in her appearance that the old lady hardly knew the soiled and disordered traveller whose attire showed the violence she had sustained in the neat clean quietlooking little scotchwoman who now stood before her encouraged by such a favourable alteration in her appearance mrs dalton ventured to invite jeanie to partake of her dinner and was equally pleased with the decent propriety of her conduct during the meal  thou canst read this book canst thou young woman said the old lady when their meal was concluded laying her hand upon a large bible  i hope sae madam said jeanie surprised at the question my father wad hae wanted mony a thing ere i had wanted that schuling  the better sign of him young woman there are men here well to pass in the world would not want their share of a leicester plover and thats a bagpudding if fasting for three hours would make all their poor children read the bible from end to end take thou the book then for my eyes are something dazed and read where thou listestits the only book thou canst not happen wrong in  jeanie was at first tempted to turn up the parable of the good samaritan but her conscience checked her as if it were a use of scripture not for her own edification but to work upon the mind of others for the relief of her worldly afflictions and under this scrupulous sense of duty she selected in preference a chapter of the prophet isaiah and read it notwithstanding her northern accent and tone with a devout propriety which greatly edified mrs dalton  ah she said an all scotchwomen were sic as thou but it was our luck to get born devils of thy country i thinkevery one worse than tother if thou knowest of any tidy lass like thysell that wanted a place and could bring a good character and would not go laiking about to wakes and fairs and wore shoes and stockings all the day roundwhy ill not say but we might find room for her at the rectory hast no cousin or sister lass that such an offer would suit  this was touching upon a sore point but jeanie was spared the pain of replying by the entrance of the same manservant she had seen before  measter wishes to see the young woman from scotland was tummass address  go to his reverence my dear as fast as you can and tell him all your storyhis reverence is a kind man said mrs dalton i will fold down the leaf and wake you a cup of tea with some nice muffin against you come down and thats what you seldom see in scotland girl  measters waiting for the young woman said tummas impatiently  well mr jacksauce and what is your business to put in your oarand how often must i tell you to call mr staunton his reverence seeing as he is a dignified clergyman and not be meastering meastering him as if he were a little petty squire  as jeanie was now at the door and ready to accompany tummas the footman said nothing till he got into the passage when he muttered there are moe masters than one in this house and i think we shall have a mistress too an dame dalton carries it thus  tummas led the way through a more intricate range of passages than jeanie had yet threaded and ushered her into an apartment which was darkened by the closing of most of the windowshutters and in which was a bed with the curtains partly drawn  here is the young woman sir said tummas  very well said a voice from the bed but not that of his reverence be ready to answer the bell and leave the room  there is some mistake said jeanie confounded at finding herself in the apartment of an invalid the servant told me that the minister  dont trouble yourself said the invalid there is no mistake i know more of your affairs than my father and i can manage them betterleave the room tom the servant obeyedwe must not said the invalid lose time when we have little to lose open the shutters of that window  she did so and as he drew aside the curtain of his bed the light fell on his pale countenance as turband with bandages and dressed in a nightgown he lay seemingly exhausted upon the bed  look at me he said jeanie deans can you not recollect me  no sir said she full of surprise i was never in this country before  but i may have been in yours thinkrecollect i should faint did i name the name you are most dearly bound to loathe and to detest thinkremember  a terrible recollection flashed on jeanie which every tone of the speaker confirmed and which his next words rendered certainty  be composedremember muschats cairn and the moonlight night  jeanie sunk down on a chair with clasped hands and gasped in agony  yes here i lie he said like a crushed snake writhing with impatience at my incapacity of motionhere i lie when i ought to have been in edinburgh trying every means to save a life that is dearer to me than my ownhow is your sisterhow fares it with hercondemned to death i know it by this time o the horse that carried me safely on a thousand errands of folly and wickedness that he should have broke down with me on the only good mission i have undertaken for years but i must rein in my passionmy frame cannot endure it and i have much to say give me some of the cordial which stands on that tablewhy do you tremble but you have too good causelet it standi need it not  jeanie however reluctant approached him with the cup into which she had poured the draught and could not forbear saying there is a cordial for the mind sir if the wicked will turn from their transgressions and seek to the physician of souls  silence he said sternlyand yet i thank you but tell me and lose no time in doing so what you are doing in this country remember though i have been your sisters worst enemy yet i will serve her with the best of my blood and i will serve you for her sake and no one can serve you to such purpose for no one can know the circumstances so wellso speak without fear  i am not afraid sir said jeanie collecting her spirits i trust in god and if it pleases him to redeem my sisters captivity it is all i seek whosoever be the instrument but sir to be plain with you i dare not use your counsel unless i were enabled to see that it accords with the law which i must rely upon  the devil take the puritan cried george staunton for so we must now call himi beg your pardon but i am naturally impatient and you drive me mad what harm can it possibly do to tell me in what situation your sister stands and your own expectations of being able to assist her it is time enough to refuse my advice when i offer any which you may think improper i speak calmly to you though tis against my nature but dont urge me to impatienceit will only render me incapable of serving effie  there was in the looks and words of this unhappy young man a sort of restrained eagerness and impetuosity which seemed to prey upon itself as the impatience of a fiery steed fatigues itself with churning upon the bit after a moments consideration it occurred to jeanie that she was not entitled to withhold from him whether on her sisters account or her own the fatal account of the consequences of the crime which he had committed nor to reject such advice being in itself lawful and innocent as he might be able to suggest in the way of remedy accordingly in as few words as she could express it she told the history of her sisters trial and condemnation and of her own journey as far as newark he appeared to listen in the utmost agony of mind yet repressed every violent symptom of emotion whether by gesture or sound which might have interrupted the speaker and stretched on his couch like the mexican monarch on his bed of live coals only the contortions of his cheek and the quivering of his limbs gave indication of his sufferings to much of what she said he listened with stifled groans as if he were only hearing those miseries confirmed whose fatal reality he had known before but when she pursued her tale through the circumstances which had interrupted her journey extreme surprise and earnest attention appeared to succeed to the symptoms of remorse which he had before exhibited he questioned jeanie closely concerning the appearance of the two men and the conversation which she had overheard between the taller of them and the woman  when jeanie mentioned the old woman having alluded to her fostersonit is too true he said and the source from which i derived food when an infant must have communicated to me the wretchedthe fatedpropensity to vices that were strangers in my own familybut go on  jeanie passed slightly over her journey in company with madge having no inclination to repeat what might be the effect of mere raving on the part of her companion and therefore her tale was now closed  young staunton lay for a moment in profound meditation and at length spoke with more composure than he had yet displayed during their interviewyou are a sensible as well as a good young woman jeanie deans and i will tell you more of my story than i have told to any one story did i call itit is a tissue of folly guilt and miserybut take noticei do it because i desire your confidence in returnthat is that you will act in this dismal matter by my advice and direction therefore do i speak  i will do what is fitting for a sister and a daughter and a christian woman to do said jeanie but do not tell me any of your secretsit is not good that i should come into your counsel or listen to the doctrine which causeth to err  simple fool said the young man look at me my head is not horned my foot is not cloven my hands are not garnished with talons and since i am not the very devil himself what interest can any one else have in destroying the hopes with which you comfort or fool yourself listen to me patiently and you will find that when you have heard my counsel you may go to the seventh heaven with it in your pocket if you have a mind and not feel yourself an ounce heavier in the ascent  at the risk of being somewhat heavy as explanations usually prove we must here endeavour to combine into a distinct narrative information which the invalid communicated in a manner at once too circumstantial and too much broken by passion to admit of our giving his precise words part of it indeed he read from a manuscript which he had perhaps drawn up for the information of his relations after his decease  to make my tale shortthis wretched hagthis margaret murdockson was the wife of a favourite servant of my fathershe had been my nurseher husband was deadshe resided in a cottage near this placeshe had a daughter who grew up and was then a beautiful but very giddy girl her mother endeavoured to promote her marriage with an old and wealthy churl in the neighbourhoodthe girl saw me frequentlyshe was familiar with me as our connection seemed to permitand iin a word i wronged her cruellyit was not so bad as your sisters business but it was sufficiently villanousher folly should have been her protection soon after this i was sent abroadto do my father justice if i have turned out a fiend it is not his faulthe used the best means when i returned i found the wretched mother and daughter had fallen into disgrace and were chased from this countrymy deep share in their shame and misery was discoveredmy father used very harsh languagewe quarrelled i left his house and led a life of strange adventure resolving never again to see my father or my fathers home  and now comes the storyjeanie i put my life into your hands and not only my own life which god knows is not worth saving but the happiness of a respectable old man and the honour of a family of consideration my love of low society as such propensities as i was cursed with are usually termed was i think of an uncommon kind and indicated a nature which if not depraved by early debauchery would have been fit for better things i did not so much delight in the wild revel the low humour the unconfined liberty of those with whom i associated as in the spirit of adventure presence of mind in peril and sharpness of intellect which they displayed in prosecuting their maraudings upon the revenue or similar adventureshave you looked round this rectoryis it not a sweet and pleasant retreat  jeanie alarmed at this sudden change of subject replied in the affirmative  well i wish it had been ten thousand fathoms under ground with its churchlands and tithes and all that belongs to it had it not been for this cursed rectory i should have been permitted to follow the bent of my own inclinations and the profession of arms and half the courage and address that i have displayed among smugglers and deerstealers would have secured me an honourable rank among my contemporaries why did i not go abroad when i left this housewhy did i leave it at allwhybut it came to that point with me that it is madness to look back and misery to look forward  he paused and then proceeded with more composure  the chances of a wandering life brought me unhappily to scotland to embroil myself in worse and more criminal actions than i had yet been concerned in it was now i became acquainted with wilson a remarkable man in his station of life quiet composed and resolute firm in mind and uncommonly strong in person gifted with a sort of rough eloquence which raised him above his companions hitherto i had been                 as dissolute as desperate yet through both                were seen some sparkles of a better hope  but it was this mans misfortune as well as mine that notwithstanding the difference of our rank and education he acquired an extraordinary and fascinating influence over me which i can only account for by the calm determination of his character being superior to the less sustained impetuosity of mine where he led i felt myself bound to follow and strange was the courage and address which he displayed in his pursuits while i was engaged in desperate adventures under so strange and dangerous a preceptor i became acquainted with your unfortunate sister at some sports of the young people in the suburbs which she frequented by stealthand her ruin proved an interlude to the tragic scenes in which i was now deeply engaged yet this let me saythe villany was not premeditated and i was firmly resolved to do her all the justice which marriage could do so soon as i should be able to extricate myself from my unhappy course of life and embrace some one more suited to my birth i had wild visionsvisions of conducting her as if to some poor retreat and introducing her at once to rank and fortune she never dreamt of a friend at my request attempted a negotiation with my father which was protracted for some time and renewed at different intervals at length and just when i expected my fathers pardon he learned by some means or other my infamy painted in even exaggerated colours which was god knows unnecessary he wrote me a letterhow it found me out i know notenclosing me a sum of money and disowning me for ever i became desperatei became frantici readily joined wilson in a perilous smuggling adventure in which we miscarried and was willingly blinded by his logic to consider the robbery of the officer of the customs in fife as a fair and honourable reprisal hitherto i had observed a certain line in my criminality and stood free of assaults upon personal property but now i felt a wild pleasure in disgracing myself as much as possible  the plunder was no object to me i abandoned that to my comrades and only asked the post of danger i remember well that when i stood with my drawn sword guarding the door while they committed the felony i had not a thought of my own safety i was only meditating on my sense of supposed wrong from my family my impotent thirst of vengeance and how it would sound in the haughty cars of the family of willingham that one of their descendants and the heir apparent of their honours should perish by the hands of the hangman for robbing a scottish gauger of a sum not equal to onefifth part of the money i had in my pocketbook we were takeni expected no less we were condemnedthat also i looked for but death as he approached nearer looked grimly and the recollection of your sisters destitute condition determined me on an effort to save my life i forgot to tell you that in edinburgh i again met the woman murdockson and her daughter she had followed the camp when young and had now under pretence of a trifling traffic resumed predatory habits with which she had already been too familiar our first meeting was stormy but i was liberal of what money i had and she forgot or seemed to forget the injury her daughter had received the unfortunate girl herself seemed hardly even to know her seducer far less to retain any sense of the injury she had received her mind is totally alienated which according to her mothers account is sometimes the consequence of an unfavourable confinement but it was my doing here was another stone knitted round my neck to sink me into the pit of perdition every lookevery word of this poor creatureher false spiritsher imperfect recollectionsher allusions to things which she had forgotten but which were recorded in my conscience were stabs of a poniardstabs did i saythey were tearing with hot pincers and scalding the raw wound with burning sulphurthey were to be endured however and they were endured i return to my prison thoughts  it was not the least miserable of them that your sisters time approached i knew her dread of you and of her father she often said she would die a thousand deaths ere you should know her shameyet her confinement must be provided for i knew this woman murdockson was an infernal hag but i thought she loved me and that money would make her true she had procured a file for wilson and a springsaw for me and she undertook readily to take charge of effie during her illness in which she had skill enough to give the necessary assistance i gave her the money which my father had sent me it was settled that she should receive effie into her house in the meantime and wait for farther directions from me when i should effect my escape i communicated this purpose and recommended the old hag to poor effie by a letter in which i recollect that i endeavoured to support the character of macheath under condemnationa fine gay boldfaced ruffian who is game to the last such and so wretchedly poor was my ambition yet i had resolved to forsake the courses i had been engaged in should i be so fortunate as to escape the gibbet my design was to marry your sister and go over to the west indies i had still a considerable sum of money left and i trusted to be able in one way or other to provide for myself and my wife  we made the attempt to escape and by the obstinacy of wilson who insisted upon going first it totally miscarried the undaunted and selfdenied manner in which he sacrificed himself to redeem his error and accomplish my escape from the tolbooth church you must have heard ofall scotland rang with it it was a gallant and extraordinary deedall men spoke of itall men even those who most condemned the habits and crimes of this selfdevoted man praised the heroism of his friendship i have many vices but cowardice or want of gratitude are none of the number i resolved to requite his generosity and even your sisters safety became a secondary consideration with me for the time to effect wilsons liberation was my principal object and i doubted not to find the means  yet i did not forget effie neither the bloodhounds of the law were so close after me that i dared not trust myself near any of my old haunts but old murdockson met me by appointment and informed me that your sister had happily been delivered of a boy i charged the hag to keep her patients mind easy and let her want for nothing that money could purchase and i retreated to fife where among my old associates of wilsons gang i hid myself in those places of concealment where the men engaged in that desperate trade are used to find security for themselves and their uncustomed goods men who are disobedient both to human and divine laws are not always insensible to the claims of courage and generosity we were assured that the mob of edinburgh strongly moved with the hardship of wilsons situation and the gallantry of his conduct would back any bold attempt that might be made to rescue him even from the foot of the gibbet desperate as the attempt seemed upon my declaring myself ready to lead the onset on the guard i found no want of followers who engaged to stand by me and returned to lothian soon followed by some steady associates prepared to act whenever the occasion might require  i have no doubt i should have rescued him from the very noose that dangled over his head he continued with animation which seemed a flash of the interest which he had taken in such exploits but amongst other precautions the magistrates had taken one suggested as we afterwards learned by the unhappy wretch porteous which effectually disconcerted my measures they anticipated by halfanhour the ordinary period for execution and as it had been resolved amongst us that for fear of observation from the officers of justice we should not show ourselves upon the street until the time of action approached it followed that all was over before our attempt at a rescue commenced it did commence however and i gained the scaffold and cut the rope with my own hand it was too late the bold stouthearted generous criminal was no moreand vengeance was all that remained to usa vengeance as i then thought doubly due from my hand to whom wilson had given life and liberty when he could as easily have secured his own  o sir said jeanie did the scripture never come into your mind vengeance is mine and i will repay it  scripture why i had not opened a bible for five years answered staunton  waes me sirs said jeanieand a ministers son too  it is natural for you to say so yet do not interrupt me but let me finish my most accursed history the beast porteous who kept firing on the people long after it had ceased to be necessary became the object of their hatred for having overdone his duty and of mine for having done it too well we that is i and the other determined friends of wilson resolved to be avengedbut caution was necessary i thought i had been marked by one of the officers and therefore continued to lurk about the vicinity of edinburgh but without daring to venture within the walls at length i visited at the hazard of my life the place where i hoped to find my future wife and my sonthey were both gone dame murdockson informed me that so soon as effie heard of the miscarriage of the attempt to rescue wilson and the hot pursuit after me she fell into a brain fever and that being one day obliged to go out on some necessary business and leave her alone she had taken that opportunity to escape and she had not seen her since i loaded her with reproaches to which she listened with the most provoking and callous composure for it is one of her attributes that violent and fierce as she is upon most occasions there are some in which she shows the most imperturbable calmness i threatened her with justice she said i had more reason to fear justice than she had i felt she was right and was silenced i threatened her with vengeance she replied in nearly the same words that to judge by injuries received i had more reason to fear her vengeance than she to dread mine she was again right and i was left without an answer i flung myself from her in indignation and employed a comrade to make inquiry in the neighbourhood of saint leonards concerning your sister but ere i received his answer the opening quest of a wellscented terrier of the law drove me from the vicinity of edinburgh to a more distant and secluded place of concealment a secret and trusty emissary at length brought me the account of porteouss condemnation and of your sisters imprisonment on a criminal charge thus astounding one of mine ears while he gratified the other  i again ventured to the pleasanceagain charged murdockson with treachery to the unfortunate effie and her child though i could conceive no reason save that of appropriating the whole of the money i had lodged with her your narrative throws light on this and shows another motive not less powerful because less evidentthe desire of wreaking vengeance on the seducer of her daughterthe destroyer at once of her reason and reputation great god how i wish that instead of the revenge she made choice of she had delivered me up to the cord  but what account did the wretched woman give of effie and the bairn said jeanie who during this long and agitating narrative had firmness and discernment enough to keep her eye on such points as might throw light on her sisters misfortunes  she would give none said staunton she said the mother made a moonlight flitting from her house with the infant in her armsthat she had never seen either of them sincethat the lass might have thrown the child into the north loch or the quarry holes for what she knew and it was like enough she had done so  and how came you to believe that she did not speak the fatal truth said jeanie trembling  because on this second occasion i saw her daughter and i understood from her that in fact the child had been removed or destroyed during the illness of the mother but all knowledge to be got from her is so uncertain and indirect that i could not collect any farther circumstances only the diabolical character of old murdockson makes me augur the worst  the last account agrees with that given by my poor sister said jeanie but gang on wi your ain tale sir  of this i am certain said staunton that effie in her senses and with her knowledge never injured living creaturebut what could i do in her exculpationnothingand therefore my whole thoughts were turned toward her safety i was under the cursed necessity of suppressing my feelings towards murdockson my life was in the hags handthat i cared not for but on my life hung that of your sister i spoke the wretch fair i appeared to confide in her and to me so far as i was personally concerned she gave proofs of extraordinary fidelity i was at first uncertain what measures i ought to adopt for your sisters liberation when the general rage excited among the citizens of edinburgh on account of the reprieve of porteous suggested to me the daring idea of forcing the jail and at once carrying off your sister from the clutches of the law and bringing to condign punishment a miscreant who had tormented the unfortunate wilson even in the hour of death as if he had been a wild indian taken captive by a hostile tribe i flung myself among the multitude in the moment of fermentationso did others among wilsons mates who had like me been disappointed in the hope of glutting their eyes with porteouss execution all was organised and i was chosen for the captain i felt noti do not now feel compunction for what was to be done and has since been executed  o god forgive ye sir and bring ye to a better sense of your ways exclaimed jeanie in horror at the avowal of such violent sentiments  amen replied staunton if my sentiments are wrong but i repeat that although willing to aid the deed i could have wished them to have chosen another leader because i foresaw that the great and general duty of the night would interfere with the assistance which i proposed to render effie i gave a commission however to a trusty friend to protect her to a place of safety so soon as the fatal procession had left the jail but for no persuasions which i could use in the hurry of the moment or which my comrade employed at more length after the mob had taken a different direction could the unfortunate girl be prevailed upon to leave the prison his arguments were all wasted upon the infatuated victim and he was obliged to leave her in order to attend to his own safety such was his account but perhaps he persevered less steadily in his attempts to persuade her than i would have done  effie was right to remain said jeanie and i love her the better for it  why will you say so said staunton  you cannot understand my reasons sir if i should render them answered jeanie composedly they that thirst for the blood of their enemies have no taste for the wellspring of life  my hopes said staunton were thus a second time disappointed my next efforts were to bring her through her trial by means of yourself how i urged it and where you cannot have forgotten i do not blame you for your refusal it was founded i am convinced on principle and not on indifference to your sisters fate for me judge of me as a man frantic i knew not what hand to turn to and all my efforts were unavailing in this condition and close beset on all sides i thought of what might be done by means of my family and their influence i fled from scotlandi reached this placemy miserably wasted and unhappy appearance procured me from my father that pardon which a parent finds it so hard to refuse even to the most undeserving son and here i have awaited in anguish of mind which the condemned criminal might envy the event of your sisters trial  without taking any steps for her relief said jeanie  to the last i hoped her ease might terminate more favourably and it is only two days since that the fatal tidings reached me my resolution was instantly taken i mounted my best horse with the purpose of making the utmost haste to london and there compounding with sir robert walpole for your sisters safety by surrendering to him in the person of the heir of the family of willingham the notorious george robertson the accomplice of wilson the breaker of the tolbooth prison and the wellknown leader of the porteous mob  but would that save my sister said jeanie in astonishment  it would as i should drive my bargain said staunton queens love revenge as well as their subjectslittle as you seem to esteem it it is a poison which pleases all palates from the prince to the peasant prime ministers love no less the power of gratifying sovereigns by gratifying their passionsthe life of an obscure village girl why i might ask the best of the crownjewels for laying the head of such an insolent conspiracy at the foot of her majesty with a certainty of being gratified all my other plans have failed but this could notheaven is just however and would not honour me with making this voluntary atonement for the injury i have done your sister i had not rode ten miles when my horse the best and most surefooted animal in this country fell with me on a level piece of road as if he had been struck by a cannonshot i was greatly hurt and was brought back here in the condition in which you now see me  as young staunton had come to the conclusion the servant opened the door and with a voice which seemed intended rather for a signal than merely the announcing of a visit said his reverence sir is coming up stairs to wait upon you  for gods sake hide yourself jeanie exclaimed staunton in that dressing closet  no sir said jeanie as i am here for nae ill i canna take the shame of hiding mysell frae the master of the house  but good heavens exclaimed george staunton do but consider  ere he could complete the sentence his father entered the apartment      chapter tenth                and now will pardon comfort kindness draw              the youth from vice will honour duty law                                             crabbe  jeanie arose from her seat and made her quiet reverence when the elder mr staunton entered the apartment his astonishment was extreme at finding his son in such company  i perceive madam i have made a mistake respecting you and ought to have left the task of interrogating you and of righting your wrongs to this young man with whom doubtless you have been formerly acquainted  its unwitting on my part that i am here said jeanie the servant told me his master wished to speak with me  there goes the purple coat over my ears murmured tummas dn her why must she needs speak the truth when she could have as well said anything else she had a mind  george said mr staunton if you are still as you have ever beenlost to all selfrespect you might at least have spared your father and your fathers house such a disgraceful scene as this  upon my lifeupon my soul sir said george throwing his feet over the side of the bed and starting from his recumbent posture  your life sir interrupted his father with melancholy sternnesswhat sort of life has it beenyour soul alas what regard have you ever paid to it take care to reform both ere offering either as pledges of your sincerity  on my honour sir you do me wrong answered george staunton i have been all that you can call me thats bad but in the present instance you do me injustice by my honour you do  your honour said his father and turned from him with a look of the most upbraiding contempt to jeanie from you young woman i neither ask nor expect any explanation but as a father alike and as a clergyman i request your departure from this house if your romantic story has been other than a pretext to find admission into it which from the society in which you first appeared i may be permitted to doubt you will find a justice of peace within two miles with whom more properly than with me you may lodge your complaint  this shall not be said george staunton starting up to his feet sir you are naturally kind and humaneyou shall not become cruel and inhospitable on my account turn out that eavesdropping rascal pointing to thomas and get what hartshorn drops or what better receipt you have against fainting and i will explain to you in two words the connection betwixt this young woman and me she shall not lose her fair character through me i have done too much mischief to her family already and i know too well what belongs to the loss of fame  leave the room sir said the rector to the servant and when the man had obeyed he carefully shut the door behind him then addressing his son he said sternly now sir what new proof of your infamy have you to impart to me  young staunton was about to speak but it was one of those moments when those who like jeanie deans possess the advantage of a steady courage and unruffled temper can assume the superiority over more ardent but less determined spirits  sir she said to the elder staunton ye have an undoubted right to ask your ain son to render a reason of his conduct but respecting me i am but a wayfaring traveller no ways obligated or indebted to you unless it be for the meal of meat which in my ain country is willingly gien by rich or poor according to their ability to those who need it and for which forby that i am willing to make payment if i didna think it would be an affront to offer siller in a house like thisonly i dinna ken the fashions of the country  this is all very well young woman said the rector a good deal surprised and unable to conjecture whether to impute jeanies language to simplicity or impertinence this may be all very wellbut let me bring it to a point why do you stop this young mans mouth and prevent his communicating to his father and his best friend an explanation since he says he has one of circumstances which seem in themselves not a little suspicious  he may tell of his ain affairs what he likes answered jeanie but my family and friends have nae right to hae ony stories told anent them without their express desire and as they canna be here to speak for themselves i entreat ye wadna ask mr george robi mean staunton or whatever his name is ony questions anent me or my folk for i maun be free to tell you that he will neither have the bearing of a christian or a gentleman if he answers you against my express desire  this is the most extraordinary thing i ever met with said the rector as after fixing his eyes keenly on the placid yet modest countenance of jeanie he turned them suddenly upon his son what have you to say sir  that i feel i have been too hasty in my promise sir answered george staunton i have no title to make any communications respecting the affairs of this young persons family without her assent  the elder mr staunton turned his eyes from one to the other with marks of surprise  this is more and worse i fear he said addressing his son than one of your frequent and disgraceful connectionsi insist upon knowing the mystery  i have already said sir replied his son rather sullenly that i have no title to mention the affairs of this young womans family without her consent  and i hae nae mysteries to explain sir said jeanie but only to pray you as a preacher of the gospel and a gentleman to permit me to go safe to the next publichouse on the lunnon road  i shall take care of your safety said young staunton you need ask that favour from no one  do you say so before my face said the justlyincensed father perhaps sir you intend to fill up the cup of disobedience and profligacy by forming a low and disgraceful marriage but let me bid you beware  if you were feared for sic a thing happening wi me sir said jeanie i can only say that not for all the land that lies between the twa ends of the rainbow wad i be the woman that should wed your son  there is something very singular in all this said the elder staunton follow me into the next room young woman  hear me speak first said the young man i have but one word to say i confide entirely in your prudence tell my father as much or as little of these matters as you will he shall know neither more nor less from me  his father darted at him a glance of indignation which softened into sorrow as he saw him sink down on the couch exhausted with the scene he had undergone he left the apartment and jeanie followed him george staunton raising himself as she passed the doorway and pronouncing the word remember in a tone as monitory as it was uttered by charles i upon the scaffold the elder staunton led the way into a small parlour and shut the door  young woman said he there is something in your face and appearance that marks both sense and simplicity and if i am not deceived innocence alsoshould it be otherwise i can only say you are the most accomplished hypocrite i have ever seeni ask to know no secret that you have unwillingness to divulge least of all those which concern my son his conduct has given me too much unhappiness to permit me to hope comfort or satisfaction from him if you are such as i suppose you believe me that whatever unhappy circumstances may have connected you with george staunton the sooner you break them through the better  i think i understand your meaning sir replied jeanie and as ye are sae frank as to speak o the young gentleman in sic a way i must needs say that it is but the second time of my speaking wi him in our lives and what i hae heard frae him on these twa occasions has been such that i never wish to hear the like again  then it is your real intention to leave this part of the country and proceed to london said the rector  certainly sir for i may say in one sense that the avenger of blood is behind me and if i were but assured against mischief by the way  i have made inquiry said the clergyman after the suspicious characters you described they have left their place of rendezvous but as they may be lurking in the neighbourhood and as you say you have special reason to apprehend violence from them i will put you under the charge of a steady person who will protect you as far as stamford and see you into a light coach which goes from thence to london  a coach is not for the like of me sir said jeanie to whom the idea of a stagecoach was unknown as indeed they were then only used in the neighbourhood of london  mr staunton briefly explained that she would find that mode of conveyance more commodious cheaper and more safe than travelling on horseback she expressed her gratitude with so much singleness of heart that he was induced to ask her whether she wanted the pecuniary means of prosecuting her journey she thanked him but said she had enough for her purpose and indeed she had husbanded her stock with great care this reply served also to remove some doubts which naturally enough still floated in mr stauntons mind respecting her character and real purpose and satisfied him at least that money did not enter into her scheme of deception if an impostor she should prove he next requested to know what part of the city she wished to go to  to a very decent merchant a cousin o my ain a mrs glass sir that sells snuff and tobacco at the sign o the thistle somegate in the town  jeanie communicated this intelligence with a feeling that a connection so respectable ought to give her consequence in the eyes of mr staunton and she was a good deal surprised when he answered  and is this woman your only acquaintance in london my poor girl and have you really no better knowledge where she is to be found  i was gaun to see the duke of argyle forby mrs glass said jeanie and if your honour thinks it would be best to go there first and get some of his graces folk to show me my cousins shop  are you acquainted with any of the duke of argyles people said the rector  no sir  her brain must be something touched after all or it would be impossible for her to rely on such introductionswell said he aloud i must not inquire into the cause of your journey and so i cannot be fit to give you advice how to manage it but the landlady of the house where the coach stops is a very decent person and as i use her house sometimes i will give you a recommendation to her  jeanie thanked him for his kindness with her best courtesy and said that with his honours line and ane from worthy mrs bickerton that keeps the seven stars at york she did not doubt to be well taken out in lunnon  and now said he i presume you will be desirous to set out immediately  if i had been in an inn sir or any suitable restingplace answered jeanie i wad not have presumed to use the lords day for travelling but as i am on a journey of mercy i trust my doing so will not be imputed  you may if you choose remain with mrs dalton for the evening but i desire you will have no farther correspondence with my son who is not a proper counsellor for a person of your age whatever your difficulties may be  your honour speaks ower truly in that said jeanie it was not with my will that i spoke wi him just now andnot to wish the gentleman onything but gudei never wish to see him between the een again  if you please added the rector as you seem to be a seriously disposed young woman you may attend family worship in the hall this evening  i thank your honour said jeanie but i am doubtful if my attendance would be to edification  how said the rector so young and already unfortunate enough to have doubts upon the duties of religion  god forbid sir replied jeanie it is not for that but i have been bred in the faith of the suffering remnant of the presbyterian doctrine in scotland and i am doubtful if i can lawfully attend upon your fashion of worship seeing it has been testified against by many precious souls of our kirk and specially by my worthy father  well my good girl said the rector with a goodhumoured smile far be it from me to put any force upon your conscience and yet you ought to recollect that the same divine grace dispenses its streams to other kingdoms as well as to scotland as it is as essential to our spiritual as water to our earthly wants its springs various in character yet alike efficacious in virtue are to be found in abundance throughout the christian world  ah but said jeanie though the waters may be alike yet with your worships leave the blessing upon them may not be equal it would have been in vain for naaman the syrian leper to have bathed in pharpar and abana rivers of damascus when it was only the waters of jordon that were sanctified for the cure  well said the rector we will not enter upon the great debate betwixt our national churches at present we must endeavour to satisfy you that at least amongst our errors we preserve christian charity and a desire to assist our brethren  he then ordered mrs dalton into his presence and consigned jeanie to her particular charge with directions to be kind to her and with assurances that early in the morning a trusty guide and a good horse should be ready to conduct her to stamford he then took a serious and dignified yet kind leave of her wishing her full success in the objects of her journey which he said he doubted not were laudable from the soundness of thinking which she had displayed in conversation  jeanie was again conducted by the housekeeper to her own apartment but the evening was not destined to pass over without farther torment from young staunton a paper was slipped into her hand by the faithful tummas which intimated his young masters desire or rather demand to see her instantly and assured her he had provided against interruption  tell your young master said jeanie openly and regardless of all the winks and signs by which tummas strove to make her comprehend that mrs dalton was not to be admitted into the secret of the correspondence that i promised faithfully to his worthy father that i would not see him again  tummas said mrs dalton i think you might be much more creditably employed considering the coat you wear and the house you live in than to be carrying messages between your young master and girls that chance to be in this house  why mrs dalton as to that i was hired to carry messages and not to ask any questions about them and its not for the like of me to refuse the young gentlemans bidding if he were a little wildish or so if there was harm meant theres no harm done you see  however said mrs dalton i gie you fair warning tummas ditton that an i catch thee at this work again his reverence shall make a clear house of you  thomas retired abashed and in dismay the rest of the evening passed away without anything worthy of notice  jeanie enjoyed the comforts of a good bed and a sound sleep with grateful satisfaction after the perils and hardships of the preceding day and such was her fatigue that she slept soundly until six oclock when she was awakened by mrs dalton who acquainted her that her guide and horse were ready and in attendance she hastily rose and after her morning devotions was soon ready to resume her travels the motherly care of the housekeeper had provided an early breakfast and after she had partaken of this refreshment she found herself safe seated on a pillion behind a stout lincolnshire peasant who was besides armed with pistols to protect her against any violence which might be offered  they trudged along in silence for a mile or two along a country road which conducted them by hedge and gateway into the principal highway a little beyond grantham at length her master of the horse asked her whether her name was not jean or jane deans she answered in the affirmative with some surprise then heres a bit of a note as concerns you said the man handing it over his left shoulder its from young master as i judge and every man about willingham is fain to pleasure him either for love or fear for hell come to be landlord at last let them say what they like  jeanie broke the seal of the note which was addressed to her and read as follows  you refuse to see me i suppose you are shocked at my character but in painting myself such as i am you should give me credit for my sincerity i am at least no hypocrite you refuse however to see me and your conduct may be naturalbut is it wise i have expressed my anxiety to repair your sisters misfortunes at the expense of my honourmy familys honourmy own life and you think me too debased to be admitted even to sacrifice what i have remaining of honour fame and life in her cause well if the offerer be despised the victim is still equally at hand and perhaps there may be justice in the decree of heaven that i shall not have the melancholy credit of appearing to make this sacrifice out of my own free goodwill you as you have declined my concurrence must take the whole upon yourself go then to the duke of argyle and when other arguments fail you tell him you have it in your power to bring to condign punishment the most active conspirator in the porteous mob he will hear you on this topic should he be deaf to every other make your own terms for they will be at your own making you know where i am to be found and you may be assured i will not give you the dark side of the hill as at muschats cairn i have no thoughts of stirring from the house i was born in like the hare i shall be worried in the seat i started from i repeat itmake your own terms i need not remind you to ask your sisters life for that you will do of course but make terms of advantage for yourselfask wealth and rewardoffice and income for butlerask anythingyou will get anythingand all for delivering to the hands of the executioner a man most deserving of his officeone who though young in years is old in wickedness and whose most earnest desire is after the storms of an unquiet life to sleep and be at rest  this extraordinary letter was subscribed with the initials g s  jeanie read it over once or twice with great attention which the slow pace of the horse as he stalked through a deep lane enabled her to do with facility  when she had perused this billet her first employment was to tear it into as small pieces as possible and disperse these pieces in the air by a few at a time so that a document containing so perilous a secret might not fall into any other persons hand  the question how far in point of extremity she was entitled to save her sisters life by sacrificing that of a person who though guilty towards the state had done her no injury formed the next earnest and most painful subject of consideration in one sense indeed it seemed as if denouncing the guilt of staunton the cause of her sisters errors and misfortunes would have been an act of just and even providential retribution but jeanie in the strict and severe tone of morality in which she was educated had to consider not only the general aspect of a proposed action but its justness and fitness in relation to the actor before she could be according to her own phrase free to enter upon it what right had she to make a barter between the lives of staunton and of effie and to sacrifice the one for the safety of the other his guiltthat guilt for which he was amenable to the lawswas a crime against the public indeed but it was not against her  neither did it seem to her that his share in the death of porteous though her mind revolted at the idea of using violence to any one was in the relation of a common murder against the perpetrator of which every one is called to aid the public magistrate that violent action was blended with many circumstances which in the eyes of those in jeanies rank of life if they did not altogether deprive it of the character of guilt softened at least its most atrocious features the anxiety of the government to obtain conviction of some of the offenders had but served to increase the public feeling which connected the action though violent and irregular with the idea of ancient national independence the rigorous measures adopted or proposed against the city of edinburgh the ancient metropolis of scotlandthe extremely unpopular and injudicious measure of compelling the scottish clergy contrary to their principles and sense of duty to promulgate from the pulpit the reward offered for the discovery of the perpetrators of this slaughter had produced on the public mind the opposite consequences from what were intended and jeanie felt conscious that whoever should lodge information concerning that event and for whatsoever purpose it might be done it would be considered as an act of treason against the independence of scotland with the fanaticism of the scottish presbyterians there was always mingled a glow of national feeling and jeanie trembled at the idea of her name being handed down to posterity with that of the fause monteath and one or two others who having deserted and betrayed the cause of their country are damned to perpetual remembrance and execration among its peasantry yet to part with effies life once more when a word spoken might save it pressed severely on the mind of her affectionate sister  the lord support and direct me said jeanie for it seems to be his will to try me with difficulties far beyond my ain strength  while this thought passed through jeanies mind her guard tired of silence began to show some inclination to be communicative he seemed a sensible steady peasant but not having more delicacy or prudence than is common to those in his situation he of course chose the willingham family as the subject of his conversation from this man jeanie learned some particulars of which she had hitherto been ignorant and which we will briefly recapitulate for the information of the reader  the father of george staunton had been bred a soldier and during service in the west indies had married the heiress of a wealthy planter by this lady he had an only child george staunton the unhappy young man who has been so often mentioned in this narrative he passed the first part of his early youth under the charge of a doting mother and in the society of negro slaves whose study it was to gratify his every caprice his father was a man of worth and sense but as he alone retained tolerable health among the officers of the regiment he belonged to he was much engaged with his duty besides mrs staunton was beautiful and wilful and enjoyed but delicate health so that it was difficult for a man of affection humanity and a quiet disposition to struggle with her on the point of her overindulgence to an only child indeed what mr staunton did do towards counteracting the baneful effects of his wifes system only tended to render it more pernicious for every restraint imposed on the boy in his fathers presence was compensated by treble license during his absence so that george staunton acquired even in childhood the habit of regarding his father as a rigid censor from whose severity he was desirous of emancipating himself as soon and absolutely as possible  when he was about ten years old and when his mind had received all the seeds of those evil weeds which afterwards grew apace his mother died and his father half heartbroken returned to england to sum up her imprudence and unjustifiable indulgence she had contrived to place a considerable part of her fortune at her sons exclusive control or disposal in consequence of which management george staunton had not been long in england till he learned his independence and how to abuse it his father had endeavoured to rectify the defects of his education by placing him in a wellregulated seminary but although he showed some capacity for learning his riotous conduct soon became intolerable to his teachers he found means too easily afforded to all youths who have certain expectations of procuring such a command of money as enabled him to anticipate in boyhood the frolics and follies of a more mature age and with these accomplishments he was returned on his fathers hands as a profligate boy whose example might ruin a hundred  the elder mr staunton whose mind since his wifes death had been tinged with a melancholy which certainly his sons conduct did not tend to dispel had taken orders and was inducted by his brother sir william staunton into the family living of willingham the revenue was a matter of consequence to him for he derived little advantage from the estate of his late wife and his own fortune was that of a younger brother  he took his son to reside with him at the rectory but he soon found that his disorders rendered him an intolerable inmate and as the young men of his own rank would not endure the purseproud insolence of the creole he fell into that taste for low society which is worse than pressing to death whipping or hanging his father sent him abroad but he only returned wilder and more desperate than before it is true this unhappy youth was not without his good qualities he had lively wit good temper reckless generosity and manners which while he was under restraint might pass well in society but all these availed him nothing he was so well acquainted with the turf the gamingtable the cockpit and every worse rendezvous of folly and dissipation that his mothers fortune was spent before he was twentyone and he was soon in debt and in distress his early history may be concluded in the words of our british juvenal when describing a similar character               headstrong determined in his own career              he thought reproof unjust and truth severe                   the souls disease was to its crisis come              he first abused and then abjured his home                   and when he chose a vagabond to be              he made his shame his glory ill be free                    crabbes borough letter xii  and yet tis pity on measter george too continued the honest boor for he has an open hand and winna let a poor body want an he has it  the virtue of profuse generosity by which indeed they themselves are most directly advantaged is readily admitted by the vulgar as a cloak for many sins  at stamford our heroine was deposited in safety by her communicative guide she obtained a place in the coach which although termed a light one and accommodated with no fewer than six horses only reached london on the afternoon of the second day the recommendation of the elder mr staunton procured jeanie a civil reception at the inn where the carriage stopped and by the aid of mrs bickertons correspondent she found out her friend and relative mrs glass by whom she was kindly received and hospitably entertained       chapter eleventh             my name is argyle you may well think it strange                to live at the court and never to change                                 ballad  few names deserve more honourable mention in the history of scotland during this period than that of john duke of argyle and greenwich his talents as a statesman and a soldier were generally admitted he was not without ambition but without the illness that attends itwithout that irregularity of thought and aim which often excites great men in his peculiar situation for it was a very peculiar one to grasp the means of raising themselves to power at the risk of throwing a kingdom into confusion pope has distinguished him as             argyle the states whole thunder born to wield                and shake alike the senate and the field  he was alike free from the ordinary vices of statesmen falsehood namely and dissimulation and from those of warriors inordinate and violent thirst after selfaggrandisement  scotland his native country stood at this time in a very precarious and doubtful situation she was indeed united to england but the cement had not had time to acquire consistence the irritation of ancient wrongs still subsisted and betwixt the fretful jealousy of the scottish and the supercilious disdain of the english quarrels repeatedly occurred in the course of which the national league so important to the safety of both was in the utmost danger of being dissolved scotland had besides the disadvantage of being divided into intestine factions which hated each other bitterly and waited but a signal to break forth into action  in such circumstances another man with the talents and rank of argyle but without a mind so happily regulated would have sought to rise from the earth in the whirlwind and direct its fury he chose a course more safe and more honourable soaring above the petty distinctions of faction his voice was raised whether in office or opposition for those measures which were at once just and lenient his high military talents enabled him during the memorable year 1715 to render such services to the house of hanover as perhaps were too great to be either acknowledged or repaid he had employed too his utmost influence in softening the consequences of that insurrection to the unfortunate gentlemen whom a mistaken sense of loyalty had engaged in the affair and was rewarded by the esteem and affection of his country in an uncommon degree this popularity with a discontented and warlike people was supposed to be a subject of jealousy at court where the power to become dangerous is sometimes of itself obnoxious though the inclination is not united with it besides the duke of argyles independent and somewhat haughty mode of expressing himself in parliament and acting in public were ill calculated to attract royal favour he was therefore always respected and often employed but he was not a favourite of george the second his consort or his ministers at several different periods in his life the duke might be considered as in absolute disgrace at court although he could hardly be said to be a declared member of opposition this rendered him the dearer to scotland because it was usually in her cause that he incurred the displeasure of his sovereign and upon this very occasion of the porteous mob the animated and eloquent opposition which he had offered to the severe measures which were about to be adopted towards the city of edinburgh was the more gratefully received in that metropolis as it was understood that the dukes interposition had given personal offence to queen caroline  his conduct upon this occasion as indeed that of all the scottish members of the legislature with one or two unworthy exceptions had been in the highest degree spirited the popular tradition concerning his reply to queen caroline has been given already and some fragments of his speech against the porteous bill are still remembered he retorted upon the chancellor lord hardwicke the insinuation that he had stated himself in this case rather as a party than as a judgei appeal said argyle to the houseto the nation if i can be justly branded with the infamy of being a jobber or a partisan have i been a briber of votesa buyer of boroughsthe agent of corruption for any purpose or on behalf of any partyconsider my life examine my actions in the field and in the cabinet and see where there lies a blot that can attach to my honour i have shown myself the friend of my countrythe loyal subject of my king i am ready to do so again without an instants regard to the frowns or smiles of a court i have experienced both and am prepared with indifference for either i have given my reasons for opposing this bill and have made it appear that it is repugnant to the international treaty of union to the liberty of scotland and reflectively to that of england to common justice to common sense and to the public interest shall the metropolis of scotland the capital of an independent nation the residence of a long line of monarchs by whom that noble city was graced and dignifiedshall such a city for the fault of an obscure and unknown body of rioters be deprived of its honours and its privilegesits gates and its guardsand shall a native scotsman tamely behold the havoc i glory my lords in opposing such unjust rigour and reckon it my dearest pride and honour to stand up in defence of my native country while thus laid open to undeserved shame and unjust spoliation  other statesmen and orators both scottish and english used the same arguments the bill was gradually stripped of its most oppressive and obnoxious clauses and at length ended in a fine upon the city of edinburgh in favour of porteouss widow so that as somebody observed at the time the whole of these fierce debates ended in making the fortune of an old cookmaid such having been the good womans original capacity  the court however did not forget the baffle they had received in this affair and the duke of argyle who had contributed so much to it was thereafter considered as a person in disgrace it is necessary to place these circumstances under the readers observation both because they are connected with the preceding and subsequent part of our narrative  the duke was alone in his study when one of his gentlemen acquainted him that a countrygirl from scotland was desirous of speaking with his grace  a countrygirl and from scotland said the duke what can have brought the silly fool to londonsome lover pressed and sent to sea or some stock sank in the southsea funds or some such hopeful concern i suppose and then nobody to manage the matter but maccallummorewell this same popularity has its inconvenienceshowever show our countrywoman up archibaldit is ill manners to keep her in attendance  a young woman of rather low stature and whose countenance might be termed very modest and pleasing in expression though sunburnt somewhat freckled and not possessing regular features was ushered into the splendid library she wore the tartan plaid of her country adjusted so as partly to cover her head and partly to fall back over her shoulders a quantity of fair hair disposed with great simplicity and neatness appeared in front of her round and goodhumoured face to which the solemnity of her errand and her sense of the dukes rank and importance gave an appearance of deep awe but not of slavish fear or fluttered bashfulness the rest of jeanies dress was in the style of scottish maidens of her own class but arranged with that scrupulous attention to neatness and cleanliness which we often find united with that purity of mind of which it is a natural emblem  she stopped near the entrance of the room made her deepest reverence and crossed her hands upon her bosom without uttering a syllable the duke of argyle advanced towards her and if she admired his graceful deportment and rich dress decorated with the orders which had been deservedly bestowed on him his courteous manner and quick and intelligent cast of countenance he on his part was not less or less deservedly struck with the quiet simplicity and modesty expressed in the dress manners and countenance of his humble countrywoman  did you wish to speak with me my bonny lass said the duke using the encouraging epithet which at once acknowledged the connection betwixt them as countryfolk or did you wish to see the duchess  my business is with your honour my lordi mean your lordships grace  and what is it my good girl said the duke in the same mild and encouraging tone of voice jeanie looked at the attendant leave us archibald said the duke and wait in the anteroom the domestic retired and now sit down my good lass said the duke take your breathtake your time and tell me what you have got to say i guess by your dress you are just come up from poor scotlanddid you come through the streets in your tartan plaid  no sir said jeanie a friend brought me in ane o their street coachesa very decent woman she added her courage increasing as she became familiar with the sound of her own voice in such a presence your lordships grace kens herits mrs glass at the sign o the thistle  o my worthy snuffmerchanti have always a chat with mrs glass when i purchase my scots highdried well but your business my bonny womantime and tide you know wait for no one  your honouri beg your lordships pardoni mean your gracefor it must be noticed that this matter of addressing the duke by his appropriate title had been anxiously inculcated upon jeanie by her friend mrs glass in whose eyes it was a matter of such importance that her last words as jeanie left the coach were mind to say your grace and jeanie who had scarce ever in her life spoke to a person of higher quality than the laird of dumbiedikes found great difficulty in arranging her language according to the rules of ceremony  the duke who saw her embarrassment said with his usual affability never mind my grace lassie just speak out a plain tale and show you have a scots tongue in your head  sir i am muckle obligedsir i am the sister of that poor unfortunate criminal effie deans who is ordered for execution at edinburgh  ah said the duke i have heard of that unhappy story i thinka case of childmurder under a special act of parliamentduncan forbes mentioned it at dinner the other day  and i was come up frae the north sir to see what could be done for her in the way of getting a reprieve or pardon sir or the like of that  alas my poor girl said the duke you have made a long and a sad journey to very little purposeyour sister is ordered for execution  but i am given to understand that there is law for reprieving her if it is in the kings pleasure said jeanie  certainly there is said the duke but that is purely in the kings breast the crime has been but too commonthe scots crownlawyers think it is right there should be an example then the late disorders in edinburgh have excited a prejudice in government against the nation at large which they think can only be managed by measures of intimidation and severity what argument have you my poor girl except the warmth of your sisterly affection to offer against all thiswhat is your interestwhat friends have you at court  none excepting god and your grace said jeanie still keeping her ground resolutely however  alas said the duke i could almost say with old ormond that there could not be any whose influence was smaller with kings and ministers it is a cruel part of our situation young womani mean of the situation of men in my circumstances that the public ascribe to them influence which they do not possess and that individuals are led to expect from them assistance which we have no means of rendering but candour and plain dealing is in the power of every one and i must not let you imagine you have resources in my influence which do not exist to make your distress the heavieri have no means of averting your sisters fateshe must die  we must a die sir said jeanie it is our common doom for our fathers transgression but we shouldna hasten ilk other out o the world thats what your honour kens better than me  my good young woman said the duke mildly we are all apt to blame the law under which we immediately suffer but you seem to have been well educated in your line of life and you must know that it is alike the law of god and man that the murderer shall surely die  but sir effiethat is my poor sister sircanna be proved to be a murderer and if she be not and the law take her life notwithstanding wha is it that is the murderer then  i am no lawyer said the duke and i own i think the statute a very severe one  you are a lawmaker sir with your leave and therefore ye have power over the law answered jeanie  not in my individual capacity said the duke though as one of a large body i have a voice in the legislation but that cannot serve younor have i at present i care not who knows it so much personal influence with the sovereign as would entitle me to ask from him the most insignificant favour what could tempt you young woman to address yourself to me  it was yourself sir  myself he repliedi am sure you have never seen me before  no sir but a the world kens that the duke of argyle is his countrys friend and that ye fight for the right and speak for the right and that theres nane like you in our present israel and so they that think themselves wranged draw to refuge under your shadow and if ye wunna stir to save the blood of an innocent countrywoman of your ain what should we expect frae southerns and strangers and maybe i had another reason for troubling your honour  and what is that asked the duke  i hae understood from my father that your honours house and especially your gudesire and his father laid down their lives on the scaffold in the persecuting time and my father was honoured to gie his testimony baith in the cage and in the pillory as is specially mentioned in the books of peter walker the packman that your honour i dare say kens for he uses maist partly the westland of scotland and sir theres ane that takes concern in me that wished me to gang to your graces presence for his gudesire had done your gracious gudesire some good turn as ye will see frae these papers  with these words she delivered to the duke the little parcel which she had received from butler he opened it and in the envelope read with some surprise musterroll of the men serving in the troop of that godly gentleman captain

evangelical armythat last fellow should understand his wheelings to judge by his namebut what does all this mean my girl  it was the other paper sir said jeanie somewhat abashed at the mistake  o this is my unfortunate grandfathers hand sure enoughto all who may have friendship for the house of argyle these are to certify that benjamin butler of monks regiment of dragoons having been under god the means of saving my life from four english troopers who were about to slay me i having no other present means of recompense in my power do give him this acknowledgment hoping that it may be useful to him or his during these troublesome times and do conjure my friends tenants kinsmen and whoever will do aught for me either in the highlands or lowlands to protect and assist the said benjamin butler and his friends or family on their lawful occasions giving them such countenance maintenance and supply as may correspond with the benefit he hath bestowed on me witness my handlorne  this is a strong injunctionthis benjamin butler was your grandfather i supposeyou seem too young to have been his daughter  he was nae akin to me sirhe was grandfather to aneto a neighbours sonto a sincere weelwisher of mine sir dropping her little courtesy as she spoke  o i understand said the dukea truelove affair he was the grandsire of one you are engaged to  one i was engaged to sir said jeanie sighing but this unhappy business of my poor sister  what said the duke hastilyhe has not deserted you on that account has he  no sir he wad be the last to leave a friend in difficulties said jeanie but i maun think for him as weel as for mysell he is a clergyman sir and it would not beseem him to marry the like of me wi this disgrace on my kindred  you are a singular young woman said the duke you seem to me to think of every one before yourself and have you really come up from edinburgh on foot to attempt this hopeless solicitation for your sisters life  it was not athegither on foot sir answered jeanie for i sometimes got a cast in a waggon and i had a horse from ferrybridge and then the coach  well never mind all that interrupted the dukewhat reason have you for thinking your sister innocent  because she has not been proved guilty as will appear from looking at these papers  she put into his hand a note of the evidence and copies of her sisters declaration these papers butler had procured after her departure and saddletree had them forwarded to london to mrs glasss care so that jeanie found the documents so necessary for supporting her suit lying in readiness at her arrival  sit down in that chair my good girl said the dukeuntil i glance over the papers  she obeyed and watched with the utmost anxiety each change in his countenance as he cast his eye through the papers briefly yet with attention and making memoranda as he went along after reading them hastily over he looked up and seemed about to speak yet changed his purpose as if afraid of committing himself by giving too hasty an opinion and read over again several passages which he had marked as being most important all this he did in shorter time than can be supposed by men of ordinary talents for his mind was of that acute and penetrating character which discovers with the glance of intuition what facts bear on the particular point that chances to be subjected to consideration at length he rose after a few minutes deep reflection young woman said he your sisters case must certainly be termed a hard one  god bless you sir for that very word said jeanie  it seems contrary to the genius of british law continued the duke to take that for granted which is not proved or to punish with death for a crime which for aught the prosecutor has been able to show may not have been committed at all  god bless you sir again said jeanie who had risen from her seat and with clasped hands eyes glittering through tears and features which trembled with anxiety drank in every word which the duke uttered  but alas my poor girl he continued what good will my opinion do you unless i could impress it upon those in whose hands your sisters life is placed by the law besides i am no lawyer and i must speak with some of our scottish gentlemen of the gown about the matter  o but sir what seems reasonable to your honour will certainly be the same to them answered jeanie  i do not know that replied the duke ilka man buckles his belt his ain gateyou know our old scots proverbbut you shall not have placed this reliance on me altogether in vain leave these papers with me and you shall hear from me tomorrow or next day take care to be at home at mrs glasss and ready to come to me at a moments warning it will be unnecessary for you to give mrs glass the trouble to attend youand by the by you will please to be dressed just as you are at present  i wad hae putten on a cap sir said jeanie but your honour kens it isna the fashion of my country for single women and i judged that being sae mony hundred miles frae hame your graces heart wad warm to the tartan looking at the corner of her plaid  you judged quite right said the duke i know the full value of the snood and maccallummores heart will be as cold as death can make it when it does not warm to the tartan now go away and dont be out of the way when i send  jeanie repliedthere is little fear of that sir for i have little heart to go to see sights amang this wilderness of black houses but if i might say to your gracious honour that if ye ever condescend to speak to ony ane that is of greater degree than yoursell though maybe it isna civil in me to say sae just if you would think there can be nae sic odds between you and them as between poor jeanie deans from st leonards and the duke of argyle and so dinna be chappit back or cast down wi the first rough answer  i am not apt said the duke laughing to mind rough answers muchdo not you hope too much from what i have promised i will do my best but god has the hearts of kings in his own hand  jeanie courtesied reverently and withdrew attended by the dukes gentleman to her hackneycoach with a respect which her appearance did not demand but which was perhaps paid to the length of the interview with which his master had honoured her      chapter twelfth                          ascend                while radiant summer opens all its pride                thy hill delightful shene here let us sweep                        the boundless landscape                                              thomson  from her kind and officious but somewhat gossiping friend mrs glass jeanie underwent a very close catechism on their road to the strand where the thistle of the good lady flourished in full glory and with its legend of nemo me impune distinguished a shop then well known to all scottish folk of high and low degree  and were you sure aye to say your grace to him said the good old lady for ane should make a distinction between maccallummore and the bits o southern bodies that they ca lords herethere are as mony o them jeanie as would gar ane think they maun cost but little fash in the makingsome of them i wadna trust wi six penniesworth of blackrappeesome of them i wadna gie mysell the trouble to put up a hapnyworth in brown paper forbut i hope you showed your breeding to the duke of argyle for what sort of folk would he think your friends in london if you had been lording him and him a duke  he didna seem muckle to mind said jeanie he kend that i was landward bred  weel weel answered the good lady his grace kens me weel so i am the less anxious about it i never fill his snugbox but he says how dye do good mrs glasshow are all our friends in the north or it may behave ye heard from the north lately and you may be sure i make my best courtesy and answer my lord duke i hope your graces noble duchess and your graces young ladies are well and i hope the snuff continues to give your grace satisfaction and then ye will see the people in the shop begin to look about them and if theres a scotsman as there may be three or halfadozen aff go the hats and mony a look after him and there goes the prince of scotland god bless him but ye have not told me yet the very words he said tye  jeanie had no intention to be quite so communicative she had as the reader may have observed some of the caution and shrewdness as well as of the simplicity of her country she answered generally that the duke had received her very compassionately and had promised to interest himself in her sisters affair and to let her hear from him in the course of the next day or the day after she did not choose to make any mention of his having desired her to be in readiness to attend him far less of his hint that she should not bring her landlady so that honest mrs glass was obliged to remain satisfied with the general intelligence above mentioned after having done all she could to extract more  it may easily be conceived that on the next day jeanie declined all invitations and inducements whether of exercise or curiosity to walk abroad and continued to inhale the close and somewhat professional atmosphere of mrs glasss small parlour the latter flavour it owed to a certain cupboard containing among other articles a few canisters of real havannah which whether from respect to the manufacture or out of a reverend fear of the exciseman mrs glass did not care to trust in the open shop below and which communicated to the room a scent that however fragrant to the nostrils of the connoisseur was not very agreeable to those of jeanie  dear sirs she said to herself i wonder how my cousins silk manty and her gowd watch or ony thing in the world can be worth sitting sneezing all her life in this little stilling room and might walk on green braes if she liked  mrs glass was equally surprised at her cousins reluctance to stir abroad and her indifference to the fine sights of london it would always help to pass away the time she said to have something to look at though ane was in distress but jeanie was unpersuadable  the day after her interview with the duke was spent in that hope delayed which maketh the heart sick minutes glided after minuteshours fled after hoursit became too late to have any reasonable expectation of hearing from the duke that day yet the hope which she disowned she could not altogether relinquish and her heart throbbed and her ears tingled with every casual sound in the shop below it was in vain the day wore away in the anxiety of protracted and fruitless expectation  the next morning commenced in the same manner but before noon a welldressed gentleman entered mrs glasss shop and requested to see a young woman from scotland  that will be my cousin jeanie deans mr archibald said mrs glass with a courtesy of recognisance have you any message for her from his grace the duke of argyle mr archibald i will carry it to her in a moment  i believe i must give her the trouble of stepping down mrs glass  jeaniejeanie deans said mrs glass screaming at the bottom of the little staircase which ascended from the corner of the shop to the higher regions jeaniejeanie deans i say come down stairs instantly here is the duke of argyles groom of the chambers desires to see you directly this was announced in a voice so loud as to make all who chanced to be within hearing aware of the important communication  it may easily be supposed that jeanie did not tarry long in adjusting herself to attend the summons yet her feet almost failed her as she came down stairs  i must ask the favour of your company a little way said archibald with civility  i am quite ready sir said jeanie  is my cousin going out mr archibald then i will hae to go wi her no doubtjames rasperlook to the shop jamesmr archibald pushing a jar towards him you take his graces mixture i think please to fill your box for old acquaintance sake while i get on my things  mr archibald transferred a modest parcel of snuff from the jar to his own mull but said he was obliged to decline the pleasure of mrs glasss company as his message was particularly to the young person  particularly to the young person said mrs glass is not that uncommon mr archibald but his grace is the best judge and you are a steady person mr archibald it is not every one that comes from a great mans house i would trust my cousin withbut jeanie you must not go through the streets with mr archibald with your tartan whatdyecallit there upon your shoulders as if you had come up with a drove of highland cattle wait till i bring down my silk cloak why well have the mob after you  i have a hackneycoach in waiting madam said mr archibald interrupting the officious old lady from whom jeanie might otherwise have found it difficult to escape and i believe i must not allow her time for any change of dress  so saying he hurried jeanie into the coach while she internally praised and wondered at the easy manner in which he shifted off mrs glasss officious offers and inquiries without mentioning his masters orders or entering into any explanation  on entering the coach mr archibald seated himself in the front seat opposite to our heroine and they drove on in silence after they had driven nearly halfanhour without a word on either side it occurred to jeanie that the distance and time did not correspond with that which had been occupied by her journey on the former occasion to and from the residence of the duke of argyle at length she could not help asking her taciturn companion whilk way they were going  my lord duke will inform you himself madam answered archibald with the same solemn courtesy which marked his whole demeanour almost as he spoke the hackneycoach drew up and the coachman dismounted and opened the door archibald got out and assisted jeanie to get down she found herself in a large turnpike road without the bounds of london upon the other side of which road was drawn up a plain chariot and four horses the panels without arms and the servants without liveries  you have been punctual i see jeanie said the duke of argyle as archibald opened the carriagedoor you must be my companion for the rest of the way archibald will remain here with the hackneycoach till your return  ere jeanie could make answer she found herself to her no small astonishment seated by the side of a duke in a carriage which rolled forward at a rapid yet smooth rate very different in both particulars from the lumbering jolting vehicle which she had just left and which lumbering and jolting as it was conveyed to one who had seldom been in a coach before a certain feeling of dignity and importance  young woman said the duke after thinking as attentively on your sisters case as is in my power i continue to be impressed with the belief that great injustice may be done by the execution of her sentence so are one or two liberal and intelligent lawyers of both countries whom i have spoken withnay pray hear me out before you thank mei have already told you my personal conviction is of little consequence unless i could impress the same upon others now i have done for you what i would certainly not have done to serve any purpose of my owni have asked an audience of a lady whose interest with the king is deservedly very high it has been allowed me and i am desirous that you should see her and speak for yourself you have no occasion to be abashed tell your story simply as you did to me  i am much obliged to your grace said jeanie remembering mrs glasss charge and i am sure since i have had the courage to speak to your grace in poor effies cause i have less reason to be shamefaced in speaking to a leddy but sir i would like to ken what to ca her whether your grace or your honour or your leddyship as we say to lairds and leddies in scotland and i will take care to mind it for i ken leddies are full mair particular than gentlemen about their titles of honour  you have no occasion to call her anything but madam just say what you think is likely to make the best impressionlook at me from time to timeand if i put my hand to my cravat soshowing her the motionyou will stop but i shall only do this when you say anything that is not likely to please  but sir your grace said jeanie if it wasna ower muckle trouble wad it no be better to tell me what i should say and i could get it by heart  no jeanie that would not have the same effectthat would be like reading a sermon you know which we good presbyterians think has less unction than when spoken without book replied the duke just speak as plainly and boldly to this lady as you did to me the day before yesterday and if you can gain her consent ill wad ye a plack as we say in the north that you get the pardon from the king  as he spoke he took a pamphlet from his pocket and began to read jeanie had good sense and tact which constitute betwixt them that which is called natural good breeding she interpreted the dukes manoeuvre as a hint that she was to ask no more questions and she remained silent accordingly  the carriage rolled rapidly onwards through fertile meadows ornamented with splendid old oaks and catching occasionally a glance of the majestic mirror of a broad and placid river after passing through a pleasant village the equipage stopped on a commanding eminence where the beauty of english landscape was displayed in its utmost luxuriance here the duke alighted and desired jeanie to follow him they paused for a moment on the brow of a hill to gaze on the unrivalled landscape which it presented a huge sea of verdure with crossing and intersecting promontories of massive and tufted groves was tenanted by numberless flocks and herds which seemed to wander unrestrained and unbounded through the rich pastures the thames here turreted with villas and there garlanded with forests moved on slowly and placidly like the mighty monarch of the scene to whom all its other beauties were but accessories and bore on its bosom an hundred barks and skiffs whose white sails and gaily fluttering pennons gave life to the whole  the duke of argyle was of course familiar with this scene but to a man of taste it must be always new yet as he paused and looked on this inimitable landscape with the feeling of delight which it must give to the bosom of every admirer of nature his thoughts naturally reverted to his own more grand and scarce less beautiful domains of inverary this is a fine scene he said to his companion curious perhaps to draw out her sentiments we have nothing like it in scotland  its braw rich feeding for the cows and they have a fine breed o cattle here replied jeanie but i like just as weel to look at the craigs of arthurs seat and the sea coming in ayont them as at a thae muckle trees  the duke smiled at a reply equally professional and national and made a signal for the carriage to remain where it was then adopting an unfrequented footpath he conducted jeanie through several complicated mazes to a posterndoor in a high brick wall  it was shut but as the duke tapped slightly at it a person in waiting within after reconnoitring through a small iron grate contrived for the purpose unlocked the door and admitted them they entered and it was immediately closed and fastened behind them this was all done quickly the door so instantly closing and the person who opened it so suddenly disappearing that jeanie could not even catch a glimpse of his exterior  they found themselves at the extremity of a deep and narrow alley carpeted with the most verdant and closeshaven turf which felt like velvet under their feet and screened from the sun by the branches of the lofty elms which united over the path and caused it to resemble in the solemn obscurity of the light which they admitted as well as from the range of columnar stems and intricate union of their arched branches one of the narrow side aisles in an ancient gothic cathedral       chapter thirteeth                              i beseech you             these tears beseech you and these chaste hands woo you             that never yet were heaved but to things holy             things like yourselfyou are a god above us                   be as a god then full of saving mercy                                             the bloody brother  encouraged as she was by the courteous manners of her noble countryman it was not without a feeling of something like terror that jeanie felt herself in a place apparently so lonely with a man of such high rank that she should have been permitted to wait on the duke in his own house and have been there received to a private interview was in itself an uncommon and distinguished event in the annals of a life so simple as hers but to find herself his travelling companion in a journey and then suddenly to be left alone with him in so secluded a situation had something in it of awful mystery a romantic heroine might have suspected and dreaded the power of her own charms but jeanie was too wise to let such a silly thought intrude on her mind still however she had a most eager desire to know where she now was and to whom she was to be presented  she remarked that the dukes dress though still such as indicated rank and fashion for it was not the custom of men of quality at that time to dress themselves like their own coachmen or grooms was nevertheless plainer than that in which she had seen him upon a former occasion and was divested in particular of all those badges of external decoration which intimated superior consequence in short he was attired as plainly as any gentleman of fashion could appear in the streets of london in a morning and this circumstance helped to shake an opinion which jeanie began to entertain that perhaps he intended she should plead her cause in the presence of royalty itself but surely said she to herself he wad hae putten on his braw star and garter an he had thought o coming before the face of majestyand after a this is mair like a gentlemans policy than a royal palace  there was some sense in jeanies reasoning yet she was not sufficiently mistress either of the circumstances of etiquette or the particular relations which existed betwixt the government and the duke of argyle to form an accurate judgment the duke as we have said was at this time in open opposition to the administration of sir robert walpole and was understood to be out of favour with the royal family to whom he had rendered such important services but it was a maxim of queen caroline to bear herself towards her political friends with such caution as if there was a possibility of their one day being her enemies and towards political opponents with the same degree of circumspection as if they might again become friendly to her measures since margaret of anjou no queenconsort had exercised such weight in the political affairs of england and the personal address which she displayed on many occasions had no small share in reclaiming from their political heresy many of those determined tories who after the reign of the stuarts had been extinguished in the person of queen anne were disposed rather to transfer their allegiance to her brother the chevalier de st george than to acquiesce in the settlement of the crown on the hanover family her husband whose most shining quality was courage in the field of battle and who endured the office of king of england without ever being able to acquire english habits or any familiarity with english dispositions found the utmost assistance from the address of his partner and while he jealously affected to do everything according to his own will and pleasure was in secret prudent enough to take and follow the advice of his more adroit consort he intrusted to her the delicate office of determining the various degrees of favour necessary to attach the wavering or to confirm such as were already friendly or to regain those whose goodwill had been lost  with all the winning address of an elegant and according to the times an accomplished woman queen caroline possessed the masculine soul of the other sex she was proud by nature and even her policy could not always temper her expressions of displeasure although few were more ready at repairing any false step of this kind when her prudence came up to the aid of her passions she loved the real possession of power rather than the show of it and whatever she did herself that was either wise or popular she always desired that the king should have the full credit as well as the advantage of the measure conscious that by adding to his respectability she was most likely to maintain her own and so desirous was she to comply with all his tastes that when threatened with the gout she had repeatedly had recourse to checking the fit by the use of the cold bath thereby endangering her life that she might be able to attend the king in his walks  it was a very consistent part of queen carolines character to keep up many private correspondences with those to whom in public she seemed unfavourable or who for various reasons stood ill with the court by this means she kept in her hands the thread of many a political intrigue and without pledging herself to anything could often prevent discontent from becoming hatred and opposition from exaggerating itself into rebellion if by any accident her correspondence with such persons chanced to be observed or discovered which she took all possible pains to prevent it was represented as a mere intercourse of society having no reference to politics an answer with which even the prime minister sir robert walpole was compelled to remain satisfied when he discovered that the queen had given a private audience to pulteney afterwards earl of bath his most formidable and most inveterate enemy  in thus maintaining occasional intercourse with several persons who seemed most alienated from the crown it may readily be supposed that queen caroline had taken care not to break entirely with the duke of argyle his high birth his great talents the estimation in which he was held in his own country the great services which he had rendered the house of brunswick in 1715 placed him high in that rank of persons who were not to be rashly neglected he had almost by his single and unassisted talents stopped the irruption of the banded force of all the highland chiefs there was little doubt that with the slightest encouragement he could put them all in motion and renew the civil war and it was well known that the most flattering overtures had been transmitted to the duke from the court of st germains the character and temper of scotland was still little known and it was considered as a volcano which might indeed slumber for a series of years but was still liable at a moment the least expected to break out into a wasteful irruption it was therefore of the highest importance to retain come hold over so important a personage as the duke of argyle and caroline preserved the power of doing so by means of a lady with whom as wife of george ii she might have been supposed to be on less intimate terms  it was not the least instance of the queens address that she had contrived that one of her principal attendants lady suffolk should unite in her own person the two apparently inconsistent characters of her husbands mistress and her own very obsequious and complaisant confidant by this dexterous management the queen secured her power against the danger which might most have threatened itthe thwarting influence of an ambitious rival and if she submitted to the mortification of being obliged to connive at her husbands infidelity she was at least guarded against what she might think its most dangerous effects and was besides at liberty now and then to bestow a few civil insults upon her good howard whom however in general she treated with great decorum   see horace walpoles reminiscences  lady suffolk lay under strong obligations to the duke of argyle for reasons which may be collected from horace walpoles reminiscences of that reign and through her means the duke had some occasional correspondence with queen caroline much interrupted however since the part he had taken in the debate concerning the porteous mob an affair which the queen though somewhat unreasonably was disposed to resent rather as an intended and premeditated insolence to her own person and authority than as a sudden ebullition of popular vengeance still however the communication remained open betwixt them though it had been of late disused on both sides these remarks will be found necessary to understand the scene which is about to be presented to the reader  from the narrow alley which they had traversed the duke turned into one of the same character but broader and still longer here for the first time since they had entered these gardens jeanie saw persons approaching them  they were two ladies one of whom walked a little behind the other yet not so much as to prevent her from hearing and replying to whatever observation was addressed to her by the lady who walked foremost and that without her having the trouble to turn her person as they advanced very slowly jeanie had time to study their features and appearance the duke also slackened his pace as if to give her time to collect herself and repeatedly desired her not to be afraid the lady who seemed the principal person had remarkably good features though somewhat injured by the smallpox that venomous scourge which each village esculapius thanks to jenner can now tame as easily as their tutelary deity subdued the python the ladys eyes were brilliant her teeth good and her countenance formed to express at will either majesty or courtesy her form though rather embonpoint was nevertheless graceful and the elasticity and firmness of her step gave no room to suspect what was actually the case that she suffered occasionally from a disorder the most unfavourable to pedestrian exercise her dress was rather rich than gay and her manner commanding and noble  her companion was of lower stature with light brown hair and expressive blue eyes her features without being absolutely regular were perhaps more pleasing than if they had been critically handsome a melancholy or at least a pensive expression for which her lot gave too much cause predominated when she was silent but gave way to a pleasing and goodhumoured smile when she spoke to any one  when they were within twelve or fifteen yards of these ladies the duke made a sign that jeanie should stand still and stepping forward himself with the grace which was natural to him made a profound obeisance which was formally yet in a dignified manner returned by the personage whom he approached  i hope she said with an affable and condescending smile that i see so great a stranger at court as the duke of argyle has been of late in as good health as his friends there and elsewhere could wish him to enjoy  the duke replied that he had been perfectly well and added that the necessity of attending to the public business before the house as well as the time occupied by a late journey to scotland had rendered him less assiduous in paying his duty at the levee and drawingroom than he could have desired  when your grace can find time for a duty so frivolous replied the queen you are aware of your title to be well received i hope my readiness to comply with the wish which you expressed yesterday to lady suffolk is a sufficient proof that one of the royal family at least has not forgotten ancient and important services in resenting something which resembles recent neglect this was said apparently with great good humour and in a tone which expressed a desire of conciliation  the duke replied that he would account himself the most unfortunate of men if he could be supposed capable of neglecting his duty in modes and circumstances when it was expected and would have been agreeable he was deeply gratified by the honour which her majesty was now doing to him personally and he trusted she would soon perceive that it was in a matter essential to his majestys interest that he had the boldness to give her this trouble  you cannot oblige me more my lord duke replied the queen than by giving me the advantage of your lights and experience on any point of the kings service your grace is aware that i can only be the medium through which the matter is subjected to his majestys superior wisdom but if it is a suit which respects your grace personally it shall lose no support by being preferred through me  it is no suit of mine madam replied the duke nor have i any to prefer for myself personally although i feel in full force my obligation to your majesty it is a business which concerns his majesty as a lover of justice and of mercy and which i am convinced may be highly useful in conciliating the unfortunate irritation which at present subsists among his majestys good subjects in scotland  there were two parts of this speech disagreeable to caroline in the first place it removed the flattering notion she had adopted that argyle designed to use her personal intercession in making his peace with the administration and recovering the employments of which he had been deprived and next she was displeased that he should talk of the discontents in scotland as irritations to be conciliated rather than suppressed  under the influence of these feelings she answered hastily that his majesty has good subjects in england my lord duke he is bound to thank god and the lawsthat he has subjects in scotland i think he may thank god and his sword  the duke though a courtier coloured slightly and the queen instantly sensible of her error added without displaying the least change of countenance and as if the words had been an original branch of the sentenceand the swords of those real scotchmen who are friends to the house of brunswick particularly that of his grace of argyle  my sword madam replied the duke like that of my fathers has been always at the command of my lawful king and of my native countryi trust it is impossible to separate their real rights and interests but the present is a matter of more private concern and respects the person of an obscure individual  what is the affair my lord said the queen let us find out what we are talking about lest we should misconstrue and misunderstand each other  the matter madam answered the duke of argyle regards the fate of an unfortunate young woman in scotland now lying under sentence of death for a crime of which i think it highly probable that she is innocent and my humble petition to your majesty is to obtain your powerful intercession with the king for a pardon  it was now the queens turn to colour and she did so over cheek and brow neck and bosom she paused a moment as if unwilling to trust her voice with the first expression of her displeasure and on assuming the air of dignity and an austere regard of control she at length replied my lord duke i will not ask your motives for addressing to me a request which circumstances have rendered such an extraordinary one your road to the kings closet as a peer and a privycouncillor entitled to request an audience was open without giving me the pain of this discussion i at least have had enough of scotch pardons  the duke was prepared for this burst of indignation and he was not shaken by it he did not attempt a reply while the queen was in the first heat of displeasure but remained in the same firm yet respectful posture which he had assumed during the interview the queen trained from her situation to selfcommand instantly perceived the advantage she might give against herself by yielding to passion and added in the same condescending and affable tone in which she had opened the interview you must allow me some of the privileges of the sex my lord and do not judge uncharitably of me though i am a little moved at the recollection of the gross insult and outrage done in your capital city to the royal authority at the very time when it was vested in my unworthy person your grace cannot be surprised that i should both have felt it at the time and recollected it now  it is certainly a matter not speedily to be forgotten answered the duke my own poor thoughts of it have been long before your majesty and i must have expressed myself very ill if i did not convey my detestation of the murder which was committed under such extraordinary circumstances i might indeed be so unfortunate as to differ with his majestys advisers on the degree in which it was either just or politic to punish the innocent instead of the guilty but i trust your majesty will permit me to be silent on a topic in which my sentiments have not the good fortune to coincide with those of more able men  we will not prosecute a topic on which we may probably differ said the queen one word however i may say in privateyou know our good lady suffolk is a little deafthe duke of argyle when disposed to renew his acquaintance with his master and mistress will hardly find many topics on which we should disagree  let me hope said the duke bowing profoundly to so flattering an intimation that i shall not be so unfortunate as to have found one on the present occasion  i must first impose on your grace the duty of confession said the queen before i grant you absolution what is your particular interest in this young woman she does not seem and she scanned jeanie as she said this with the eye of a connoisseur much qualified to alarm my friend the duchesss jealousy  i think your majesty replied the duke smiling in his turn will allow my taste may be a pledge for me on that score  then though she has not much the air dune grande dame i suppose she is some thirtieth cousin in the terrible chapter of scottish genealogy  no madam said the duke but i wish some of my nearer relations had half her worth honesty and affection  her name must be campbell at least said queen caroline  no madam her name is not quite so distinguished if i may be permitted to say so answered the duke  ah but she comes from inverary or argyleshire said the sovereign  she has never been farther north in her life than edinburgh madam  then my conjectures are all ended said the queen and your grace must yourself take the trouble to explain the affair of your protegee  with that precision and easy brevity which is only acquired by habitually conversing in the higher ranks of society and which is the diametrical opposite of that protracted style of disquisition             which squires call potter and which men call prose  the duke explained the singular law under which effie deans had received sentence of death and detailed the affectionate exertions which jeanie had made in behalf of a sister for whose sake she was willing to sacrifice all but truth and conscience  queen caroline listened with attention she was rather fond it must be remembered of an argument and soon found matter in what the duke told her for raising difficulties to his request  it appears to me my lord she replied that this is a severe law but still it is adopted upon good grounds i am bound to suppose as the law of the country and the girl has been convicted under it the very presumptions which the law construes into a positive proof of guilt exist in her case and all that your grace has said concerning the possibility of her innocence may be a very good argument for annulling the act of parliament but cannot while it stands good be admitted in favour of any individual convicted upon the statute  the duke saw and avoided the snare for he was conscious that by replying to the argument he must have been inevitably led to a discussion in the course of which the queen was likely to be hardened in her own opinion until she became obliged out of mere respect to consistency to let the criminal suffer   illustration jeanie and queen caroline194   if your majesty he said would condescend to hear my poor countrywoman herself perhaps she may find an advocate in your own heart more able than i am to combat the doubts suggested by your understanding  the queen seemed to acquiesce and the duke made a signal for jeanie to advance from the spot where she had hitherto remained watching countenances which were too long accustomed to suppress all apparent signs of emotion to convey to her any interesting intelligence her majesty could not help smiling at the awestruck manner in which the quiet demure figure of the little scotchwoman advanced towards her and yet more at the first sound of her broad northern accent but jeanie had a voice low and sweetly toned an admirable thing in woman and eke besought her leddyship to have pity on a poor misguided young creature in tones so affecting that like the notes of some of her native songs provincial vulgarity was lost in pathos  stand up young woman said the queen but in a kind tone and tell me what sort of a barbarous people your countryfolk are where childmurder is become so common as to require the restraint of laws like yours  if your leddyship pleases answered jeanie there are mony places besides scotland where mothers are unkind to their ain flesh and blood  it must be observed that the disputes between george the second and frederick prince of wales were then at the highest and that the goodnatured part of the public laid the blame on the queen she coloured highly and darted a glance of a most penetrating character first at jeanie and then at the duke both sustained it unmoved jeanie from total unconsciousness of the offence she had given and the duke from his habitual composure but in his heart he thought my unlucky protegee has with this luckless answer shot dead by a kind of chancemedley her only hope of success  lady suffolk goodhumouredly and skilfully interposed in this awkward crisis you should tell this lady she said to jeanie the particular causes which render this crime common in your country  some thinks its the kirksessionthat isits theits the cuttystool if your leddyship pleases said jeanie looking down and courtesying  the what said lady suffolk to whom the phrase was new and who besides was rather deaf  thats the stool of repentance madam if it please your leddyship answered jeanie for light life and conversation and for breaking the seventh command here she raised her eyes to the duke saw his hand at his chin and totally unconscious of what she had said out of joint gave double effect to the innuendo by stopping short and looking embarrassed  as for lady suffolk she retired like a covering party which having interposed betwixt their retreating friends and the enemy have suddenly drawn on themselves a fire unexpectedly severe  the deuce take the lass thought the duke of argyle to himself there goes another shotand she has hit with both barrels right and left  indeed the duke had himself his share of the confusion for having acted as master of ceremonies to this innocent offender he felt much in the circumstances of a country squire who having introduced his spaniel into a wellappointed drawingroom is doomed to witness the disorder and damage which arises to china and to dressgowns in consequence of its untimely frolics jeanies last chancehit however obliterated the ill impression which had arisen from the first for her majesty had not so lost the feelings of a wife in those of a queen but that she could enjoy a jest at the expense of her good suffolk she turned towards the duke of argyle with a smile which marked that she enjoyed the triumph and observed the scotch are a rigidly moral people then again applying herself to jeanie she asked how she travelled up from scotland  upon my foot mostly madam was the reply  what all that immense way upon foothow far can you walk in a day  fiveandtwenty miles and a bittock  and a what said the queen looking towards the duke of argyle  and about five miles more replied the duke  i thought i was a good walker said the queen but this shames me sadly  may your leddyship never hae sae weary a heart that ye canna be sensible of the weariness of the limbs said jeanie that came better off thought the duke its the first thing she has said to the purpose  and i didna just athegither walk the haill way neither for i had whiles the cast of a cart and i had the cast of a horse from ferrybridgeand divers other easements said jeanie cutting short her story for she observed the duke made the sign he had fixed upon  with all these accommodations answered the queen you must have had a very fatiguing journey and i fear to little purpose since if the king were to pardon your sister in all probability it would do her little good for i suppose your people of edinburgh would hang her out of spite  she will sink herself now outright thought the duke  but he was wrong the shoals on which jeanie had touched in this delicate conversation lay under ground and were unknown to her this rock was above water and she avoided it  she was confident she said that baith town and country wad rejoice to see his majesty taking compassion on a poor unfriended creature  his majesty has not found it so in a late instance said the queen but i suppose my lord duke would advise him to be guided by the votes of the rabble themselves who should be hanged and who spared  no madam said the duke but i would advise his majesty to be guided by his own feelings and those of his royal consort and then i am sure punishment will only attach itself to guilt and even then with cautious reluctance  well my lord said her majesty all these fine speeches do not convince me of the propriety of so soon showing any mark of favour to youri suppose i must not say rebelliousbut at least your very disaffected and intractable metropolis why the whole nation is in a league to screen the savage and abominable murderers of that unhappy man otherwise how is it possible but that of so many perpetrators and engaged in so public an action for such a length of time one at least must have been recognised even this wench for aught i can tell may be a depositary of the secrethark you young woman had you any friends engaged in the porteous mob  no madam answered jeanie happy that the question was so framed that she could with a good conscience answer it in the negative  but i suppose continued the queen if you were possessed of such a secret you would hold it a matter of conscience to keep it to yourself  i would pray to be directed and guided what was the line of duty madam answered jeanie  yes and take that which suited your own inclinations replied her majesty  if it like you madam said jeanie i would hae gaen to the end of the earth to save the life of john porteous or any other unhappy man in his condition but i might lawfully doubt how far i am called upon to be the avenger of his blood though it may become the civil magistrate to do so he is dead and gane to his place and they that have slain him must answer for their ain act but my sister my puir sister effie still lives though her days and hours are numbered she still lives and a word of the kings mouth might restore her to a brokenhearted auld man that never in his daily and nightly exercise forgot to pray that his majesty might be blessed with a long and a prosperous reign and that his throne and the throne of his posterity might be established in righteousness o madam if ever ye kend what it was to sorrow for and with a sinning and a suffering creature whose mind is sae tossed that she can be neither cad fit to live or die have some compassion on our miserysave an honest house from dishonour and an unhappy girl not eighteen years of age from an early and dreadful death alas it is not when we sleep soft and wake merrily ourselves that we think on other peoples sufferings our hearts are waxed light within us then and we are for righting our ain wrangs and fighting our ain battles but when the hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the bodyand seldom may it visit your leddyshipand when the hour of death comes that comes to high and lowlang and late may it be yoursoh my leddy then it isna what we hae dune for oursells but what we hae dune for others that we think on maist pleasantly and the thoughts that ye hae intervened to spare the puir things life will be sweeter in that hour come when it may than if a word of your mouth could hang the haill porteous mob at the tail of ae tow  tear followed tear down jeanies cheeks as her features glowing and quivering with emotion she pleaded her sisters cause with a pathos which was at once simple and solemn  this is eloquence said her majesty to the duke of argyle young woman she continued addressing herself to jeanie i cannot grant a pardon to your sisterbut you shall not want my warm intercession with his majesty take this housewife case she continued putting a small embroidered needlecase into jeanies hands do not open it now but at your leisureyou will find something in it which will remind you that you have had an interview with queen caroline  jeanie having her suspicions thus confirmed dropped on her knees and would have expanded herself in gratitude but the duke who was upon thorns lest she should say more or less than just enough touched his chin once more  our business is i think ended for the present my lord duke said the queen and i trust to your satisfaction hereafter i hope to see your grace more frequently both at richmond and st jamesscome lady suffolk we must wish his grace goodmorning  they exchanged their parting reverences and the duke so soon as the ladies had turned their backs assisted jeanie to rise from the ground and conducted her back through the avenue which she trode with the feeling of one who walks in her sleep      chapter fourteenth                       so soon as i can win the offended king                     i will be known your advocate                                              cymbeline  the duke of argyle led the way in silence to the small postern by which they had been admitted into richmond park so long the favourite residence of queen caroline it was opened by the same halfseen janitor and they found themselves beyond the precincts of the royal demesne still not a word was spoken on either side the duke probably wished to allow his rustic protegee time to recruit her faculties dazzled and sunk with colloquy sublime and betwixt what she had guessed had heard and had seen jeanie deanss mind was too much agitated to permit her to ask any questions  they found the carriage of the duke in the place where they had left it and when they resumed their places soon began to advance rapidly on their return to town  i think jeanie said the duke breaking silence you have every reason to congratulate yourself on the issue of your interview with her majesty  and that leddy was the queen herself said jeanie i misdoubted it when i saw that your honour didna put on your hatand yet i can hardly believe it even when i heard her speak it herself  it was certainly queen caroline replied the duke have you no curiosity to see what is in the little pocketbook  do you think the pardon will be in it sir said jeanie with the eager animation of hope  why no replied the duke that is unlikely they seldom carry these things about them unless they were likely to be wanted and besides her majesty told you it was the king not she who was to grant it  that is true too said jeanie but i am so confused in my mindbut does your honour think there is a certainty of effies pardon then continued she still holding in her hand the unopened pocketbook  why kings are kittle cattle to shoe behind as we say in the north replied the duke but his wife knows his trim and i have not the least doubt that the matter is quite certain  oh god be praised god be praised ejaculated jeanie and may the gude leddy never want the hearts ease she has gien me at this moment and god bless you too my lordwithout your help i wad neer hae won near her  the duke let her dwell upon this subject for a considerable time curious perhaps to see how long the feelings of gratitude would continue to supersede those of curiosity but so feeble was the latter feeling in jeanies mind that his grace with whom perhaps it was for the time a little stronger was obliged once more to bring forward the subject of the queens present it was opened accordingly in the inside of the case was the usual assortment of silk and needles with scissors tweezers etc and in the pocket was a bankbill for fifty pounds  the duke had no sooner informed jeanie of the value of this last document for she was unaccustomed to see notes for such sums than she expressed her regret at the mistake which had taken place for the hussy itsell she said was a very valuable thing for a keepsake with the queens name written in the inside with her ain hand doubtlesscarolineas plain as could be and a crown drawn aboon it  she therefore tendered the bill to the duke requesting him to find some mode of returning it to the royal owner  no no jeanie said the duke there is no mistake in the case her majesty knows you have been put to great expense and she wishes to make it up to you  i am sure she is even ower gude said jeanie and it glads me muckle that i can pay back dumbiedikes his siller without distressing my father honest man  dumbiedikes what a freeholder of midlothian is he not said his grace whose occasional residence in that county made him acquainted with most of the heritors as landed persons are termed in scotlandhe has a house not far from dalkeith wears a black wig and a laced hat  yes sir answered jeanie who had her reasons for being brief in her answers upon this topic  ah my old friend dumbie said the duke i have thrice seen him fou and only once heard the sound of his voiceis he a cousin of yours jeanie  no sirmy lord  then he must be a wellwisher i suspect  yeyesmy lord sir answered jeanie blushing and with hesitation  aha then if the laird starts i suppose my friend butler must be in some danger  o no sir answered jeanie much more readily but at the same time blushing much more deeply  well jeanie said the duke you are a girl may be safely trusted with your own matters and i shall inquire no farther about them but as to this same pardon i must see to get it passed through the proper forms and i have a friend in office who will for auld lang syne do me so much favour and then jeanie as i shall have occasion to send an express down to scotland who will travel with it safer and more swiftly than you can do i will take care to have it put into the proper channel meanwhile you may write to your friends by post of your good success  and does your honour think said jeanie that will do as weel as if i were to take my tap in my lap and slip my ways hame again on my ain errand  much better certainly said the duke you know the roads are not very safe for a single woman to travel  jeanie internally acquiesced in this observation  and i have a plan for you besides one of the duchesss attendants and one of mineyour acquaintance archibaldare going down to inverary in a light calash with four horses i have bought and there is room enough in the carriage for you to go with them as far as glasgow where archibald will find means of sending you safely to edinburghand in the way i beg you will teach the woman as much as you can of the mystery of cheesemaking for she is to have a charge in the dairy and i dare swear you are as tidy about your milkpail as about your dress  does your honour like cheese said jeanie with a gleam of conscious delight as she asked the question  like it said the duke whose goodnature anticipated what was to followcakes and cheese are a dinner for an emperor let alone a highlandman  because said jeanie with modest confidence and great and evident selfgratulation we have been thought so particular in making cheese that some folk think it as gude as the real dunlop and if your honours grace wad but accept a stane or twa blithe and fain and proud it wad make us but maybe ye may like the ewemilk that is the buckholmside cheese better or maybe the gaitmilk as ye come frae the highlandsand i canna pretend just to the same skeel o them but my cousin jean that lives at lockermachus in lammermuir i could speak to her and   the hilly pastures of buckholm which the author now surveysnot in the frenzy of a dreamers eyeare famed for producing the best ewemilk cheese in the south of scotland  quite unnecessary said the duke the dunlop is the very cheese of which i am so fond and i will take it as the greatest favour you can do me to send one to caroline park but remember be on honour with it jeanie and make it all yourself for i am a real good judge  i am not feared said jeanie confidently that i may please your honour for i am sure you look as if you could hardly find fault wi onybody that did their best and weel is it my part i trow to do mine  this discourse introduced a topic upon which the two travellers though so different in rank and education found each a good deal to say the duke besides his other patriotic qualities was a distinguished agriculturist and proud of his knowledge in that department he entertained jeanie with his observations on the different breeds of cattle in scotland and their capacity for the dairy and received so much information from her practical experience in return that he promised her a couple of devonshire cows in reward for the lesson in short his mind was so transported back to his rural employments and amusements that he sighed when his carriage stopped opposite to the old hackneycoach which archibald had kept in attendance at the place where they had left it while the coachman again bridled his lean cattle which had been indulged with a bite of musty hay the duke cautioned jeanie not to be too communicative to her landlady concerning what had passed there is he said no use of speaking of matters till they are actually settled and you may refer the good lady to archibald if she presses you hard with questions she is his old acquaintance and he knows how to manage with her  he then took a cordial farewell of jeanie and told her to be ready in the ensuing week to return to scotlandsaw her safely established in her hackneycoach and rolled of in his own carriage humming a stanza of the ballad which he is said to have composed                  at the sight of dumbarton once again                  ill cock up my bonnet and march amain                  with my claymore hanging down to my heel                  to whang at the bannocks of barley meal  perhaps one ought to be actually a scotsman to conceive how ardently under all distinctions of rank and situation they feel their mutual connection with each other as natives of the same country there are i believe more associations common to the inhabitants of a rude and wild than of a wellcultivated and fertile country their ancestors have more seldom changed their place of residence their mutual recollection of remarkable objects is more accurate the high and the low are more interested in each others welfare the feelings of kindred and relationship are more widely extended and in a word the bonds of patriotic affection always honourable even when a little too exclusively strained have more influence on mens feelings and actions  the rumbling hackneycoach which tumbled over the then execrable london pavement at a rate very different from that which had conveyed the ducal carriage to richmond at length deposited jeanie deans and her attendant at the national sign of the thistle mrs glass who had been in long and anxious expectation now rushed full of eager curiosity and openmouthed interrogation upon our heroine who was positively unable to sustain the overwhelming cataract of her questions which burst forth with the sublimity of a grand gardyloo  had she seen the duke god bless himthe duchessthe young ladies had she seen the king god bless himthe queenthe prince of walesthe princessor any of the rest of the royal familyhad she got her sisters pardonwas it out and outor was it only a commutation of punishmenthow far had she gonewhere had she driven towhom had she seenwhat had been saidwhat had kept her so long  such were the various questions huddled upon each other by a curiosity so eager that it could hardly wait for its own gratification jeanie would have been more than sufficiently embarrassed by this overbearing tide of interrogations had not archibald who had probably received from his master a hint to that purpose advanced to her rescue mrs glass said archibald his grace desired me particularly to say that he would take it as a great favour if you would ask the young woman no questions as he wishes to explain to you more distinctly than she can do how her affairs stand and consult you on some matters which she cannot altogether so well explain the duke will call at the thistle tomorrow or next day for that purpose  his grace is very condescending said mrs glass her zeal for inquiry slaked for the present by the dexterous administration of this sugar plumhis grace is sensible that i am in a manner accountable for the conduct of my young kinswoman and no doubt his grace is the best judge how far he should intrust her or me with the management of her affairs  his grace is quite sensible of that answered archibald with national gravity and will certainly trust what he has to say to the most discreet of the two and therefore mrs glass his grace relies you will speak nothing to mrs jean deans either of her own affairs or her sisters until he sees you himself he desired me to assure you in the meanwhile that all was going on as well as your kindness could wish mrs glass  his grace is very kindvery considerate certainly mr archibaldhis graces commands shall be obeyed andbut you have had a far drive mr archibald as i guess by the time of your absence and i guess with an engaging smile you winna be the waur o a glass of the right rosa solis  i thank you mrs glass said the great mans great man but i am under the necessity of returning to my lord directly and making his adieus civilly to both cousins he left the shop of the lady of the thistle  i am glad your affairs have prospered so well jeanie my love said mrs glass though indeed there was little fear of them so soon as the duke of argyle was so condescending as to take them into hand i will ask you no questions about them because his grace who is most considerate and prudent in such matters intends to tell me all that you ken yourself dear and doubtless a great deal more so that anything that may lie heavily on your mind may be imparted to me in the meantime as you see it is his graces pleasure that i should be made acquainted with the whole matter forthwith and whether you or he tells it will make no difference in the world ye ken if i ken what he is going to say beforehand i will be much more ready to give my advice and whether you or he tell me about it cannot much signify after all my dear so you may just say whatever you like only mind i ask you no questions about it  jeanie was a little embarrassed she thought that the communication she had to make was perhaps the only means she might have in her power to gratify her friendly and hospitable kinswoman but her prudence instantly suggested that her secret interview with queen caroline which seemed to pass under a certain sort of mystery was not a proper subject for the gossip of a woman like mrs glass of whose heart she had a much better opinion than of her prudence she therefore answered in general that the duke had had the extraordinary kindness to make very particular inquiries into her sisters bad affair and that he thought he had found the means of putting it a straight again but that he proposed to tell all that he thought about the matter to mrs glass herself  this did not quite satisfy the penetrating mistress of the thistle searching as her own small rappee she in spite of her promise urged jeanie with still farther questions had she been a that time at argyle house was the duke with her the whole time and had she seen the duchess and had she seen the young ladiesand specially lady caroline campbellto these questions jeanie gave the general reply that she knew so little of the town that she could not tell exactly where she had been that she had not seen the duchess to her knowledge that she had seen two ladies one of whom she understood bore the name of caroline and more she said she could not tell about the matter  it would be the dukes eldest daughter lady caroline campbell there is no doubt of that said mrs glass but doubtless i shall know more particularly through his graceand so as the cloth is laid in the little parlour above stairs and it is past three oclock for i have been waiting this hour for you and i have had a snack myself and as they used to say in scotland in my timei do not ken if the word be used nowthere is ill talking between a full body and a fasting      chapter fifteenth             heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid                    some banished lover or some captive maid                                           pope  by dint of unwonted labour with the pen jeanie deans contrived to indite and give to the charge of the postman on the ensuing day no less than three letters an exertion altogether strange to her habits insomuch so that if milk had been plenty she would rather have made thrice as many dunlop cheeses the first of them was very brief it was addressed to george staunton esq at the rectory willingham by grantham the address being part of the information she had extracted from the communicative peasant who rode before her to stamford it was in these words  sirto prevent farder mischieves whereof there hath been enough comes these sir i have my sisters pardon from the queens majesty whereof i do not doubt you will be glad having had to say naut of matters whereof you know the purport so sir i pray for your better welfare in bodie and soul and that it will please the fisycian to visit you in his good time alwaies sir i pray you will never come again to see my sister whereof there has been too much and so wishing you no evil but even your best good that you may be turned from your iniquity for why suld ye die i rest your humble servant to command                                                        ye ken wha  the next letter was to her father it is too long altogether for insertion so we only give a few extracts it commenced  dearest and truly honoured fatherthis comes with my duty to inform you that it has pleased god to redeem that captivitie of my poor sister in respect the queens blessed majesty for whom we are ever bound to pray hath redeemed her soul from the slayer granting the ransom of her whilk is ane pardon or reprieve and i spoke with the queen face to face and yet live for she is not muckle differing from other grand leddies saying that she has a stately presence and een like a blue huntin hawks whilk gaed throu and throu me like a highland durkand all this good was alway under the great giver to whom all are but instruments wrought forth for us by the duk of argile wha is ane native truehearted scotsman and not pridefu like other folk we ken ofand likewise skeely enow in bestial whereof he has promised to gie me twa devonshire kye of which he is enamoured although i do still haud by the real hawlit airshire breedand i have promised him a cheese and i wad wuss ye if gowans the brockit cow has a quey that she suld suck her fill of milk as i am given to understand he has none of that breed and is not scornfu but will take a thing frae a puir body that it may lighten their heart of the loading of debt that they awe him also his honour the duke will accept ane of our dunlop cheeses and it sall be my faut if a better was ever yearned in lowdenhere follow some observations respecting the breed of cattle and the produce of the dairy which it is our intention to forward to the board of agriculturenevertheless these are but matters of the afterharvest in respect of the great good which providence hath gifted us withand in especial poor effies life and oh my dear father since it hath pleased god to be merciful to her let her not want your free pardon whilk will make her meet to be ane vessel of grace and also a comfort to your ain graie hairs dear father will ye let the laird ken that we have had friends strangely raised up to us and that the talent whilk he lent me will be thankfully repaid i hae some of it to the fore and the rest of it is not knotted up in ane purse or napkin but in ane wee bit paper as is the fashion heir whilk i am assured is gude for the siller and dear father through mr butlers means i hae gude friendship with the duke for their had been kindness between their forbears in the auld troublesome time byepast and mrs glass has been kind like my very mother she has a braw house here and lives bien and warm wi twa servant lasses and a man and a callant in the shop and she is to send you doun a pound of her hiedried and some other tobaka and we maun think of some propine for her since her kindness hath been great and the duk is to send the pardun doun by an express messenger in respect that i canna travel sae fast and i am to come doun wi twa of his honours servantsthat is john archibald a decent elderly gentleman that says he has seen you lang syne when ye were buying beasts in the west frae the laird of aughtermuggitiebut maybe ye winna mind himony way hes a civil manand mrs dolly dutton that is to be dairymaid at inverara and they bring me on as far as glasgo whilk will make it nae pinch to win hame whilk i desire of all things may the giver of all good things keep ye in your outgauns and incomings whereof devoutly prayeth your loving dauter                                                   jean deans  the third letter was to butler and its tenor as follows  master butlersirit will be pleasure to you to ken that all i came for is thanks be to god weel dune and to the gude end and that your forbears letter was right welcome to the duke of argile and that he wrote your name down with a kylevine pen in a leathern book whereby it seems like he will do for you either wi a scule or a kirk he has enow of baith as i am assured and i have seen the queen which gave me a hussycase out of her own hand she had not her crown and skeptre but they are laid by for her like the bairns best claise to be worn when she needs them and they are keepit in a tour whilk is not like the tour of libberton nor yet craigmillar but mair like to the castell of edinburgh if the buildings were taen and set down in the midst of the norloch also the queen was very bounteous giving me a paper worth fiftie pounds as i am assured to pay my expenses here and back agen sae master butler as we were aye neebours bairns forby onything else that may hae been spoken between us i trust you winna skrimp yoursell for what is needfu for your health since it signifies not muckle whilk o us has the siller if the other wants it and mind this is no meant to haud ye to onything whilk ye wad rather forget if ye suld get a charge of a kirk or a scule as above said only i hope it will be a scule and not a kirk because of these difficulties anent aiths and patronages whilk might gang ill down wi my honest father only if ye could compass a harmonious call frae the parish of skreeghmedead as ye anes had hope of i trow it wad please him weel since i hae heard him say that the root of the matter was mair deeply hafted in that wild muirland parish than in the canongate of edinburgh i wish i had whaten books ye wanted mr butler for they hae haill houses of them here and they are obliged to set sum out in the street whilk are sald cheap doubtless to get them out of the weather it is a muckle place and i hae seen sae muckle of it that my poor head turns round and ye ken langsyne i am nae great penwoman and it is near eleven oclock o the night i am cumming down in good company and safeand i had troubles in gaun up whilk makes me blither of travelling wi kend folk my cousin mrs glass has a braw house here but a thing is sae poisoned wi snuff that i am like to be scomfished whiles but what signifies these things in comparison of the great deliverance whilk has been vouchsafed to my fathers house in whilk you as our auld and dear wellwisher will i dout not rejoice and be exceedingly glad and i am dear mr butler your sincere wellwisher in temporal and eternal things                                                   j d  after these labours of an unwonted kind jeanie retired to her bed yet scarce could sleep a few minutes together so often was she awakened by the heartstirring consciousness of her sisters safety and so powerfully urged to deposit her burden of joy where she had before laid her doubts and sorrows in the warm and sincere exercises of devotion  all the next and all the succeeding day mrs glass fidgeted about her shop in the agony of expectation like a pea to use a vulgar simile which her profession renders appropriate upon one of her own tobacco pipes with the third morning came the expected coach with four servants clustered behind on the footboard in dark brown and yellow liveries the duke in person with laced coat goldheaded cane star and garter all as the storybook says very grand  he inquired for his little countrywoman of mrs glass but without requesting to see her probably because he was unwilling to give an appearance of personal intercourse betwixt them which scandal might have misinterpreted the queen he said to mrs glass had taken the case of her kinswoman into her gracious consideration and being specially moved by the affectionate and resolute character of the elder sister had condescended to use her powerful intercession with his majesty in consequence of which a pardon had been despatched to scotland to effie deans on condition of her banishing herself forth of scotland for fourteen years the kings advocate had insisted he said upon this qualification of the pardon having pointed out to his majestys ministers that within the course of only seven years twentyone instances of childmurder had occurred in scotland  weary on him said mrs glass what for needed he to have telled that of his ain country and to the english folk abune a i used aye to think the advocate a douce decent man but it is an ill birdbegging your graces pardon for speaking of such a coorse byword   its an ill bird that fouls its own pest  and then what is the poor lassie to do in a foreign landwhy waes me its just sending her to play the same pranks ower again out of sight or guidance of her friends  pooh pooh said the duke that need not be anticipated why she may come up to london or she may go over to america and marry well for all that is come and gone  in troth and so she may as your grace is pleased to intimate replied mrs glass and now i think upon it there is my old correspondent in virginia ephraim buckskin that has supplied the thistle this forty years with tobacco and it is not a little that serves our turn and he has been writing to me this ten years to send him out a wife the carle is not above sixty and hale and hearty and well to pass in the world and a line from my hand would settle the matter and effie deanss misfortune forby that there is no special occasion to speak about it would be thought little of there  is she a pretty girl said the duke her sister does not get beyond a good comely sonsy lass  oh far prettier is effie than jeanie said mrs glass though it is long since i saw her mysell but i hear of the deanses by all my lowden friends when they comeyour grace kens we scots are clannish bodies  so much the better for us said the duke and the worse for those who meddle with us as your good oldfashioned sign says mrs glass and now i hope you will approve of the measures i have taken for restoring your kinswoman to her friends these he detailed at length and mrs glass gave her unqualified approbation with a smile and a courtesy at every sentence and now mrs glass you must tell jeanie i hope she will not forget my cheese when she gets down to scotland archibald has my orders to arrange all her expenses  begging your graces humble pardon said mrs glass it is a pity to trouble yourself about them the deanses are wealthy people in their way and the lass has money in her pocket  thats all very true said the duke but you know where maccallummore travels he pays all it is our highland privilege to take from all what we want and to give to all what they want  your grace is better at giving than taking said mrs glass  to show you the contrary said the duke i will fill my box out of this canister without paying you a bawbee and again desiring to be remembered to jeanie with his good wishes for her safe journey he departed leaving mrs glass uplifted in heart and in countenance the proudest and happiest of tobacco and snuff dealers  reflectively his graces good humour and affability had a favourable effect upon jeanies situationher kinswoman though civil and kind to her had acquired too much of london breeding to be perfectly satisfied with her cousins rustic and national dress and was besides something scandalised at the cause of her journey to london mrs glass might therefore have been less sedulous in her attentions towards jeanie but for the interest which the foremost of the scottish nobles for such in all mens estimation was the duke of argyle seemed to take in her fate now however as a kinswoman whose virtues and domestic affections had attracted the notice and approbation of royalty itself jeanie stood to her relative in a light very different and much more favourable and was not only treated with kindness but with actual observance and respect  it depended on herself alone to have made as many visits and seen as many sights as lay within mrs glasss power to compass but excepting that she dined abroad with one or two far away kinsfolk and that she paid the same respect on mrs glasss strong urgency to mrs deputy dabby wife of the worshipful mr deputy dabby of farringdon without she did not avail herself of the opportunity as mrs dabby was the second lady of great rank whom jeanie had seen in london she used sometimes afterwards to draw a parallel betwixt her and the queen in which she observed that mrs dabby was dressed twice as grand and was twice as big and spoke twice as loud and twice as muckle as the queen did but she hadna the same gosshawk glance that makes the skin creep and the knee bend and though she had very kindly gifted her with a loaf of sugar and twa punds of tea yet she hadna athegither the sweet look that the queen had when she put the needlebook into her hand  jeanie might have enjoyed the sights and novelties of this great city more had it not been for the qualification added to her sisters pardon which greatly grieved her affectionate disposition on this subject however her mind was somewhat relieved by a letter which she received in return of post in answer to that which she had written to her father with his affectionate blessing it brought his full approbation of the step which she had taken as one inspired by the immediate dictates of heaven and which she had been thrust upon in order that she might become the means of safety to a perishing household  if ever a deliverance was dear and precious this said the letter is a dear and precious deliveranceand if life saved can be made more sweet and savoury it is when it cometh by the hands of those whom we hold in the ties of affection and do not let your heart be disquieted within you that this victim who is rescued from the horns of the altar whereuntil she was fast bound by the chains of human law is now to be driven beyond the bounds of our land scotland is a blessed land to those who love the ordinances of christianity and it is a faer land to look upon and dear to them who have dwelt in it a their days and weel said that judicious christian worthy john livingstone a sailor in borrowstouness as the famous patrick walker reporteth his words that howbeit he thought scotland was a gehennah of wickedness when he was at home yet when he was abroad he accounted it ane paradise for the evils of scotland he found everywhere and the good of scotland he found nowhere but we are to hold in remembrance that scotland though it be our native land and the land of our fathers is not like goshen in egypt on whilk the sun of the heavens and of the gospel shineth allenarly and leaveth the rest of the world in utter darkness therefore and also because this increase of profit at saint leonards crags may be a cauld waff of wind blawing from the frozen land of earthly self where never plant of grace took root or grew and because my concerns make me take something ower muckle a grip of the gear of the warld in mine arms i receive this dispensation anent effie as a call to depart out of haran as righteous abraham of old and leave my fathers kindred and my mothers house and the ashes and mould of them who have gone to sleep before me and which wait to be mingled with these auld crazed bones of mine own and my heart is lightened to do this when i call to mind the decay of active and earnest religion in this land and survey the height and the depth the length and the breadth of national defections and how the love of many is waxing lukewarm and cold and i am strengthened in this resolution to change my domicile likewise as i hear that storefarms are to be set at an easy mail in northumberland where there are many precious souls that are of our true though suffering persuasion and sic part of the kye or stock as i judge it fit to keep may be driven thither without incommoditysay about wooler or that gate keeping aye a shouther to the hillsand the rest may be sauld to gude profit and advantage if we had grace weel to use and guide these gifts of the warld the laird has been a true friend on our unhappy occasions and i have paid him back the siller for effies misfortune whereof mr nichil novit returned him no balance as the laird and i did expect he wad hae done but law licks up a as the common folk say i have had the siller to borrow out of sax purses mr saddletree advised to give the laird of lounsbeck a charge on his hand for a thousand merks but i hae nae broo of charges since that awfu morning that a tout of a horn at the cross of edinburgh blew half the faithfu ministers of scotland out of their pulpits however i sall raise an adjudication whilk mr saddletree says comes instead of the auld apprisings and will not lose weelwon gear with the like of him if it may be helped as for the queen and the credit that she hath done to a poor mans daughter and the mercy and the grace ye found with her i can only pray for her weelbeing here and hereafter for the establishment of her house now and for ever upon the throne of these kingdoms i doubt not but what you told her majesty that i was the same david deans of whom there was a sport at the revolution when i noited thegither the heads of twa false prophets these ungracious graces the prelates as they stood on the hie street after being expelled from the conventionparliament   note p expulsion of the scotch bishops  the duke of argyle is a noble and truehearted nobleman who pleads the cause of the poor and those who have none to help them verily his reward shall not be lacking unto himi have been writing of many things but not of that whilk lies nearest mine heart i have seen the misguided thing she will be at freedom the morn on enacted caution that she shall leave scotland in four weeks her mind is in an evil framecasting her eye backward on egypt i doubt as if the bitter waters of the wilderness were harder to endure than the brick furnaces by the side of which there were savoury fleshpots i need not bid you make haste down for you are excepting always my great master my only comfort in these straits i charge you to withdraw your feet from the delusion of that vanityfair in whilk ye are a sojourner and not to go to their worship whilk is an illmumbled mass as it was weel termed by james the sext though he afterwards with his unhappy son strove to bring it ower back and belly into his native kingdom wherethrough their race have been cut off as foam upon the water and shall be as wanderers among the nationssee the prophecies of hosea ninth and seventeenth and the same tenth and seventh but us and our house let us say with the same prophet let us return to the lord for he hath torn and he will heal ushe hath smitten and he will bind us up  he proceeded to say that he approved of her proposed mode of returning by glasgow and entered into sundry minute particulars not necessary to be quoted a single line in the letter but not the least frequently read by the party to whom it was addressed intimated that reuben butler had been as a son to him in his sorrows as david deans scarce ever mentioned butler before without some gibe more or less direct either at his carnal gifts and learning or at his grandfathers heresy jeanie drew a good omen from no such qualifying clause being added to this sentence respecting him  a lovers hope resembles the bean in the nursery talelet it once take root and it will grow so rapidly that in the course of a few hours the giant imagination builds a castle on the top and by and by comes disappointment with the curtal axe and hews down both the plant and the superstructure jeanies fancy though not the most powerful of her faculties was lively enough to transport her to a wild farm in northumberland well stocked with milkcows yeald beasts and sheep a meetinghouse hard by frequented by serious presbyterians who had united in a harmonious call to reuben butler to be their spiritual guideeffie restored not to gaiety but to cheerfulness at leasttheir father with his grey hairs smoothed down and spectacles on his noseherself with the maiden snood exchanged for a matrons curchall arranged in a pew in the said meetinghouse listening to words of devotion rendered sweeter and more powerful by the affectionate ties which combined them with the preacher she cherished such visions from day to day until her residence in london began to become insupportable and tedious to her and it was with no ordinary satisfaction that she received a summons from argyle house requiring her in two days to be prepared to join their northward party      chapter sixteenth               one was a female who had grievous ill              wrought in revenge and she enjoyd it still              sullen she was and threatening in her eye              glared the stern triumph that she dared to die                                       crabbe  the summons of preparation arrived after jeanie deans had resided in the metropolis about three weeks  on the morning appointed she took a grateful farewell of mrs glass as that good womans attention to her particularly required placed herself and her movable goods which purchases and presents had greatly increased in a hackneycoach and joined her travelling companions in the housekeepers apartment at argyle house while the carriage was getting ready she was informed that the duke wished to speak with her and being ushered into a splendid saloon she was surprised to find that he wished to present her to his lady and daughters  i bring you my little countrywoman duchess these were the words of the introduction with an army of young fellows as gallant and steady as she is and a good cause i would not fear two to one  ah papa said a lively young lady about twelve years old remember you were full one to two at sheriffmuir and yet singing the wellknown ballad   some say that we wan and some say that they wan and some say that nane wan at a man but of ae thing im sure that on sheriffmuir a battle there was that i saw man  what little mary turned tory on my handsthis will be fine news for our countrywoman to carry down to scotland  we may all turn tories for the thanks we have got for remaining whigs said the second young lady  well hold your peace you discontented monkeys and go dress your babies and as for the bob of dunblane             if it wasna weel bobbit weel bobbit weel bobbit             if it wasna weel bobbit well bob it again  papas wit is running low said lady mary the poor gentleman is repeating himselfhe sang that on the field of battle when he was told the highlanders had cut his left wing to pieces with their claymores  a pull by the hair was the repartee to this sally  ah brave highlanders and bright claymores said the duke well do i wish them for a the ill theyve done me yet as the song goesbut come madcaps say a civil word to your countrywomani wish ye had half her canny hamely sense i think you may be as leal and truehearted  the duchess advanced and in a few words in which there was as much kindness as civility assured jeanie of the respect which she had for a character so affectionate and yet so firm and added when you get home you will perhaps hear from me  and from me and from me and from me jeanie added the young ladies one after the other for you are a credit to the land we love so well  jeanie overpowered by these unexpected compliments and not aware that the dukes investigation had made him acquainted with her behaviour on her sisters trial could only answer by blushing and courtesying round and round and uttering at intervals mony thanks mony thanks  jeanie said the duke you must have doch an dorroch or you will be unable to travel  there was a salver with cake and wine on the table he took up a glass drank to all true hearts that loed scotland and offered a glass to his guest  jeanie however declined it saying that she had never tasted wine in her life  how comes that jeanie said the dukewine maketh glad the heart you know  ay sir but my father is like jonadab the son of rechab who charged his children that they should drink no wine  i thought your father would have had more sense said the duke unless indeed he prefers brandy but however jeanie if you will not drink you must eat to save the character of my house  he thrust upon her a large piece of cake nor would he permit her to break off a fragment and lay the rest on a salver  put it in your pouch jeanie said he you will be glad of it before you see st giless steeple i wish to heaven i were to see it as soon as you and so my best service to all my friends at and about auld reekie and a blithe journey to you  and mixing the frankness of a soldier with his natural affability he shook hands with his protegee and committed her to the charge of archibald satisfied that he had provided sufficiently for her being attended to by his domestics from the unusual attention with which he had himself treated her  accordingly in the course of her journey she found both her companions disposed to pay her every possible civility so that her return in point of comfort and safety formed a strong contrast to her journey to london  her heart also was disburdened of the weight of grief shame apprehension and fear which had loaded her before her interview with the queen at richmond but the human mind is so strangely capricious that when freed from the pressure of real misery it becomes open and sensitive to the apprehension of ideal calamities she was now much disturbed in mind that she had heard nothing from reuben butler to whom the operation of writing was so much more familiar than it was to herself  it would have cost him sae little fash she said to herself for i hae seen his pen gan as fast ower the paper as ever it did ower the water when it was in the grey gooses wing waes me maybe he may be badlybut then my father wad likely hae said somethin about itor maybe he may hae taen the rue and kensna how to let me wot of his change of mind he needna be at muckle fash about itshe went on drawing herself up though the tear of honest pride and injured affection gathered in her eye as she entertained the suspicion jeanie deans is no the lass to pu him by the sleeve or put him in mind of what he wishes to forget i shall wish him weel and happy a the same and if he has the luck to get a kirk in our country i sall gang and hear him just the very same to show that i bear nae malice and as she imagined the scene the tear stole over her eye  in these melancholy reveries jeanie had full time to indulge herself for her travelling companions servants in a distinguished and fashionable family had of course many topics of conversation in which it was absolutely impossible she could have either pleasure or portion she had therefore abundant leisure for reflection and even for selftormenting during the several days which indulging the young horses the duke was sending down to the north with sufficient ease and short stages they occupied in reaching the neighbourhood of carlisle  in approaching the vicinity of that ancient city they discerned a considerable crowd upon an eminence at a little distance from the high road and learned from some passengers who were gathering towards that busy scene from the southward that the cause of the concourse was the laudable public desire to see a doomed scotch witch and thief get half of her due upo haribeebroo yonder for she was only to be hanged she should hae been boorned aloive an cheap ont  dear mr archibald said the dame of the dairy elect i never seed a woman hanged in a my life and only four men as made a goodly spectacle  mr archibald however was a scotchman and promised himself no exuberant pleasure in seeing his countrywoman undergo the terrible behests of law moreover he was a man of sense and delicacy in his way and the late circumstances of jeanies family with the cause of her expedition to london were not unknown to him so that he answered drily it was impossible to stop as he must be early at carlisle on some business of the dukes and he accordingly bid the postilions get on  the road at that time passed at about a quarter of a miles distance from the eminence called haribee or harabeebrow which though it is very moderate in size and height is nevertheless seen from a great distance around owing to the flatness of the country through which the eden flows here many an outlaw and borderrider of both kingdoms had wavered in the wind during the wars and scarce less hostile truces between the two countries upon harabee in latter days other executions had taken place with as little ceremony as compassion for these frontier provinces remained long unsettled and even at the time of which we write were ruder than those in the centre of england  the postilions drove on wheeling as the penrith road led them round the verge of the rising ground yet still the eyes of mrs dolly dutton which with the head and substantial person to which they belonged were all turned towards the scene of action could discern plainly the outline of the gallowstree relieved against the clear sky the dark shade formed by the persons of the executioner and the criminal upon the light rounds of the tall aerial ladder until one of the objects launched into the air gave unequivocal signs of mortal agony though appearing in the distance not larger than a spider dependent at the extremity of his invisible thread while the remaining form descended from its elevated situation and regained with all speed an undistinguished place among the crowd this termination of the tragic scene drew forth of course a squall from mrs dutton and jeanie with instinctive curiosity turned her head in the same direction  the sight of a female culprit in the act of undergoing the fatal punishment from which her beloved sister had been so recently rescued was too much not perhaps for her nerves but for her mind and feelings she turned her head to the other side of the carriage with a sensation of sickness of loathing and of fainting her female companion overwhelmed her with questions with proffers of assistance with requests that the carriage might be stoppedthat a doctor might be fetchedthat drops might be gottenthat burnt feathers and asafoetida fair water and hartshorn might be procured all at once and without one instants delay archibald more calm and considerate only desired the carriage to push forward and it was not till they had got beyond sight of the fatal spectacle that seeing the deadly paleness of jeanies countenance he stopped the carriage and jumping out himself went in search of the most obvious and most easily procured of mrs duttons pharmacopoeiaa draught namely of fair water  while archibald was absent on this goodnatured piece of service damning the ditches which produced nothing but mud and thinking upon the thousand bubbling springlets of his own mountains the attendants on the execution began to pass the stationary vehicle in their way back to carlisle  from their halfheard and halfunderstood words jeanie whose attention was involuntarily rivetted by them as that of children is by ghost stories though they know the pain with which they will afterwards remember them jeanie i say could discern that the present victim of the law had died game as it is termed by those unfortunates that is sullen reckless and impenitent neither fearing god nor regarding man  a sture woife and a dour said one cumbrian peasant as he clattered by in his wooden brogues with a noise like the trampling of a drayhorse  she has gone to ho master with hos name in her mouth said another shame the country should be harried wi scotch witches and scotch bitches this gatebut i say hang and drown  ay ay gaffer tramp take awa yealdon take awa lowhang

old woman who hobbled past them as they stood talking near the carriage this was nae witch but a bluidyfingered thief and murderess  ay was it een sae dame hinchup said one in a civil tone and stepping out of his place to let the old woman pass along the footpathnay you know best surebut at ony rate we hae but tint a scot of her and thats a thing better lost than found  the old woman passed on without making any answer  ay ay neighbour said gaffer tramp seest thou how one witch will speak for totherscots or english the same to them  his companion shook his head and replied in the same subdued tone ay ay when a sarkfoot wife gets on her broomstick the dames of allonby are ready to mount just as sure as the byword gangs o the hills                     if skiddaw hath a cap                    criffel wots full weel of that  but continued gager tramp thinkest thou the daughter o yon hangit body isna as rank a witch as ho  i kenna clearly returned the fellow but the folk are speaking o swimming her i the eden and they passed on their several roads after wishing each other goodmorning  just as the clowns left the place and as mr archibald returned with some fair water a crowd of boys and girls and some of the lower rabble of more mature age came up from the place of execution grouping themselves with many a yell of delight around a tall female fantastically dressed who was dancing leaping and bounding in the midst of them a horrible recollection pressed on jeanie as she looked on this unfortunate creature and the reminiscence was mutual for by a sudden exertion of great strength and agility madge wildfire broke out of the noisy circle of tormentors who surrounded her and clinging fast to the door of the calash uttered in a sound betwixt laughter and screaming eh dye ken jeanie deans they hae hangit our mother then suddenly changing her tone to that of the most piteous entreaty she added o gar them let me gang to cut her downlet me but cut her downshe is my mother if she was waur than the deil and shell be nae mair kenspeckle than halfhangit maggie dickson that cried saut mony a day after she had been hangit her voice was roupit and hoarse and her neck was a wee agee or ye wad hae kend nae odds on her frae ony other sautwife   note q halfhanged maggie dickson  mr archibald embarrassed by the madwomans clinging to the carriage and detaining around them her noisy and mischievous attendants was all this while looking out for a constable or beadle to whom he might commit the unfortunate creature but seeing no such person of authority he endeavoured to loosen her hold from the carriage that they might escape from her by driving on this however could hardly be achieved without some degree of violence madge held fast and renewed her frantic entreaties to be permitted to cut down her mother it was but a tenpenny tow lost she said and what was that to a womans life there came up however a parcel of savagelooking fellows butchers and graziers chiefly among whose cattle there had been of late a very general and fatal distemper which their wisdom imputed to witchcraft they laid violent hands on madge and tore her from the carriage exclaiming what doest stop folk o kings highway hast no done mischief enow already wi thy murders and thy witcherings  oh jeanie deansjeanie deans exclaimed the poor maniac save my mother and i will take ye to the interpreters house againand i will teach ye a my bonny sangsand i will tell ye what came o the the rest of her entreaties were drowned in the shouts of the rabble  save her for gods sakesave her from those people exclaimed jeanie to archibald  she is mad but quite innocent she is mad gentlemen said archibald do not use her ill take her before the mayor  ay ay wese hae care enow on her answered one of the fellows gang thou thy gate man and mind thine own matters  hes a scot by his tongue said another and an he will come out o his whirligig there ise gie him his tartan plaid fu o broken banes  it was clear nothing could be done to rescue madge and archibald who was a man of humanity could only bid the postilions hurry on to carlisle that he might obtain some assistance to the unfortunate woman as they drove off they heard the hoarse roar with which the mob preface acts of riot or cruelty yet even above that deep and dire note they could discern the screams of the unfortunate victim they were soon out of hearing of the cries but had no sooner entered the streets of carlisle than archibald at jeanies earnest and urgent entreaty went to a magistrate to state the cruelty which was likely to be exercised on this unhappy creature  in about an hour and a half he returned and reported to jeanie that the magistrate had very readily gone in person with some assistance to the rescue of the unfortunate woman and that he had himself accompanied him that when they came to the muddy pool in which the mob were ducking her according to their favourite mode of punishment the magistrate succeeded in rescuing her from their hands but in a state of insensibility owing to the cruel treatment which she had received he added that he had seen her carried to the workhouse and understood that she had been brought to herself and was expected to do well  this last averment was a slight alteration in point of fact for madge wildfire was not expected to survive the treatment she had received but jeanie seemed so much agitated that mr archibald did not think it prudent to tell her the worst at once indeed she appeared so fluttered and disordered by this alarming accident that although it had been their intention to proceed to longtown that evening her companions judged it most advisable to pass the night at carlisle  this was particularly agreeable to jeanie who resolved if possible to procure an interview with madge wildfire connecting some of her wild flights with the narrative of george staunton she was unwilling to omit the opportunity of extracting from her if possible some information concerning the fate of that unfortunate infant which had cost her sister so dear her acquaintance with the disordered state of poor madges mind did not permit her to cherish much hope that she could acquire from her any useful intelligence but then since madges mother had suffered her deserts and was silent for ever it was her only chance of obtaining any kind of information and she was loath to lose the opportunity  she coloured her wish to mr archibald by saying that she had seen madge formerly and wished to know as a matter of humanity how she was attended to under her present misfortunes that complaisant person immediately went to the workhouse or hospital in which he had seen the sufferer lodged and brought back for reply that the medical attendants positively forbade her seeing any one when the application for admittance was repeated next day mr archibald was informed that she had been very quiet and composed insomuch that the clergyman who acted as chaplain to the establishment thought it expedient to read prayers beside her bed but that her wandering fit of mind had returned soon after his departure however her countrywoman might see her if she chose it she was not expected to live above an hour or two  jeanie had no sooner received this information than she hastened to the hospital her companions attending her they found the dying person in a large ward where there were ten beds of which the patients was the only one occupied  madge was singing when they enteredsinging her own wild snatches of songs and obsolete airs with a voice no longer overstrained by false spirits but softened saddened and subdued by bodily exhaustion she was still insane but was no longer able to express her wandering ideas in the wild notes of her former state of exalted imagination there was death in the plaintive tones of her voice which yet in this moderated and melancholy mood had something of the lulling sound with which a mother sings her infant asleep as jeanie entered she heard first the air and then a part of the chorus and words of what had been perhaps the song of a jolly harvesthome                   our work is overover now                    the goodman wipes his weary brow                   the last long wain wends slow away                    and we are free to sport and play                  the night comes on when sets the sun                    and labour ends when day is done                  when autumns gone and winters come                    we hold our jovial harvesthome  jeanie advanced to the bedside when the strain was finished and addressed madge by her name but it produced no symptoms of recollection on the contrary the patient like one provoked by interruption changed her posture and called out with an impatient tone nursenurse turn my face to the wa that i may never answer to that name ony mair and never see mair of a wicked world  the attendant on the hospital arranged her in her bed as she desired with her face to the wall and her back to the light so soon as she was quiet in this new position she began again to sing in the same low and modulated strains as if she was recovering the state of abstraction which the interruption of her visitants had disturbed the strain however was different and rather resembled the music of the methodist hymns though the measure of the song was similar to that of the former                    when the fight of grace is fought                   when the marriage vest is wrought                   when faith hath chased cold doubt away                   and hope but sickens at delay                   when charity imprisoned here                   longs for a more expanded sphere                      doff thy robes of sin and clay                      christian rise and come away  the strain was solemn and affecting sustained as it was by the pathetic warble of a voice which had naturally been a fine one and which weakness if it diminished its power had improved in softness archibald though a follower of the court and a pococurante by profession was confused if not affected the dairymaid blubbered and jeanie felt the tears rise spontaneously to her eyes even the nurse accustomed to all modes in which the spirit can pass seemed considerably moved  the patient was evidently growing weaker as was intimated by an apparent difficulty of breathing which seized her from time to time and by the utterance of low listless moans intimating that nature was succumbing in the last conflict but the spirit of melody which must originally have so strongly possessed this unfortunate young woman seemed at every interval of ease to triumph over her pain and weakness and it was remarkable that there could always be traced in her songs something appropriate though perhaps only obliquely or collaterally so to her present situation her next seemed the fragment of some old ballad                   cauld is my bed lord archibald                       and sad my sleep of sorrow                   but thine sall be as sad and cauld                      my fause truelove tomorrow                  and weep ye not my maidens free                  though death your mistress borrow                      for he for whom i die today                      shall die for me tomorrow  again she changed the tune to one wilder less monotonous and less regular but of the words only a fragment or two could be collected by those who listened to this singular scene                       proud maisie is in the wood                            walking so early                      sweet robin sits on the bush                            singing so rarely                     tell me thou bonny bird                         when shall i marry me                        when six braw gentlemen                         kirkward shall carry ye                     who makes the bridal bed                         birdie say truly                        the greyheaded sexton                         that delves the grave duly                    the glowworm oer grave and stone                        shall light thee steady                    the owl from the steeple sing                        welcome proud lady  her voice died away with the last notes and she fell into a slumber from which the experienced attendant assured them that she never would awake at all or only in the death agony  the nurses prophecy proved true the poor maniac parted with existence without again uttering a sound of any kind but our travellers did not witness this catastrophe they left the hospital as soon as jeanie had satisfied herself that no elucidation of her sisters misfortunes was to be hoped from the dying person   note r madge wildfire      chapter seventeenth                   wilt thou go on with me                  the moon is bright the sea is calm                  and i know well the ocean paths                           thou wilt go on with me                                           thalaba  the fatigue and agitation of these various scenes had agitated jeanie so much notwithstanding her robust strength of constitution that archibald judged it necessary that she should have a days repose at the village of longtown it was in vain that jeanie protested against any delay the duke of argyles man of confidence was of course consequential and as he had been bred to the medical profession in his youth at least he used this expression to describe his having thirty years before pounded for six months in the mortar of old mungo mangleman the surgeon at greenock he was obstinate whenever a matter of health was in question  in this case he discovered febrile symptoms and having once made a happy application of that learned phrase to jeanies case all farther resistance became in vain and she was glad to acquiesce and even to go to bed and drink watergruel in order that she might possess her soul in quiet and without interruption  mr archibald was equally attentive in another particular he observed that the execution of the old woman and the miserable fate of her daughter seemed to have had a more powerful effect upon jeanies mind than the usual feelings of humanity might naturally have been expected to occasion yet she was obviously a strongminded sensible young woman and in no respect subject to nervous affections and therefore archibald being ignorant of any special connection between his masters protegee and these unfortunate persons excepting that she had seen madge formerly in scotland naturally imputed the strong impression these events had made upon her to her associating them with the unhappy circumstances in which her sister had so lately stood he became anxious therefore to prevent anything occurring which might recall these associations to jeanies mind  archibald had speedily an opportunity of exercising this precaution a pedlar brought to longtown that evening amongst other wares a large broadside sheet giving an account of the last speech and execution of margaret murdockson and of the barbarous murder of her daughter magdalene or madge murdockson called madge wildfire and of her pious conversation with his reverence archdeacon fleming which authentic publication had apparently taken place on the day they left carlisle and being an article of a nature peculiarly acceptable to such countryfolk as were within hearing of the transaction the itinerant bibliopolist had forthwith added them to his stock in trade he found a merchant sooner than he expected for archibald much applauding his own prudence purchased the whole lot for two shillings and ninepence and the pedlar delighted with the profit of such a wholesale transaction instantly returned to carlisle to supply himself with more  the considerate mr archibald was about to commit his whole purchase to the flames but it was rescued by the yet more considerate dairydamsel who said very prudently it was a pity to waste so much paper which might crepe hair pin up bonnets and serve many other useful purposes and who promised to put the parcel into her own trunk and keep it carefully out of the sight of mrs jeanie deans though bythebye she had no great notion of folk being so very nice mrs deans might have had enough to think about the gallows all this time to endure a sight of it without all this todo about it  archibald reminded the dame of the dairy of the dukes particular charge that they should be attentive and civil to jeanie as also that they were to part company soon and consequently would not be doomed to observing any ones health or temper during the rest of the journey with which answer mrs dolly dutton was obliged to hold herself satisfied on the morning they resumed their journey and prosecuted it successfully travelling through dumfriesshire and part of lanarkshire until they arrived at the small town of rutherglen within about four miles of glasgow here an express brought letters to archibald from the principal agent of the duke of argyle in edinburgh  he said nothing of their contents that evening but when they were seated in the carriage the next day the faithful squire informed jeanie that he had received directions from the dukes factor to whom his grace had recommended him to carry her if she had no objection for a stage or two beyond glasgow some temporary causes of discontent had occasioned tumults in that city and the neighbourhood which would render it unadvisable for mrs jeanie deans to travel alone and unprotected betwixt that city and edinburgh whereas by going forward a little farther they would meet one of his graces subfactors who was coming down from the highlands to edinburgh with his wife and under whose charge she might journey with comfort and in safety  jeanie remonstrated against this arrangement she had been lang she said frae hameher father and her sister behoved to be very anxious to see herthere were other friends she had that werena weel in health she was willing to pay for man and horse at glasgow and surely naebody wad meddle wi sae harmless and feckless a creature as she wasshe was muckle obliged by the offer but never hunted deer langed for its restingplace as i do to find myself at saint leonards  the groom of the chambers exchanged a look with his female companion which seemed so full of meaning that jeanie screamed aloudo mr archibaldmrs dutton if ye ken of onything that has happened at saint leonards for gods sakefor pitys sake tell me and dinna keep me in suspense  i really know nothing mrs deans said the groom of the chambers  and iii am sure i knows as little said the dame of the dairy while some communication seemed to tremble on her lips which at a glance of archibalds eye she appeared to swallow down and compressed her lips thereafter into a state of extreme and vigilant firmness as if she had been afraid of its bolting out before she was aware  jeanie saw there was to be something concealed from her and it was only the repeated assurances of archibald that her fatherher sisterall her friends were as far as he knew well and happy that at all pacified her alarm from such respectable people as those with whom she travelled she could apprehend no harm and yet her distress was so obvious that archibald as a last resource pulled out and put into her hand a slip of paper on which these words were written  jeanie deansyou will do me a favour by going with archibald and my female domestic a days journey beyond glasgow and asking them no questions which will greatly oblige your friend argyle  greenwich  although this laconic epistle from a nobleman to whom she was bound by such inestimable obligations silenced all jeanies objections to the proposed route it rather added to than diminished the eagerness of her curiosity the proceeding to glasgow seemed now no longer to be an object with her fellowtravellers on the contrary they kept the lefthand side of the river clyde and travelled through a thousand beautiful and changing views down the side of that noble stream till ceasing to hold its inland character it began to assume that of a navigable river  you are not for gaun intill glasgow then said jeanie as she observed that the drivers made no motion for inclining their horses heads towards the ancient bridge which was then the only mode of access to st mungos capital  no replied archibald there is some popular commotion and as our duke is in opposition to the court perhaps we might be too well received or they might take it in their heads to remember that the captain of carrick came down upon them with his highlandmen in the time of shawfields mob in 1725 and then we would be too ill received and at any rate it is best for us and for me in particular who may be supposed to possess his graces mind upon many particulars to leave the good people of the gorbals to act according to their own imaginations without either provoking or encouraging them by my presence   in 1725 there was a great riot in glasgow on account of the malttax among the troops brought in to restore order was one of the independent companies of highlanders levied in argyleshire and distinguished in a lampoon of the period as campbell of carrick and his highland thieves it was called shawfields mob because much of the popular violence was directed against daniel campbell esq of shawfield m p provost of the town  to reasoning of such tone and consequence jeanie had nothing to reply although it seemed to her to contain fully as much selfimportance as truth  the carriage meantime rolled on the river expanded itself and gradually assumed the dignity of an estuary or arm of the sea the influence of the advancing and retiring tides became more and more evident and in the beautiful words of him of the laurel wreath the river waxed                   a broader and yet broader stream                  the cormorant stands upon its shoals                      his black and dripping wings                      half opend to the wind             from southeys thalaba book xi stanza 36  which way lies inverary said jeanie gazing on the dusky ocean of highland hills which now piled above each other and intersected by many a lake stretched away on the opposite side of the river to the northward is yon high castle the dukes hoose  that mrs deanslud help thee replied archibald thats the old castle of dumbarton the strongest place in europe be the other what it may sir william wallace was governor of it in the old war with the english and his grace is governor just now it is always entrusted to the best man in scotland  and does the duke live on that high rock then demanded jeanie  no no he has his deputygovernor who commands in his absence he lives in the white house you see at the bottom of the rockhis grace does not reside there himself  i think not indeed said the dairywoman upon whose mind the road since they had left dumfries had made no very favourable impression for if he did he might go whistle for a dairywoman an he were the only duke in england i did not leave my place and my friends to come down to see cows starve to death upon hills as they be at that pigstye of elfinfoot as you call it mr archibald or to be perched upon the top of a rock like a squirrel in his cage hung out of a three pair of stairs window  inwardly chuckling that these symptoms of recalcitration had not taken place until the fair malcontent was as he mentally termed it under his thumb archibald coolly replied that the hills were none of his making nor did he know how to mend them but as to lodging they would soon be in a house of the dukes in a very pleasant island called roseneath where they went to wait for shipping to take them to inverary and would meet the company with whom jeanie was to return to edinburgh  an island said jeanie who in the course of her various and adventurous travels had never quitted terra firma then i am doubting we maun gang in ane of these boats they look unco sma and the waves are something rough and  mr archibald said mrs dutton i will not consent to it i was never engaed to leave the country and i desire you will bid the boys drive round the other way to the dukes house  there is a safe pinnace belonging to his grace maam close by replied archibald and you need be under no apprehensions whatsoever  but i am under apprehensions said the damsel and i insist upon going round by land mr archibald were it ten miles about  i am sorry i cannot oblige you madam as roseneath happens to be an island  if it were ten islands said the incensed dame thats no reason why i should be drowned in going over the seas to it  no reason why you should be drowned certainly maam answered the unmoved groom of the chambers but an admirable good one why you cannot proceed to it by land and fixed his masters mandates to perform he pointed with his hand and the drivers turning off the highroad proceeded towards a small hamlet of fishing huts where a shallop somewhat more gaily decorated than any which they had yet seen having a flag which displayed a boars head crested with a ducal coronet waited with two or three seamen and as many highlanders  the carriage stopped and the men began to unyoke their horses while mr archibald gravely superintended the removal of the baggage from the carriage to the little vessel has the caroline been long arrived said archibald to one of the seamen  she has been here in five days from liverpool and shes lying down at greenock answered the fellow  let the horses and carriage go down to greenock then said archibald and be embarked there for inverary when i send noticethey may stand in my cousins duncan archibald the stablersladies he added i hope you will get yourselves ready we must not lose the tide  mrs deans said the cowslip of inverary you may do as you pleasebut i will sit here all night rather than go into that there painted eggshellfellowfellow this was addressed to a highlander who was lifting a travelling trunk that trunk is mine and that there bandbox and that pillion mail and those seven bundles and the paperbag and if you venture to touch one of them it shall be at your peril  the celt kept his eye fixed on the speaker then turned his head towards archibald and receiving no countervailing signal he shouldered the portmanteau and without farther notice of the distressed damsel or paying any attention to remonstrances which probably he did not understand and would certainly have equally disregarded whether he understood them or not moved off with mrs duttons wearables and deposited the trunk containing them safely in the boat  the baggage being stowed in safety mr archibald handed jeanie out of the carriage and not without some tremor on her part she was transported through the surf and placed in the boat he then offered the same civility to his fellowservant but she was resolute in her refusal to quit the carriage in which she now remained in solitary state threatening all concerned or unconcerned with actions for wages and boardwages damages and expenses and numbering on her fingers the gowns and other habiliments from which she seemed in the act of being separated for ever mr archibald did not give himself the trouble of making many remonstrances which indeed seemed only to aggravate the damsels indignation but spoke two or three words to the highlanders in gaelic and the wily mountaineers approaching the carriage cautiously and without giving the slightest intimation of their intention at once seized the recusant so effectually fast that she could neither resist nor struggle and hoisting her on their shoulders in nearly a horizontal posture rushed down with her to the beach and through the surf and with no other inconvenience than ruffling her garments a little deposited her in the boat but in a state of surprise mortification and terror at her sudden transportation which rendered her absolutely mute for two or three minutes the men jumped in themselves one tall fellow remained till he had pushed off the boat and then tumbled in upon his companions they took their oars and began to pull from the shore then spread their sail and drove merrily across the firth  you scotch villain said the infuriated damsel to archibald how dare you use a person like me in this way  madam said archibald with infinite composure its high time you should know you are in the dukes country and that there is not one of these fellows but would throw you out of the boat as readily as into it if such were his graces pleasure  then the lord have mercy on me said mrs dutton if i had had any on myself i would never have engaged with you  its something of the latest to think of that now mrs dutton said archibald but i assure you you will find the highlands have their pleasures you will have a dozen of cowmilkers under your own authority at inverary and you may throw any of them into the lake if you have a mind for the dukes head people are almost as great as himself  this is a strange business to be sure mr archibald said the lady but i suppose i must make the best ontare you sure the boat will not sink it leans terribly to one side in my poor mind  fear nothing said mr archibald taking a most important pinch of snuff this same ferry on clyde knows us very well or we know it which is all the same no fear of any of our people meeting with any accident we should have crossed from the opposite shore but for the disturbances at glasgow which made it improper for his graces people to pass through the city  are you not afeard mrs deans said the dairyvestal addressing jeanie who sat not in the most comfortable state of mind by the side of archibald who himself managed the helmare you not afeard of these wild men with their naked knees and of this nutshell of a thing that seems bobbing up and down like a skimmingdish in a milkpail  nonomadam answered jeanie with some hesitation i am not feared for i hae seen hielandmen before though never was sae near them and for the danger of the deep waters i trust there is a providence by sea as well as by land  well said mrs dutton it is a beautiful thing to have learned to write and read for one can always say such fine words whatever should befall them  archibald rejoicing in the impression which his vigorous measures had made upon the intractable dairymaid now applied himself as a sensible and goodnatured man to secure by fair means the ascendency which he had obtained by some wholesome violence and he succeeded so well in representing to her the idle nature of her fears and the impossibility of leaving her upon the beach enthroned in an empty carriage that the good understanding of the party was completely revived ere they landed at roseneath      chapter eighteenth               did fortune guide                  or rather destiny our bark to which              we could appoint no port to this best place                                fletcher  the islands in the firth of clyde which the daily passage of so many smokepennoned steamboats now renders so easily accessible were in our fathers times secluded spots frequented by no travellers and few visitants of any kind they are of exquisite yet varied beauty arran a mountainous region or alpine island abounds with the grandest and most romantic scenery bute is of a softer and more woodland character the cumbrays as if to exhibit a contrast to both are green level and bare forming the links of a sort of natural bar which is drawn along the mouth of the firth leaving large intervals however of ocean roseneath a smaller isle lies much higher up the firth and towards its western shore near the opening of the lake called the gare loch and not far from loch long and loch scant or the holy loch which wind from the mountains of the western highlands to join the estuary of the clyde  in these isles the severe frost winds which tyrannise over the vegetable creation during a scottish spring are comparatively little felt nor excepting the gigantic strength of arran are they much exposed to the atlantic storms lying landlocked and protected to the westward by the shores of ayrshire accordingly the weepingwillow the weepingbirch and other trees of early and pendulous shoots flourish in these favoured recesses in a degree unknown in our eastern districts and the air is also said to possess that mildness which is favourable to consumptive cases  the picturesque beauty of the island of roseneath in particular had such recommendations that the earls and dukes of argyle from an early period made it their occasional residence and had their temporary accommodation in a fishing or huntinglodge which succeeding improvements have since transformed into a palace it was in its original simplicity when the little bark which we left traversing the firth at the end of last chapter approached the shores of the isle  when they touched the landingplace which was partly shrouded by some old low but widespreading oaktrees intermixed with hazelbushes two or three figures were seen as if awaiting their arrival to these jeanie paid little attention so that it was with a shock of surprise almost electrical that upon being carried by the rowers out of the

bairnthe lord of israel be thy father for i am hardly worthy of thee thou hast redeemed our captivitybrought back the honour of our housebless thee my bairn with mercies promised and purchased but he has blessed thee in the good of which he has made thee the instrument  these words broke from him not without tears though david was of no melting mood archibald had with delicate attention withdrawn the spectators from the interview so that the wood and setting sun alone were witnesses of the expansion of their feelings  and effieand effie dear father was an eager interjectional question which jeanie repeatedly threw in among her expressions of joyful thankfulness  ye will hearye will hear said david hastily and over and anon renewed his grateful acknowledgments to heaven for sending jeanie safe down from the land of prelatic deadness and schismatic heresy and had delivered her from the dangers of the way and the lions that were in the path  and effie repeated her affectionate sister again and again andand fain would she have said butler but she modified the direct inquiryand mr and mrs saddletreeand dumbiedikesand a friends  a weela weel praise to his name  andmr butlerhe wasna

only leaf left now on the auld treehale be your portion  she is deadshe is slainit has come ower late exclaimed jeanie wringing her hands  no jeanie returned deans in the same grave melancholy tone she lives in the flesh and is at freedom from earthly restraint if she were as much alive in faith and as free from the bonds of satan  the lord protect us said jeaniecan the unhappy bairn hae left you for that villain  it is ower truly spoken said deansshe has left her auld father that has wept and prayed for hershe has left her sister that travailed and toiled for her like a mothershe has left

choked his utterance  and wi that manthat fearfu man said jeanie and she has left us to gang aff wi himo effie effie wha could hae thought it after sic a deliverance as you had been gifted wi  she went out from us my bairn because she was not of us replied david she is a withered branch will never bear fruit of gracea scapegoat gone forth into the wilderness of the world to carry wi her as i trust the sins of our little congregation the peace of the warld gang wi her and a better peace when she has the grace to turn to it if she is of his elected his ain hour will come what would her mother have said that famous and memorable matron rebecca macnaught whose memory is like a flower of sweet savour in newbattle and a pot of frankincense in lugton but be it saelet her partlet her gang her gatelet her bite on her ain bridlethe lord kens his timeshe was the bairn of prayers and may not prove an utter castaway but never jeanie never more let her name be spoken between you and meshe hath passed from us like the brook which vanisheth when the summer waxeth warm as patient job saithlet her pass and be forgotten  there was a melancholy pause which followed these expressions jeanie would fain have asked more circumstances relating to her sisters departure but the tone of her fathers prohibition was positive she was about to mention her interview with staunton at his fathers rectory but on hastily running over the particulars in her memory she thought that on the whole they were more likely to aggravate than diminish his distress of mind she turned therefore the discourse from this painful subject resolving to suspend farther inquiry until she should see butler from whom she expected to learn the particulars of her sisters elopement  but when was she to see butler was a question she could not forbear asking herself especially while her father as if eager to escape from the subject of his youngest daughter pointed to the opposite shore of dumbartonshire and asking jeanie if it werena a pleasant abode declared to her his intention of removing his earthly tabernacle to that country in respect he was solicited by his grace the duke of argyle as one well skilled in country labour and a that appertained to flocks and herds to superintend a storefarm whilk his grace had taen into his ain hand for the improvement of stock  jeanies heart sunk within her at this declaration she allowed it was a goodly and pleasant land and sloped bonnily to the western sun and she doubtedna that the pasture might be very gude for the grass looked green for as drouthy as the weather had been but it was far frae hame and she thought she wad be often thinking on the bonny spots of turf sae fu of gowans and yellow kingcups amang the crags at st leonards  dinna speak ont jeanie said her father i wish never to hear it named mairthat is after the rouping is ower and the bills paid but i brought a the beasts owerby that i thought ye wad like best there is gowans and theres your ain brockit cow and the wee hawkit ane that ye cadi needna tell ye how ye cad itbut i couldna bid them sell the petted creature though the sight o it may sometimes gie us a sair heartits no the poor dumb creatures faultand ane or twa beasts mair i hae reserved and i caused them to be driven before the other beasts that men might say as when the son of jesse returned from battle this is davids spoil  upon more particular inquiry jeanie found new occasion to admire the active beneficence of her friend the duke of argyle while establishing a sort of experimental farm on the skirts of his immense highland estates he had been somewhat at a loss to find a proper person in whom to vest the charge of it the conversation his grace had upon country matters with jeanie deans during their return from richmond had impressed him with a belief that the father whose experience and success she so frequently quoted must be exactly the sort of person whom he wanted when the condition annexed to effies pardon rendered it highly probable that david deans would choose to change his place of residence this idea again occurred to the duke more strongly and as he was an enthusiast equally in agriculture and in benevolence he imagined he was serving the purposes of both when he wrote to the gentleman in edinburgh entrusted with his affairs to inquire into the character of david deans cowfeeder and so forth at st leonards crags and if he found him such as he had been represented to engage him without delay and on the most liberal terms to superintend his fancyfarm in dumbartonshire  the proposal was made to old david by the gentleman so commissioned on the second day after his daughters pardon had reached edinburgh his resolution to leave st leonards had been already formed the honour of an express invitation from the duke of argyle to superintend a department where so much skill and diligence was required was in itself extremely flattering and the more so because honest david who was not without an exeellent opinion of his own talents persuaded himself that by accepting this charge he would in some sort repay the great favour he had received at the hands of the argyle family the appointments including the right of sufficient grazing for a small stock of his own were amply liberal and davids keen eye saw that the situation was convenient for trafficking to advantage in highland cattle there was risk of hership from the neighbouring mountains indeed but the awful name of the duke of argyle would be a great security and a trifle of blackmail would david was aware assure his safety   hership a scottish word which may be said to be now obsolete because fortunately the practice of plundering by armed force which is its meaning does not require to be commonly spoken of  still however there were two points on which he haggled the first was the character of the clergyman with whose worship he was to join and on this delicate point he received as we will presently show the reader perfect satisfaction the next obstacle was the condition of his youngest daughter obliged as she was to leave scotland for so many years  the gentleman of the law smiled and said there was no occasion to interpret that clause very strictlythat if the young woman left scotland for a few months or even weeks and came to her fathers new residence by sea from the western side of england nobody would know of her arrival or at least nobody who had either the right or inclination to give her disturbance the extensive heritable jurisdictions of his grace excluded the interference of other magistrates with those living on his estates and they who were in immediate dependence on him would receive orders to give the young woman no disturbance living on the verge of the highlands she might indeed be said to be out of scotland that is beyond the bounds of ordinary law and civilisation  old deans was not quite satisfied with this reasoning but the elopement of effie which took place on the third night after her liberation rendered his residence at st leonards so detestable to him that he closed at once with the proposal which had been made him and entered with pleasure into the idea of surprising jeanie as had been proposed by the duke to render the change of residence more striking to her the duke had apprised archibald of these circumstances with orders to act according to the instructions he should receive from edinburgh and by which accordingly he was directed to bring jeanie to roseneath  the father and daughter communicated these matters to each other now stopping now walking slowly towards the lodge which showed itself among the trees at about halfamiles distance from the little bay in which they had landed as they approached the house david deans informed his daughter with somewhat like a grim smile which was the utmost advance he ever made towards a mirthful expression of visage that there was baith a worshipful gentleman and ane reverend gentleman residing therein the worshipful gentleman was his honour the laird of knocktarlitie who was bailie of the lordship under the duke of argyle ane highland gentleman tarrd wi the same stick david doubted as mony of them namely a hasty and choleric temper and a neglect of the higher things that belong to salvation and also a gripping unto the things of this world without muckle distinction of property but however ane gude hospitable gentleman with whom it would be a part of wisdom to live on a gude understanding for hielandmen were hasty ower hasty as for the reverend person of whom he had spoken he was candidate by favour of the duke of argyle for david would not for the universe have called him presentee for the kirk of the parish in which their farm was situated and he was likely to be highly acceptable unto the christian souls of the parish who were hungering for spiritual manna having been fed but upon sour hieland sowens by mr duncan macdonought the last minister who began the morning duly sunday and saturday with a mutchkin of usquebaugh but i need say the less about the present lad said david again grimly grimacing as i think ye may hae seen him afore and here he is come to meet us  she had indeed seen him before for it was no other than reuben butler himself      chapter nineteenth               no more shalt thou behold thy sisters face              thou hast already had her last embrace                            elegy on mrs anne killigrew  this second surprise had been accomplished for jeanie deans by the rod of the same benevolent enchanter whose power had transplanted her father from the crags of st leonards to the banks of the gare loch the duke of argyle was not a person to forget the hereditary debt of gratitude which had been bequeathed to him by his grandfather in favour of the grandson of old bible butler he had internally resolved to provide for reuben butler in this kirk of knocktarlitie of which the incumbent had just departed this life accordingly his agent received the necessary instructions for that purpose under the qualifying condition always that the learning and character of mr butler should be found proper for the charge upon inquiry these were found as highly satisfactory as had been reported in the case of david deans himself  by this preferment the duke of argyle more essentially benefited his friend and protegee jeanie than he himself was aware of since he contributed to remove objections in her fathers mind to the match which he had no idea had been in existence  we have already noticed that deans had something of a prejudice against butler which was perhaps in some degree owing to his possessing a sort of consciousness that the poor usher looked with eyes of affection upon his eldest daughter this in davids eyes was a sin of presumption even although it should not be followed by any overt act or actual proposal but the lively interest which butler had displayed in his distresses since jeanie set forth on her london expedition and which therefore he ascribed to personal respect for himself individually had greatly softened the feelings of irritability with which david had sometimes regarded him and while he was in this good disposition towards butler another incident took place which had great influence on the old mans mind so soon as the shock of effies second elopement was over it was deanss early care to collect and refund to the laird of dumbiedikes the money which he had lent for effies trial and for jeanies travelling expenses the laird the pony the cocked hat and the tabaccopipe had not been seen at st leonards crags for many a day so that in order to pay this debt david was under the necessity of repairing in person to the mansion of dumbiedikes  he found it in a state of unexpected bustle there were workmen pulling down some of the old hangings and replacing them with others altering repairing scrubbing painting and whitewashing there was no knowing the old house which had been so long the mansion of sloth and silence the laird himself seemed in some confusion and his reception though kind lacked something of the reverential cordiality with which he used to greet david deans there was a change also david did not very well know of what nature about the exterior of this landed proprietoran improvement in the shape of his garments a spruceness in the air with which they were put on that were both novelties even the old hat looked smarter the cock had been newly pointed the lace had been refreshed and instead of slouching backward or forward on the lairds head as it happened to be thrown on it was adjusted with a knowing inclination over one eye  david deans opened his business and told down the cash dumbiedikes steadily inclined his ear to the one and counted the other with great accuracy interrupting david while he was talking of the redemption of the captivity of judah to ask him whether he did not think one or two of the guineas looked rather light when he was satisfied on this point had pocketed his money and had signed a receipt he addressed david with some little hesitationjeanie wad be writing ye something gudeman  about the siller replied davidnae doubt she did  and did she say nae mair about me asked the laird  nae mair but kind and christian wisheswhat suld she hae said replied david fully expecting that the lairds long courtship if his dangling after jeanie deserves so active a name was now coming to a point and so indeed it was but not to that point which he wished or expected  aweel she kens her ain mind best gudeman i hae made a clean house o jenny balchristie and her niece they were a bad packsteald meat and mault and loot the carters magg the coalsim to be married the morn and kirkit on sunday  whatever david felt he was too proud and too steadyminded to show any unpleasant surprise in his countenance and manner  i wuss ye happy sir through him that gies happinessmarriage is an honourable state  and i am wedding into an honourable house davidthe laird of lickpelfs youngest daughtershe sits next us in the kirk and thats the way i came to think ont  there was no more to be said but again to wish the laird joy to taste a cup of his liquor and to walk back again to st leonards musing on the mutability of human affairs and human resolutions the expectation that one day or other jeanie would be lady dumbiedikes had in spite of himself kept a more absolute possession of davids mind than he himself was aware of at least it had hitherto seemed a union at all times within his daughters reach whenever she might choose to give her silent lover any degree of encouragement and now it was vanished for ever david returned therefore in no very gracious humour for so good a man he was angry with jeanie for not having encouraged the lairdhe was angry with the laird for requiring encouragementand he was angry with himself for being angry at all on the occasion  on his return he found the gentleman who managed the duke of argyles affairs was desirous of seeing him with a view to completing the arrangement between them thus after a brief repose he was obliged to set off anew for edinburgh so that old may hettly declared that a this was to end with the master just walking himself aff his feet  when the business respecting the farm had been talked over and arranged the professional gentleman acquainted david deans in answer to his inquiries concerning the state of public worship that it was the pleasure of the duke to put an excellent young clergyman called reuben butler into the parish which was to be his future residence  reuben butler exclaimed davidreuben butler the usher at liberton  the very same said the dukes commissioner his grace has heard an excellent character of him and has some hereditary obligations to him besidesfew ministers will be so comfortable as i am directed to make mr butler  obligationsthe dukeobligations to reuben butlerreuben butler a placed minister of the kirk of scotland exclaimed david in interminable astonishment for somehow he had been led by the bad success which butler had hitherto met with in all his undertakings to consider him as one of those stepsons of fortune whom she treats with unceasing rigour and ends with disinheriting altogether  there is perhaps no time at which we are disposed to think so highly of a friend as when we find him standing higher than we expected in the esteem of others when assured of the reality of butlers change of prospects david expressed his great satisfaction at his success in life which he observed was entirely owing to himself david i advised his puir grandmother who was but a silly woman to breed him up to the ministry and i prophesied that with a blessing on his endeavours he would become a polished shaft in the temple he may be something ower proud o his carnal learning but a gude lad and has the root of the matteras ministers gang now where yell find ane better yell find ten waur than reuben butler  he took leave of the man of business and walked homeward forgetting his weariness in the various speculations to which this wonderful piece of intelligence gave rise honest david had now like other great men to go to work to reconcile his speculative principles with existing circumstances and like other great men when they set seriously about that task he was tolerably successful  ought reuben butler in conscience to accept of this preferment in the kirk of scotland subject as david at present thought that establishment was to the erastian encroachments of the civil power this was the leading question and he considered it carefully the kirk of scotland was shorn of its beams and deprived of its full artillery and banners of authority but still it contained zealous and fructifying pastors attentive congregations and with all her spots and blemishes the like of this kirk was nowhere else to be seen upon earth  davids doubts had been too many and too critical to permit him ever unequivocally to unite himself with any of the dissenters who upon various accounts absolutely seceded from the national church he had often joined in communion with such of the established clergy as approached nearest to the old presbyterian model and principles of 1640 and although there were many things to be amended in that system yet he remembered that he david deans had himself ever been an humble pleader for the good old cause in a legal way but without rushing into righthand excesses divisions and separations but as an enemy to separation he might join the righthand of fellowship with a minister of the kirk of scotland in its present model ergo reuben butler might take possession of the parish of knocktarlitie without forfeiting his friendship or favourq e d but secondly came the trying point of laypatronage which david deans had ever maintained to be a coming in by the window and over the wall a cheating and starving the souls of a whole parish for the purpose of clothing the back and filling the belly of the incumbent  this presentation therefore from the duke of argyle whatever was the worth and high character of that nobleman was a limb of the brazen image a portion of the evil thing and with no kind of consistency could david bend his mind to favour such a transaction but if the parishioners themselves joined in a general call to reuben butler to be their pastor it did not seem quite so evident that the existence of this unhappy presentation was a reason for his refusing them the comforts of his doctrine if the presbytery admitted him to the kirk in virtue rather of that act of patronage than of the general call of the congregation that might be their error and david allowed it was a heavy one but if reuben butler accepted of the cure as tendered to him by those whom he was called to teach and who had expressed themselves desirous to learn david after considering and reconsidering the matter came through the great virtue of if to be of opinion that he might safely so act in that matter  there remained a third stumblingblockthe oaths to government exacted from the established clergymen in which they acknowledge an erastian king and parliament and homologate the incorporating union between england and scotland through which the latter kingdom had become part and portion of the former wherein prelacy the sister of popery had made fast her throne and elevated the horns of her mitre these were symptoms of defection which had often made david cry out my bowelsmy bowelsi am pained at the very heart and he remembered that a godly bowhead matron had been carried out of the tolbooth church in a swoon beyond the reach of brandy and burnt feathers merely on hearing these fearful words it is enacted by the lords spiritual and temporal pronounced from a scottish pulpit in the proem to the porteous proclamation these oaths were therefore a deep compliance and dire abominationa sin and a snare and a danger and a defection but this shibboleth was not always exacted ministers had respect to their own tender consciences and those of their brethren and it was not till a later period that the reins of discipline were taken up tight by the general assemblies and presbyteries the peacemaking particle came again to davids assistance if an incumbent was not called upon to make such compliances and if he got a right entry into the church without intrusion and by orderly appointment why upon the whole david deans came to be of opinion that the said incumbent might lawfully enjoy the spirituality and temporality of the cure of souls at knocktarlitie with stipend manse glebe and all thereunto appertaining  the best and most uprightminded men are so strongly influenced by existing circumstances that it would be somewhat cruel to inquire too nearly what weight parental affection gave to these ingenious trains of reasoning let david deanss situation be considered he was just deprived of one daughter and his eldest to whom he owed so much was cut off by the sudden resolution of dumbiedikes from the high hope which david had entertained that she might one day be mistress of that fair lordship just while this disappointment was bearing heavy on his spirits butler comes before his imaginationno longer the halfstarved threadbare usher but fat and sleek and fair the beneficed minister of knocktarlitie beloved by his congregationexemplary in his lifepowerful in his doctrinedoing the duty of the kirk as never highland minister did beforeturning sinners as a colley dog turns sheepa favourite of the duke of argyle and drawing a stipend of eight hundred punds scots and four chalders of victual here was a match making up in davids mind in a tenfold degree the disappointment in the case of dumbiedikes in so far as the goodman of st leonards held a powerful minister in much greater admiration than a mere landed proprietor it did not occur to him as an additional reason in favour of the match that jeanie might herself have some choice in the matter for the idea of consulting her feelings never once entered into the honest mans head any more than the possibility that her inclination might perhaps differ from his own  the result of his meditations was that he was called upon to take the management of the whole affair into his own hand and give if it should be found possible without sinful compliance or backsliding or defection of any kind a worthy pastor to the kirk of knocktarlitie accordingly by the intervention of the honest dealer in buttermilk who dwelt in liberton david summoned to his presence reuben butler even from this worthy messenger he was unable to conceal certain swelling emotions of dignity insomuch that when the carter had communicated his message to the usher he added that certainly the gudeman of st leonards had some grand news to tell him for he was as uplifted as a middencock upon pattens  butler it may readily be conceived immediately obeyed the summons he was a plain character in which worth and good sense and simplicity were the principal ingredients but love on this occasion gave him a certain degree of address he had received an intimation of the favour designed him by the duke of argyle with what feelings those only can conceive who have experienced a sudden prospect of being raised to independence and respect from penury and toil he resolved however that the old man should retain all the consequence of being in his own opinion the first to communicate the important intelligence at the same time he also determined that in the expected conference he would permit david deans to expatiate at length upon the proposal in all its bearings without irritating him either by interruption or contradiction this last was the most prudent plan he could have adopted because although there were many doubts which david deans could himself clear up to his own satisfaction yet he might have been by no means disposed to accept the solution of any other person and to engage him in an argument would have been certain to confirm him at once and for ever in the opinion which butler chanced to impugn  he received his friend with an appearance of important gravity which real misfortune had long compelled him to lay aside and which belonged to those days of awful authority in which he predominated over widow butler and dictated the mode of cultivating the crofts of beersheba he made known to reuben with great prolixity the prospect of his changing his present residence for the charge of the duke of argyles stockfarm in dumbartonshire and enumerated the various advantages of the situation with obvious selfcongratulation but assured the patient hearer that nothing had so much moved him to acceptance as the sense that by his skill in bestial he could render the most important services to his grace the duke of argyle to whom in the late unhappy circumstance here a tear dimmed the sparkle of pride in the old mans eye he had been sae muckle obliged  to put a rude hielandman into sic a charge he continued what could be expected but that he suld be sic a chiefest herdsman as wicked doeg the edomite whereas while this grey head is to the fore not a clute o them but sall be as weel cared for as if they were the fatted kine of pharaohand now reuben lad seeing we maun remove our tent to a strange country ye will be casting a dolefu look after us and thinking with whom ye are to hold counsel anent your government in thae slippery and backsliding times and nae doubt remembering that the auld man david deans was made the instrument to bring you out of the mire of schism and heresy wherein your fathers house delighted to wallow aften also nae doubt when ye are pressed wi ensnaring trials and tentations and heartplagues you that are like a recruit that is marching for the first time to the touk of drum will miss the auld bauld and experienced veteran soldier that has felt the brunt of mony a foul day and heard the bullets whistle as aften as he has hairs left on his auld pow  it is very possible that butler might internally be of opinion that the reflection on his ancestors peculiar tenets might have been spared or that he might be presumptuous enough even to think that at his years and with his own lights he might be able to hold his course without the pilotage of honest david but he only replied by expressing his regret that anything should separate him from an ancient tried and affectionate friend  but how can it be helped man said david twisting his features into a sort of smilehow can we help iti trow ye canna tell me thatye maun leave that to ither folkto the duke of argyle and me reuben its a gude thing to hae friends in this warldhow muckle better to hae an interest beyond it  and david whose piety though not always quite rational was as sincere as it was habitual and fervent looked reverentially upward and paused mr butler intimated the pleasure with which he would receive his friends advice on a subject so important and david resumed  what think ye now reuben of a kirka regular kirk under the present establishmentwere sic offered to ye wad ye be free to accept it and under whilk provisionsi am speaking but by way of query  butler replied that if such a prospect were held out to him he would probably first consult whether he was likely to be useful to the parish he should be called to and if there appeared a fair prospect of his proving so his friend must be aware that in every other point of view it would be highly advantageous for him  right reuben very right lad answered the monitor your ain conscience is the first thing to be satisfiedfor how sall he teach others that has himself sae ill learned the scriptures as to grip for the lucre of foul earthly preferment sic as gear and manse money and victual that which is not his in a spiritual senseor wha makes his kirk a stalkinghorse from behind which he may tak aim at his stipend but i look for better things of youand specially ye maun be minded not to act altogether on your ain judgment for therethrough comes sair mistakes backslidings and defections on the left and on the right if there were sic a day of trial put to you reuben you who are a young lad although it may be ye are gifted wi the carnal tongues and those whilk were spoken at rome whilk is now the seat of the scarlet abomination and by the greeks to whom the gospel was as foolishness yet naetheless ye may be entreated by your weelwisher to take the counsel of those prudent and resolved and weatherwithstanding professors wha hae kend what it was to lurk on banks and in mosses in bogs and in caverns and to risk the peril of the head rather than renounce the honesty of the heart  butler replied that certainly possessing such a friend as he hoped and trusted he had in the goodman himself who had seen so many changes in the preceding century he should be much to blame if he did not avail himself of his experience and friendly counsel  eneugh saideneugh said reuben said david deans with internal exultation and say that ye were in the predicament whereof i hae spoken of a surety i would deem it my duty to gang to the root o the matter and lay bare to you the ulcers and imposthumes and the sores and the leprosies of this our time crying aloud and sparing not  david deans was now in his element he commenced his examination of the doctrines and belief of the christian church with the very culdees from whom he passed to john knoxfrom john knox to the recusants in james the sixths timebruce black blair livingstonefrom them to the brief and at length triumphant period of the presbyterian churchs splendour until it was overrun by the english independents then followed the dismal times of prelacy the indulgences seven in number with all their shades and bearings until he arrived at the reign of king james the second in which he himself had been in his own mind neither an obscure actor nor an obscure sufferer then was butler doomed to hear the most detailed and annotated edition of what he had so often heard beforedavid deanss confinement namely in the iron cage in the canongate tolbooth and the cause thereof  we should be very unjust to our friend david deans if we should pretermitto use his own expressiona narrative which he held essential to his fame a drunken trooper of the royal guards francis gordon by name had chased five or six of the skulking whigs among whom was our friend david and after he had compelled them to stand and was in the act of brawling with them one of their number fired a pocketpistol and shot him dead david used to sneer and shake his head when any one asked him whether he had been the instrument of removing this wicked persecutor from the face of the earth in fact the merit of the deed lay between him and his friend patrick walker the pedlar whose words he was so fond of quoting neither of them cared directly to claim the merit of silencing mr francis gordon of the lifeguards there being some wild cousins of his about edinburgh who might have been even yet addicted to revenge but yet neither of them chose to disown or yield to the other the merit of this active defence of their religious rights david said that if he had fired a pistol then it was what he never did after or before and as for mr patrick walker he has left it upon record that his great surprise was that so small a pistol could kill so big a man these are the words of that venerable biographer whose trade had not taught him by experience that an inch was as good as an ell he francis gordon got a shot in his head out of a pocketpistol rather fit for diverting a boy than killing such a furious mad brisk man which notwithstanding killed him dead   note s death of francis gordon   upon the extensive foundation which the history of the kirk afforded during its shortlived triumph and long tribulation david with length of breath and of narrative which would have astounded any one but a lover of his daughter proceeded to lay down his own rules for guiding the conscience of his friend as an aspirant to serve in the ministry upon this subject the good man went through such a variety of nice and casuistical problems supposed so many extreme cases made the distinctions so critical and nice betwixt the right hand and the left handbetwixt compliance and defectionholding back and stepping asideslipping and stumblingsnares and errorsthat at length after having limited the path of truth to a mathematical line he was brought to the broad admission that each mans conscience after he had gained a certain view of the difficult navigation which he was to encounter would be the best guide for his pilotage he stated the examples and arguments for and against the acceptance of a kirk on the present revolution model with much more impartiality to butler than he had been able to place them before his own view and he concluded that his young friend ought to think upon these things and be guided by the voice of his own conscience whether he could take such an awful trust as the charge of souls without doing injury to his own internal conviction of what is right or wrong  when david had finished his very long harangue which was only interrupted by monosyllables or little more on the part of butler the orator himself was greatly astonished to find that the conclusion at which he very naturally wished to arrive seemed much less decisively attained than when he had argued the case in his own mind  in this particular davids current of thinking and speaking only illustrated the very important and general proposition concerning the excellence of the publicity of debate for under the influence of any partial feeling it is certain that most men can more easily reconcile themselves to any favourite measure when agitating it in their own mind than when obliged to expose its merits to a third party when the necessity of seeming impartial procures for the opposite arguments a much more fair statement than that which he affords it in tacit meditation having finished what he had to say david thought himself obliged to be more explicit in point of fact and to explain that this was no hypothetical case but one on which by his own influence and that of the duke of argyle reuben butler would soon be called to decide  it was even with something like apprehension that david deans heard butler announce in return to this communication that he would take that night to consider on what he had said with such kind intentions and return him an answer the next morning the feelings of the father mastered david on this occasion he pressed butler to spend the evening with himhe produced most unusual at his meals one nay two bottles of aged strong alehe spoke of his daughterof her meritsher housewiferyher thrifther affection he led butler so decidedly up to a declaration of his feelings towards jeanie that before nightfall it was distinctly understood she was to be the bride of reuben butler and if they thought it indelicate to abridge the period of deliberation which reuben had stipulated it seemed to be sufficiently understood betwixt them that there was a strong probability of his becoming minister of knocktarlitie providing the congregation were as willing to accept of him as the duke to grant him the presentation the matter of the oaths they agreed it was time enough to dispute about whenever the shibboleth should be tendered  many arrangements were adopted that evening which were afterwards ripened by correspondence with the duke of argyles man of business who intrusted deans and butler with the benevolent wish of his principal that they should all meet with jeanie on her return from england at the dukes huntinglodge in roseneath  this retrospect so far as the placid loves of jeanie deans and reuben butler are concerned forms a full explanation of the preceding narrative up to their meeting on the island as already mentioned      chapter twentieth                   i come he said my love my life                   andnatures dearest namemy wife                   thy fathers house and friends resign                   my home my friends my sire are thine                                              logan  the meeting of jeanie and butler under circumstances promising to crown an affection so long delayed was rather affecting from its simple sincerity than from its uncommon vehemence of feeling david deans whose practice was sometimes a little different from his theory appalled them at first by giving them the opinion of sundry of the suffering preachers and champions of his younger days that marriage though honourable by the laws of scripture was yet a state overrashly coveted by professors and specially by young ministers whose desire he said was at whiles too inordinate for kirks stipends and wives which had frequently occasioned overready compliance with the general defections of the times he endeavoured to make them aware also that hasty wedlock had been the bane of many a savoury professorthat the unbelieving wife had too often reversed the text and perverted the believing husbandthat when the famous donald cargill being then hiding in leewood in lanarkshire it being killingtime did upon importunity marry robert marshal of starry shaw he had thus expressed himself what hath induced robert to marry this woman her ill will overcome his goodhe will not keep the way longhis thriving days are done to the sad accomplishment of which prophecy david said he was himself a living witness for robert marshal having fallen into foul compliances with the enemy went home and heard the curates declined into other steps of defection and became lightly esteemed indeed he observed that the great upholders of the standard cargill peden cameron and renwick had less delight in tying the bonds of matrimony than in any other piece of their ministerial work and although they would neither dissuade the parties nor refuse their office they considered the being called to it as an evidence of indifference on the part of those between whom it was solemnised to the many grievous things of the day notwithstanding however that marriage was a snare unto many david was of opinion as indeed he had showed in his practice that it was in itself honourable especially if times were such that honest men could be secure against being shot hanged or banished and had ane competent livelihood to maintain themselves and those that might come after them and therefore as he concluded something abruptly addressing jeanie and butler who with faces as highcoloured as crimson had been listening to his lengthened argument for and against the holy state of matrimony i will leave you to your ain cracks  as their private conversation however interesting to themselves might probably be very little so to the reader so far as it respected their present feelings and future prospects we shall pass it over and only mention the information which jeanie received from butler concerning her sisters elopement which contained many particulars that she had been unable to extract from her father  jeanie learned therefore that for three days after her pardon had arrived effie had been the inmate of her fathers house at st leonardsthat the interviews betwixt david and his erring child which had taken place before she was liberated from prison had been touching in the extreme but butler could not suppress his opinion that when he was freed from the apprehension of losing her in a manner so horrible her father had tightened the bands of discipline so as in some degree to gall the feelings and aggravate the irritability of a spirit naturally impatient and petulant and now doubly so from the sense of merited disgrace  on the third night effie disappeared from st leonards leaving no intimation whatever of the route she had taken butler however set out in pursuit of her and with much trouble traced her towards a little landingplace formed by a small brook which enters the sea betwixt musselburgh and edinburgh this place which has been since made into a small harbour surrounded by many villas and lodginghouses is now termed portobello at this time it was surrounded by a waste common covered with furze and unfrequented save by fishingboats and now and then a smuggling lugger a vessel of this description had been hovering in the firth at the time of effies elopement and as butler ascertained a boat had come ashore in the evening on which the fugitive had disappeared and had carried on board a female as the vessel made sail immediately and landed no part of their cargo there seemed little doubt that they were accomplices of the notorious robertson and that the vessel had only come into the firth to carry off his paramour  this was made clear by a letter which butler himself soon afterwards received by post signed e d but without bearing any date of place or time it was miserably ill written and spelt seasickness having apparently aided the derangement of effies very irregular orthography and mode of expression in this epistle however as in all that unfortunate girl said or did there was something to praise as well as to blame she said in her letter that she could not endure that her father and her sister should go into banishment or be partakers of her shamethat if her burden was a heavy one it was of her own binding and she had the more right to bear it alonethat in future they could not be a comfort to her or she to them since every look and word of her father put her in mind of her transgression and was like to drive her madthat she had nearly lost her judgment during the three days she was at st leonardsher father meant weel by her and all men but he did not know the dreadful pain he gave her in casting up her sins if jeanie had been at hame it might hae dune betterjeanie was ane like the angels in heaven that rather weep for sinners than reckon their transgressions but she should never see jeanie ony mair and that was the thought that gave her the sairest heart of a that had come and gane yet on her bended knees would she pray for jeanie night and day baith for what she had done and what she had scorned to do in her behalf for what a thought would it have been to her at that moment o time if that upright creature had made a fault to save her she desired her father would give jeanie a the gearher ain ie effies mothers and ashe had made a deed giving up her right and it was in mr novits handwarlds gear was henceforward the least of her care nor was it likely to be muckle her mistershe hoped this would make it easy for her sister to settle and immediately after this expression she wished butler himself all good things in return for his kindness to her for herself she said she kend her lot would be a waesome ane but it was of her own framing sae she desired the less pity but for her friends satisfaction she wished them to know that she was gaun nae ill gatethat they who had done her maist wrong were now willing to do her what justice was in their power and she would in some warldly respects be far better off than she deserved but she desired her family to remain satisfied with this assurance and give themselves no trouble in making farther inquiries after her  to david deans and to butler this letter gave very little comfort for what was to be expected from this unfortunate girls uniting her fate to that of a character so notorious as robertson who they readily guessed was alluded to in the last sentence excepting that she should become the partner and victim of his future crimes jeanie who knew george stauntons character and real rank saw her sisters situation under a ray of better hope she augured well of the haste he had shown to reclaim his interest in effie and she trusted he had made her his wife if so it seemed improbable that with his expected fortune and high connections he should again resume the life of criminal adventure which he had led especially since as matters stood his life depended upon his keeping his own secret which could only be done by an entire change of his habits and particularly by avoiding all those who had known the heir of willingham under the character of the audacious criminal and condemned robertson  she thought it most likely that the couple would go abroad for a few years and not return to england until the affair of porteous was totally forgotten jeanie therefore saw more hopes for her sister than butler or her father had been able to perceive but she was not at liberty to impart the comfort which she felt in believing that she would be secure from the pressure of poverty and in little risk of being seduced into the paths of guilt she could not have explained this without making public what it was essentially necessary for effies chance of comfort to conceal the identity namely of george staunton and george robertson after all it was dreadful to think that effie had united herself to a man condemned for felony and liable to trial for murder whatever might be his rank in life and the degree of his repentance besides it was melancholy to reflect that she herself being in possession of the whole dreadful secret it was most probable he would out of regard to his own feelings and fear for his safety never again permit her to see poor effie after perusing and reperusing her sisters valedictory letter she gave ease to her feelings in a flood of tears which butler in vain endeavoured to check by every soothing attention in his power she was obliged however at length to look up and wipe her eyes for her father thinking he had allowed the lovers time enough for conference was now advancing towards them from the lodge accompanied by the captain of knockdunder or as his friends called him for brevitys sake duncan knock a title which some youthful exploits had rendered peculiarly appropriate  this duncan of knockdunder was a person of firstrate importance in the island of roseneath and the continental parishes of knocktarlitie kilmun and so forth nay his influence extended as far as cowal where however it was obscured by that of another factor   this is more correctly speaking a peninsula  the tower of knockdunder still occupies with its remains a cliff overhanging the holy loch duncan swore it had been a royal castle if so it was one of the smallest the space within only forming a square of sixteen feet and bearing therefore a ridiculous proportion to the thickness of the walls which was ten feet at least such as it was however it had long given the title of captain equivalent to that of chatellain to the ancestors of duncan who were retainers of the house of argyle and held a hereditary jurisdiction under them of little extent indeed but which had great consequence in their own eyes and was usually administered with a vigour somewhat beyond the law  the present representative of that ancient family was a stout short man about fifty whose pleasure it was to unite in his own person the dress of the highlands and lowlands wearing on his head a black tiewig surmounted by a fierce cockedhat deeply guarded with gold lace while the rest of his dress consisted of the plaid and philabeg duncan superintended a district which was partly highland partly lowland and therefore might be supposed to combine their national habits in order to show his impartiality to trojan or tyrian the incongruity however had a whimsical and ludicrous effect as it made his head and body look as if belonging to different individuals or as some one said who had seen the executions of the insurgent prisoners in 1715 it seemed as if some jacobite enchanter having recalled the sufferers to life had clapped in his haste an englishmans head on a highlanders body to finish the portrait the bearing of the gracious duncan was brief bluff and consequential and the upward turn of his short coppercoloured nose indicated that he was somewhat addicted to wrath and usquebaugh  when this dignitary had advanced up to butler and to jeanie i take the freedom mr deans he said in a very consequential manner to salute your daughter whilk i presume this young lass to bei kiss every pretty girl that comes to roseneath in virtue of my office having made this gallant speech he took out his quid saluted jeanie with a hearty smack and bade her welcome to argyles country then addressing butler he said ye maun gang ower and meet the carle ministers yonder the morn for they will want to do your job and synd it down with usquebaugh doubtlessthey seldom make dry wark in this kintra  and the lairdsaid david deans addressing butler in farther explanation  the captain man interrupted duncan folk winna ken wha ye are speaking aboot unless ye gie shentlemens their proper title  the captain then said david assures me that the call is unanimous on the part of the parishionersa real harmonious call reuben  i pelieve said duncan it was as harmonious as could pe expected when the tae half o the bodies were clavering sassenach and the tother skirting gaelic like seamaws and clackgeese before a storm ane wad hae needed the gift of tongues to ken preceesely what they saidbut i pelieve the best end of it was long live maccallummore and knockdunderand as to its being an unanimous call i wad be glad to ken fat business the carles have to call ony thing or ony body but what the duke and mysell likes  nevertheless said mr butler if any of the parishioners have any scruples which sometimes happen in the mind of sincere professors i should be happy of an opportunity of trying to remove  never fash your peard about it man interrupted duncan knockleave it a to mescruple deil ane o them has been bred up to scruple onything that theyre bidden to do and if sic a thing suld happen as ye speak o ye sall see the sincere professor as ye ca him towed at the stern of my boat for a few furlongs ill try if the water of the haly loch winna wash off scruples as weel as fleascot tam  the rest of duncans threat was lost in a growling gargling sort of sound which he made in his throat and which menaced recusants with no gentle means of conversion david deans would certainly have given battle in defence of the right of the christian congregation to be consulted in the choice of their own pastor which in his estimation was one of the choicest and most inalienable of their privileges but he had again engaged in close conversation with jeanie and with more interest than he was in use to take in affairs foreign alike to his occupation and to his religious tenets was inquiring into the particulars of her london journey this was perhaps fortunate for the newformed friendship betwixt him and the captain of knockdunder which rested in davids estimation upon the proofs he had given of his skill in managing stock but in reality upon the special charge transmitted to duncan from the duke and his agent to behave with the utmost attention to deans and his family  and now sirs said duncan in a commanding tone i am to pray ye a to come in to your supper for yonder is mr archibald half famished and a saxon woman that looks as if her een were fleeing out o her head wi fear and wonder as if she had never seen a shentleman in a philabeg pefore  and reuben butler said david will doubtless desire instantly to retire that he may prepare his mind for the exercise of tomorrow that his work may suit the day and be an offering of a sweet savour in the nostrils of the reverend presbytery  hout tout man its but little ye ken about them interrupted the captain teil a ane o them wad gie the savour of the hot venison pasty which i smell turning his squab nose up in the air a the way frae the lodge for a that mr putler or you either can say to them  david groaned but judging he had to do with a gallio as he said did not think it worth his while to give battle they followed the captain to the house and arranged themselves with great ceremony round a wellloaded suppertable the only other circumstance of the evening worthy to be recorded is that butler pronounced the blessing that knockdunder found it too long and david deans censured it as too short from which the charitable reader may conclude it was exactly the proper length      chapter twentyfirst                    now turn the psalms of david ower                        and lilt wi holy clangor                    of double verse come gie us four                        and skirl up the bangor                                             burns  the next was the important day when according to the forms and ritual of the scottish kirk reuben butler was to be ordained minister of knocktarlitie by the presbytery of  and so eager were the whole party that all excepting mrs dutton the destined cowslip of inverary were stirring at an early hour  their host whose appetite was as quick and keen as his temper was not long in summoning them to a substantial breakfast where there were at least a dozen of different preparations of milk plenty of cold meat scores boiled and roasted eggs a huge cag of butter halfafirkin herrings boiled and broiled fresh and salt and tea and coffee for them that liked it which as their landlord assured them with a nod and a wink pointing at the same time to a little cutter which seemed dodging under the lee of the island cost them little beside the fetching ashore  is the contraband trade permitted here so openly said butler i should think it very unfavourable to the peoples morals  the duke mr putler has gien nae orders concerning the putting of it down said the magistrate and seemed to think that he had said all that was necessary to justify his connivance butler was a man of prudence and aware that real good can only be obtained by remonstrance when remonstrance is welltimed so for the present he said nothing more on the subject  when breakfast was half over in flounced mrs dolly as fine as a blue sacque and cherrycoloured ribands could make her  good morrow to you madam said the master of ceremonies i trust your early rising will not skaith ye  the dame apologised to captain knockunder as she was pleased to term their entertainer but as we say in cheshire she added i was like the mayor of altringham who lies in bed while his breeches are mending for the girl did not bring up the right bundle to my room till she had brought up all the others by mistake one after totherwell i suppose we are all for church today as i understandpray may i be so bold as to ask if it is the fashion for your north country gentlemen to go to church in your petticoats captain knockunder  captain of knockdunder madam if you please for i knock under to no man and in respect of my garb i shall go to church as i am at your service madam for if i were to lie in bed like your major whatdyecallum till my preeches were mended i might be there all my life seeing i never had a pair of them on my person but twice in my life which i am pound to remember it peing when the duke brought his duchess here when her grace pehoved to be pleasured so i een porrowed the ministers trews for the twa days his grace was pleased to staybut i will put myself under sic confinement again for no man on earth or woman either but her grace being always excepted as in duty pound  the mistress of the milkingpail stared but making no answer to this round declaration immediately proceeded to show that the alarm of the preceding evening had in no degree injured her appetite  when the meal was finished the captain proposed to them to take boat in order that mrs jeanie might see her new place of residence and that he himself might inquire whether the necessary preparations had been made there and at the manse for receiving the future inmates of these mansions  the morning was delightful and the huge mountainshadows slept upon the mirrored wave of the firth almost as little disturbed as if it had been an inland lake even mrs duttons fears no longer annoyed her she had been informed by archibald that there was to be some sort of junketting after the sermon and that was what she loved dearly and as for the water it was so still that it would look quite like a pleasuring on the thames  the whole party being embarked therefore in a large boat which the captain called his coach and six and attended by a smaller one termed his gig the gallant duncan steered straight upon the little tower of the oldfashioned church of knocktarlitie and the exertions of six stout rowers sped them rapidly on their voyage as they neared the land the hills appeared to recede from them and a little valley formed by the descent of a small river from the mountains evolved itself as it were upon their approach the style of the country on each side was simply pastoral and resembled in appearance and character the description of a forgotten scottish poet which runs nearly thus                    the water gently down a level slid                with little din but couthy what it made               on ilka side the trees grew thick and lang             and wi the wild birds notes were a in sang                on either side a full bowshot and mair                  the green was even gowany and fair                 with easy slope on every hand the braes             to the hills feet with scatterd bushes raise               with goats and sheep aboon and kye below                 the bonny banks all in a swarm did go   rosss fortunate shepherdess edit 1778 p 23  they landed in this highland arcadia at the mouth of the small stream which watered the delightful and peaceable valley inhabitants of several descriptions came to pay their respects to the captain of knockdunder a homage which he was very peremptory in exacting and to see the new settlers some of these were men after david deanss own heart elders of the kirksession zealous professors from the lennox lanarkshire and ayrshire to whom the preceding duke of argyle had given rooms in this corner of his estate because they had suffered for joining his father the unfortunate earl during his illfated attempt in 1686 these were cakes of the right leaven for david regaling himself with and had it not been for this circumstance he has been heard to say that the captain of knockdunder would have swore him out of the country in twentyfour hours sae awsome it was to ony thinking soul to hear his imprecations upon the slightest temptation that crossed his humour  besides these there were a wilder set of parishioners mountaineers from the upper glen and adjacent hill who spoke gaelic went about armed and wore the highland dress but the strict commands of the duke had established such good order in this part of his territories that the gael and saxons lived upon the best possible terms of good neighbourhood they first visited the manse as the parsonage is termed in scotland it was old but in good repair and stood snugly embosomed in a grove of sycamore with a wellstocked garden in front bounded by the small river which was partly visible from the windows partly concealed by the bushes trees and bounding hedge within the house looked less comfortable than it might have been for it had been neglected by the late incumbent but workmen had been labouring under the directions of the captain of knockdunder and at the expense of the duke of argyle to put it into some order the old plenishing had been removed and neat but plain household furniture had been sent down by the duke in a brig of his own called the caroline and was now ready to be placed in order in the apartments  the gracious duncan finding matters were at a stand among the workmen summoned before him the delinquents and impressed all who heard him with a sense of his authority by the penalties with which he threatened them for their delay mulcting them in half their charge he assured them would be the least of it for if they were to neglect his pleasure and the dukes he would be tamnd if he paid them the tother half either and they might seek law for it where they could get it the workpeople humbled themselves before the offended dignitary and spake him soft and fair and at length upon mr butler recalling to his mind that it was the ordinationday and that the workmen were probably thinking of going to church knockdunder agreed to forgive them out of respect to their new minister  but an i catch them neglecking my duty again mr putler the teil pe in me if the kirk shall be an excuse for what has the like o them rapparees to do at the kirk ony day put sundays or then either if the duke and i has the necessitous uses for them  it may be guessed with what feelings of quiet satisfaction and delight butler looked forward to spending his days honoured and useful as he trusted to be in this sequestered valley and how often an intelligent glance was exchanged betwixt him and jeanie whose goodhumoured face looked positively handsome from the expression of modesty and at the same time of satisfaction which she wore when visiting the apartments of which she was soon to call herself mistress she was left at liberty to give more open indulgence to her feelings of delight and admiration when leaving the manse the company proceeded to examine the destined habitation of david deans  jeanie found with pleasure that it was not above a musketshot from the manse for it had been a bar to her happiness to think she might be obliged to reside at a distance from her father and she was aware that there were strong objections to his actually living in the same house with butler but this brief distance was the very thing which she could have wished  the farmhouse was on the plan of an improved cottage and contrived with great regard to convenience an excellent little garden an orchard and a set of offices complete according to the best ideas of the time combined to render it a most desirable habitation for the practical farmer and far superior to the hovel at woodend and the small house at saint leonards crags the situation was considerably higher than that of the manse and fronted to the west the windows commanded an enchanting view of the little vale over which the mansion seemed to preside the windings of the stream and the firth with its associated lakes and romantic islands the hills of dumbartonshire once possessed by the fierce clan of macfarlanes formed a crescent behind the valley and far to the right were seen the dusky and more gigantic mountains of argyleshire with a seaward view of the shattered and thundersplitten peaks of arran  but to jeanie whose taste for the picturesque if she had any by nature had never been awakened or cultivated the sight of the faithful old may hettly as she opened the door to receive them in her clean toy sundays russetgown and blue apron nicely smoothed down before her was worth the whole varied landscape the raptures of the faithful old creature at seeing jeanie were equal to her own as she hastened to assure her that baith the gudeman and the beasts had been as weel seen after as she possibly could contrive separating her from the rest of the company may then hurried her young mistress to the offices that she might receive the compliments she expected for her care of the cows jeanie rejoiced in the simplicity of her heart to see her charge once more and the mute favourites of our heroine gowans and the others acknowledged her presence by lowing turning round their broad and decent brows when they heard her wellknown pruh my leddypruh my woman and by various indications known only to those who have studied the habits of the milky mothers showing sensible pleasure as she approached to caress them in their turn  the very brute beasts are glad to see ye again said may but nae wonder jeanie for ye were aye kind to beast and body and i maun learn to ca ye mistress now jeanie since ye hae been up to lunnon and seen the duke and the king and a the braw folk but wha kens added the old dame slily what ill hae to ca ye forby mistress for i am thinking it wunna lang be deans  ca me your ain jeanie may and then ye can never gang wrang  in the cowhouse which they examined there was one animal which jeanie looked at till the tears gushed from her eyes may who had watched her with a sympathising expression immediately observed in an undertone the gudeman aye sorts that beast himself and is kinder to it than ony beast in the byre and i noticed he was that way een when he was angriest and had maist cause to be angryeh sirs a parents hearts a queer thingmony a warsle he has had for that puir lassiei am thinking he petitions mair for her than for yoursell hinny for what can he plead for you but just to wish you the blessing ye deserve and when i sleepit ayont the hallan when we came first here he was often earnest a night and i could hear him come ower and ower again wi effiepuir blinded misguided thing it was aye effie effieif that puir wandering lamb comena into the sheepfauld in the shepherds ain time it will be an unco wonder for i wot she has been a child of prayers oh if the puir prodigal wad return sae blithely as the goodman wad kill the fatted calfthough brockies calf will no be fit for killing this three weeks yet  and then with the discursive talent of persons of her description she got once more afloat in her account of domestic affairs and left this delicate and affecting topic  having looked at every thing in the offices and the dairy and expressed her satisfaction with the manner in which matters had been managed in her absence jeanie rejoined the rest of the party who were surveying the interior of the house all excepting david deans and butler who had gone down to the church to meet the kirksession and the clergymen of the presbytery and arrange matters for the duty of the day  in the interior of the cottage all was clean neat and suitable to the exterior it had been originally built and furnished by the duke as a retreat for a favourite domestic of the higher class who did not long enjoy it and had been dead only a few months so that every thing was in excellent taste and good order but in jeanies bedroom was a neat trunk which had greatly excited mrs duttons curiosity for she was sure that the direction for mrs jean deans at auchingower parish of knocktarlitie was the writing of mrs semple the duchesss own woman may hettly produced the key in a sealed parcel which bore the same address and attached to the key was a label intimating that the trunk and its contents were a token of remembrance to jeanie deans from her friends the duchess of argyle and the young ladies the trunk hastily opened as the reader will not doubt was found to be full of wearing apparel of the best quality suited to jeanies rank in life and to most of the articles the names of the particular donors were attached as if to make jeanie sensible not only of the general but of the individual interest she had excited in the noble family to name the various articles by their appropriate names would be to attempt things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme besides that the oldfashioned terms of manteaus sacques kissingstrings and so forth would convey but little information even to the milliners of the present day i shall deposit however an accurate inventory of the contents of the trunk with my kind friend miss martha buskbody who has promised should the public curiosity seem interested in the subject to supply me with a professional glossary and commentary suffice it to say that the gift was such as became the donors and was suited to the situation of the receiver that every thing was handsome and appropriate and nothing forgotten which belonged to the wardrobe of a young person in jeanies situation in life the destined bride of a respectable clergyman  article after article was displayed commented upon and admired to the wonder of may who declared she didna think the queen had mair or better claise and somewhat to the envy of the northern cowslip this unamiable but not very unnatural disposition of mind broke forth in sundry unfounded criticisms to the disparagement of the articles as they were severally exhibited but it assumed a more direct character when at the bottom of all was found a dress of white silk very plainly made but still of white silk and french silk to boot with a paper pinned to it bearing that it was a present from the duke of argyle to his travelling companion to be worn on the day when she should change her name  mrs dutton could forbear no longer but whispered into mr archibalds ear that it was a clever thing to be a scotchwoman she supposed all her sisters and she had halfadozen might have been hanged without any one sending her a present of a pocket handkerchief  or without your making any exertion to save them mrs dolly answered archibald drilybut i am surprised we do not hear the bell yet said he looking at his watch  fat ta deil mr archibald answered the captain of knockdunder wad ye hae them ring the bell before i am ready to gang to kirki wad gar the bedral eat the bellrope if he took ony sic freedom but if ye want to hear the bell i will just show mysell on the knowehead and it will begin jowing forthwith  accordingly so soon as they sallied out and that the goldlaced hat of the captain was seen rising like hesper above the dewy verge of the rising ground the clash for it was rather a clash than a clang of the bell was heard from the old mossgrown tower and the clapper continued to thump its cracked sides all the while they advanced towards the kirk duncan exhorting them to take their own time for teil ony sport wad be till he came   note t tolling to service in scotland   accordingly the bell only changed to the final and impatient chime when they crossed the stile and rang in that is concluded its mistuned summons when they had entered the dukes seat in the little kirk where the whole party arranged themselves with duncan at their head excepting david deans who already occupied a seat among the elders  the business of the day with a particular detail of which it is unnecessary to trouble the reader was gone through according to the established form and the sermon pronounced upon the occasion had the good fortune to please even the critical david deans though it was only an hour and a quarter long which david termed a short allowance of spiritual provender  the preacher who was a divine that held many of davids opinions privately apologised for his brevity by saying that he observed the captain was gaunting grievously and that if he had detained him longer there was no knowing how long he might be in paying the next terms victual stipend  david groaned to find that such carnal motives could have influence upon the mind of a powerful preacher he had indeed been scandalised by another circumstance during the service  so soon as the congregation were seated after prayers and the clergyman had read his text the gracious duncan after rummaging the leathern purse which hung in front of his petticoat produced a short tobaccopipe made of iron and observed almost aloud i hae forgotten my spleuchanlachlan gang down to the clachan and

service when butler had been admitted minister of the kirk of knocktarlitie with all its spiritual immunities and privileges david who had frowned groaned and murmured at knockdunders irreverent demeanour communicated his plain thoughts of the matter to isaac meiklehose one of the elders with whom a reverential aspect and huge grizzle wig had especially disposed him to seek fraternisation it didna become a wild indian david said much less a christian and a gentleman to sit in the kirk puffing tobaccoreek as if he were in a changehouse  meiklehose shook his head and allowed it was far frae beseemingbut what will ye say the captains a queer hand and to speak to him about that or onything else that crosses the maggot wad be to set the kiln alow he keeps a high hand ower the country and we couldna deal wi the hielandmen without his protection sin a the keys o the kintray hings at his belt and hes no an ill body in the main and maistry ye ken maws the meadows doun  that may be very true

their dinner to the changehouse and if we dinna mend our pace well come short at mealtime  david accompanied his friend without answer but began to feel from experience that the glen of knocktarlitie like the rest of the world was haunted by its own special subjects of regret and discontent his mind was so much occupied by considering the best means of converting duncan of knock to a sense of reverend decency during public worship that he altogether forgot to inquire whether butler was called upon to subscribe the oaths to government  some have insinuated that his neglect on this head was in some degree intentional but i think this explanation inconsistent with the simplicity of my friend davids character neither have i ever been able by the most minute inquiries to know whether the formula at which he so much scrupled had been exacted from butler ay or no the books of the kirksession might have thrown some light on this matter but unfortunately they were destroyed in the year 1746 by one donacha dhu na dunaigh at the instance it was said or at least by the connivance of the gracious duncan of knock who had a desire to obliterate the recorded foibles of a certain kate finlayson      chapter twentysecond                  now butt and ben the changehouse fills                       wi yillcaup commentators                heres crying out for bakes and gills

             is like to breed a rupture                           o wrath that day                                             burns  a plentiful entertainment at the duke of argyles cost regaled the reverend gentlemen who had assisted at the ordination of reuben butler and almost all the respectable part of the parish the feast was indeed such as the country itself furnished for plenty of all the requisites for a rough and round dinner were always at duncan of knocks command there was the beef and mutton on the braes the fresh and saltwater fish in the lochs the brooks and firth game of every kind from the deer to the leveret were to be had for the killing in the dukes forests moors heaths and mosses and for liquor homebrewed ale flowed as freely as water brandy and usquebaugh both were had in those happy times without duty even white wine and claret were got for nothing since the dukes extensive rights of admiralty gave him a title to all the wine in cask which is drifted ashore on the western coast and isles of scotland when shipping have suffered by severe weather in short as duncan boasted the entertainment did not cost maccallummore a plack out of his sporran and was nevertheless not only liberal but overflowing  the dukes health was solemnised in a bona fide bumper and david deans himself added perhaps the first huzza that his lungs had ever uttered to swell the shout with which the pledge was received nay so exalted in heart was he upon this memorable occasion and so much disposed to be indulgent that he expressed no dissatisfaction when three bagpipers struck up the campbells are coming the health of the reverend minister of knocktarlitie was received with similar honours and there was a roar of laughter when one of his brethren slily subjoined the addition of a good wife to our brother to keep the manse in order on this occasion david deans was delivered of his firstborn joke and apparently the parturition was accompanied with many throes for sorely did he twist about his physiognomy and much did he stumble in his speech before he could express his idea that the lad being now wedded to his spiritual bride it was hard to threaten him with ane temporal spouse in the same day he then laughed a hoarse and brief laugh and was suddenly grave and silent as if abashed at his own vivacious effort  after another toast or two jeanie mrs dolly and such of the female natives as had honoured the feast with their presence retired to davids new dwelling at auchingower and left the gentlemen to their potations  the feast proceeded with great glee the conversation where duncan had it under his direction was not indeed always strictly canonical but david deans escaped any risk of being scandalised by engaging with one of his neighbours in a recapitulation of the sufferings of ayrshire and lanarkshire during what was called the invasion of the highland host the prudent mr meiklehose cautioning them from time to time to lower their voices for that duncan knocks father had been at that onslaught and brought back muckle gude plenishing and that duncan was no unlikely to hae been there himself for what he kend  meanwhile as the mirth grew fast and furious the graver members of the party began to escape as well as they could david deans accomplished his retreat and butler anxiously watched an opportunity to follow him knockdunder however desirous he said of knowing what stuff was in the new minister had no intention to part with him so easily but kept him pinned to his side watching him sedulously and with obliging violence filling his glass to the brim as often as he could seize an opportunity of doing so at length as the evening was wearing late a venerable brother chanced to ask mr archibald when they might hope to see the duke tam carum caput as he would venture to term him at the lodge of roseneath duncan of knock whose ideas were somewhat conglomerated and who it may be believed was no great scholar catching up some imperfect sound of the words conceived the speaker was drawing a parallel between the duke and sir donald gorme of sleat and being of opinion that such comparison was odious snorted thrice and prepared himself to be in a passion  to the explanation of the venerable divine the captain answered i heard the word gorme myself sir with my ain ears dye think i do not know gaelic from latin  apparently not sirso the clergyman offended in his turn and taking a pinch of snuff answered with great coolness  the copper nose of the gracious duncan now became heated like the bull of phalaris and while mr archibald mediated betwixt the offended parties and the attention of the company was engaged by their dispute butler took an opportunity to effect his retreat  he found the females at auchingower very anxious for the breaking up of the convivial party for it was a part of the arrangement that although david deans was to remain at auchingower and butler was that night to take possession of the manse yet jeanie for whom complete accommodations were not yet provided in her fathers house was to return for a day or two to the lodge at roseneath and the boats had been held in readiness accordingly they waited therefore for knockdunders return but twilight came and they still waited in vain at length mr archibald who was a man of decorum had taken care not to exceed in his conviviality made his appearance and advised the females strongly to return to the island under his escort observing that from the humour in which he had left the captain it was a great chance whether he budged out of the publichouse that night and it was absolutely certain that he would not be very fit company for ladies the gig was at their disposal he said and there was still pleasant twilight for a party on the water  jeanie who had considerable confidence in archibalds prudence immediately acquiesced in this proposal but mrs dolly positively objected to the small boat if the big boat could be gotten she agreed to set out otherwise she would sleep on the floor rather than stir a step reasoning with dolly was out of the question and archibald did not think the difficulty so pressing as to require compulsion he observed it was not using the captain very politely to deprive him of his coach and six but as it was in the ladies service he gallantly said he would use so much freedombesides the gig would serve the captains purpose better as it could come off at any hour of the tide the large boat should therefore be at mrs dollys service  they walked to the beach accordingly accompanied by butler it was some time before the boatmen could be assembled and ere they were well embarked and ready to depart the pale moon was come over the hill and flinging a trembling reflection on the broad and glittering waves but so soft and pleasant was the night that butler in bidding farewell to jeanie had no apprehension for her safety and what is yet more extraordinary mrs dolly felt no alarm for her own the air was soft and came over the cooling wave with something of summer fragrance the beautiful scene of headlands and capes and bays around them with the broad blue chain of mountains were dimly visible in the moonlight while every dash of the oars made the waters glance and sparkle with the brilliant phenomenon called the sea fire  this last circumstance filled jeanie with wonder and served to amuse the mind of her companion until they approached the little bay which seemed to stretch its dark and wooded arms into the sea as if to welcome them  the usual landingplace was at a quarter of a miles distance from the lodge and although the tide did not admit of the large boat coming quite close to the jetty of loose stones which served as a pier jeanie who was both bold and active easily sprung ashore but mrs dolly positively refusing to commit herself to the same risk the complaisant mr archibald ordered the boat round to a more regular landingplace at a considerable distance along the shore he then prepared to land himself that he might in the meanwhile accompany jeanie to the lodge but as there was no mistaking the woodland lane which led from thence to the shore and as the moonlight showed her one of the white chimneys rising out of the wood which embosomed the building jeanie declined this favour with thanks and requested him to proceed with mrs dolly who being in a country where the ways were so strange to her had mair need of countenance  this indeed was a fortunate circumstance and might even be said to save poor cowslips life if it was true as she herself used solemnly to aver that she must positively have expired for fear if she had been left alone in the boat with six wild highlanders in kilts  the night was so exquisitely beautiful that jeanie instead of immediately directing her course towards the lodge stood looking after the boat as it again put off from the side and rowed into the little bay the dark figures of her companions growing less and less distinct as they diminished in the distance and the jorram or melancholy boatsong of the rowers coming on the ear with softened and sweeter sound until the boat rounded the headland and was lost to her observation  still jeanie remained in the same posture looking out upon the sea it would she was aware be some time ere her companions could reach the lodge as the distance by the more convenient landingplace was considerably greater than from the point where she stood and she was not sorry to have an opportunity to spend the interval by herself  the wonderful change which a few weeks had wrought in her situation from shame and grief and almost despair to honour joy and a fair prospect of future happiness passed before her eyes with a sensation which brought the tears into them yet they flowed at the same time from another source as human happiness is never perfect and as wellconstructed minds are never more sensible of the distresses of those whom they love than when their own situation forms a contrast with them jeanies affectionate regrets turned to the fate of her poor sisterthe child of so many hopesthe fondled nursling of so many yearsnow an exile and what was worse dependent on the will of a man of whose habits she had every reason to entertain the worst opinion and who even in his strongest paroxysms of remorse had appeared too much a stranger to the feelings of real penitence  while her thoughts were occupied with these melancholy reflections a shadowy figure seemed to detach itself from the copsewood on her right hand jeanie started and the stories of apparitions and wraiths seen by solitary travellers in wild situations at such times and in such an hour suddenly came full upon her imagination the figure glided on and as it came betwixt her and the moon she was aware that it had the appearance of a woman a soft voice twice repeated jeaniejeanie was it indeedcould it be the voice of her sisterwas she still among the living or had the grave given uly its tenantere she could state these questions to her own mind effie alive and in the body had clasped her in her arms and was straining her to her bosom and devouring her with kisses i have wandered here she said like a ghaist to see you and nae wonder you take me for anei thought but to see you gang by or to hear the sound of your voice but to speak to yoursell again jeanie was mair than i deserved and mair than i durst pray for  o effie how came ye here alone and at this hour and on the wild seabeachare you sure its your ain living sell there was something of effies former humour in her practically answering the question by a gentle pinch more beseeming the fingers of a fairy than of a ghost and again the sisters embraced and laughed and wept by turns  but ye maun gang up wi me to the lodge effie said jeanie and tell me a your storyi hae gude folk there that will make ye welcome for my sake  na na jeanie

mouth and pointing to the thicket with the other he is yonder she said this in a tone which showed that her husband had found means to inspire her with awe as well as affection at this moment a man issued from the wood  it was young staunton even by the imperfect light of the moon jeanie could observe that he was handsomely dressed and had the air of a person of rank  effie he said our time is wellnigh spentthe skiff will be aground in the creek and i dare not stay longeri hope your sister will allow me to salute her but jeanie shrunk back from him with a feeling of internal abhorrence well he said it does not much signify if you keep up the feeling of illwill at least you do not act upon it and i thank you for your respect to my secret when a word which in your place i would have spoken at once would have cost me my life people say you should keep from the wife of your bosom the secret that concerns your neckmy wife and her sister both know mine and i shall not sleep a wink the less sound  but are you really married to my sister sir asked jeanie in great doubt and anxiety for the haughty careless tone in which he spoke seemed to justify her worst apprehensions  i really am legally married and by my own name replied staunton more gravely  and your fatherand your friends  and my father and my friends must just reconcile themselves to that which is done and cannot be undone replied staunton however it is my intention in order to break off dangerous connections and to let my friends come to their temper to conceal my marriage for the present and stay abroad for some years so that you will not hear of us for some time if ever you hear of us again at all it would be dangerous you must be aware to keep up the correspondence for all would guess that the husband

husbandthey plunged into the copsewood and she saw them no more the whole scene had the effect of a vision and she could almost have believed it such but that very soon after they quitted her she heard the sound of oars and a skiff was seen on the firth pulling swiftly towards the small smuggling sloop which lay in the offing it was on board of such a vessel that effie had embarked at portobello and jeanie had no doubt that the same conveyance was destined as staunton had hinted to transport them to a foreign country  although it was impossible to determine whether this interview while it was passing gave more pain or pleasure to jeanie deans yet the ultimate impression which remained on her mind was decidedly favourable effie was marriedmade according to the common phrase an honest womanthat was one main point it seemed also as if her husband were about to abandon the path of gross vice in which he had run so long and so desperatelythat was another for his final and effectual conversion he did not want understanding and god knew his own hour  such were the thoughts with which jeanie endeavoured to console her anxiety respecting her sisters future fortune on her arrival at the lodge she found archibald in some anxiety at her stay and about to walk out in quest of her a headache served as an apology for retiring to rest in order to conceal her visible agitation of mind from her companions  by this secession also she escaped a scene of a different sort for as if there were danger in all gigs whether by sea or land that of knockdunder had been run down by another boat an accident owing chiefly to the drunkenness of the captain his crew and passengers knockdunder and two or three guests whom he was bringing along with him to finish the conviviality of the evening at the lodge got a sound ducking but being rescued by the crew of the boat which endangered them there was no ultimate loss excepting that of the captains laced hat which greatly to the satisfaction of the highland part of the district as well as to the improvement of the conformity of his own personal appearance he replaced by a smart highland bonnet next day many were the vehement threats of vengeance which on the succeeding morning the gracious duncan threw out against the boat which had upset him but as neither she nor the small smuggling vessel to which she belonged was any longer to be seen in the firth he was compelled to sit down with the affront this was the more hard he said as he was assured the mischief was done on purpose these scoundrels having lurked about after they had landed every drop of brandy and every bag of tea they had on board and he understood the coxswain had been on shore making particular inquiries concerning the time when his boat was to cross over and to return and so forth  put the neist time they meet me on the firth said duncan with great majesty i will teach the moonlight rapscallions and vagabonds to keep their ain side of the road and pe tamnd to them      chapter twentythird                lord who would live turmoiled in a court               and may enjoy such quiet walks as these                                         shakespeare  within a reasonable time after butler was safely and comfortably settled in his living and jeanie had taken up her abode at auchingower with her fatherthe precise extent of which interval we request each reader to settle according to his own sense of what is decent and proper upon the occasionand after due proclamation of banns and all other formalities the long wooing of this worthy pair was ended by their union in the holy bands of matrimony on this occasion david deans stoutly withstood the iniquities of pipes fiddles and promiscuous dancing to the great wrath of the captain of knockdunder who said if he had guessed it was to be sic a tamnd quakers meeting he wad hae seen them peyont the cairn before he wad hae darkened their doors  and so much rancour remained on the spirits of the gracious duncan upon this occasion that various picqueerings as david called them took place upon the same and similar topics and it was only in consequence of an accidental visit of the duke to his lodge at roseneath that they were put a stop to but upon that occasion his grace showed such particular respect to mr and mrs butler and such favour even to old david that knockdunder held it prudent to change his course towards the latter he in future used to express himself among friends concerning the minister and his wife as very worthy decent folk just a little over strict in their notions put it was pest for thae plack cattle to err on the safe side and respecting david he allowed that he was an excellent judge of nowte and sheep and a sensible eneugh carle an it werena for his tamnd cameronian nonsense whilk it is not worth while of a shentleman to knock out of an auld silly head either by force of reason or otherwise so that by avoiding topics of dispute the personages of our tale lived in great good habits with the gracious duncan only that he still grieved davids soul and set a perilous example to the congregation by sometimes bringing his pipe to the church during a cold winter day and almost always sleeping during sermon in the summer time  mrs butler whom we must no longer if we can help it term by the familiar name of jeanie brought into the married state the same firm mind and affectionate dispositionthe same natural and homely good sense and spirit of useful exertionin a word all the domestic good qualities of which she had given proof during her maiden life she did not indeed rival butler in learning but then no woman more devoutly venerated the extent of her husbands erudition she did not pretend to understand his expositions of divinity but no minister of the presbytery had his humble dinner so well arranged his clothes and linen in equal good order his fireside so neatly swept his parlour so clean and his books so well dusted  if he talked to jeanie of what she did not understandand for the man was mortal and had been a schoolmaster he sometimes did harangue more scholarly and wisely than was necessaryshe listened in placid silence and whenever the point referred to common life and was such as came under the grasp of a strong natural understanding her views were more forcible and her observations more acute than his own in acquired politeness of manners when it happened that she mingled a little in society mrs butler was of course judged deficient but then she had that obvious wish to oblige and that real and natural goodbreeding depending on good sense and good humour which joined to a considerable degree of archness and liveliness of manner rendered her behaviour acceptable to all with whom she was called upon to associate notwithstanding her strict attention to all domestic affairs she always appeared the clean welldressed mistress of the house never the sordid household drudge when complimented on this occasion by duncan knock who swore that he thought the fairies must help her since her house was always clean and nobody ever saw anybody sweeping it she modestly replied that much might be dune by timing anes turns  duncan replied he heartily wished she could teach that art to the huzzies at the lodge for he could never discover that the house was washed at a except now and then by breaking his shins over the pail cot tamn the jauds  of lesser matters there is not occasion to speak much it may easily be believed that the dukes cheese was carefully made and so graciously accepted that the offering became annual remembrances and acknowledgments of past favours were sent to mrs bickerton and mrs glass and an amicable intercourse maintained from time to time with these two respectable and benevolent persons  it is especially necessary to mention that in the course of five years mrs butler had three children two boys and a girl all stout healthy babes of grace fairhaired blueeyed and stronglimbed the boys were named david and reuben an order of nomenclature which was much to the satisfaction of the old hero of the covenant and the girl by her mothers special desire was christened euphemia rather contrary to the wish both of her father and husband who nevertheless loved mrs butler too well and were too much indebted to her for their hours of happiness to withstand any request which she made with earnestness and as a gratification to herself but from some feeling i know not of what kind the child was never distinguished by the name of effie but by the abbreviation of femie which in scotland is equally commonly applied to persons called euphemia  in this state of quiet and unostentatious enjoyment there were besides the ordinary rubs and ruffles which disturb even the most uniform life two things which particularly chequered mrs butlers happiness without these she said to our informer her life would have been but too happy and perhaps she added she had need of some crosses in this world to remind her that there was a better to come behind it  the first of these related to certain polemical skirmishes betwixt her father and her husband which notwithstanding the mutual respect and affection they entertained for each other and their great love for hernotwithstanding also their general agreement in strictness and even severity of presbyterian principleoften threatened unpleasant weather between them david deans as our readers must be aware was sufficiently opinionative and intractable and having prevailed on himself to become a member of a kirksession under the established church he felt doubly obliged to evince that in so doing he had not compromised any whit of his former professions either in practice or principle now mr butler doing all credit to his fatherinlaws motives was frequently of opinion that it were better to drop out of memory points of division and separation and to act in the manner most likely to attract and unite all parties who were serious in religion moreover he was not pleased as a man and a scholar to be always dictated to by his unlettered fatherinlaw and as a clergyman he did not think it fit to seem for ever under the thumb of an elder of his own kirksession a proud but honest thought carried his opposition now and then a little farther than it would otherwise have gone my brethren he said will suppose i am flattering and conciliating the old man for the sake of his succession if i defer and give way to him on every occasion and besides there are many on which i neither can nor will conscientiously yield to his notions i cannot be persecuting old women for witches or ferreting out matter of scandal among the young ones which might otherwise have remained concealed  from this difference of opinion it happened that in many cases of nicety such as in owning certain defections and failing to testify against certain backslidings of the time in not always severely tracing forth little matters of scandal and fama clamosa which david called a loosening of the reins of discipline and in failing to demand clear testimonies in other points of controversy which had as it were drifted to leeward with the change of times butler incurred the censure of his fatherinlaw and sometimes the disputes betwixt them became eager and almost unfriendly in all such cases mrs butler was a mediating spirit who endeavoured by the alkaline smoothness of her own disposition to neutralise the acidity of theological controversy to the complaints of both she lent an unprejudiced and attentive ear and sought always rather to excuse than absolutely to defend the other party  she reminded her father that butler had not his experience of the auld and wrastling times when folk were gifted wi a far look into eternity to make up for the oppressions whilk they suffered here below in time she freely allowed that many devout ministers and professors in times past had enjoyed downright revelation like the blessed peden and lundie and cameron and renwick and john caird the tinkler wha entered into the secrets and elizabeth melvil lady culross wha prayed in her bed surrounded by a great many christians in a large room in whilk it was placed on purpose and that for three hours time with wonderful assistance and lady robertland whilk got six sure outgates of grace and mony other in times past and of a specially mr john scrimgeour minister of kinghorn who having a beloved child sick to death of the crewels was free to expostulate with his maker with such impatience of displeasure and complaining so bitterly that at length it was said unto him that he was heard for this time but that he was requested to use no such boldness in time coming so that when he returned he found the child sitting up in the bed hale and fair with all its wounds closed and supping its parritch whilk babe he had left at the time of death but though these things might be true in these needful times she contended that those ministers who had not seen such vouchsafed and especial mercies were to seek their rule in the records of ancient times and therefore reuben was carefu both to search the scriptures and the books written by wise and good men of old and sometimes in this way it wad happen that twa precious saints might pu sundry wise like twa cows riving at the same hayband  to this david used to reply with a sigh ah hinny thou kennst little ot but that saam john scrimgeour that blew open the gates of heaven as an it had been wi a saxpund cannonball used devoutly to wish that most part of books were burnt except the bible reubens a gude lad and a kindi have aye allowed that but as to his not allowing inquiry anent the scandal of marjory kittlesides and rory macrand under pretence that they have southered sin wi marriage its clear agane the christian discipline o the kirk and then theres aily macclure of deepheugh that practises her abominations spacing folks fortunes wi eggshells and muttonbanes and dreams and divinations whilk is a scandal to ony christian land to suffer sic a wretch to live and ill uphaud that in a judicatures civil or ecclesiastical  i daresay ye are very right father was the general style of jeanies answer but ye maun come down to the manse to your dinner the day the bits o bairns puir things are wearying to see their luckie dad and reuben never sleeps weel nor i neither when you and he hae had ony bit outcast  nae outcast jeanie god forbid i suld cast out wi thee or aught that is dear to thee and he put on his sundays coat and came to the manse accordingly  with her husband mrs butler had a more direct conciliatory process reuben had the utmost respect for the old mans motives and affection for his person as well as gratitude for his early friendship so that upon any such occasion of accidental irritation it was only necessary to remind him with delicacy of his fatherinlaws age of his scanty education strong prejudices and family distresses the least of these considerations always inclined butler to measures of conciliation in so far as he could accede to them without compromising principle and thus our simple and unpretending heroine had the merit of those peacemakers to whom it is pronounced as a benediction that they shall inherit the earth  the second crook in mrs butlers lot to use the language of her father was the distressing circumstance that she had never heard of her sisters safety or of the circumstances in which she found herself though betwixt four and five years had elapsed since they had parted on the beach of the island of roseneath frequent intercourse was not to be expectednot to be desired perhaps in their relative situations but effie had promised that if she lived and prospered her sister should hear from her she must then be no more or sunk into some abyss of misery since she had never redeemed her pledge her silence seemed strange and portentous and wrung from jeanie who could never forget the early years of their intimacy the most painful anticipation concerning her fate at length however the veil was drawn aside  one day as the captain of knockdunder had called in at the manse on his return from some business in the highland part of the parish and had been accommodated according to his special request with a mixture of milk brandy honey and water which he said mrs butler compounded potter than ever a woman in scotlandfor in all innocent matters she studied the taste of every one around herhe said to butler py the py minister i have a letter here either for your canny pody of a wife or you which i got when i was last at glasco the postage comes to fourpence which you may either pay me forthwith or give me tooble or quits in a hit at packcammon  the playing at backgammon and draughts had been a frequent amusement of mr whackbairn butlers principal when at liberton school the minister therefore still piqued himself on his skill at both games and occasionally practised them as strictly canonical although david deans whose notions of every kind were more rigorous used to shake his head and groan grievously when he espied the tables lying in the parlour or the children playing with the dice boxes or backgammon men indeed mrs butler was sometimes chidden for removing these implements of pastime into some closet or corner out of sight let them be where they are jeanie would butler say upon such occasions i am not conscious of following this or any other trifling relaxation to the interruption of my more serious studies and still more serious duties i will not therefore have it supposed that i am indulging by stealth and against my conscience in an amusement which using it so little as i do i may well practise openly and without any check of mindnil conscire sibi jeanie that is my motto which signifies my love the honest and open confidence which a man ought to entertain when he is acting openly and without any sense of doing wrong  such being butlers humour he accepted the captains defiance to a twopenny hit at backgammon and handed the letter to his wife observing the postmark was york but if it came from her friend mrs bickerton she had considerably improved her handwriting which was uncommon at her years  leaving the gentlemen to their game mrs butler went to order something for supper for captain duncan had proposed kindly to stay the night with them and then carelessly broke open her letter it was not from mrs bickerton and after glancing over the first few lines she soon found it necessary to retire to her own bedroom to read the document at leisure      chapter twentyfourth                      happy thou art then happy be                           nor envy me my lot                     thy happy state i envy thee                           and peaceful cot                                   lady charlotte campbell  the letter which mrs butler when retired into her own apartment perused with anxious wonder was certainly from effie although it had no other signature than the letter e and although the orthography style and penmanship were very far superior not only to anything which effie could produce who though a lively girl had been a remarkably careless scholar but even to her more considerate sisters own powers of composition and expression the manuscript was a fair italian hand though something stiff and constrainedthe spelling and the diction that of a person who had been accustomed to read good composition and mix in good society  the tenor of the letter was as follows  my dearest sisterat many risks i venture to write to you to inform you that i am still alive and as to worldly situation that i rank higher than i could expect or merit if wealth and distinction and an honourable rank could make a woman happy i have them all but you jeanie whom the world might think placed far beneath me in all these respects are far happier than i am i have had means of hearing of your welfare my dearest jeanie from time to timei think i should have broken my heart otherwise i have learned with great pleasure of your increasing family we have not been worthy of such a blessing two infants have been successively removed and we are now childlessgods will be done but if we had a child it would perhaps divert him from the gloomy thoughts which make him terrible to himself and others yet do not let me frighten you jeanie he continues to be kind and i am far better off than i deserve you will wonder at my better scholarship but when i was abroad i had the best teachers and i worked hard because my progress pleased him he is kind jeanie only he has much to distress him especially when he looks backward when i look backward myself i have always a ray of comfort it is in the generous conduct of a sister who forsook me not when i was forsaken by every one you have had your reward you live happy in the esteem and love of all who know you and i drag on the life of a miserable impostor indebted for the marks of regard i receive to a tissue of deceit and lies which the slightest accident may unravel he has produced me to his friends since the estate opened to him as a daughter of a scotchman of rank banished on account of the viscount of dundees warsthat is our frs old friend clavers you knowand he says i was educated in a scotch convent indeed i lived in such a place long enough to enable me to support the character but when a countryman approaches me and begins to talk as they all do of the various families engaged in dundees affair and to make inquiries into my connections and when i see his eye bent on mine with such an expression of agony my terror brings me to the very risk of detection goodnature and politeness have hitherto saved me as they prevented people from pressing on me with distressing questions but how longo how long will this be the caseand if i bring this disgrace on him he will hate mehe will kill me for as much as he loves me he is as jealous of his family honour now as ever he was careless about it i have been in england four months and have often thought of writing to you and yet such are the dangers that might arise from an intercepted letter that i have hitherto forborne but now i am obliged to run the risk last week i saw your great friend the d of a he came to my box and sate by me and something in the play put him in mind of yougracious heaven he told over your whole london journey to all who were in the box but particularly to the wretched creature who was the occasion of it all if he had knownif he could have conceived beside whom he was sitting and to whom the story was toldi suffered with courage like an indian at the stake while they are rending his fibres and boring his eyes and while he smiles applause at each wellimagined contrivance of his torturers it was too much for me at last jeaniei fainted and my agony was imputed partly to the heat of the place and partly to my extreme sensibility and hypocrite all over i encouraged both opinionsanything but discovery luckily he was not there but the incident has more alarms i am obliged to meet your great man often and he seldom sees me without talking of e d and j d and r b and d d as persons in whom my amiable sensibility is interested my amiable sensibilityand then the cruel tone of light indifference with which persons in the fashionable world speak together on the most affecting subjects to hear my guilt my folly my agony the foibles and weaknesses of my friendseven your heroic exertions jeanie spoken of in the drolling style which is the present tone in fashionable lifescarce all that i formerly endured is equal to this

and may be twice as much when you want it with you it may do goodwith me it never can  write to me soon jeanie or i shall remain in the agonising apprehension that this has fallen into wrong handsaddress simply to l s under cover to the reverend george whiterose in the minsterclose york he thinks i correspond with some of my noble jacobite relations who are in scotland how highchurch and jacobitical zeal would burn in his checks if he knew he was the agent not of euphemia setoun of the honourable house of winton but of e d daughter of a cameronian cowfeederjeanie i can laugh yet sometimesbut god protect you from such mirthmy fatheri mean your father would say it was like the idle crackling of thorns but the thorns keep their poignancy they remain unconsumed farewell my dearest jeaniedo not show this even to mr butler much less to any one else i have every respect for him but his principles are over strict and my case will not endure severe handlingi rest your affectionate sister e  in this long letter there was much to surprise as well as to distress mrs butler that effieher sister effie should be mingling freely in society and apparently on not unequal terms with the duke of argyle sounded like something so extraordinary that she even doubted if she read truly not was it less marvellous that in the space of four years her education should have made such progress jeanies humility readily allowed that effie had always when she chose it been smarter at her book than she herself was but then she was very idle and upon the whole had made much less proficiency love or fear or necessity however had proved an able schoolmistress and completely supplied all her deficiencies  what jeanie least liked in the tone of the letter was a smothered degree of egotism we should have heard little about her said jeanie to herself but that she was feared the duke might come to learn wha she was and a about her puir friends here but effie puir thing aye looks her ain way and folk that do that think mair o themselves than of their neighboursi am no clear about keeping her siller she added taking up a l50 note which had fallen out of the paper to the floor we hae eneugh and it looks unco like theftboot or hushmoney as they ca it she might hae been sure that i wad say naething wad harm her for a the gowd in lunnon and i maun tell the minister about it i dinna see that she suld be sae feared for her ain bonny bargain o a gudeman and that i shouldna reverence mr butler just as much and sae ill een tell him when that tippling body the captain has taen boat in the morningbut i wonder at my ain state of mind she added turning back after she had made a step or two to the door to join the gentlemen surely i am no sic a fule as to be angry that effies a braw lady while i am only a ministers wifeand yet i am as petted as a bairn when i should bless god that has redeemed her from shame and poverty and guilt as ower likely she might hae been plunged into  sitting down upon a stool at the foot of the bed she folded her arms upon her bosom saying within herself from this place will i not rise till i am in a better frame of mind and so placed by dint of tearing the veil from the motives of her little temporary spleen against her sister she compelled herself to be ashamed of them and to view as blessings the advantages of her sisters lot while its embarrassments were the necessary consequences of errors long since committed and thus she fairly vanquished the feeling of pique which she naturally enough entertained at seeing effie so long the object of her care and her pity soar suddenly so high above her in life as to reckon amongst the chief objects of her apprehension the risk of their relationship being discovered  when this unwonted burst of amour propre was thoroughly subdued she walked down to the little parlour where the gentlemen were finishing their game and heard from the captain a confirmation of the news intimated in her letter that the duke of argyle was shortly expected at roseneath  hell find plenty of moorfowls and plackcock on the moors of auchingower and hell pe nae doubt for taking a late dinner and a ped at the manse as he has done pefore now  he has a gude right captain said jeanie  teil ane potter to ony ped in the kintra answered the captain and ye had potter tell your father puir body to get his beasts a in order and put his tamnd cameronian nonsense out o his head for twa or three days if he can pe so opliging for fan i speak to him apout prute pestil he answers me out o the pible whilk is not using a shentleman weel unless it be a person of your cloth mr putler  no one understood better than jeanie the merit of the soft answer which turneth away wrath and she only smiled and hoped that his grace would find everything that was under her fathers care to his entire satisfaction  but the captain who had lost the whole postage of the letter at backgammon was in the pouting mood not unusual to losers and which says the proverb must be allowed to them  and master putler though you know i never meddle with the things of your kirksessions yet i must pe allowed to say that i will not be pleased to allow ailie macclure of deepheugh to be poonished as a witch in respect she only spaes fortunes and does not lame or plind or pedevil any persons or coup cadgers carts or ony sort of mischief put only tells people good fortunes as anent our poats killing so many seals and dougfishes whilk is very pleasant to hear  the woman said butler is i believe no witch but a cheat and it is only on that head that she is summoned to the kirksession to cause her to desist in future from practising her impostures upon ignorant persons  i do not know replied the gracious duncan what her practices or postures are but i pelieve that if the poys take hould on her to duck her in the clachan purn it will be a very sorry practiceand i pelieve moreover that if i come in thirdsman among you at the kirksessions you will be all in a tamnd pad posture indeed  without noticing this threat mr butler replied that he had not attended to the risk of illusage which the poor woman might undergo at the hands of the rabble and that he would give her the necessary admonition in private instead of bringing her before the assembled session  this duncan said was speaking like a reasonable shentleman and so the evening passed peaceably off  next morning after the captain had swallowed his morning draught of athole brose and departed in his coach and six mrs butler anew deliberated upon communicating to her husband her sisters letter but she was deterred by the recollection that in doing so she would unveil to him the whole of a dreadful secret of which perhaps his public character might render him an unfit depositary butler already had reason to believe that effie had eloped with that same robertson who had been a leader in the porteous mob and who lay under sentence of death for the robbery at kirkcaldy but he did not know his identity with george staunton a man of birth and fortune who had now apparently reassumed his natural rank in society jeanie had respected stauntons own confession as sacred and upon reflection she considered the letter of her sisteras equally so and resolved to mention the contents to no one  on reperusing the letter she could not help observing the staggering and unsatisfactory condition of those who have risen to distinction by undue paths and the outworks and bulwarks of fiction and falsehood by which they are under the necessity of surrounding and defending their precarious advantages but she was not called upon she thought to unveil her sisters original historyit would restore no right to any one for she was usurping noneit would only destroy her happiness and degrade her in the public estimation had she been wise jeanie thought she would have chosen seclusion and privacy in place of public life and gaiety but the power of choice might not be hers the money she thought could not be returned without her seeming haughty and unkind she resolved therefore upon reconsidering this point to employ it as occasion should serve either in educating her children better than her own means could compass or for their future portion her sister had enough was strongly bound to assist jeanie by any means in her power and the arrangement was so natural and proper that it ought not to be declined out of fastidious or romantic delicacy jeanie accordingly wrote to her sister acknowledging her letter and requesting to hear from her as often as she could in entering into her own little details of news chiefly respecting domestic affairs she experienced a singular vacillation of ideas for sometimes she apologised for mentioning things unworthy the notice of a lady of rank and then recollected that everything which concerned her should be interesting to effie her letter under the cover of mr whiterose she committed to the postoffice at glasgow by the intervention of a parishioner who had business at that city  the next week brought the duke to roseneath and shortly afterwards he intimated his intention of sporting in their neighbourhood and taking his bed at the manse an honour which he had once or twice done to its inmates on former occasions  effie proved to be perfectly right in her auticipations the duke had hardly set himself down at mrs butlers right hand and taken upon himself the task of carving the excellent barndoor chucky which had been selected as the high dishes upon this honourable occasion before he began to speak of lady staunton of willingham in lincolnshire and the great noise which her wit and beauty made in london for much of this jeanie was in some measure preparedbut effies wit that would never have entered into her imagination being ignorant how exactly raillery in the higher rank resembles flippancy among their inferiors  she has been the ruling bellethe blazing starthe universal toast of the winter said the duke and is really the most beautiful creature that was seen at court upon the birthday  the birthday and at courtjeanie was annihilated remembering well her own presentation all its extraordinary circumstances and particularly the cause of it  i mention this lady particularly to you mrs butler said the duke because she has something in the sound of her voice and cast of her countenance that reminded me of younot when you look so pale thoughyou have overfatigued yourselfyou must pledge me in a glass of wine  she did so and butler observed it was dangerous flattery in his grace to tell a poor ministers wife that she was like a courtbeauty  oho mr butler said the duke i find you are growing jealous but its rather too late in the day for you know how long i have admired your wife but seriously there is betwixt them one of those inexplicable likenesses which we see in countenances that do not otherwise resemble each other  the perilous part of the compliment has flown off thought mr butler  his wife feeling the awkwardness of silence forced herself to say that perhaps the lady might be her countrywoman and the language might have made some resemblance  you are quite right replied the duke she is a scotchwoman and speaks with a scotch accent and now and then a provincial word drops out so prettily that it is quite doric mr butler  i should have thought said the clergyman that would have sounded vulgar in the great city  not at all replied the duke you must suppose it is not the broad coarse scotch that is spoken in the cowgate of edinburgh or in the gorbals this lady has been very little in scotland in fact she was educated in a convent abroad and speaks that pure courtscotch which was common in my younger days but it is so generally disused now that it sounds like a different dialect entirely distinct from our modern patois  notwithstanding her anxiety jeanie could not help admiring within herself how the most correct judges of life and manners can be imposed on by their own preconceptions while the duke proceeded thus she is of the unfortunate house of winton i believe but being bred abroad she had missed the opportunity of learning her own pedigree and was obliged to me for informing her that she must certainly come of the setons of windygoul i wish you could have seen how prettily she blushed at her own ignorance amidst her noble and elegant manners there is now and then a little touch of bashfulness and conventual rusticity if i may call it so that makes her quite enchanting you see at once the rose that had bloomed untouched amid the chaste precincts of the cloister mr butler  true to the hint mr butler failed not to start with his             ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis etc  while his wife could hardly persuade herself that all this was spoken of effie deans and by so competent a judge as the duke of argyle and had she been acquainted with catullus would have thought the fortunes of her sister had reversed the whole passage  she was however determined to obtain some indemnification for the anxious feelings of the moment by gaining all the intelligence she could and therefore ventured to make some inquiry about the husband of the lady his grace admired so much  he is very rich replied the duke of an ancient family and has good manners but he is far from being such a general favourite as his wife some people say he can be very pleasanti never saw him so but should rather judge him reserved and gloomy and capricious he was very wild in his youth they say and has bad health yet he is a goodlooking man enougha great friend of your lord high commissioner of the kirk mr butler  then he is the friend of a very worthy and honourable nobleman said butler  does he admire his lady as much as other people do said jeanie in a low voice  whosir george they say he is very fond of her said the duke but i observe she trembles a little when he fixes his eye on her and that is no good signbut it is strange how i am haunted by this resemblance of yours to lady staunton in look and tone of voice one would almost swear you were sisters  jeanies distress became uncontrollable and beyond concealment the duke of argyle was much disturbed goodnaturedly ascribing it to his having unwittingly recalled to her remembrance her family misfortunes he was too wellbred to attempt to apologise but hastened to change the subject and arrange certain points of dispute which had occurred betwixt duncan of knock and the minister acknowledging that his worthy substitute was sometimes a little too obstinate as well as too energetic in his executive measures  mr butler admitted his general merits but said he would presume to apply to the worthy gentleman the words of the poet to marrucinus asinius                   manu                  non belle uteris in joco atque vino  the discourse being thus turned on parish business nothing farther occurred that can interest the reader      chapter twentyfifth                upon my head they placed a fruitless crown                  and put a barren sceptre in my gripe               thence to be wrenchd by an unlineal hand                  no son of mine succeeding                                         macbeth  after this period but under the most strict precautions against discovery the sisters corresponded occasionally exchanging letters about twice every year those of lady staunton spoke of her husbands health and spirits as being deplorably uncertain her own seemed also to be sinking and one of the topics on which she most frequently dwelt was their want of family sir george staunton always violent had taken some aversion at the next heir whom he suspected of having irritated his friends against him during his absence and he declared he would bequeath willingham and all its lands to an hospital ere that fetchandcarry telltale should inherit an acre of it  had he but a child said the unfortunate wife or had that luckless infant survived it would be some motive for living and for exertion but heaven has denied us a blessing which we have not deserved  such complaints in varied form but turning frequently on the same topic filled the letters which passed from the spacious but melancholy halls of willingham to the quiet and happy parsonage at knocktarlitie years meanwhile rolled on amid these fruitless repinings john duke of argyle and greenwich died in the year 1743 universally lamented but by none more than by the butlers to whom his benevolence had been so distinguished he was succeeded by his brother duke archibald with whom they had not the same intimacy but who continued the protection which his brother had extended towards them this indeed became more necessary than ever for after the breaking out and suppression of the rebellion in 1745 the peace of the country adjacent to the highlands was considerably disturbed marauders or men that had been driven to that desperate mode of life quartered themselves in the fastnesses nearest to the lowlands which were their scene of plunder and there is scarce a glen in the romantic and now peaceable highlands of perth stirling and dumbartonshire where one or more did not take up their residence  the prime pest of the parish of knocktarlitie was a certain donacha dhu na dunaigh or black duncan the mischievous whom we have already casually mentioned this fellow had been originally a tinkler or caird many of whom stroll about these districts but when all police was disorganised by the civil war he threw up his profession and from half thief became whole robber and being generally at the head of three or four active young fellows and he himself artful bold and well acquainted with the passes he plied his new profession with emolument to himself and infinite plague to the country  all were convinced that duncan of knock could have put down his namesake donacha any morning he had a mind for there were in the parish a set of stout young men who had joined argyles banner in the war under his old friend and behaved very well on several occasions and as for their leader as no one doubted his courage it was generally supposed that donacha had found out the mode of conciliating his favour a thing not very uncommon in that age and country this was the more readily believed as david deanss cattle being the property of the duke were left untouched when the ministers cows were carried off by the thieves another attempt was made to renew the same act of rapine and the cattle were in the act of being driven off when butler laying his profession aside in a case of such necessity put himself at the head of some of his neighbours and rescued the creagh an exploit at which deans attended in person notwithstanding his extreme old age mounted on a highland pony and girded with an old broadsword likening himself for he failed not to arrogate the whole merit of the expedition to david the son of jesse when he recovered the spoil of ziklag from the amalekites this spirited behaviour had so far a good effect that donacha dhu na dunaigh kept his distance for some time to come and though his distant exploits were frequently spoken of he did not exercise any depredations in that part of the country he continued to flourish and to be heard of occasionally until the year 1751 when if the fear of the second david had kept him in check fate released him from that restraint for the venerable patriarch of st leonards was that year gathered to his fathers  david deans died full of years and of honour he is believed for the exact time of his birth is not known to have lived upwards of ninety years for he used to speak of events as falling under his own knowledge which happened about the time of the battle of bothwell bridge it was said that he even bore arms there for once when a drunken jacobite laird wished for a bothwell brigg whig that he might stow the lugs out of his head david informed him with a peculiar austerity of countenance that if he liked to try such a prank there was one at his elbow and it required the interference of butler to preserve the peace  he expired in the arms of his beloved daughter thankful for all the blessings which providence had vouchsafed to him while in this valley of strife and toiland thankful also for the trials he had been visited with having found them he said needful to mortify that spiritual pride and confidence in his own gifts which was the side on which the wily enemy did most sorely beset him he prayed in the most affecting manner for jeanie her husband and her family and that her affectionate duty to the puir auld man might purchase her length of days here and happiness hereafter then in a pathetic petition too well understood by those who knew his family circumstances he besought the shepherd of souls while gathering his flock not to forget the little one that had strayed from the fold and even then might be in the hands of the ravening wolfhe prayed for the national jerusalem that peace might be in her land and prosperity in her palacesfor the welfare of the honourable house of argyle and for the conversion of duncan of knockdunder after this he was silent being exhausted nor did he again utter anything distinctly he was heard indeed to mutter something about national defections righthand extremes and lefthand failings off but as may hettly observed his head was carried at the time and it is probable that these expressions occurred to him merely out of general habit and that he died in the full spirit of charity with all men about an hour afterwards he slept in the lord  notwithstanding her fathers advanced age his death was a severe shock to mrs butler much of her time had been dedicated to attending to his health and his wishes and she felt as if part of her business in the world was ended when the good old man was no more his wealth which came nearly to fifteen hundred pounds in disposable capital served to raise the fortunes of the family at the manse how to dispose of this sum for the best advantage of his family was matter of anxious consideration to butler if we put it on heritable bond we shall maybe lose the interest for theres that bond over lounsbecks land your father could neither get principal nor interest for itif we bring it into the funds we shall maybe lose the principal and all as many did in the south sea scheme the little estate of craigsture is in the marketit lies within two miles of the manse and knock says his grace has no thought to buy it but they ask l2500 and they may for it is worth the money and were i to borrow the balance the creditor might call it up suddenly or in case of my death my family might be distressed  and so if we had mair siller we might buy that bonny pastureground where the grass comes so early asked jeanie  certainly my dear and knockdunder who is a good judge is strongly advising me to it to be sure it is his nephew that is selling it  aweel reuben said jeanie ye maun just look up a text in scripture as ye did when ye wanted siller beforejust look up a text in the bible  ah jeanie said butler laughing and pressing her hand at the same time the best people in these times can only work miracles once  we will see said jeanie composedly and going to the closet in which she kept her honey her sugar her pots of jelly her vials of the more ordinary medicines and which served her in short as a sort of storeroom she jangled vials and gallipots till from out the darkest nook well flanked by a triple row of bottles and jars which she was under the necessity of displacing she brought a cracked brown cann with a piece of leather tied over the top its contents seemed to be written papers thrust in disorder into this uncommon secretaire but from among these jeanie brought an old clasped bible which had been david deanss companion in his earlier wanderings and which he had given to his daughter when the failure of his eyes had compelled him to use one of a larger print this she gave to butler who had been looking at her motions with some surprise and desired him to see what that book could do for him he opened the clasps and to his astonishment a parcel of l50 banknotes dropped out from betwixt the leaves where they had been separately lodged and fluttered upon the floor i didna think to hae tauld you o my wealth reuben said his wife smiling at his surprise till on my deathbed or maybe on some family pinch but it wad be better laid out on yon bonny grassholms than lying useless here in this auld pigg  how on earth came ye by that siller jeaniewhy here is more than a thousand pounds said butler lifting up and counting the notes  if it were ten thousand its a honestly come by said jeanie and troth i kenna how muckle there is ot but its a there that ever i gotand as for how i came by it reubenits weel come by and honestly as i said beforeand its mair folks secret than mine or ye wad hae kend about it lang syne and as for onything else i am not free to answer mair questions about it and ye maun just ask me nane  answer me but one said butler is it all freely and indisputably your own property to dispose of it as you think fitis it possible no one has a claim in so large a sum except you  it was mine free to dispose of it as i like answered jeanie and i have disposed of it already for now it is yours reubenyou are bible butler now as well as your forbear that my puir father had sic an ill will at only if ye like i wad wish femie to get a gude share ot when we are gane  certainly it shall be as you choosebut who on earth ever pitched on such a hidingplace for temporal treasures  that is just ane o my auldfashioned gates as you ca them reuben i thought if donacha dhu was to make an outbreak upon us the bible was the last thing in the house he wad meddle wibut an ony mair siller should drap in as it is not unlikely i shall een pay it ower to you and ye may lay it out your ain way  and i positively must not ask you how you have come by all this money said the clergyman  indeed reuben you must not for if you were asking me very sair i wad maybe tell you and then i am sure i would do wrong  but tell me said butler is it anything that distresses your own mind  there is baith weal and woe come aye wi worlds gear reuben but ye maun ask me naething mairthis siller binds me to naething and can never be speered back again  surely said mr butler when he had again counted over the money as if to assure himself that the notes were real there was never man in the world had a wife like minea blessing seems to follow her  never said jeanie since the enchanted princess in the bairns fairy tale that kamed gold nobles out o the tae side of her haffit locks and dutch dollars out o the tother but gang away now minister and put by the siller and dinna keep the notes wampishing in your hand that gate or i shall wish them in the brown pigg again for fear we get a black cast about themwere ower near the hills in these times to be thought to hae siller in the house and besides ye maun gree wi knockdunder that has the selling o the lands and dinna you be simple and let him ken o this windfa but keep him to the very lowest penny as if ye had to borrow siller to make the price up  in the last admonition jeanie showed distinctly that although she did not understand how to secure the money which came into her hands otherwise than by saving and hoarding it yet she had some part of her father davids shrewdness even upon worldly subjects and reuben butler was a prudent man and went and did even as his wife had advised him the news quickly went abroad into the parish that the minister had bought craigsture and some wished him joy and some were sorry it had gane out of the auld name however his clerical brethren understanding that he was under the necessity of going to edinburgh about the ensuing whitsunday to get together david deanss cash to make up the purchasemoney of his new acquisition took the opportunity to name him their delegate to the general assembly or convocation of the scottish church which takes place usually in the latter end of the month of may      chapter twentysixth                but who is this what thing of sea or land                         female of sex it seems               that so bedeckd ornate and gay                         comes this way sailing                                           milton  not long after the incident of the bible and the banknotes fortune showed that she could surprise mrs butler as well as her husband the minister in order to accomplish the various pieces of business which his unwonted visit to edinburgh rendered necessary had been under the necessity of setting out from home in the latter end of the month of february concluding justly that he would find the space betwixt his departure and the term of whitsunday 24th may short enough for the purpose of bringing forward those various debtors of old david deans out of whose purses a considerable part of the price of his new purchase was to be made good  jeanie was thus in the unwonted situation of inhabiting a lonely house and she felt yet more solitary from the death of the good old man who used to divide her cares with her husband her children were her principal resource and to them she paid constant attention  it happened a day or two after butlers departure that while she was engaged in some domestic duties she heard a dispute among the young folk which being maintained with obstinacy appeared to call for her interference all came to their natural umpire with their complaints femie not yet ten years old charged davie and reubie with an attempt to take away her book by force and david and reuben replied the elder that it was not a book for femie to read and reuben that it was about a bad woman  where did you get the book ye little hempie said mrs butler how dare ye touch papas books when he is away but the little lady holding fast a sheet of crumpled paper declared it was nane o papas books and may hettly had taken it off the muckle cheese which came from inverara for as was very natural to suppose a friendly intercourse with interchange of mutual civilities was kept up from time to time between mrs dolly dutton now mrs maccorkindale and her former friends  jeanie took the subject of contention out of the childs hand to satisfy herself of the propriety of her studies but how much was she struck when she read upon the title of the broadsidesheet the last speech confession and dying words of margaret maccraw or murdockson executed on harabee hill near carlisle the  day of  1737 it was indeed one of those papers which archibald had bought at longtown when he monopolised the pedlars stock which dolly had thrust into her trunk out of sheer economy one or two copies it seems had remained in her repositories at inverary till she chanced to need them in packing a cheese which as a very superior production was sent in the way of civil challenge to the dairy at knocktarlitie  the title of this paper so strangely fallen into the very hands from which in wellmeant respect to her feelings it had been so long detained was of itself sufficiently startling but the narrative itself was so interesting that jeanie shaking herself loose from the children ran upstairs to her own apartment and bolted the door to peruse it without interruption  the narrative which appeared to have been drawn up or at least corrected by the clergyman who attended this unhappy woman stated the crime for which she suffered to have been her active part in that atrocious robbery and murder committed near two years since near haltwhistle for which the notorious frank levitt was committed for trial at lancaster assizes it was supposed the evidence of the accomplice thomas tuck commonly called tyburn tom upon which the woman had been convicted would weigh equally heavy against him although many were inclined to think it was tuck himself who had struck the fatal blow according to the dying statement of meg murdockson  after a circumstantial account of the crime for which she suffered there was a brief sketch of margarets life it was stated that she was a scotchwoman by birth and married a soldier in the cameronian regimentthat she long followed the camp and had doubtless acquired in fields of battle and similar scenes that ferocity and love of plunder for which she had been afterwards distinguishedthat her husband having obtained his discharge became servant to a beneficed clergyman of high situation and character in lincolnshire and that she acquired the confidence and esteem of that honourable family she had lost this many years after her husbands death it was stated in consequence of conniving at the irregularities of her daughter with the heir of the family added to the suspicious circumstances attending the birth of a child which was strongly suspected to have met with foul play in order to preserve if possible the girls reputation after this she had led a wandering life both in england and scotland under colour sometimes of telling fortunes sometimes of driving a trade in smuggled wares but in fact receiving stolen goods and occasionally actively joining in the exploits by which they were obtained many of her crimes she had boasted of after conviction and there was one circumstance for which she seemed to feel a mixture of joy and occasional compunction when she was residing in the suburbs of edinburgh during the preceding summer a girl who had been seduced by one of her confederates was intrusted to her charge and in her house delivered of a male infant her daughter whose mind was in a state of derangement ever since she had lost her own child according to the criminals account carried off the poor girls infant taking it for her own of the reality of whose death she at times could not be persuaded  margaret murdockson stated that she for some time believed her daughter had actually destroyed the infant in her mad fits and that she gave the father to understand so but afterwards learned that a female stroller had got it from her she showed some compunction at having separated mother and child especially as the mother had nearly suffered death being condemned on the scotch law for the supposed murder of her infant when it was asked what possible interest she could have had in exposing the unfortunate girl to suffer for a crime she had not committed she asked if they thought she was going to put her own daughter into trouble to save another she did not know what the scotch law would have done to her for carrying the child away this answer was by no means satisfactory to the clergyman and he discovered by close examination that she had a deep and revengeful hatred against the young person whom she had thus injured but the paper intimated that whatever besides she had communicated upon this subject was confided by her in private to the worthy and reverend archdeacon who had bestowed such particular pains in affording her spiritual assistance the broadside went on to intimate that after her execution of which the particulars were given her daughter the insane person mentioned more than once and who was generally known by the name of madge wildfire had been very illused by the populace under the belief that she was a sorceress and an accomplice in her mothers crimes and had been with difficulty rescued by the prompt interference of the police  such for we omit moral reflections and all that may seem unnecessary to the explanation of our story was the tenor of the broadside to mrs butler it contained intelligence of the highest importance since it seemed to afford the most unequivocal proof of her sisters innocence respecting the crime for which she had so nearly suffered it is true neither she nor her husband nor even her father had ever believed her capable of touching her infant with an unkind hand when in possession of her reason but there was a darkness on the subject and what might have happened in a moment of insanity was dreadful to think upon besides whatever was their own conviction they had no means of establishing effies innocence to the world which according to the tenor of this fugitive publication was now at length completely manifested by the dying confession of the person chiefly interested in concealing it  after thanking god for a discovery so dear to her feelings mrs butler began to consider what use she should make of it to have shown it to her husband would have been her first impulse but besides that he was absent from home and the matter too delicate to be the subject of correspondence by an indifferent penwoman mrs butler recollected that he was not possessed of the information necessary to form a judgment upon the occasion and that adhering to the rule which she had considered as most advisable she had best transmit the information immediately to her sister and leave her to adjust with her husband the mode in which they should avail themselves of it accordingly she despatched a special messenger to glasgow with a packet enclosing the confession of margaret murdockson addressed as usual under cover to mr whiterose of york she expected with anxiety an answer but none arrived in the usual course of post and she was left to imagine how many various causes might account for lady stauntons silence she began to be half sorry that she had parted with the printed paper both for fear of its having fallen into bad hands and from the desire of regaining the document which might be essential to establish her sisters innocence she was even doubting whether she had not better commit the whole matter to her husbands consideration when other incidents occurred to divert her purpose  jeanie she is a favourite and we beg her pardon for still using the familiar title had walked down to the seaside with her children one morning after breakfast when the boys whose sight was more discriminating than hers exclaimed that the captains coach and six was coming right for the shore with ladies in it jeanie instinctively bent her eyes on the approaching boat and became soon sensible that there were two females in the stern seated beside the gracious duncan who acted as pilot it was a point of politeness to walk towards the landingplace in order to receive them especially as she saw that the captain of knockdunder was upon honour and ceremony his piper was in the bow of the boat sending forth music of which one half sounded the better that the other was drowned by the waves and the breeze moreover he himself had his brigadier wig newly frizzed his bonnet he had abjured the cockedhat decorated with saint georges red cross his uniform mounted as a captain of militia the dukes flag with the boars head displayedall intimated parade and gala  as mrs butler approached the landingplace she observed the captain hand the ladies ashore with marks of great attention and the parties advanced towards her the captain a few steps before the two ladies of whom the taller and elder leaned on the shoulder of the other who seemed to be an attendant or servant  as they met duncan in his best most important and deepest tone of highland civility pegged leave to introduce to mrs putler ladyehehi hae forgotten your leddyships name  never mind my name sir said the lady i trust mrs butler will be at no loss the dukes letterand as she observed mrs butler look confused she said again to duncan somethin sharply did you not send the letter last night sir  in troth and i didna and i crave your leddyships pardon but you see matam i thought it would do as weel totay pecause mrs putler is never taen out osortsneverand the coach was out fishingand the gig was gane to greenock for a cag of prandyandput heres his graces letter  give it me sir said the lady taking it out of his hand since you have not found it convenient to do me the favour to send it before me i will deliver it myself  mrs butler looked with great attention and a certain dubious feeling of deep interest on the lady who thus expressed herself with authority over the man of authority and to whose mandates he seemed to submit resigning the letter with a just as your leddyship is pleased to order it  the lady was rather above the middle size beautifully made though something embonpoint with a hand and arm exquisitely formed her manner was easy dignified and commanding and seemed to evince high birth and the habits of elevated society she wore a travelling dressa grey beaver hat and a veil of flanders lace two footmen in rich liveries who got out of the barge and lifted out a trunk and portmanteau appeared to belong to her suite  as you did not receive the letter madam which should have served for my introductionfor i presume you are mrs butleri will not present it to you till you are so good as to admit me into your house without it  to pe sure matam said knockdunder ye canna doubt mrs putler will do thatmrs putler this is ladyladythese tamned southern names rin out o my head like a stane trowling down hillput i believe she is a scottish woman pornthe mair our creditand i presume her leddyship is of the house of  the duke of argyle knows my family very well sir said the lady in a tone which seemed designed to silence duncan or at any rate which had that effect completely  there was something about the whole of this strangers address and tone and manner which acted upon jeanies feelings like the illusions of a dream that tease us with a puzzling approach to reality something there was of her sister in the gait and manner of the stranger as well as in the sound of her voice and something also when lifting her veil she showed features to which changed as they were in expression and complexion she could not but attach many remembrances  the stranger was turned of thirty certainly but so well were her personal charms assisted by the power of dress and arrangement of ornament that she might well have passed for oneandtwenty and her behaviour was so steady and so composed that as often as mrs butler perceived anew some point of resemblance to her unfortunate sister so often the sustained selfcommand and absolute composure of the stranger destroyed the ideas which began to arise in her imagination she led the way silently towards the manse lost in a confusion of reflections and trusting the letter with which she was to be there intrusted would afford her satisfactory explanation of what was a most puzzling and embarrassing scene  the lady maintained in the meanwhile the manners of a stranger of rank she admired the various points of view like one who has studied nature and the best representations of art at length she took notice of the children  these are two fine young mountaineersyours madam i presume  jeanie replied in the affirmative the stranger sighed and sighed once more as they were presented to her by name  come here femie said mrs butler and hold your head up  what is your daughters name madam said the lady  euphemia madam answered mrs butler  i thought the ordinary scottish contraction of the name had been effie replied the stranger in a tone which went to jeanies heart for in that single word there was more of her sistermore of lang syne ideasthan in all the reminiscences which her own heart had anticipated or the features and manner of the stranger had suggested  when they reached the manse the lady gave mrs butler the letter which she had taken out of the hands of knockdunder and as she gave it she pressed her hand adding aloud perhaps madam you will have the goodness to get me a little milk  and me a drap of the greypeard if you please mrs putler added duncan  mrs butler withdrew but deputing to may hettly and to david the supply of the strangers wants she hastened into her own room to read the letter the envelope was addressed in the duke of argyles hand and requested mrs butlers attentions and civility to a lady of rank a particular friend of his late brother lady staunton of willingham who being recommended to drink goats whey by the physicians was to honour the lodge at roseneath with her residence while her husband made a short tour in scotland but within the same cover which had been given to lady staunton unsealed was a letter from that lady intended to prepare her sister for meeting her and which but for the captains negligence she ought to have received on the preceding evening it stated that the news in jeanies last letter had been so interesting to her husband that he was determined to inquire farther into the confession made at carlisle and the fate of that poor innocent and that as he had been in some degree successful she had by the most earnest entreaties extorted rather than obtained his permission under promise of observing the most strict incognito to spend a week or two with her sister or in her neighbourhood while he was prosecuting researches to which though it appeared to her very vainly he seemed to attach some hopes of success  there was a postscript desiring that jeanie would trust to lady s the management of their intercourse and be content with assenting to what she should propose after reading and again reading the letter mrs butler hurried down stairs divided betwixt the fear of betraying her secret and the desire to throw herself upon her sisters neck effie received her with a glance at once affectionate and cautionary and immediately proceeded to speak  i have been telling mr  captain  this gentleman mrs butler that if you could accommodate me with an apartment in your house and a place for ellis to sleep and for the two men it would suit me better than the lodge which his grace has so kindly placed at my disposal i am advised i should reside as near where the goats feed as possible  i have peen assuring my leddy mrs putler said duncan that though it could not discommode you to receive any of his graces visitors or mine yet she had mooch petter stay at the lodge and for the gaits the creatures can be fetched there in respect it is mair fitting they suld wait upon her leddyship than she upon the like o them  by no means derange the goats for me said lady staunton i am certain the milk must be much better here and this she said with languid negligence as one whose slightest intimation of humour is to bear down all argument  mrs butler hastened to intimate that her house such as it was was heartily at the disposal of lady staunton but the captain continued to remonstrate  the duke he said had written  i will settle all that with his grace  and there were the things had been sent down frae glasco  anything necessary might be sent over to the parsonageshe would beg the favour of mrs butler to show her an apartment and of the captain to have her trunks etc sent over from roseneath  so she courtesied off poor duncan who departed saying in his secret soul cot tamn her english impudenceshe takes possession of the ministers house as an it were her ainand speaks to shentlemens as if they were pounden servants and per tamned to herand theres the deer that was shot toobut we will send it ower to the manse whilk will pe put civil seeing i hae prought worthy mrs putler sic a fliskmahoy and with these kind intentions he went to the shore to give his orders accordingly  in the meantime the meeting of the sisters was as affectionate as it was extraordinary and each evinced her feelings in the way proper to her character jeanie was so much overcome by wonder and even by awe that her feelings were deep stunning and almost overpowering effie on the other hand wept laughed sobbed screamed and clapped her hands for joy all in the space of five minutes giving way at once and without reserve to a natural excessive vivacity of temper which no one however knew better how to restrain under the rules of artificial breeding  after an hour had passed like a moment in their expressions of mutual affection lady staunton observed the captain walking with impatient steps below the window that tiresome highland fool has returned upon our hands she said i will pray him to grace us with his absence  hout no hout no said mrs butler in a tone of entreaty ye maunna affront the captain  affront said lady staunton nobody is ever affronted at what i do or say my dear however i will endure him since you think it proper  the captain was accordingly graciously requested by lady staunton to remain during dinner during this visit his studious and punctilious complaisance towards the lady of rank was happily contrasted by the cavalier air of civil familiarity in which he indulged towards the ministers wife  i have not been able to persuade mrs butler said lady staunton to the captain during the interval when jeanie had left the parlour to let me talk of making any recompense for storming her house and garrisoning it in the way i have done  doubtless matam said the captain it wad ill pecome mrs putler wha is a very decent pody to make any such sharge to a lady who comes from my house or his graces which is the same thingand speaking of garrisons in the year fortyfive i was poot with a garrison of twenty of my lads in the house of invergarry whilk had near been unhappily for  i beg your pardon sirbut i wish i could think of some way of indemnifying this good lady  o no need of intemnifying at allno trouble for her nothing at all so peing in the house of invergarry and the people about it being uncanny i doubted the warst and  do you happen to know sir said lady staunton if any of these two lads these young butlers i mean show any turn for the army  could not say indeed my leddy replied knockdunderso i knowing the people to pe unchancy and not to lippen to and hearing a pibroch in the wood i pegan to pid my lads look to their flints and then  for said lady staunton with the most ruthless disregard to the narrative which she mangled by these interruptions if that should be the case it should cost sir george but the asking a pair of colours for one of them at the waroffice since we have always supported government and never had occasion to trouble ministers  and if you please my leddy said duncan who began to find some savour in this proposal as i hae a braw weelgrown lad of a nevoy cad duncan macgilligan that is as pig as paith the putler pairns putten thegither sir george could ask a pair for him at the same time and it wad pe put ae asking for a  lady staunton only answered this hint with a wellbred stare which gave no sort of encouragement  jeanie who now returned was lost in amazement at the wonderful difference betwixt the helpless and despairing girl whom she had seen stretched on a flockbed in a dungeon expecting a violent and disgraceful death and last as a forlorn exile upon the midnight beach with the elegant wellbred beautiful woman before her the features now that her sisters veil was laid aside did not appear so extremely different as the whole manner expression look and bearing in outside show lady staunton seemed completely a creature too soft and fair for sorrow to have touched so much accustomed to have all her whims complied with by those around her that she seemed to expect she should even be saved the trouble of forming them and so totally unacquainted with contradiction that she did not even use the tone of selfwill since to breathe a wish was to have it fulfilled she made no ceremony of ridding herself of duncan as soon as the evening approached but complimented him out of the house under pretext of fatigue with the utmost nonchalance  when they were alone her sister could not help expressing her wonder at the selfpossession with which lady staunton sustained her part  i daresay you are surprised at it said lady staunton composedly for you my dear jeanie have been truth itself from your cradle upwards but you must remember that i am a liar of fifteen years standing and therefore must by this time be used to my character  in fact during the feverish tumult of feelings excited during the two or three first days mrs butler thought her sisters manner was completely contradictory of the desponding tone which pervaded her correspondence she was moved to tears indeed by the sight of her fathers grave marked by a modest stone recording his piety and integrity but lighter impressions and associations had also power over her she amused herself with visiting the dairy in which she had so long been assistant and was so near discovering herself to may hettly by betraying her acquaintance with the celebrated receipt for dunlop cheese that she compared herself to bedreddin hassan whom the vizier his fatherinlaw discovered by his superlative skill in composing creamtarts with pepper in them but when the novelty of such avocations ceased to amuse her she showed to her sister but too plainly that the gaudy colouring with which she veiled her unhappiness afforded as little real comfort as the gay uniform of the soldier when it is drawn over his mortal wound there were moods and moments in which her despondence seemed to exceed even that which she herself had described in her letters and which too well convinced mrs butler how little her sisters lot which in appearance was so brilliant was in reality to be envied  there was one source however from which lady staunton derived a pure degree of pleasure gifted in every particular with a higher degree of imagination than that of her sister she was an admirer of the beauties of nature a taste which compensates many evils to those who happen to enjoy it here her character of a fine lady stopped short where she ought to have            screamd at ilk cleugh and screechd at ilka how                 as loud as she had seen the worriecow  on the contrary with the two boys for her guides she undertook long and fatiguing walks among the neighbouring mountains to visit glens lakes waterfalls or whatever scenes of natural wonder or beauty lay concealed among their recesses it is wordsworth i think who talking of an old man under difficulties remarks with a singular attention to nature                   whether it was care that spurrd him                  god only knows but to the very last                  he had the lightest foot in ennerdale  in the same manner languid listless and unhappy within doors at times even indicating something which approached near to contempt of the homely accommodations of her sisters house although she instantly endeavoured by a thousand kindnesses to atone for such ebullitions of spleen lady staunton appeared to feel interest and energy while in the open air and traversing the mountain landscapes in society with the two boys whose ears she delighted with stories of what she had seen in other countries and what she had to show them at willingham manor and they on the other hand exerted themselves in doing the honours of dumbartonshire to the lady who seemed so kind insomuch that there was scarce a glen in the neighbouring hills to which they did not introduce her  upon one of these excursions while reuben was otherwise employed david alone acted as lady stauntons guide and promised to show her a cascade in the hills grander and higher than any they had yet visited it was a walk of five long miles and over rough ground varied however and cheered by mountain views and peeps now of the firth and its islands now of distant lakes now of rocks and precipices the scene itself too when they reached it amply rewarded the labour of the walk a single shoot carried a considerable stream over the face of a black rock which contrasted strongly in colour with the white foam of the cascade and at the depth of about twenty feet another rock intercepted the view of the bottom of the fall the water wheeling out far beneath swept round the crag which thus bounded their view and tumbled down the rocky glen in a torrent of foam those who love nature always desire to penetrate into its utmost recesses and lady staunton asked david whether there was not some mode of gaining a view of the abyss at the foot of the fall he said that he knew a station on a shelf on the farther side of the intercepting rock from which the whole waterfall was visible but that the road to it was steep and slippery and dangerous bent however on gratifying her curiosity she desired him to lead the way and accordingly he did so over crag and stone anxiously pointing out to her the restingplaces where she ought to step for their mode of advancing soon ceased to be walking and became scrambling  in this manner clinging like seabirds to the face of the rock they were enabled at length to turn round it and came full in front of the fall which here had a most tremendous aspect boiling roaring and thundering with unceasing din into a black cauldron a hundred feet at least below them which resembled the crater of a volcano the noise the dashing of the waters which gave an unsteady appearance to all around them the trembling even of the huge crag on which they stood the precariousness of their footing for there was scarce room for them to stand on the shelf of rock which they had thus attained had so powerful an effect on the senses and imagination of lady staunton that she called out to david she was falling and would in fact have dropped from the crag had he not caught hold of her the boy was bold and stout of his agestill he was but fourteen years old and as his assistance gave no confidence to lady staunton she felt her situation become really perilous the chance was that in the appalling novelty of the circumstances he might have caught the infection of her panic in which case it is likely that both must have perished she now screamed with terror though without hope of calling any one to her assistance to her amazement the scream was answered by a whistle from above of a tone so clear and shrill that it was heard even amid the noise of the waterfall  in this moment of terror and perplexity a human face black and having grizzled hair hanging down over the forehead and cheeks and mixing with mustaches and a beard of the same colour and as much matted and tangled looked down on them from a broken part of the rock above  it is the enemy said the boy who had very nearly become incapable of supporting lady staunton  no no she exclaimed inaccessible to supernatural terrors and restored to the presence of mind of which she had been deprived by the danger of her situation it is a manfor gods sake my friend help us  the face glared at them but made no answer in a second or two afterwards another that of a young lad appeared beside the first equally swart and begrimed but having tangled black hair descending in elflocks which gave an air of wildness and ferocity to the whole expression of the countenance lady staunton repeated her entreaties clinging to the rock with more energy as she found that from the superstitious terror of her guide he became incapable of supporting her her words were probably drowned in the roar of the falling stream for though she observed the lips of the young being whom she supplicated move as he spoke in reply not a word reached her ear  a moment afterwards it appeared he had not mistaken the nature of her supplication which indeed was easy to be understood from her situation and gestures the younger apparition disappeared and immediately after lowered a ladder of twisted osiers about eight feet in length and made signs to david to hold it fast while the lady ascended despair gives courage and finding herself in this fearful predicament lady staunton did not hesitate to risk the ascent by the precarious means which this accommodation afforded and carefully assisted by the person who had thus providentially come to her aid she reached the summit in safety she did not however even look around her until she saw her nephew lightly and actively follow her examples although there was now no one to hold the ladder fast when she saw him safe she looked round and could not help shuddering at the place and company in which she found herself they were on a sort of platform of rock surrounded on every side by precipices or overhanging cliffs and which it would have been scarce possible for any research to have discovered as it did not seem to be commanded by any accessible position it was partly covered by a huge fragment of stone which having fallen from the cliffs above had been intercepted by others in its descent and jammed so as to serve for a sloping roof to the farther part of the broad shelf or platform on which they stood a quantity of withered moss and leaves strewed beneath this rude and wretched shelter showed the lairsthey could not be termed the bedsof those who dwelt in this eyrie for it deserved no other name of these two were before lady staunton one the same who had afforded such timely assistance stood upright before them a tall lathy young savage his dress a tattered plaid and philabeg no shoes no stockings no hat or bonnet the place of the last being supplied by his hair twisted and matted like the glibbe of the ancient wild irish and like theirs forming a natural thickset stout enough to bear off the cut of a sword yet the eyes of the lad were keen and sparkling his gesture free and noble like that of all savages he took little notice of david butler but gazed with wonder on lady staunton as a being different probably in dress and superior in beauty to anything he had ever beheld the old man whose face they had first seen remained recumbent in the same posture as when he had first looked down on them only his face was turned towards them as he lay and looked up with a lazy and listless apathy which belied the general expression of his dark and rugged features he seemed a very tall man but was scarce better clad than the younger he had on a loose lowland greatcoat and ragged tartan trews or pantaloons all around looked singularly wild and unpropitious beneath the brow of the incumbent rock was a charcoal fire on which there was a still working with bellows pincers hammers a movable anvil and other smiths tools three guns with two or three sacks and barrels were disposed against the wall of rock under shelter of the superincumbent crag a dirk and two swords and a lochaber axe lay scattered around the fire of which the red glare cast a ruddy tinge on the precipitous foam and mist of the cascade the lad when he had satisfied his curiosity with staring at lady staunton fetched an earthen jar and a horncup into which he poured some spirits apparently hot from the still and offered them successively to the lady and to the boy both declined and the young savage quaffed off the draught which could not amount to less than three ordinary glasses he then fetched another ladder from the corner of the cavern if it could be termed so adjusted it against the transverse rock which served as a roof and made signs for the lady to ascend it while he held it fast below she did so and found herself on the top of a broad rock near the brink of the chasm into which the brook precipitates itself she could see the crest of the torrent flung loose down the rock like the mane of a wild horse but without having any view of the lower platform from which she had ascended  david was not suffered to mount so easily the lad from sport or love of mischief shook the ladder a good deal as he ascended and seemed to enjoy the terror of young butler so that when they had both come up they looked on each other with no friendly eyes neither however spoke the young caird or tinker or gipsy with a good deal of attention assisted lady staunton up a very perilous ascent which she had still to encounter and they were followed by david butler until all three stood clear of the ravine on the side of a mountain whose sides were covered with heather and sheets of loose shingle so narrow was the chasm out of which they ascended that unless when they were on the very verge the eye passed to the other side without perceiving the existence of a rent so fearful and nothing was seen of the cataract though its deep hoarse voice was still heard  lady staunton freed from the danger of rock and river had now a new subject of anxiety her two guides confronted each other with angry countenances for david though younger by two years at least and much shorter was a stout wellset and very bold boy  you are the blackcoats son of knocktarlitie said the young caird if you come here again ill pitch you down the linn like a football  ay lad ye are very short to be sae lang retorted young butler undauntedly and measuring his opponents height with an undismayed eye i am thinking you are a gillie of black donacha if you come down the glen well shoot you like a wild buck  you may tell your father said the lad that the leaf on the timber is the last he shall seewe will hae amends for the mischief he has done to us  i hope he will live to see mony simmers and do ye muckle mair answered david  more might have passed but lady staunton stepped between them with her purse in her hand and taking out a guinea of which it contained several visible through the network as well as some silver in the opposite end offered it to the caird  the white siller ladythe white siller said the young savage to whom the value of gold was probably unknown lady staunton poured what silver she had into his hand and the juvenile savage snatched it greedily and made a sort of half inclination of acknowledgment and adieu  let us make haste now lady staunton said david for there will be little peace with them since they hae seen your purse  they hurried on as fast as they could but they had not descended the hill a hundred yards or two before they heard a halloo behind them and looking back saw both the old man and the young one pursuing them with great speed the former with a gun on his shoulder very fortunately at this moment a sportsman a gamekeeper of the duke who was engaged in stalking deer appeared on the face of the hill the bandits stopped on seeing him and lady staunton hastened to put herself under his protection he readily gave them his escort home and it required his athletic form and loaded rifle to restore to the lady her usual confidence and courage  donald listened with much gravity to the account of their adventure and answered with great composure to davids repeated inquiries whether he could have suspected that the cairds had been lurking thereinteed master tavie i might hae had some guess that they were there or thereabout though maybe i had nane but i am aften on the hill and they are like waspsthey stang only them that fashes them sae for my part i make a point not to see them unless i were ordered out on the preceese errand by maccallummore or knockdunder whilk is a clean different case  they reached the manse late and lady staunton who had suffered much both from fright and fatigue never again permitted her love of the picturesque to carry her so far among the mountains without a stronger escort than david though she acknowledged he had won the stand of colours by the intrepidity he had displayed so soon as assured he had to do with an earthly antagonist i couldna maybe hae made muckle o a bargain wi yon lang callant said david when thus complimented on his valour but when ye deal wi thae folk its tyne heart tyne a      chapter twentyseventh                what see you there               that hath so cowarded and chased your blood                           out of appearance                                     henry the fifth  we are under the necessity of returning to edinburgh where the general assembly was now sitting it is well known that some scottish nobleman is usually deputed as high commissioner to represent the person of the king in this convocation that he has allowances for the purpose of maintaining a certain outward show and solemnity and supporting the hospitality of the representative of majesty whoever are distinguished by rank or office in or near the capital usually attend the morning levees of the lord commissioner and walk with him in procession to the place where the assembly meets  the nobleman who held this office chanced to be particularly connected with sir george staunton and it was in his train that he ventured to tread the high street of edinburgh for the first time since the fatal night of porteouss execution walking at the right hand of the representative of sovereignty covered with lace and embroidery and with all the paraphernalia of wealth and rank the handsome though wasted figure of the english stranger attracted all eyes who could have recognised in a form so aristocratic the plebeian convict that disguised in the rags of madge wildfire had led the formidable rioters to their destined revenge there was no possibility that this could happen even if any of his ancient acquaintances a race of men whose lives are so brief had happened to survive the span commonly allotted to evildoers besides the whole affair had long fallen asleep with the angry passions in which it originated nothing is more certain than that persons known to have had a share in that formidable riot and to have fled from scotland on that account had made money abroad returned to enjoy it in their native country and lived and died undisturbed by the law   see arnots criminal trials 4to ed p 235  the forbearance of the magistrate was in these instances wise certainly and just for what good impression could be made on the public mind by punishment when the memory of the offence was obliterated and all that was remembered was the recent inoffensive or perhaps exemplary conduct of the offender  sir george staunton might therefore tread the scene of his former audacious exploits free from the apprehension of the law or even of discovery or suspicion but with what feelings his heart that day throbbed must be left to those of the reader to imagine it was an object of no common interest which had brought him to encounter so many painful remembrances  in consequence of jeanies letter to lady staunton transmitting the confession he had visited the town of carlisle and had found archdeacon fleming still alive by whom that confession had been received this reverend gentleman whose character stood deservedly very high he so far admitted into his confidence as to own himself the father of the unfortunate infant which had been spirited away by madge wildfire representing the intrigue as a matter of juvenile extravagance on his own part for which he was now anxious to atone by tracing if possible what had become of the child after some recollection of the circumstances the clergyman was able to call to memory that the unhappy woman had written a letter to george staunton esq younger rectory willingham by grantham that he had forwarded it to the address accordingly and that it had been returned with a note from the reverend mr staunton rector of willingham saying he knew no such person as him to whom the letter was addressed as this had happened just at the time when george had for the last time absconded from his fathers house to carry off effie he was at no loss to account for the cause of the resentment under the influence of which his father had disowned him this was another instance in which his ungovernable temper had occasioned his misfortune had he remained at willingham but a few days longer he would have received margaret murdocksons letter in which were exactly described the person and haunts of the woman annaple bailzou to whom she had parted with the infant it appeared that meg murdockson had been induced to make this confession less from any feelings of contrition than from the desire of obtaining through george staunton or his fathers means protection and support for her daughter madge her letter to george staunton said that while the writer lived her daughter would have needed nought from any body and that she would never have meddled in these affairs except to pay back the ill that george had done to her and hers but she was to die and her daughter would be destitute and without reason to guide her she had lived in the world long enough to know that people did nothing for nothingso she had told george staunton all he could wish to know about his wean in hopes he would not see the demented young creature he had ruined perish for want as for her motives for not telling them sooner she had a long account to reckon for in the next world and she would reckon for that too  the clergyman said that meg had died in the same desperate state of mind occasionally expressing some regret about the child which was lost but oftener sorrow that the mother had not been hangedher mind at once a chaos of guilt rage and apprehension for her daughters future safety that instinctive feeling of parental anxiety which she had in common with the shewolf and lioness being the last shade of kindly affection that occupied a breast equally savage  the melancholy catastrophe of madge wildfire was occasioned by her taking the confusion of her mothers execution as affording an opportunity of leaving the workhouse to which the clergyman had sent her and presenting herself to the mob in their fury to perish in the way we have already seen when dr fleming found the convicts letter was returned from lincolnshire he wrote to a friend in edinburgh to inquire into the fate of the unfortunate girl whose child had been stolen and was informed by his correspondent that she had been pardoned and that with all her family she had retired to some distant part of scotland or left the kingdom entirely and here the matter rested until at sir george stauntons application the clergyman looked out and produced margaret murdocksons returned letter and the other memoranda which he had kept concerning the affair  whatever might be sir george stauntons feelings in ripping up this miserable history and listening to the tragical fate of the unhappy girl whom he had ruined he had so much of his ancient wilfulness of disposition left as to shut his eyes on everything save the prospect which seemed to open itself of recovering his son it was true it would be difficult to produce him without telling much more of the history of his birth and the misfortunes of his parents than it was prudent to make known but let him once be found and being found let him but prove worthy of his fathers protection and many ways might be fallen upon to avoid such risk sir george staunton was at liberty to adopt him as his heir if he pleased without communicating the secret of his birth or an act of parliament might be obtained declaring him legitimate and allowing him the name and arms of his father he was indeed already a legitimate child according to the law of scotland by the subsequent marriage of his parents wilful in everything sir georges sole desire now was to see this son even should his recovery bring with it a new series of misfortunes as dreadful as those which followed on his being lost  but where was the youth who might eventually be called to the honours and estates of this ancient family on what heath was he wandering and shrouded by what mean disguise did he gain his precarious bread by some petty trade by menial toil by violence or by theft these were questions on which sir georges anxious investigations could obtain no light many remembered that annaple bailzou wandered through the country as a beggar and fortuneteller or spaewifesome remembered that she had been seen with an infant in 1737 or 1738but for more than ten years she had not travelled that district and that she had been heard to say she was going to a distant part of scotland of which country she was a native to scotland therefore came sir george staunton having parted with his lady at glasgow and his arrival at edinburg happening to coincide with the sitting of the general assembly of the kirk his acquaintance with the nobleman who held the office of lord high commissioner forced him more into public than suited either his views or inclinations  at the public table of this nobleman sir george staunton was placed next to a clergyman of respectable appearance and wellbred though plain demeanour whose name he discovered to be butler it had been no part of sir georges plan to take his brotherinlaw into his confidence and he had rejoiced exceedingly in the assurances he received from his wife that mrs butler the very soul of integrity and honour had never suffered the account he had given of himself at willingham rectory to transpire even to her husband but he was not sorry to have an opportunity to converse with so near a connection without being known to him and to form a judgment of his character and understanding he saw much and heard more to raise butler very high in his opinion he found he was generally respected by those of his own profession as well as by the laity who had seats in the assembly he had made several public appearances in the assembly distinguished by good sense candour and ability and he was followed and admired as a sound and at the same time an eloquent preacher  this was all very satisfactory to sir george stauntons pride which had revolted at the idea of his wifes sister being obscurely married he now began on the contrary to think the connection so much better than he expected that if it should be necessary to acknowledge it in consequence of the recovery of his son it would sound well enough that lady staunton had a sister who in the decayed state of the family had married a scottish clergyman high in the opinion of his countrymen and a leader in the church  it was with these feelings that when the lord high commissioners company broke up sir george staunton under pretence of prolonging some inquiries concerning the constitution of the church of scotland requested butler to go home to his lodgings in the lawnmarket and drink a cup of coffee butler agreed to wait upon him providing sir george would permit him in passing to call at a friends house where he resided and make his apology for not coming to partake her tea they proceeded up the high street entered the krames and passed the beggingbox placed to remind those at liberty of the distresses of the poor prisoners sir george paused there one instant and next day a l20 note was found in that receptacle for public charity  when he came up to butler again he found him with his eyes fixed on the entrance of the tolbooth and apparently in deep thought  that seems a very strong door said sir george by way of saying something  it is so sir said butler turning off and beginning to walk forward but it was my misfortune at one time to see it prove greatly too weak  at this moment looking at his companion he asked him whether he felt himself ill and sir george staunton admitted that he had been so foolish as to eat ice which sometimes disagreed with him with kind officiousness that would not be gainsaid and ere he could find out where he was going butler hurried sir george into the friends house near to the prison in which he himself had lived since he came to town being indeed no other than that of our old friend bartoline saddletree in which lady staunton had served a short noviciate as a shopmaid this recollection rushed on her husbands mind and the blush of shame which it excited overpowered the sensation of fear which had produced his former paleness good mrs saddletree however bustled about to receive the rich english baronet as the friend of mr butler and requested an elderly female in a black gown to sit still in a way which seemed to imply a wish that she would clear the way for her betters in the meanwhile understanding the state of the case she ran to get some cordial waters sovereign of course in all cases of faintishness whatsoever during her absence her visitor the female in black made some progress out of the room and might have left it altogether without particular observation had she not stumbled at the threshold so near sir george staunton that he in point of civility raised her and assisted her to the door  mrs porteous is turned very doited now puir body said mrs saddletree as she returned with her bottle in her handshe is no sae auld but she got a sair backcast wi the slaughter o her husbandye had some trouble about that job mr butleri think sir to sir george ye had better drink out the haill glass for to my een ye look waur than when ye came in  and indeed he grew as pale as a corpse on recollecting who it was that his arm had so lately supportedthe widow whom he had so large a share in making such  it is a prescribed job that case of porteous now said old saddletree who was confined to his chair by the goutclean prescribed and out of date  i am not clear of that neighbour said plumdamas for i have heard them say twenty years should rin and this is but the fiftyane porteouss mob was in threttyseven  yell no teach me law i think neighbourme that has four gaun pleas and might hae had fourteen an it hadna been the gudewife i tell ye if the foremost of the porteous mob were standing there where that gentleman stands the kings advocate wadna meddle wi himit fas under the negative prescription  haud your din carles said mrs saddletree and let the gentleman sit down and get a dish of comfortable tea  but sir george had had quite enough of their conversation and butler at his request made an apology to mrs saddletree and accompanied him to his lodgings here they found another guest waiting sir george stauntons return this was no other than our readers old acquaintance ratcliffe  this man had exercised the office of turnkey with so much vigilance acuteness and fidelity that he gradually rose to be governor or captain of the tolbooth and it is yet to be remembered in tradition that young men who rather sought amusing than select society in their merrymeetings used sometimes to request ratcliffes company in order that he might regale them with legends of his extraordinary feats in the way of robbery and escape   there seems an anachronism in the history of this person ratcliffe among other escapes from justice was released by the porteous mob when under sentence of death and he was again under the same predicament when the highlanders made a similar jaildelivery in 1745 he was too sincere a whig to embrace liberation at the hands of the jacobites and in reward was made one of the keepers of the tolbooth so at least runs constant tradition  but he lived and died without resuming his original vocation otherwise than in his narratives over a bottle  under these circumstances he had been recommended to sir george staunton by a man of the law in edinburgh as a person likely to answer any questions he might have to ask about annaple bailzou who according to the colour which sir george staunton gave to his cause of inquiry was supposed to have stolen a child in the west of england belonging to a family in which he was interested the gentleman had not mentioned his name but only his official title so that sir george staunton when told that the captain of the tolbooth was waiting for him in his parlour had no idea of meeting his former acquaintance jem ratcliffe  this therefore was another new and most unpleasant surprise for he had no difficulty in recollecting this mans remarkable features the change however from george robertson to sir george staunton baffled even the penetration of ratcliffe and he bowed very low to the baronet and his guest hoping mr butler would excuse his recollecting that he was an old acquaintance  and once rendered my wife a piece of great service said mr butler for which she sent you a token of grateful acknowledgment which i hope came safe and was welcome  deil a doubt ont said ratcliffe with a knowing nod but ye are muckle changed for the better since i saw ye maister butler  so much so that i wonder you knew me  aha thendeil a face i see i ever forget said ratcliffe while sir george staunton tied to the stake and incapable of escaping internally cursed the accuracy of his memory and yet sometimes continued ratcliffe the sharpest hand will be taen in there is a face in this very room if i might presume to be sae bauld that if i didna ken the honourable person it belangs to i might think it had some cut of an auld acquaintance  i should not be much flattered answered the baronet sternly and roused by the risk in which he saw himself placed if it is to me you mean to apply that compliment  by no manner of means sir said ratcliffe bowing very low i am come to receive your honours commands and no to trouble your honour wi my poor observations  well sir said sir george i am told you understand police matters so do ito convince you of which here are ten guineas of retaining feei make them fifty when you can find me certain notice of a person living or dead whom you will find described in that paper i shall leave town presentlyyou may send your written answer to me to the care of mr  naming his highly respectable agent or of his grace the lord high commissioner rateliffe bowed and withdrew  i have angered the proud peat now he said to himself by finding out a likeness but if george robertsons father had lived within a mile of his mother dn me if i should not know what to think for as high as he carries his head  when he was left alone with butler sir george staunton ordered tea and coffee which were brought by his valet and then after considering with himself for a minute asked his guest whether he had lately heard from his wife and family butler with some surprise at the question replied that he had received no letter for some time his wife was a poor penwoman  then said sir george staunton i am the first to inform you there has been an invasion of your quiet premises since you left home my wife whom the duke of argyle had the goodness to permit to use roseneath lodge while she was spending some weeks in your country has sallied across and taken up her quarters in the manse as she says to be nearer the goats whose milk she is using but i believe in reality because she prefers mrs butlers company to that of the respectable gentleman who acts as seneschal on the dukes domains  mr butler said he had often heard the late duke and the present speak with high respect of lady staunton and was happy if his house could accommodate any friend of theirsit would be but a very slight acknowledgment of the many favours he owed them  that does not make lady staunton and myself the less obliged to your hospitality sir said sir george may i inquire if you think of returning home soon  in the course of two days mr butler answered his duty in the assembly would be ended and the other matters he had in town being all finished he was desirous of returning to dumbartonshire as soon as he could but he was under the necessity of transporting a considerable sum in bills and money with him and therefore wished to travel in company with one or two of his brethren of the clergy  my escort will be more safe said sir george staunton and i think of setting off tomorrow or next day if you will give me the pleasure of your company i will undertake to deliver you and your charge safe at the manse provided you will admit me along with you  mr butler gratefully accepted of this proposal the appointment was made accordingly and by despatches with one of sir georges servants who was sent forward for the purpose the inhabitants of the manse of knocktarlitie were made acquainted with the intended journey and the news rung through the whole vicinity that the minister was coming back wi a braw english gentleman and a the siller that was to pay for the estate of craigsture  this sudden resolution of going to knocktarlitie had been adopted by sir george staunton in consequence of the incidents of the evening in spite of his present consequence he felt he had presumed too far in venturing so near the scene of his former audacious acts of violence and he knew too well from past experience the acuteness of a man like ratcliffe again to encounter him the next two days he kept his lodgings under pretence of indisposition and took leave by writing of his noble friend the high commissioner alleging the opportunity of mr butlers company as a reason for leaving edinburgh sooner than he had proposed he had a long conference with his agent on the subject of annaple bailzou and the professional gentleman who was the agent also of the argyle family had directions to collect all the information which ratcliffe or others might be able to obtain concerning the fate of that woman and the unfortunate child and so soon as anything transpired which had the least appearance of being important that he should send an express with it instantly to knocktarlitie these instructions were backed with a deposit of money and a request that no expense might be spared so that sir george staunton had little reason to apprehend negligence on the part of the persons intrusted with the commission  the journey which the brothers made in company was attended with more pleasure even to sir george staunton than he had ventured to expect his heart lightened in spite of himself when they lost sight of edinburgh and the easy sensible conversation of butler was well calculated to withdraw his thoughts from painful reflections he even began to think whether there could be much difficulty in removing his wifes connections to the rectory of willingham it was only on his part procuring some still better preferment for the present incumbent and on butlers that he should take orders according to the english church to which he could not conceive a possibility of his making objection and then he had them residing under his wing no doubt there was pain in seeing mrs butler acquainted as he knew her to be with the full truth of his evil history but then her silence though he had no reason to complain of her indiscretion hitherto was still more absolutely ensured it would keep his lady also both in good temper and in more subjection for she was sometimes troublesome to him by insisting on remaining in town when he desired to retire to the country alleging the total want of society at willingham madam your sister is there would he thought be a sufficient answer to this ready argument  he sounded butler on this subject asking what he would think of an english living of twelve hundred pounds yearly with the burden of affording his company now and then to a neighbour whose health was not strong or his spirits equal he might meet he said occasionally a very learned and accomplished gentleman who was in orders as a catholic priest but he hoped that would be no insurmountable objection to a man of his liberality of sentiment what he said would mr butler think of as an answer if the offer should be made to him  simply that i could not accept of it said mr butler i have no mind to enter into the various debates between the churches but i was brought up in mine own have received her ordination am satisfied of the truth of her doctrines and will die under the banner i have enlisted to  what may be the value of your preferment said sir george staunton unless i am asking an indiscreet question  probably one hundred ayear one year with another besides my glebe and pastureground  and you scruple to exchange that for twelve hundred ayear without alleging any damning difference of doctrine betwixt the two churches of england and scotland  on that sir i have reserved my judgment there may be much good and there are certainly saving means in both but every man must act according to his own lights i hope i have done and am in the course of doing my masters work in this highland parish and it would ill become me for the sake of lucre to leave my sheep in the wilderness but even in the temporal view which you have taken of the matter sir george this hundred pounds ayear of stipend hath fed and clothed us and left us nothing to wish for my fatherinlaws succession and other circumstances have added a small estate of about twice as much more and how we are to dispose of it i do not knowso i leave it to you sir to think if i were wise not having the wish or opportunity of spending three hundred ayear to covet the possession of four times that sum  this is philosophy said sir george i have heard of it but i never saw it before  it is common sense replied butler which accords with philosophy and religion more frequently than pedants or zealots are apt to admit  sir george turned the subject and did not again resume it although they travelled in sir georges chariot he seemed so much fatigued with the motion that it was necessary for him to remain for a day at a small town called midcalder which was their first stage from edinburgh glasgow occupied another day so slow were their motions  they travelled on to dumbarton where they had resolved to leave the equipage and to hire a boat to take them to the shores near the manse as the gareloch lay betwixt them and that point besides the impossibility of travelling in that district with wheelcarriages sir georges valet a man of trust accompanied them as also a footman the grooms were left with the carriage just as this arrangement was completed which was about four oclock in the afternoon an express arrived from sir georges agent in edinburgh with a packet which he opened and read with great attention appearing much interested and agitated by the contents the packet had been despatched very soon after their leaving edinburgh but the messenger had missed the travellers by passing through midcalder in the night and overshot his errand by getting to roseneath before them he was now on his return after having waited more than fourandtwenty hours sir george staunton instantly wrote back an answer and rewarding the messenger liberally desired him not to sleep till he placed it in his agents hands  at length they embarked in the boat which had waited for them some time during their voyage which was slow for they were obliged to row the whole way and often against the tide sir george stauntons inquiries ran chiefly on the subject of the highland banditti who had infested that country since the year 1745 butler informed him that many of them were not native highlanders but gipsies tinkers and other men of desperate fortunes who had taken advantage of the confusion introduced by the civil war the general discontent of the mountaineers and the unsettled state of police to practise their plundering trade with more audacity sir george next inquired into their lives their habits whether the violences which they committed were not sometimes atoned for by acts of generosity and whether they did not possess the virtues as well as the vices of savage tribes  butler answered that certainly they did sometimes show sparks of generosity of which even the worst class of malefactors are seldom utterly divested but that their evil propensities were certain and regular principles of action while any occasional burst of virtuous feeling was only a transient impulse not to be reckoned upon and excited probably by some singular and unusual concatenation of circumstances in discussing these inquiries which sir george pursued with an apparent eagerness that rather surprised butler the latter chanced to mention the name of donacha dhu na dunaigh with which the reader is already acquainted sir george caught the sound up eagerly and as if it conveyed particular interest to his ear he made the most minute inquiries concerning the man whom he mentioned the number of his gang and even the appearance of those who belonged to it upon these points butler could give little answer the man had a name among the lower class but his exploits were considerably exaggerated he had always one or two fellows with him but never aspired to the command of above three or four in short he knew little about him and the small acquaintance he had had by no means inclined him to desire more  nevertheless i should like to see him some of these days  that would be a dangerous meeting sir george unless you mean we are to see him receive his deserts from the law and then it were a melancholy one  use every man according to his deserts mr butler and who shall escape whipping but i am talking riddles to you i will explain them more fully to you when i have spoken over the subject with lady stauntonpull away my lads he added addressing himself to the rowers the clouds threaten us with a storm  in fact the dead and heavy closeness of the air the huge piles of clouds which assembled in the western horizon and glowed like a furnace under the influence of the setting sunthat awful stillness in which nature seems to expect the thunderburst as a condemned soldier waits for the platoon fire which is to stretch him on the earth all betokened a speedy storm large broad drops fell from time to time and induced the gentlemen to assume the boatcloaks but the rain again ceased and the oppressive heat so unusual in scotland in the end of may inclined them to throw them aside there is something solemn in this delay of the storm said sir george it seems as if it suspended its peal till it solemnised some important event in the world below  alas replied butler what are we that the laws of nature should correspond in their march with our ephemeral deeds or sufferings the clouds will burst when surcharged with the electric fluid whether a goat is falling at that instant from the cliffs of arran or a hero expiring on the field of battle he has won  the mind delights to deem it otherwise said sir george staunton and to dwell on the fate of humanity as on that which is the prime central movement of the mighty machine we love not to think that we shall mix with the ages that have gone before us as these broad black raindrops mingle with the waste of waters making a trifling and momentary eddy and are then lost for ever  for everwe are notwe cannot be lost for ever said butler looking upward death is to us change not consummation and the commencement of a new existence corresponding in character to the deeds which we have done in the body  while they agitated these grave subjects to which the solemnity of the approaching storm naturally led them their voyage threatened to be more tedious than they expected for gusts of wind which rose and fell with sudden impetuosity swept the bosom of the firth and impeded the efforts of the rowers they had now only to double a small headland in order to get to the proper landingplace in the mouth of the little river but in the state of the weather and the boat being heavy this was like to be a work of time and in the meanwhile they must necessarily be exposed to the storm  could we not land on this side of the headland asked sir george and so gain some shelter  butler knew of no landingplace at least none affording a convenient or even practicable passage up the rocks which surrounded the shore  think again said sir george staunton the storm will soon be violent  hout ay said one of the boatmen theres the cairds cove but we dinna tell the minister about it and i am no sure if i can steer the boat to it the bay is sae fa o shoals and sunk rocks  try said sir george and i will give you halfaguinea  the old fellow took the helm and observed that if they could get in there was a steep path up from the beach and halfanhours walk from thence to the manse  are you sure you know the way said butler to the old man  i maybe kend it a wee better fifteen years syne when dandie wilson was in the firth wi his cleanganging lugger i mind dandie had a wild young englisher wi him that they cad  if you chatter so much said sir george staunton you will have the boat on the grindstonebring that white rock in a line with the steeple  by g said the veteran staring i think your honour kens the bay as weel as meyour honours nose has been on the grindstone ere now im thinking  as they spoke thus they approached the little cove which concealed behind crags and defended on every point by shallows and sunken rocks could scarce be discovered or approached except by those intimate with the navigation an old shattered boat was already drawn up on the beach within the cove close beneath the trees and with precautions for concealment  upon observing this vessel butler remarked to his companion it is impossible for you to conceive sir george the difficulty i have had with my poor people in teaching them the guilt and the danger of this contraband tradeyet they have perpetually before their eyes all its dangerous consequences i do not know anything that more effectually depraves and ruins their moral and religious principles  sir george forced himself to say something in a low voice about the spirit of adventure natural to youth and that unquestionably many would become wiser as they grew older  too seldom sir replied butler if they have been deeply engaged and especially if they have mingled in the scenes of violence and blood to which their occupation naturally leads i have observed that sooner or later they come to an evil end experience as well as scripture teaches us sir george that mischief shall hunt the violent man and that the bloodthirsty man shall not live half his daysbut take my arm to help you ashore  sir george needed assistance for he was contrasting in his altered thought the different feelings of mind and frame with which he had formerly frequented the same place as they landed a low growl of thunder was heard at a distance  that is ominous mr butler said sir george  intonuit laevumit is ominous of good then answered butler smiling  the boatmen were ordered to make the best of their way round the headland to the ordinary landingplace the two gentlemen followed by their servant sought their way by a blind and tangled path through a close copsewood to the manse of knocktarlitie where their arrival was anxiously expected  the sisters in vain had expected their husbands return on the preceding day which was that appointed by sir georges letter the delay of the travellers at calder had occasioned this breach of appointment the inhabitants of the manse began even to doubt whether they would arrive on the present day lady staunton felt this hope of delay as a brief reprieve for she dreaded the pangs which her husbands pride must undergo at meeting with a sisterinlaw to whom the whole of his unhappy and dishonourable history was too well known she knew whatever force or constraint he might put upon his feelings in public that she herself must be doomed to see them display themselves in full vehemence in secretconsume his health destroy his temper and render him at once an object of dread and compassion again and again she cautioned jeanie to display no tokens of recognition but to receive him as a perfect strangerand again and again jeanie renewed her promise to comply with her wishes  jeanie herself could not fail to bestow an anxious thought on the awkwardness of the approaching meeting but her conscience was ungalledand then she was cumbered with many household cares of an unusual nature which joined to the anxious wish once more to see butler after an absence of unusual length made her extremely desirous that the travellers should arrive as soon as possible andwhy should i disguise the truthever and anon a thought stole across her mind that her gala dinner had now been postponed for two days and how few of the dishes after every art of her simple cuisine had been exerted to dress them could with any credit or propriety appear again upon the third and what was she to do with the restupon this last subject she was saved the trouble of farther deliberation by the sudden appearance of the captain at the head of halfadozen stout fellows dressed and armed in the highland fashion  gootmorrow morning to ye leddy staunton and i hope i hae the pleasure to see you weeland gootmorrow to you goot mrs putleri do peg you will order some victuals and ale and prandy for the lads for we hae peen out on firth and moor since afore daylight and a to no purpose neithercot tam  so saying he sate down pushed back his brigadier wig and wiped his head with an air of easy importance totally regardless of the look of wellbred astonishment by which lady staunton endeavoured to make him comprehend that he was assuming too great a liberty  it is some comfort when one has had a sair tussel continued the captain addressing lady staunton with an air of gallantry that it is in a fair leddys service or in the service of a gentleman whilk has a fair leddy whilk is the same thing since serving the husband is serving the wife as mrs putler does very weel know  really sir said lady staunton as you seem to intend this compliment for me i am at a loss to know what interest sir george or i can have in your

entertained no doubt so long as her best greybeard of brandy was upon duty duncan left the manse collected his followers and began to scour the close and entangled wood which lay between the little glen and the cairds cove david who was a favourite with the captain on account of his spirit and courage took the opportunity of escaping to attend the investigations of that great man      chapter

next heard and duncan and his myrmidons hastening to the spot found butler and sir george stauntons servant in the hands of four ruffians sir george himself lay stretched on the ground with his drawn sword in his hand duncan who was as brave as a lion instantly fired his pistol at the leader of the band unsheathed his sword cried out to his men claymore and run his weapon through the body of the fellow whom he had previously wounded who was no other thau donacha dhu na dunaigh himself the other banditti were speedily overpowered excepting one young lad who made wonderful resistance for his years and was at length secured with difficulty   illustration death of sir george staunton404   butler so soon as he was liberated from the ruffians ran to raise sir george staunton but life had

such was the observation of a man too much accustomed to the ancient state of manners in the highlands to look upon the issue of such a skirmish as anything worthy of wonder or emotion  we will not attempt to describe the very contrary effect which the unexpected disaster produced upon lady staunton when the bloody corpse of her husband was brought to the house where she expected to meet him alive and well all was forgotten but that he was the lover of her youth and whatever were his faults to the world that he had towards her exhibited only those that arose from the inequality of spirits and temper incident to a situation of unparalleled difficulty in the vivacity of her grief she gave way to all the natural irritability of her temper shriek followed shriek and swoon succeeded to swoon it required all jeanies watchful affection to prevent her from making known in these paroxysms of affliction much which it was of the highest importance that she should keep secret  at length silence and exhaustion succeeded to frenzy and jeanie stole out to take counsel with her husband and to exhort him to anticipate the captains interference by taking possession in lady stauntons name of the private papers of her deceased husband to the utter astonishment of butler she now for the first time explained the relation betwixt herself and lady staunton which authorised nay demanded that he should prevent any stranger from being unnecessarily made acquainted with her family affairs it was in such a crisis that jeanies active and undaunted habits of virtuous exertion were most conspicuous while the captains attention was still engaged by a prolonged refreshment and a very tedious examination in gaelic and english of all the prisoners and every other witness of the fatal transaction she had the body of her brotherinlaw undressed and properly disposed it then appeared from the crucifix the beads and the shirt of hair which he wore next his person that his sense of guilt had induced him to receive the dogmata of a religion which pretends by the maceration of the body to expiate the crimes of the soul in the packet of papers which the express had brought to sir george staunton from edinburgh and which butler authorised by his connection with the deceased did not scruple to examine he found new and astonishing intelligence which gave him reason to thank god he had taken that measure  ratcliffe to whom all sorts of misdeeds and misdoers were familiar instigated by the promised reward soon found himself in a condition to trace the infant of these unhappy parents the woman to whom meg murdockson had sold that most unfortunate child had made it the companion of her wanderings and her beggary until he was about seven or eight years old when as ratcliffe learned from a companion of hers then in the correction house of edinburgh she sold him in her turn to donacha dhu na dunaigh this man to whom no act of mischief was unknown was occasionally an agent in a horrible trade then carried on betwixt scotland and america for supplying the plantations with servants by means of kidnapping as it was termed both men and women but especially children under age here ratcliffe lost sight of the boy but had no doubt but donacha dhu could give an account of him the gentleman of the law so often mentioned despatched therefore an express with a letter to sir george staunton and another covering a warrant for apprehension of donacha with instructions to the captain of knockdunder to exert his utmost energy for that purpose  possessed of this information and with a mind agitated by the most gloomy apprehensions butler now joined the captain and obtained from him with some difficulty a sight of the examinations these with a few questions to the elder of the prisoners soon confirmed the most dreadful of butlers anticipations we give the heads of the information without descending into minute details  donacha dhu had indeed purchased effies unhappy child with the purpose of selling it to the american traders whom he had been in the habit of supplying with human flesh but no opportunity occurred for some time and the boy who was known by the name of the whistler made some impression on the heart and affections even of this rude savage perhaps because he saw in him flashes of a spirit as fierce and vindictive as his own when donacha struck or threatened hima very common occurrencehe did not answer with complaints and entreaties like other children but with oaths and efforts at revengehe had all the wild merit too by which woggarwolfes arrowbearing page won the hard heart of his master               like a wild cub reard at the ruffians feet              he could say biting jests bold ditties sing              and quaff his foaming bumper at the board                  with all the mockery of a little man   ethwald  in short as donacha dhu said the whistler was a born imp of satan and therefore he should never leave him accordingly from his eleventh year forward he was one of the band and often engaged in acts of violence the last of these was more immediately occasioned by the researches which the whistlers real father made after him whom he had been taught to consider as such donacha dhus fears had been for some time excited by the strength of the means which began now to be employed against persons of his description he was sensible he existed only by the precarious indulgence of his namesake duncan of knockdunder who was used to boast that he could put him down or string him up when he had a mind he resolved to leave the kingdom by means of one of those sloops which were engaged in the traffic of his old kidnapping friends and which was about to sail for america but he was desirous first to strike a bold stroke  the ruffians cupidity was excited by the intelligence that a wealthy englishman was coming to the mansehe had neither forgotten the whistlers report of the gold he had seen in lady stauntons purse nor his old vow of revenge against the minister and to bring the whole to a point he conceived the hope of appropriating the money which according to the general report of the country the minister was to bring from edinburgh to pay for his pew purchase while he was considering how he might best accomplish his purpose he received the intelligence from one quarter that the vessel in which he proposed to sail was to sail immediately from greenock from another that the minister and a rich english lord with a great many thousand pounds were expected the next evening at the manse and from a third that he must consult his safety by leaving his ordinary haunts as soon as possible for that the captain had ordered out a party to scour the glens for him at break of day donacha laid his plans with promptitude and decision he embarked with the whistler and two others of his band whom by the by he meant to sell to the kidnappers and set sail for the cairds cove he intended to lurk till nightfall in the wood adjoining to this place which he thought was too near the habitation of men to excite the suspicion of duncan knock then break into butlers peaceful habitation and flesh at once his appetite for plunder and revenge when his villany was accomplished his boat was to convey him to the vessel which according to previous agreement with the master was instantly to set sail  this desperate design would probably have succeeded but for the ruffians being discovered in their lurkingplace by sir george staunton and butler in their accidental walk from the cairds cove towards the manse finding himself detected and at the same time observing that the servant carried a casket or strongbox donacha conceived that both his prize and his victims were within his power and attacked the travellers without hesitation shots were fired and swords drawn on both sides sir george staunton offered the bravest resistance till he fell as there was too much reason to believe by the hand of a son so long sought and now at length so unhappily met  while butler was halfstunned with this intelligence the hoarse voice of knockdunder added to his consternation  i will take the liperty to take down the pellropes mr putler as i must pe taking order to hang these idle people up tomorrow morning to teach them more consideration in their doings in future  butler entreated him to remember the act abolishing the heritable jurisdictions and that he ought to send them to glasgow or inverary to be tried by the circuit duncan scorned the proposal  the jurisdiction act he said had nothing to do put with the rebels and specially not with argyles country and he would hang the men up all three in one row before coot leddy stauntons windows which would be a great comfort to her in the morning to see that the coot gentleman her husband had been suitably afenged  and the utmost length that butlers most earnest entreaties could prevail was that he would reserve the twa pig carles for the circuit but as for him they cad the fustler he should try how he could fustle in a swinging tow for it suldna be said that a shentleman friend to the duke was killed in his country and his people didna take at least twa lives for ane  butler entreated him to spare the victim for his souls sake but knockdunder answered that the soul of such a scum had been long the tefils property and that cot tam he was determined to gif the tefil his due  all persuasion was in vain and duncan issued his mandate for execution on the succeeding morning the child of guilt and misery was separated from his companions strongly pinioned and committed to a separate room of which the captain kept the key  in the silence of the night however mrs butler arose resolved if possible to avert at least to delay the fate which hung over her nephew especially if upon conversing with him she should see any hope of his being brought to better temper she had a masterkey that opened every lock in the house and at midnight when all was still she stood before the eyes of the astonished young savage as hard bound with cords he lay like a sheep designed for slaughter upon a quantity of the refuse of flax which filled a corner in the apartment amid features sunburnt tawny grimed with dirt and obscured by his shaggy hair of a rusted black colour jeanie tried in vain to trace the likeness of either of his very handsome parents yet how could she refuse compassion to a creature so young and so wretchedso much more wretched than even he himself could be aware of since the murder he had too probably committed with his own hand but in which he had at any rate participated was in fact a parricide she placed food on a table near him raised him and slacked the cords on his arms so as to permit him to feed himself he stretched out his hands still smeared with blood perhaps that of his father and he ate voraciously and in silence  what is your first name said jeanie by way of opening the conversation  the whistler  but your christian name by which you were baptized  i never was baptized that i know ofi have no other name than the whistler  poor unhappy abandoned lad said jeanie what would ye do if you could escape from this place and the death you are to die tomorrow morning  join wi rob roy or wi sergeant more cameron noted freebooters at that time and revenge donachas death on all and sundry  o ye unhappy boy said jeanie do ye ken what will come o ye when ye die  i shall neither feel cauld nor hunger more said the youth doggedly  to let him be execute in this dreadful state of mind would be to destroy baith body and souland to let him gang i dare notwhat will be done but he is my sisters sonmy own nephewour flesh and bloodand his hands and feet are yerked as tight as cords can be drawnwhistler do the cords hurt you  very much  but if i were to slacken them you would harm me  no i would notyou never harmed me or mine  there may be good in him yet thought jeanie i will try fair play with him  she cut his bondshe stood upright looked round with a laugh of wild exultation clapped his hands together and sprung from the ground as if in transport on finding himself at liberty he looked so wild that jeanie trembled at what she had done  let me out said the young savage  i wunna unless you promise  then ill make you glad to let us both out  he seized the lighted candle and threw it among the flax which was instantly in a flame jeanie screamed and ran out of the room the prisoner rushed past her threw open a window in the passage jumped into the garden sprung over its enclosure bounded through the woods like a deer and gained the seashore meantime the fire was extinguished but the prisoner was sought in vain as jeanie kept her own secret the share she had in his escape was not discovered but they learned his fate some time afterwardsit was as wild as his life had hitherto been  the anxious inquiries of butler at length learned that the youth had gained the ship in which his master donacha had designed to embark but the avaricious shipmaster inured by his evil trade to every species of treachery and disappointed of the rich booty which donacha had proposed to bring aboard secured the person of the fugitive and having transported him to america sold him as a slave or indented servant to a virginian planter far up the country when these tidings reached butler he sent over to america a sufficient sum to redeem the lad from slavery with instructions that measures should be taken for improving his mind restraining his evil propensities and encouraging whatever good might appear in his character but this aid came too late the young man had headed a conspiracy in which his inhuman master was put to death and had then fled to the next tribe of wild indians he was never more heard of and it may therefore be presumed that he lived and died after the manner of that savage people with whom his previous habits had well fitted him to associate  all hopes of the young mans reformation being now ended mr and mrs butler thought it could serve no purpose to explain to lady staunton a history so full of horror she remained their guest more than a year during the greater part of which period her grief was excessive in the latter months it assumed the appearance of listlessness and low spirits which the monotony of her sisters quiet establishment afforded no means of dissipating effie from her earliest youth was never formed for a quiet low content far different from her sister she required the dissipation of society to divert her sorrow or enhance her joy she left the seclusion of knocktarlitie with tears of sincere affection and after heaping its inmates with all she could think of that might be valuable in their eyes but she did leave it and when the anguish of the parting was over her departure was a relief to both sisters  the family at the manse of knocktarlitie in their own quiet happiness heard

followed the law and rose more slowly yet surely euphemia butler whose fortune augmented by her aunts generosity and added to her own beauty rendered her no small prize married a highland laird who never asked the name of her grandfather and was loaded on the occasion with presents from lady staunton which made her the envy of all the beauties in dumbarton and argyle shires  after blazing nearly ten years in the fashionable world and hiding like many of her compeers an aching heart with a gay demeanourafter declining repeated offers of the most respectable kind for a second matrimonial engagement lady staunton betrayed the inward wound by retiring to the continent and taking up her abode in the convent where she had received her education she never took the veil but lived and died in severe seclusion and in the practice of the roman catholic religion in all its formal observances vigils and austerities  jeanie had so much of her fathers spirit as to sorrow bitterly for this apostasy and butler joined in her regret yet any religion however imperfect he said was better than cold scepticism or the hurrying din of dissipation which fills the ears of worldlings until they care for none of these things  meanwhile happy in each other in the prosperity of their family and the love and honour of all who knew them this simple pair lived beloved and died lamented

of sir william scott of harden is instructed as it is called by a charter under the great seal domino willielmo scott de harden militi et waltero scott suo filio legitimo tertio genito terrarum de roberton   see douglass baronage page 215  the munificent old gentleman left all his four sons considerable estates and settled those of eilrig and raeburn together with valuable possessions around lessuden upon walter his third son who is ancestor of the scotts of raeburn and of the author of waverley he appears to have become a convert to the doctrine of the quakers or friends and a great assertor of their peculiar tenets this was probably at the time when george fox the celebrated apostle of the sect made an expedition into the south of scotland about 1657 on which occasion he boasts that as he first set his horses feet upon scottish ground he felt the seed of grace to sparkle about him like innumerable sparks of fire upon the same occasion probably sir gideon scott of highchester second son of sir william immediate elder brother of walter and ancestor of the authors friend and kinsman the present representative of the family of harden also embraced the tenets of quakerism this last convert gideon entered into a controversy with the rev james kirkton author of the secret and true history of the church of scotland which is noticed by my ingenious friend mr charles kirkpatrick sharpe in his valuable and curious edition of that work 4to 1817 sir william scott eldest of the brothers remained amid the defection of his two younger brethren an orthodox member of the presbyterian church and used such means for reclaiming walter of raeburn from his heresy as savoured far more of persecution than persuasion in this he was assisted by macdougal of makerston brother to isabella macdougal the wife of the said walter and who like her husband had conformed to the quaker tenets  the interest possessed by sir william scott and makerston was powerful enough to procure the two following acts of the privy council of scotland directed against walter of raeburn as an heretic and convert to quakerism appointing him to be imprisoned first in edinburgh jail and then in that of jedburgh and his children to be taken by force from the society and direction of their parents and educated at a distance from them besides the assignment of a sum for their maintenance sufficient in those times to be burdensome to a moderate scottish estate  apud edin vigesimo junii 1665  the lords of his magestys privy council having receaved information that scott of raeburn and isobel mackdougall his wife being infected with the error of quakerism doe endeavour to breid and trains up william walter and isobel scotts their children in the same profession doe therefore give order and command to sir william scott of harden the said raeburns brother to seperat and take away the saids children from the custody and society of the saids parents and to cause educat and bring them up in his owne house or any other convenient place and ordaines letters to be direct at the said sir williams instance against raeburn for a maintenance to the saids children and that the said sir wm give ane account of his diligence with all conveniency  edinburgh 5th july 1666  anent a petition presented be sir wm scott of harden for himself and in name and behalf of the three children of walter scott of raeburn his brother showing that the lords of councill by ane act of the 22d day of junii 1665 did grant power and warrand to the petitioner to separat and take away raeburns children from his family and education and to breed them in some convenient place where they might be free from all infection in their younger years from the principalls of quakerism and for maintenance of the saids children did ordain letters to be direct against raeburn and seeing the petitioner in obedience to the said order did take away the saids children being two sonnes and a daughter and after some paines taken upon them in his owne family hes sent them to the city of glasgow to be bread at schooles and there to be principled with the knowledge of the true religion and that it is necessary the councill determine what shall be the maintenance for which raeburns three children may be charged as likewise that raeburn himself being now in the tolbooth of edinburgh where he dayley converses with all the quakers who are prisoners there and others who daily resort to them whereby he is hardened in his pernitious opinions and principles without all hope of recovery unlesse he be separat from such pernitious company humbly therefore desyring that the councell might determine upon the soume of money to be payed be raeburn for the education of his children to the petitioner who will be countable therefor and that in order to his conversion the place of his imprisonment may be changed the lords of his maj privy councell having at length heard and considered the foresaid petition doe modifie the soume of two thousand pounds scots to be payed yearly at the terms of whitsunday be the said walter scott of raeburn furth of his estate to the petitioner for the entertainment and

orders and ordaines the said walter scott of raeburn to be transported from the tolbooth of edinburgh to the prison of jedburgh where his friends and others may have occasion to convert him and to the effect he may be secured from the practice of other quakers the said lords doe hereby discharge the magistrates of jedburgh to suffer any persons suspect of these principles to have access to him and in case any contraveen that they secure ther persons till they be therfore puneist and ordaines letters to be direct heirupon in form as effeirs   both the sons thus harshly separated from their father proved good scholars the eldest william who carried on the line of raeburn was like his father a deep orientalist the younger walter became a good classical scholar a great friend and correspondent of the celebrated dr pitcairn and a jacobite so distinguished for zeal that he made a vow never to shave his beard till the restoration of the exiled family this last walter scott was the authors greatgrandfather  there is yet another link betwixt the author and the simpleminded and excellent society of friends through a proselyte of much more importance than walter scott of raeburn the celebrated john swinton of swinton nineteenth baron in descent of that ancient and once powerful family was with sir william lockhart of lee the person whom cromwell chiefly trusted in the management of the scottish affairs during his usurpation after the restoration swinton was devoted as a victim to the new order of things and was brought down in the same vessel which conveyed the marquis of argyle to edinburgh where that nobleman was tried and executed swinton was destined to the same fate he had assumed the habit and entered into the society of the quakers and appeared as one of their number before the parliament of scotland he renounced all legal defence though several pleas were open to him and answered in conformity to the principles of his sect that at the time these crimes were imputed to him he was in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity but that god almighty having since called him to the light he saw and acknowledged these errors and did not refuse to pay the forfeit of them even though in the judgment of the parliament it should extend to life itself  respect to fallen greatness and to the patience and calm resignation with which a man once in high power expressed himself under such a change of fortune found swinton friends family connections and some interested considerations of middleton the commissioner joined to procure his safety and he was dismissed but after a long imprisonment and much dilapidation of his estates it is said that swintons admonitions while confined in the castle of edinburgh had a considerable share in converting to the tenets of the friends colonel david barclay then lying there in the garrison this was the father of robert barclay author of the celebrated apology for the quakers it may be observed among the inconsistencies of human nature that kirkton wodrow and other presbyterian authors who have detailed the sufferings of their own sect for nonconformity with the established church censure the government of the time for not exerting the civil power against the peaceful enthusiasts we have treated of and some express particular chagrin at the escape of swinton whatever might be his motives for assuming the tenets of the friends the old man retained them faithfully till the close of his life  jean swinton granddaughter of sir john swinton son of judge swinton as the quaker was usually termed was mother of anne rutherford the authors mother  and thus as in the play of the antijacobin the ghost of the authors grandmother having arisen to speak the epilogue it is full time to conclude lest the reader should remonstrate that his desire to know the author of waverley never included a wish to be acquainted with his whole ancestry     note btombstone to helen walker  on helen

described in this chapter was built by the citizens in 1561 and destined for the accommodation of parliament as well as of the high courts of justice and at the same time for the confinement of prisoners for debt or on criminal charges since the year 1640 when the present parliament house was erected the tolbooth was occupied as a prison only   this is not so certain few persons now living are likely to remember the interior  of the old tolbooth with narrow staircase thick walls and small apartments  nor to imagine that it could ever have been used for these purposes robert chambers  in his minor antiquities of edinburgh has preserved groundplans or sections  which clearly show thisthe largest hall was on the second floor and measuring 27  feet by 20 and 12 feet high it may have been intended for the meetings of town  council while the parliament assembled after 1560 in what was called the upper  tolbooth that is the southwest portion of the collegiate church of st giles until  the year 1640 when the present parliament house was completed being no  longer required for such a purpose it was set apart by the town council on the  24th december 1641 as a distinct church with the name of the tolbooth parish  and therefore could not have derived the name from its vicinity to the tolbooth as  usually stated  gloomy and dismal as it was the situation in the centre of the high street rendered it so particularly wellaired that when the plague laid waste the city in 1645 it affected none within these melancholy precincts the tolbooth was removed with the mass of buildings in which it was incorporated in the autumn of the year 1817 at that time the kindness of his old schoolfellow and friend robert johnstone esquire then dean of guild of the city with the liberal acquiescence of the persons who had contracted for the work procured for the author of waverley the stones which composed the gateway together with the door and its ponderous fastenings which he employed in decorating the entrance of his kitchencourt at abbotsford to such base offices may we return the application of these relies of the heart of midlothian to serve as the posterngate to a court of modern offices may be justly ridiculed as whimsical but yet it is not without interest that we see the gateway through which so much of the stormy politics of a rude age and the vice and misery of later times had found their passage now occupied in the service of rural economy last year to complete the change a tomtit was pleased to build her nest within the lock of the tolbootha strong temptation to have committed a sonnet had the author like tony lumpkin been in a concatenation accordingly  it is worth mentioning that an act of beneficence celebrated the demolition of the

few or none transferred to the new place of confinement  the figure of a heart upon the pavement between st giless church and the edinburgh county hall now marks the site of the old tolbooth     note dthe porteous mob  the following interesting and authentic account of the inquiries made by crown counsel into the affair of the porteous mob seems to have been drawn up by the solicitorgeneral the office was held in 1737 by charles erskine esq  i owe this curious illustration to the kindness of a professional friend it throws indeed little light on the origin of the tumult but shows how profound the darkness must have been which so much investigation could not dispel  upon the 7th of september last when the unhappy wicked murder of captain porteus was committed his majestys advocate and solicitor were out of town the first beyond inverness and the other in annandale not far from carlyle neither of them knew anything of the reprieve nor did they in the least suspect that any disorder was to happen  when the disorder happened the magistrates and other persons concerned in the management of the town seemed to be all struck of a heap and whether from the great terror that had seized all the inhabitants they thought ane immediate enquiry would be fruitless or whether being a direct insult upon the prerogative of the crown they did not care rashly to intermeddle but no proceedings was had by them only soon after ane express was sent to his majesties solicitor who came to town as soon as was possible for him but in the meantime the persons who had been most guilty had either ran off or at least kept themselves upon the wing until they should see what steps were taken by the government  when the solicitor arrived he perceived the whole inhabitants under a consternation he had no materials furnished him nay the inhabitants were so much afraid of being reputed informers that very few people had so much as the courage to speak with him on the streets however having received her majesties orders by a letter from the duke of new castle he resolved to sett about the matter in earnest and entered upon ane enquiry gropeing in the dark he had no assistance from the magistrates worth mentioning but called witness after witness in the privatest manner before himself in his own house and for six weeks time from morning to evening went on in the enquiry without taking the least diversion or turning his thoughts to any other business  he tried at first what he could do by declarations by engaging secresy so that those who told the truth should never be discovered made use of no clerk but wrote all the declarations with his own hand to encourage them to speak out after all for some time he could get nothing but ends of stories which when pursued broke off and those who appeared and knew anything of the matter were under the utmost terror lest it should take air that they had mentioned any one man as guilty  during the course of the enquiry the run of the town which was strong for the villanous actors begun to alter a little and when they saw the kings servants in earnest to do their best the generality who before had spoke very warmly in defence of the wickedness began to be silent and at that period more of the criminals began to abscond  at length the enquiry began to open a little and the sollicitor was under some difficulty how to proceed he very well saw that the first warrand that was issued out would start the whole gang and as he had not come at any of the most notorious offenders he was unwilling upon the slight evidence he had to begin however upon notice given him by generall moyle that one king a butcher in the canongate had boasted in presence of bridget knell a soldiers wife the morning after captain porteus was hanged that he had a very active hand in the mob a warrand was issued out and king was apprehended and imprisoned in the canongate tolbooth  this obliged the sollicitor immediately to take up those against whom he had any information by a signed declaration william stirling apprentice to james stirling merchant in edinburgh was charged as haveing been at the netherbow after the gates were shutt with a lochaberax or halbert in his hand and haveing begun a huzza marched upon the head of the mob towards the guard  james braidwood son to a candlemaker in town was by a signed declaration charged as haveing been at the tolbooth door giveing directions to the mob about setting fire to the door and that the mob named him by his name and asked his advice  by another declaration one stoddart a journeyman smith was charged of having boasted publickly in a smiths shop at leith that he had assisted in breaking open the tolbooth door  peter traill a journeyman wright by one of the declarations was also accused of haveing lockt the netherbow port when it was shutt by the mob  his majesties sollicitor having these informations implored privately such persons as he could best rely on and the truth was there were very few in whom he could repose confidence but he was indeed faithfully served by one webster a soldier in the welsh fuzileers recommended him by lieutenant alshton who with very great address informed himself and really run some risque in getting his information concerning the places where the persons informed against used to haunt and how they might be seized in consequence of which a party of the guard from the canongate was agreed on to march up at a certain hour when a message should be sent the sollicitor wrote a letter and gave it to one of the town officers ordered to attend captain maitland one of the town captains promoted to that command since the unhappy accident who indeed was extremely diligent and active throughout the whole and haveing got stirling and braidwood apprehended dispatched the officer with the letter to the military in the canongate who immediately begun their march and by the time the sollicitor had half examined the said two persons in the burrowroom where the magistrates were present a party of fifty men drums beating marched into the parliament close and drew up which was the first thing that struck a terror and from that time forward the insolence was succeeded by fear  stirling and braidwood were immediately sent to the castle and imprisoned that same night stoddart the smith was seized and he was committed to the castle also as was likewise traill the journeyman wright who were all severally examined and denyed the least accession  in the meantime the enquiry was going on and it haveing cast up in one of the declarations that a humpd backed creature marched with a gun as one of the guards to porteus when he went up to the lawn markett the person who emitted this declaration was employed to walk the streets to see if he could find him out at last he came to the sollicitor and told him he had found him and that he was in a certain house whereupon a warrand was issued out against him and he was apprehended and sent to the castle and he proved to be one birnie a helper to the countess of weemyss coachman  thereafter ane information was given in against william mlauchlan ffootman to the said countess he haveing been very active in the mob ffor sometime he kept himself out of the way but at last he was apprehended and likewise committed to the castle  and these were all the prisoners who were putt under confinement in that place  there were other persons imprisoned in the tolbooth of edinburgh and severalls against whom warrands were issued but could not be apprehended whose names and cases shall afterwards be more particularly taken notice of  the ffriends of stirling made an application to the earl of islay lord justicegenerall setting furth that he was seized with a bloody fflux that his life was in danger and that upon ane examination of witnesses whose names were given in it would appear to conviction that he had not the least access to any of the riotous proceedings of that wicked mob  this petition was by his lordship putt in the hands of his majesties sollicitor who examined the witnesses and by their testimonies it appeared that the young man who was not above eighteen years of age was that night in company with about half a dozen companions in a public house in stephen laws closs near the back of the guard where they all remained untill the noise came to the house that the mob had shut the gates and seized the guard upon which the company broke up and he and one of his companions went towards his masters house and in the course of the after examination there was a witness who declared nay indeed swore for the sollicitor by this time saw it necessary to put those he examined upon oath that he met him stirling after he entered into the alley where his master lives going towards his house and another witness fellowprentice with stirling declares that after the mob had seized the guard he went home where he found stirling before him and that his master lockt the door and kept them both at home till after twelve at night upon weighing of which testimonies and upon consideration had that he was charged by the declaration only of one person who really did not appear to be a witness of the greatest weight and that his life was in danger from the imprisonment he was admitted to baill by the lord justicegenerall by whose warrand he was committed  braidwoods friends applyed in the same manner but as he stood charged by more than one witness he was not releasedtho indeed the witnesses adduced for him say somewhat in his exculpationthat he does not seem to have been upon any original concert and one of the witnesses says he was along with him at the tolbooth door and refuses what is said against him with regard to his having advised the burning of the tolbooth door but he remains still in prison  as to traill the journeyman wright he is charged by the same witness who declared against stirling and there is none concurrs with him and to say the truth concerning him he seemed to be the most ingenuous of any of them whom the solicitor examined and pointed out a witness by whom one of the first accomplices was discovered and who escaped when the warrand was to be putt in execution against them he positively denys his having shutt the gate and tis thought traill ought to be admitted to baill  as to birnie he is charged only by one witness who had never seen him before nor knew his name so tho i dare say the witness honestly mentioned him tis possible he may be mistaken and in the examination of above 200 witnesses there is no body concurrs with him and he is ane insignificant little creature  with regard to mlauchlan the proof is strong against him by one witness that he acted as a serjeant or sort of commander for some time of a guard that stood cross between the upper end of the luckenbooths and the north side of the street to stop all but friends from going towards the tolbooth and by other witnesses that he was at the tolbooth door with a link in his hand while the operation of beating and burning it was going on that he went along with the mob with a halbert in his hand untill he came to the gallows stone in the grassmarket and that he stuck the halbert into the hole of the gallows stone that afterwards he went in amongst the mob when captain porteus was carried to the dyers tree so that the proof seems very heavy against him  to sum up this matter with regard to the prisoners in the castle tis believed there is strong proof against mlauchlan there is also proof against braidwood but as it consists only in emission of words said to have been had by him while at the tolbooth door and that he is ane insignificant pitifull creature and will find people to swear heartily in his favours tis at best doubtfull whether a jury will be got to condemn him  as to those in the tolbooth of edinburgh john crawford who had for some time been employed to ring the bells in the steeple of the new church of edinburgh being in company with a soldier accidentally the discourse falling in concerning the captain porteus and his murder as he appears to be a lightheaded fellow he said that he knew people that were more guilty than any that were putt in prison upon this information crawford was seized and being examined it appeared that when the mob begun as he was comeing down from the steeple the mob took the keys from him that he was that night in several corners and did indeed delate severall persons whom he saw there and immediately warrands were despatched and it was found they had absconded and fled but there was no evidence against him of any kind nay on the contrary it appeared that he had been with the magistrates in clerks the vintners relating to them what he had seen in the streets therefore after haveing detained him in prison ffor a very considerable time his majesties advocate and sollicitor signed a warrand for his liberation  there was also one james wilson incarcerated in the said tolbooth upon the declaration of one witness who said he saw him on the streets with a gun and there he remained for some time in order to try if a concurring witness could be found or that he acted any part in the tragedy and wickedness but nothing farther appeared against him and being seized with a severe sickness he is by a warrand signed by his majesties advocate and sollicitor liberated upon giveing sufficient baill  as to king enquiry was made and the ffact comes out beyond all exception that he was in the lodge at the netherbow with lindsay the waiter and several other people not at all concerned in the mob but after the affair was over he went up towards the guard and having met with sandie the turk and his wife who escaped out of prison they returned to his house at the abbey and then tis very possible he may have thought fitt in his beer to boast of villany in which he could not possibly have any share for that reason he was desired to find baill and he should be set at liberty but he is a stranger and a fellow of very indifferent character and tis believed it wont be easy for him to find baill wherefore its thought he must be sett at liberty without it because he is a burden upon the government while kept in confinement not being able to maintain himself  what is above is all that relates to persons in custody but there are warrands out against a great many other persons who had fled particularly against one william white a journeyman baxter who by the evidence appears to have been at the beginning of the mob and to have gone along with the drum from the westport to the netherbow and is said to have been one of those who attacked the guard and probably was as deep as any one there  information was given that he was lurking at falkirk where he was born whereupon directions were sent to the sheriff of the county and a warrand from his excellency generall wade to the commanding officers at stirling and linlithgow to assist and all possible endeavours were used to catch hold of him and tis said he escaped very narrowly having been concealed in some outhouse and the misfortune was that those who were employed in the search did not know him personally nor indeed was it easy to trust any of the acquaintances of so low obscure a fellow with the secret of the warrand to be putt in execution  there was also strong evidence found against robert taylor servant to william and charles thomsons periwigmakers that he acted as ane officer among the mob and he was traced from the guard to the well at the head of foresters wynd where he stood and had the appellation of captain from the mob and from that walking down the bow before captain porteus with his lochaber axe and by the description given of one who hawld the rope by which captain porteus was pulled up tis believed taylor was the person and tis farther probable that the witness who debated stirling had mistaken taylor for him their stature and age so far as can be gathered from the description being the same  a great deal of pains were taken and no charge was saved in order to have catched hold of this taylor and warrands were sent to the country where he was born but it appears he had shipt himself off for holland where it is said he now is  there is strong evidence also against thomas burns butcher that he was ane active person from the beginning of the mob to the end of it he lurkt for some time amongst those of his trade and artfully enough a train was laid to catch him under pretence of a message that had come from his father in ireland so that he came to a blind alehouse in the fleshmarket close and a party being ready was by webster the soldier who was upon this exploit advertised to come down however burns escaped out at a backwindow and hid himself in some of the houses which are heaped together upon one another in that place so that it was not possible to catch him tis now said he is gone to ireland to his father who lives there  there is evidence also against one robert anderson journeyman and servant to colin alison wright and against thomas linnen and james maxwell both servants also to the said colin alison who all seem to have been deeply concerned in the matter anderson is one of those who putt the rope upon captain porteuss neck linnen seems also to have been very active and maxwell which is pretty remarkable is proven to have come to a shop upon the friday before and charged the journeymen and prentices there to attend in the parliament close on tuesday night to assist to hang captain porteus these three did early abscond and though warrands had been issued out against them and all endeavours used to apprehend them could not be found  one waldie a servant to george campbell wright has also absconded and many others and tis informed that numbers of them have shipt themselves off ffor the plantations and upon an information that a ship was going off ffrom glasgow in which severall of the rogues were to transport themselves beyond seas proper warrands were obtained and persons despatched to search the said ship and seize any that can be found  the like warrands had been issued with regard to ships from leith but whether they had been scard or whether the information had been groundless they had no effect  this is a summary of the enquiry ffrom which it appears there is no prooff on which one can rely but against mlauchlan there is a prooff also against braidwood but more exceptionable his majesties advocate since he came to town has joind with the sollicitor and has done his utmost to gett at the bottom of this matter but hitherto it stands as is above represented they are resolved to have their eyes and their ears open and to do what they can but they laboured exceedingly against the stream and it may truly be said that nothing was wanting on their part nor have they declined any labour to answer the commands laid upon them to search the matter to the bottom    the porteous mob  in the preceding chapters i to vi the circumstances of that extraordinary riot and conspiracy called the porteous mob are given with as much accuracy as the author was able to collect them the order regularity and determined resolution with which such a violent action was devised and executed were only equalled by the secrecy which was observed concerning the principal actors  although the fact was performed by torchlight and in presence of a great multitude to some of whom at least the individual actors must have been known yet no discovery was ever made concerning any of the perpetrators of the slaughter  two men only were brought to trial for an offence which the government were so anxious to detect and punish william mlauchlan footman to the countess of wemyss who is mentioned in the report of the solicitorgeneral against whom strong evidence had been obtained was brought to trial in march 1737 charged as having been accessory to the riot armed with a lochaber axe but this man who was at all times a silly creature proved that he was in a state of mortal intoxication during the time he was present with the rabble incapable of giving them either advice or assistance or indeed of knowing what he or they were doing he was also able to prove that he was forced into the riot and upheld while there by two bakers who put a lochaber axe into his hand the jury wisely judging this poor creature could be no proper subject of punishment found the panel not guilty the same verdict was given in the case of thomas linning also mentioned in the solicitors memorial who was tried in 1738 in short neither then nor for a long period afterwards was anything discovered relating to the organisation of the porteous plot  the imagination of the people of edinburgh was long irritated and their curiosity kept awake by the mystery attending this extraordinary conspiracy it was generally reported of such natives of edinburgh as having left the city in youth returned with a fortune amassed in foreign countries that they had originally fled on account of their share in the porteous mob but little credit can be attached to these surmises as in most of the cases they are contradicted by dates and in none supported by anything but vague rumours grounded on the ordinary wish of the vulgar to impute the success of prosperous men to some unpleasant source the secret history of the porteous mob has been till this day unravelled and it has always been quoted as a close daring and calculated act of violence of a nature peculiarly characteristic of the scottish people  nevertheless the author for a considerable time nourished hopes to have found himself enabled to throw some light on this mysterious story an old man who died about twenty years ago at the advanced age of ninetythree was said to have made a communication to the clergyman who attended upon his deathbed respecting the origin of the porteous mob this person followed the trade of a carpenter and had been employed as such on the estate of a family of opulence and condition his character in his line of life and amongst his neighbours was excellent and never underwent the slightest suspicion his confession was said to have been to the following purpose that he was one of twelve young men belonging to the village of pathhead whose animosity against porteous on account of the execution of wilson was so extreme that they resolved to execute vengeance on him with their own hands rather than he should escape punishment with this resolution they crossed the forth at different ferries and rendezvoused at the suburb called portsburgh where their appearance in a body soon called numbers around them the public mind was in such a state of irritation that it only wanted a single spark to create an explosion and this was afforded by the exertions of the small and determined band of associates the appearance of premeditation and order which distinguished the riot according to his account had its origin not in any previous plan or conspiracy but in the character of those who were engaged in it the story also serves to show why nothing of the origin of the riot has ever been discovered since though in itself a great conflagration its source according to this account was from an obscure and apparently inadequate cause  i have been disappointed however in obtaining the evidence on which this story rests the present proprietor of the estate on which the old man died a particular friend of the author undertook to question the son of the deceased on the subject this person follows his fathers trade and holds the employment of carpenter to the same family he admits that his fathers going abroad at the time of the porteous mob was popularly attributed to his having been concerned in that affair but adds that so far as is known to him the old man had never made any confession to that effect and on the contrary had uniformly denied being present my kind friend therefore had recourse to a person from whom he had formerly heard the story but who either from respect to an old friends memory or from failure of his own happened to have forgotten that ever such a communication was made so my obliging correspondent who is a foxhunter wrote to me that he was completely planted and all that can be said with respect to the tradition is that it certainly once existed and was generally believed  nbthe rev dr carlyle minister of inveresk in his autobiography gives some interesting particulars

actions and opinions of the cameronians he resided while stationary at the bristo port of edinburgh but was by trade an itinerant merchant or pedlar which profession he seems to have exercised in ireland as well as britain he composed biographical notices of alexander peden john semple john welwood and richard cameron all ministers of the cameronian persuasion to which the last mentioned

persecuted class is to be gathered walker writes with a simplicity which sometimes slides into the burlesque and sometimes attains a tone of simple pathos but always expressing the most daring confidence in his own correctness of creed and sentiments sometimes with narrowminded and disgusting bigotry his turn for the marvellous was that of his time and sect but there is little room to doubt his veracity concerning whatever he quotes on his own knowledge his small tracts now bring a very high price especially the earlier and authentic editions the tirade against dancing pronounced by david deans is as intimated in the text partly borrowed from peter walker he notices as a foul reproach upon the name of richard cameron that his memory was vituperated by pipers and fiddlers playing the cameronian marchcarnal vain springs which too many professors of religion dance to a practice unbecoming the professors of christianity to dance to any spring but somewhat more to this whatever he proceeds be the many foul blots recorded of the saints in scripture none of them is charged with this regular fit of distraction we find it has been practised by the wicked and profane as the dancing at that brutish base action of the calfmaking and it had been good for that unhappy lass who danced off the head of john the baptist that she had been born a cripple and never drawn a limb to her historians say that her sin was written upon her judgment who some time thereafter was dancing upon the ice and it broke and snapt the head off her her head danced above and her feet beneath there is ground to think and conclude that when the worlds wickedness was great dancing at their marriages was practised but when the heavens above and the earth beneath were let loose upon them with that overflowing flood their mirth was soon staid and when the lord in holy justice rained fire and brimstone from heaven upon that wicked people and city sodom enjoying fulness of bread and idleness their fiddlestrings and hands went all in a flame and the whole people in thirty miles of length and ten of breadth as historians say were all made to fry in their skins and at the end whoever are giving in

and heaven at the hinder end but fye upon the knave death that will seize upon those bodies of yours and where will all your fiddling and flinging be then dancing being such a common evil especially

me by my worthy friend captain george burton and attested under his hand and is as follows  about fifteen years since having business that detained me for some time in leith which is near edenborough in the kingdom of scotland i often met some of my acquaintance at a certain house there where we used to drink a glass of wine for our refection the woman which kept the house was of honest reputation amongst the neighbours which made me give the more attention to what she told me one day about a fairy boy as they called him who lived about that town she had given me so strange an account of him that i desired her i might see him the first opportunity which she promised and not long after passing that way she told me there was the fairy boy but a little before i came by and casting her eye into the street said look you sir yonder he is at play with those other boys and designing him to me i went and by smooth words and a piece of money got him to come into the house with me where in the presence of divers people i demanded of him several astrological questions which he answered with great subtility and through all his discourse carried it with a cunning much beyond his years which seemed not to exceed ten or eleven he seemed to make a motion like drumming upon the table with his fingers upon which i asked him whether he could beat a drum to which he replied yes sir as well as any man in scotland for every thursday night i beat all points to a sort of people that use to meet under yon hill pointing to the great hill between edenborough and leith how boy quoth i what company have you therethere are sir said he a great company both of men and women and they are entertained with many sorts of music besides my drum they have besides plenty variety of meats and wine and many times we are carried into france or holland in a night and return again and whilst we are there we enjoy all the pleasures the country doth afford i demanded of him how they got under that hill to which he replied that there were a great pair of gates that opened to them though they were invisible to others and that within there were brave large rooms as well accommodated as most in scotland i then asked him how i should know what he said to be true upon which he told me he would read my fortune saying i should have two wives and that he saw the forms of them sitting on my shoulders that both would be very handsome women  as he was thus speaking a woman of the neighbourhood coming into the room demanded of him what her fortune should be he told her that she had two bastards before she was married which put her in such a rage that she desired not to hear the rest the woman of the house told me that all the people in scotland could not keep him from the rendezvous on thursday night upon which by promising him some more money i got a promise of him to meet me at the same place in the afternoon of the thursday following and so dismissed him at that time the boy came again at the place and time appointed and i had prevailed with some friends to continue with me if possible to prevent his moving that night he was placed between us and answered many questions without offering to go from us until about eleven of the clock he was got away unperceived of the company but i suddenly missing him hasted to the door and took hold of him and so returned him into the same room we all watched him and on a sudden he was again out of the doors i followed him close and he made a noise in the street as if he had been set upon but from that time i could never see him

temptations to commit the offence and the difficulty of discovery enacted a certain set of presumptions which in the absence of direct proof the jury were directed to receive as evidence of the crime having actually been committed the circumstances selected for this purpose were that the woman should have concealed her situation during the whole period of pregnancy that she should not have called for help at her delivery and that combined with these grounds of suspicion the child should be either found dead or be altogether missing many persons suffered death during the last century under this severe act but during the authors memory a more lenient course was followed and the female accused under the act and conscious of no competent defence usually lodged a petition to the court of justiciary denying for forms sake the tenor of the indictment but stating that as her good name had been destroyed by the charge she was willing to submit to sentence of banishment to which the crown counsel usually consented this lenity in practice and the comparative infrequency of the crime since the doom of public ecclesiastical penance has been generally dispensed with have led to the abolition of the statute of william and mary which is now replaced by another imposing banishment in those circumstances in which the crime was formerly capital this alteration took place in 1803

evidence on the point required his soninlaw a clergyman in amsterdam and his daughter were suspected by graves to have used arguments with the witness to dissuade him from giving his testimony on which subject the journal of the bow street officer proceeds thus  saw then a manifest reluctance in mr  and had no doubt the daughter and parson would endeavour to persuade him to decline troubling himself in the matter but judged he could not go back from what he had said to mr richnota bene no mischief but a woman or a priest in ithere both     note msir william dick of braid  this gentleman formed a striking example of the instability of human prosperity he was once the wealthiest man of his time in scotland a merchant in an extensive line of commerce and a farmer of the public revenue insomuch that about 1640 he estimated his fortune at two hundred thousand pounds sterling sir william dick was a zealous covenanter and in the memorable year 1641 he lent the scottish convention of estates one hundred thousand merks at once and thereby enabled them to support and pay their army which must otherwise have broken to pieces he afterwards advanced l20000 for the service of king charles during the usurpation and having by owning the royal cause provoked the displeasure of the ruling party he was fleeced of more money amounting in all to l65000 sterling  being in this manner reduced to indigence he went to london to try to recover some part of the sums which had been lent on government security instead of receiving any satisfaction the scottish croesus was thrown into prison in which he died 19th december 1655 it is said his death was hastened by the want of common necessaries but this statement is somewhat exaggerated if it be true as is commonly said that though he was not supplied with bread he had plenty of piecrust thence called sir william dicks necessity  the changes of fortune are commemorated in a folio pamphlet entitled the lamentable estate and distressed case of sir william dick lond 1656 it contains three copperplates one representing sir william on horseback and attended with guards as lord provost of edinburgh superintending the unloading of one of his rich argosies a second exhibiting him as arrested and in the hands of the bailiffs a third presents him dead in prison the tract is esteemed highly valuable by collectors of prints the only copy i ever saw upon sale was rated at l30 in london sales copies have varied in price from l15 to l52 10s     note ndoomster or dempster of court  the name of this officer is equivalent to the pronouncer of doom or sentence in this comprehensive sense the judges of the isle of man were called dempsters but in scotland the word was long restricted to the designation of an official person whose duty it was to recite the sentence after it had been pronounced by the court and recorded by the clerk on which occasion the dempster legalised it by the words of form and this i pronounce for doom for a length of years the office as mentioned in the text was held in commendam with that of the executioner for when this odious but necessary officer of justice received his appointment he petitioned the court of justiciary to be received as their dempster which was granted as a matter of course  the production of the executioner in open court and in presence of the wretched criminal had something in it hideous and disgusting to the more refined feelings of later times but if an old tradition of the parliament house of edinburgh may be trusted it was the following anecdote which occasioned the disuse of the dempsters office  it chanced at one time that the office of public executioner was vacant there was occasion for some one to act as dempster and considering the party who generally held the office it is not wonderful that a locum tenens was hard to be found at length one hume who had been sentenced to transportation for an attempt to burn his own house was induced to consent that he would pronounce the doom on this occasion but when brought forth to officiate instead of repeating the doom to the criminal mr hume addressed himself to their lordships in a bitter complaint of the injustice of his own sentence it was in vain that he was interrupted and reminded of the purpose for which he had come hither i ken what ye want of me weel eneugh said the fellow ye want me to be your dempster but i am come to be none of your dempster i am come to summon you lord t and you lord e to answer at the bar of another world for the injustice you have done me in this in short hume had only made a pretext of complying with the proposal in order to have an opportunity of reviling the judges to their faces or giving them in the phrase of his country a sloan he was hurried off amid the laughter of the audience but the indecorous scene which had taken place contributed to the abolition of the office of dempster the sentence is now read over by the clerk of court and the formality of pronouncing doom is altogether omitted  the usage of calling the dempster into court by the ringing of a handbell to repeat the sentence on a criminal is said to have been abrogated in march 1773     note ojohn duke of argyle and greenwich  this nobleman was very dear to his countrymen who were justly proud of his military and political talents and grateful for the ready zeal with which he asserted the rights of his native country this was never more conspicuous than in the matter of the porteous mob when the ministers brought in a violent and vindictive bill for declaring the lord provost of edinburgh incapable of bearing any public office in future for not foreseeing a disorder which no one foresaw or interrupting the course of a riot too formidable to endure opposition the same bill made provision for pulling down the city gates and abolishing the city guardrather a hibernian mode of enabling their better to keep the peace within burgh in future  the duke of argyle opposed this bill as a cruel unjust and fanatical proceeding and an encroachment upon the privileges of the royal burghs of scotland secured to them by the treaty of union in all the proceedings of that time said his grace the nation of scotland treated with the english as a free and independent people and as that treaty my lords had no other guarantee for the due performance of its articles but the faith and honour of a british parliament it would be both unjust and ungenerous should this house agree to any proceedings that have a tendency to injure it  lord hardwicke in reply to the duke of argyle seemed to insinuate that his grace had taken up the affair in a party point of view to which the nobleman replied in the spirited language quoted in the text lord hardwicke apologised the bill was much modified and the clauses concerning the dismantling the city and disbanding the guard were departed from a fine of l2000 was imposed on the city for the benefit of porteouss widow she was contented to accept threefourths of the sum the payment of which closed the transaction it is remarkable that in our day the magistrates of edinburgh have had recourse to both those measures hold in such horror by their predecessors as necessary steps for the improvement of the city  it may be here noticed in explanation of another circumstance mentioned in the text that there is a tradition in scotland that george ii whose irascible temper is said sometimes to have hurried him into expressing his displeasure par voie du fait offered to the duke of argyle in angry audience some menace of this nature on which he left the presence in high disdain and with little ceremony sir robert walpole having met the duke as he retired and learning the cause of his resentment and discomposure endeavoured to reconcile him to what had happened by saying such was his majestys way and that he often took such liberties with himself without meaning any harm this did not mend matters in maccallummores eyes who replied in great disdain you will please to remember sir robert the infinite distance there is betwixt you and me another frequent expression of passion on the part of the same monarch is alluded to in the old jacobite song                     the fire shall get both hat and wig                    as ofttimes theyve got a that     note pexpulsion of the bishops from the scottish convention  for some time after the scottish convention had commenced its sittings the scottish prelates retained their seats and said prayers by rotation to the meeting until the character of the convention became through the secession of dundee decidedly presbyterian occasion was then taken on the bishop of ross mentioning king james in his prayer as him for whom they watered their couch with tears on this the convention exclaimed they had no occasion for spiritual lords and commanded the bishops to depart and return no more montgomery of skelmorley breaking at the same time a coarse jest upon the scriptural expression used by the prelate davie deanss oracle patrick walker gives this account of their dismission  when they came out some of the convention said they wished the honest lads knew they were put out for then they would not get away with haill whole gowns all the fourteen gathered together with pale faces and stood in a cloud in the parliament close james wilson robert neilson francis hislop and myself were standing close by them francis hislop with force thrust robert neilson upon them their heads went hard on one another but there being so many enemies in the city fretting and gnashing the teeth waiting for an occasion to raise a mob when undoubtedly blood would have been shed and having laid down conclusions amongst ourselves to avoid giving the least occasion to all mobs kept us from tearing off their gowns  their graceless graces went quickly off and there was neither bishop nor curate seen in the streetthis was a surprising sudden change not to be forgotten some of us would have rejoiced near them in large sums to have seen these bishops sent legally down the bow that they might have found the weight of their tails in a tow to dry their towsoles that they might know what hanging was they having been active for themselves and the main instigators to all the mischiefs cruelties and bloodshed

author would appear to be alluding to another character who went by the name of saut maggie and is represented in one or more old etchings about 1790     note rmadge wildfire  in taking leave of the poor maniac the author may here observe that the first conception of the character though afterwards greatly altered was taken from that of a person calling herself and called by others feckless fannie weak or feeble fannie who always travelled with a small flock of sheep the following account furnished by the persevering kindness of mr train contains probably all that can now be known of her history though many among whom is the author may remember having heard of feckless fannie in the days of their youth  my leisure hours says mr train for some time past have been mostly spent in searching for particulars relating to the maniac called feckless fannie who travelled over all scotland and england between the years 1767 and 1775 and whose history is altogether so like a romance that i have been at all possible pains to collect every particular that can be found relative to her in galloway or in ayrshire  when feckless fannie appeared in ayrshire for the first time in the summer of 1769 she attracted much notice from being attended by twelve or thirteen sheep who seemed all endued with faculties so much superior to the ordinary race of animals of the same species as to excite universal astonishment she had for each a different name to which it answered when called by its mistress and would likewise obey in the most surprising manner any command she thought proper to give when travelling she always walked in front of her flock and they followed her closely behind when she lay down at night in the fields for she would never enter into a house they always disputed who should lie next to her by which means she was kept warm while she lay in the midst of them when she attempted to rise from the ground an old ram whose name was charlie always claimed the sole right of assisting her pushing any that stood in his way aside until he arrived right before his mistress he then bowed his head nearly to the ground that she might lay her hands on his horns which were very large he then lifted her gently from the ground by raising his head if she chanced to leave her flock feeding as soon as they discovered she was gone they all began to bleat most piteously and would continue to do so till she returned they would then testify their joy by rubbing their sides against her petticoat and frisking about  feckless fannie was not like most other demented creatures fond of fine dress on her head she wore an old slouched hat over her shoulders an old plaid and carried always in her hand a shepherds crook with any of these articles she invariably declared she would not part for any consideration whatever when she was interrogated why she set so much value on things seemingly so insignificant she would sometimes relate the history of her misfortune which was briefly as follows  i am the only daughter of a wealthy squire in the north of england but i loved my fathers shepherd and that has been my ruin for my father fearing his family would be disgraced by such an alliance in a passion mortally wounded my lover with a shot from a pistol i arrived just in time to receive the last blessing of the dying man and to close his eyes in death he bequeathed me his little all but i only accepted these sheep to be my sole companions through life and this hat this plaid and this crook all of which i will carry until i descend into the grave  this is the substance of a ballad eightyfour lines of which i copied down lately from the recitation of an old woman in this place who says she has seen it in print with a plate on the titlepage representing fannie with her sheep behind her as this ballad is said to have been written by lowe the author of marys dream i am surprised that it has not been noticed by cromek in his remains of nithsdale and galloway song but he perhaps thought it unworthy of a place in his collection as there is very little merit in the composition which want of room prevents me from transcribing at present but if i thought you had never seen it i would take an early opportunity of doing so  after having made the tour of galloway in 1769 as fannie was wandering in the neighbourhood of moffat on her way to edinburgh where i am informed she was likewise well known old charlie her favourite ram chanced to break into a kaleyard which the proprietor observing let loose a mastiff that hunted the poor sheep to death this was a sad misfortune it seemed to renew all the pangs which she formerly felt on the death of her lover she would not part from the side of her old friend for several days and it was with much difficulty she consented to allow him to be buried but still wishing to pay a tribute to his memory she covered his grave with moss and fenced it round with osiers and annually returned to the same spot and pulled the weeds from the grave and repaired the fence this is altogether like a romance but i believe it is really true that she did so the grave of charlie is still held sacred even by the schoolboys of the present day in that quarter it is now perhaps the only instance of the law of kenneth being attended to which says the grave where anie that is slaine lieth buried leave untilled for seven years repute every grave holie so as thou be well advised that in no wise with thy feet thou tread upon it  through the storms of winter as well as in the milder seasons of the year she continued her wandering course nor could she be prevented from doing so either by entreaty or promise of reward the late dr fullarton of rosemount in the neighbourhood of ayr being well acquainted with her father when in england endeavoured in a severe season by every means in his power to detain her at rosemount for a few days until the weather should become more mild but when she found herself rested a little and saw her sheep fed she raised her crook which was the signal she always gave for the sheep to follow her and off they all marched together  but the hour of poor fannies dissolution was now at hand and she seemed anxious to arrive at the spot where she was to terminate her mortal career she proceeded to glasgow and while passing through that city a crowd of idle boys attracted by her singular appearance together with the novelty of seeing so many sheep obeying her command began to ferment her with their pranks till she became so irritated that she pelted them with bricks and stones which they returned in such a manner that she was actually stoned to death between glasgow and anderston  to the real history of this singular individual credulity has attached several superstitious appendages it is said that the farmer who was the cause of charlies death shortly afterwards drowned himself in a peathag and that the hand with which a butcher in kilinarnock struck one of the other sheep became powerless and withered to the very bone in the summer of 1769 when she was passing by new cumnock a young man whose name was william forsyth son of a farmer in the same parish plagued her so much that she wished he might never see the morn upon which he went home and hanged himself in his fathers barn and i doubt not that many such stories may yet be remembered in other parts where she had been  so far mr train the author can only add to this narrative that feckless fannie and her little flock were well known in the pastoral districts in attempting to introduce such a character into fiction the author felt the risk of encountering a comparison with the maria of sterne and besides the mechanism of the story would have been as much retarded by feckless fannies flock as the night march of don quixote was delayed by sanchos tale of the sheep that were ferried over the river  the author has only to add that notwithstanding the preciseness of his friend mr trains statement there may be some hopes that the outrage on feckless fannie and her little flock was not carried to extremity there is no mention of any trial on account of it which had it occurred in the manner stated would have certainly taken place and the author has understood that it was on the border she was last seen about the skirts of the cheviot hills but without her little flock     note sdeath of francis gordon  this exploit seems to have been one in which patrick walker prided himself not a little and there is reason to fear that that excellent person would have highly resented the attempt to associate another with him in the slaughter of a kings lifeguardsman indeed he would have had the more right to be offended at losing any share of the glory since the party against gordon was already three to one besides having the advantage of firearms the manner in which he vindicates his claim to the exploit without committing himself by a direct statement of it is not a little amusing it is as follows  i shall give a brief and true account of that mans death which i did not design to do while i was upon the stage i resolve indeed if it be the lords will to leave a more full account of that and many other remarkable steps of the lords dispensations towards me through my life it was then commonly said that francis gordon was a volunteer out of wickedness of principles and could not stay with the troop but was still raging and ranging to catch hiding suffering people meldrum and airlys troops lying at lanark upon the first day of march 1682 mr gordon and another wicked comrade with their two servants and four horses came to kilcaigow two miles from lanark searching for william caigow and others under hiding  mr gordon rambling throw the town offered to abuse the women at night they came a mile further to the easterseat to robert muirs he being also under hiding gordons comrade and the two servants went to bed but he could sleep none roaring all night for women when day came he took only his sword in his hand and came to mossplatt and some new men who had been in the fields all night seeing him they fled and he pursued james wilson thomas young and myself having been in a meeting all night were lying down in the morning we were alarmed thinking there were many more than one he pursued hard and overtook us thomas young said sir what do ye pursue us for he said he was come to send us to hell james wilson said that shall not be for we will defend ourselves he said that either he or we should go to it now he run his sword furiously throw james wilsons coat james fired upon him but missed him all this time he cried damn his soul he got a shot in his head out of a pocketpistol rather fit for diverting a boy than killing such a furious mad brisk man which notwithstanding killed him dead the foresaid william caigow and robert muir came to us we searched him for papers and found a long scroll of sufferers names either to kill or take i tore it all in pieces he had also some popish books and bonds of money with one dollar which a poor man took off the ground all which we put in his pocket again thus he was four miles from lanark and near a mile from his comrade seeking his own death and got it and for as much as we have been condemned for this i could never see how any one could condemn us that allows of selfdefence which the laws both of god and nature allow to every creature for my own part my heart never smote me for this when i saw his blood run i wished that all the blood of the lords stated and avowed enemies in scotland had been in his veins having such a clear call and opportunity i would have rejoiced to have seen it all gone out with a gush i have many times wondered at the greater part of the indulged lukewarm ministers and professors in that time who made more noise of murder when one of these enemies had been killed even in our own defence than of twenty of us being murdered by them none of these men present was challenged for this but myself thomas young thereafter suffered at mauchline but was not challenged for this robert muir was banished james wilson outlived the persecution williarn caigow died in the canongate tolbooth in the beginning of 1685 mr wodrow is misinformed who says that he suffered unto death     note ttolling to service in scotland  in the old days of scotland when persons of property unless they happened to be nonjurors were as regular as their inferiors in attendance on parochial worship there was a kind of etiquette in waiting till the patron or acknowledged great man of the parish should make his appearance this ceremonial was so sacred in the eyes of a parish beadle in the isle of bute that the kirk bell being out of order he is said to have mounted the steeple every sunday to imitate with his voice the successive summonses which its mouth of metal used to send forth the first part of this imitative harmony was simply the repetition of the words bell bell bell bell two or three times in a manner as much resembling the sound as throat of flesh could imitate throat of iron bellum bellum was sounded forth in a more urgent manner but he never sent forth the third and conclusive peal the varied tone of which is called in scotland the ringingin until the two principal heritors of the parish approached when the chime ran thus                            bellum bellellum                     bernera and knockdows coming                           bellum bellellum                     bernera and knockdows coming  thereby
