roccaleone     chapter i vox populi   from the valley borne aloft on the wings of the evening breeze rose faintly the tolling of an angelus bell and in a goatherds hut on the heights above stood six men with heads uncovered and bowed obeying its summons to evening prayer a brass lamp equipped with three beaks swung from the grimy ceiling and with more smoke than flame shed an indifferent light and yet a more indifferent smell throughout the darkening hovel but it sufficed at least to reveal in the accoutrements and trappings of that company a richness that was the more striking by contrast with the surrounding squalor  as the last stroke of the ave maria faded on the wind that murmured plaintively through the larches of the hillside they piously crossed themselves and leisurely resuming their headgear they looked at one another with questioning glances yet before any could voice the inquiry that was in the minds of all a knock fell upon the rotten timbers of the door  at last exclaimed old fabrizio da lodi in a voice charged with relief whilst a younger man of good shape and gay garments strode to the door in obedience to fabrizios glance and set it wide  across the threshold stepped a tall figure under a wide featherless hat and wrapped in a cloak which he loosened as he entered revealing the very plainest of raiment beneath a leather hacketon was tightened at the waist by a girdle of hammered steel from which depended on his left a long sword with ringed steel quillons whilst from behind his right hip peeped the hilt of a stout pistoja dagger his hose of red cloth vanished into boots of untanned leather laced in front and turned down at the knees and completed in him the general appearance of a mercenary in time of peace in spite of which the six nobles in that place of paradoxes bared their heads anew and stood in attitudes of deferential attention  he paused a moment to throw off his cloak of which the young man who had admitted him hastened to relieve him as readily as if he had been born a servitor he next removed his hat and allowed it to remain slung from his shoulders displaying together with a still youthful countenance of surpassing strength and nobility a mane of jetblack hair coiffed in a broad net of gold threadthe only article of apparel that might have suggested his station to be higher than at first had seemed  he stepped briskly to the coarse and greasestained table about which the company was standing and his black eyes ran swiftly over the faces that confronted him  sirs he said at last i am here my horse went lame a halfleague beyond sant angelo and i was constrained to end the journey on foot  your excellency will be tired cried fabrizio with that ready solicitude which is ever at the orders of the great a cup of puglia wine my lord here fanfulla he called to the young nobleman who had acted as usher but the newcomer silenced him and put the matter aside with a gesture  let that wait time imports as you little dream it may well be illustrious sirs that had i not come thus i had not come at all  how cried one expressing the wonder that rose in every mind even as on every countenance some consternation showed are we betrayed  if you are in case to fear betrayal it may well be my friends as i crossed the bridge over the metauro and took the path that leads hither my eyes were caught by a crimson light shining from a tangle of bushes by the roadside that crimson flame was a reflection of the setting sun flashed from the steel cap of a hidden watcher the path took me nearer and with my hat so set that it might best conceal my face i was all eyes and as i passed the spot where that spy was ambushed i discerned among the leaves that might so well have screened him but that the sun had found his helmet out the evil face of masuccio torri there was a stir among the listeners and their consternation increased whilst one or two changed colour for whom did he wait that was the question that i asked myself and i found the answer that it was for me if i was right he must also know the distance i had come so that he would not look to see me afoot nor yet perhaps in garments such as these and so thanks to all this and to the hat and cloak in which i closely masked myself he let me pass unchallenged  by the virgin exclaimed fabrizio hotly ill swear your conclusions were wrong in all italy it was known to no man beyond us six that you were to meet us here and with my hand upon the gospels i could swear that not one of us has breathed of it  he looked round at his companions as if inviting them to bear out his words and they were not slow to confirm what he had sworn in terms as vehement as his own until in the end the newcomer waved them into silence  nor have i breathed it he assured them for i respected your injunction messer fabrizio stillwhat did masuccio there hidden like a thief by the roadside sirs he continued in a slightly altered tone i know not to what end you have bidden me hither but if aught of treason lurks in your designs i cry you beware the duke has knowledge of it or at least suspicion if that spy was not set to watch for me why then he was set to watch for all that he may anon inform his master what men were present at this meeting  fabrizio shrugged his shoulders in a contemptuous indifference which was voiced by his neighbour ferrabraccio  let him be informed sneered the latter a grim smile upon his rugged face the knowledge will come to him too late  the newcomer threw back his head and a look that was half wonder half enlightenment gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes he took a deep breath  it would seem sirs that i was right said he with a touch of sternness and that treason is indeed your business  my lord of aquila fabrizio answered him we are traitors to a man that we may remain faithful and loyal to a state  what state barked the lord of aquila contemptuously  the duchy of babbiano came the answer  you would be false to the duke that you may be faithful to the duchy he questioned scorn running ever stronger in his voice sirs it is a riddle ill not pretend to solve  there fell a pause in which they eyed one another and their glances were almost as the glances of baffled men they had not looked for such a tone from him and they questioned with their eyes and minds the wisdom of going further at last with a halfsigh fabrizio da lodi turned once more to aquila  lord count he began in a calm impressive voice i am an old man the name i bear and the family from which i spring are honourable alike you cannot think so vilely of me as to opine that in my old age i should do aught to smirch the fair fame of the one or of the other to be named a traitor sir is to be given a harsh title and one i think that could fit no man less than it fits me or any of these my companions will you do me the honour then to hear me out excellency and when you have heard me judge us nay more than judgment we ask of you lord count we ask for guidance that we may save our country from the ruin that threatens it and we promise you that we will take no step that has not your sanctionthat is not urged by you  francesco del falco count of aquila eyed the old noble with a glance that had changed whilst he spoke so that from scornful that it had been it had now grown full of mild wonder and inquiry he slightly inclined his head in token of acquiescence  i beg that you will speak was all he said and fabrizio would forthwith have spoken but that ferrabraccio intervened to demand that aquila should pass them his knightly word not to betray them in the event of his rejection of the proposals they had to make when he had given them his promise and they had seated themselves upon such rude stools as the place afforded fabrizio resumed his office of spokesman and unfolded the business upon which he had invited the count among them  in a brief preamble he touched upon the character of gian maria sforza the reigning duke of babbianoseated upon its throne by his powerful uncle lodovico sforza lord of milan he exposed the mans reckless extravagances his continued selfindulgence his carelessness in matters of statecraft and his apparent disinclination to fulfil the duties which his high station imposed upon him on all this fabrizio touched with most commendable discretion and restraint as was demanded by the circumstance that in francesco del falco he was addressing the dukes own cousin  so far excellency he continued you cannot be in ignorance of the general dissatisfaction prevailing among our most illustrious cousins subjects there was the conspiracy of bacolino a year ago which had it succeeded would have cast us into the hands of florence it failed but another such might not fail again the increased disfavour of his highness may bring more adherents to a fresh conspiracy of this character and we should be lost as an independent state and the peril that menaces us is the peril of being so lost not only by defection of our own but by the force of arms of another that other is caesar borgia his dominion is spreading like a plague upon the face of this italy which he has threatened to eat up like an artichokeleaf by leaf already his greedy eyes are turned upon us and what power have weall unready as we arewherewith successfully to oppose the overwhelming might of the duke of valentinois all this his highness realises for we have made it more than clear to him as we have too made clear the remedy yet does he seem as indifferent to his danger as to his salvation his time is spent in orgies in dancing in hawking and in shameful dalliance and if we dare throw out a word of warning threats and curses are the only answer we receive  da lodi paused as if growing conscious that his manner was becoming overvehement but of this his companions at least were all unconscious for they filled the pause with a murmur of angry confirmation francesco wrinkled his brow and sighed  i amalasmost fully conscious of this danger you speak of butwhat do you expect of me why bear me your grievance i am no statesman  here is no statesman needed lord it is a soldier babbiano requires a martial spirit to organise an army against the invasion that must comethat is coming already in short lord count we need such a warrior as are you what man is there in all italyor indeed what woman or what childthat has not heard of the prowess of the lord of aquila your knightly deeds in the wars twixt pisa and florence your feats of arms and generalship in the service of the venetians are matters for the making of epic song  messer fabrizio murmured paolo seeking to restrain his eulogistic interlocutor what time a faint tinge crept into his bronzed cheeks but da lodi continued all unheeding  and shall you my lord who have borne yourself so valiantly as a condottiero in the service of the stranger hesitate to employ your skill and valour against the enemies of your own homeland not so excellency we know the patriotic soul of francesco del falco and we count upon it  and you do well he answered firmly when the time comes you shall find me ready but until then and touching such preparation as must be madewhy do you not address his highness as you do me  a sad smile crossed the noble face of lodi whilst ferrabraccio laughed outright in chill contempt and with characteristic roughness made answer  shall we speak to him he cried of knightly deeds of prowess and of valour i would as lief enjoin roderigo borgia to fulfil the sacred duties of his vicarship i might as profitably sprinkle incense on a dunghill what we could say to gian maria we have said and since it had been idle to have appealed to him as we have appealed to you we have shown him yet another way by which babbiano might be saved and valentinos onslaught averted  ah and this other way inquired the count his glance wandering back to fabrizio  an alliance with the house of urbino answered lodi guidobaldo has two nieces we have sounded him and we have found him well disposed towards such a marriage as we suggested allied thus to the house of montefeltro we should receive not only assistance from guidobaldo but also from the lords of bologna perugia camerino and some smaller states whose fortunes are linked already to that of urbino thus we should present to cesar borgia a coalition so strong that he would never dare to bring a lance into our territory  i heard some talk of it said paolo it would have been a wise step indeed pity that the negotiations came to naught  but why did they come to naught body of satanwhy roared the impetuous ferrabraccio as with his mighty fist he smote the table a blow that wellnigh shattered it because gian maria was not in a marrying mood the girl we proposed to him was beautiful as an angel but he would not so much as look there was a woman in babbiano who  my lord cut in fabrizio hastily fearing the lengths to which the other might go it is as ferrabraccio says his highness would not marry and this it is has led us to invite you to meet us here tonight his highness will do nothing to save the duchy and so we turn to you the people are with us in every street of babbiano are you spoken of openly as the duke they would have govern them and defend their homes in the sacred name of the people then the old man concluded rising and speaking in a voice shaken by emotion and with the peoples voice of which we are but the mouthpiece we now offer you the crown of babbiano return with us tonight my lord and tomorrow with but twenty spears for escort we shall ride into babbiano and proclaim you duke nor need you fear the slightest opposition one man only of babbianothat same masuccio whom you tell us that you saw tonightremains faithful to gian maria faithful because he and the fifty swiss mercenaries at his heels are paid to be so up my lord let your own good sense tell you whether an honest man need scruple to depose a prince whose throne knows no defence beyond the hired protection of fifty foreign spears  a silence followed that impassioned speech lodi remained standing the others sat their eager glances turned upon the count their ears anxiously alert for his reply thus they remained for a brief spell aquila himself so still that he scarcely seemed to breathe  he sat gripping the arms of his chair his head fallen forward until his chin rested on his breast a frown darkening his lofty brow and whilst they waited for his answer a mighty battle was fought out within his soul the power so suddenly so unexpectedly thrust within his reach and offered him if he would but open his hands to grasp it dazzled him for one little moment as in a flash he saw himself lord of babbiano he beheld a proud career of knightly deeds that should cause his name and that of babbiano to ring throughout the length and breadth of italy from the obscure state that it was his patriotism and his skill as a condottiero should render it one of the great italian powersthe rival of florence of venice or milan he had a vision of widened territories and of neighbouring lords becoming vassals to his might he saw himself wresting romagna mile by mile from the sway of the ribald borgia hunting him to the death as he was wont to hunt the boar in the marshes of commachio or driving him into the very vatican to seek shelter within his fathers gatesthe last strip of soil that he would leave him to lord it over he dreamt of a babbiano courted by the great republics and the honour of its alliance craved by them that they might withstand the onslaughts of french and spaniard all this he saw in that fleeting vision of his and temptation caught his martial spirit in a grip of steel and then another picture rose before his eyes what would he do in times of peace his was a soul that pined in palaces he was born to the camp and not to the vapid air of courts in exchange for this power that was offered him what must he give his glorious liberty become their lord in many things to be their slave in more nominally to rule but actually to be ruled until should he fail to do his rulers will there would be some night another meeting such as this in which men would plot to encompass his downfall and to supplant him as he was invited to supplant gian maria lastly he bethought him of the man whose power he was bidden to usurp his own cousin his fathers sisters son in whose veins ran the same blood as in his own  he raised his head at last and met those anxious faces on which the fitful light was casting harsh shadows the pale ghost of a smile hovered for a second on the corners of his stern mouth  i thank you sirs for the honour you have done me he made answer slowly an honour of which i fear i am all unworthy  in strenuous chorus their voices rose to contradict him  at least then an honour which i cannot accept  there was a moments silence and their faces from eager that they had been grew downcast to the point of sullenness  but why my lord cried old fabrizio at last his arms outstretched towards the count his voice quivering with intensity santissima vergine why  becauseto give you but one reason out of manythe man you ask me to overthrow and supplant is of my own blood and but that his tone was calm they might have held that he rebuked them  i had thought hazarded seriously the gay fanfulla that with such a man as your excellency patriotism and the love of babbiano would have weighed even more than the ties of blood  and you had thought well fanfulla did i not say that the reason i gave you was but one of many tell me sirs what cause have you to believe that i should rule you wisely and well it so chances that in the crisis now threatening babbiano a captain is needed for its ruler but let not this delude you for there may come a season in the fortunes of the state when such a man might be as unfitted for dominion as is the present duke in this what then a good knighterrant is an indifferent courtier and a bad statesman lastly my friendssince you must know all that is in my heartthere remains the fact that i love myself a little i love my liberty too well and i have no mind to stifle in the scented atmosphere of courts you see i am frank with you it is my pleasure to roam the world my harness on my back free as the blessed wind of heaven shall a ducal crown and a cloak of purple he broke off sharply with a laugh there my friends you have had reasons and to spare again i thank you and deplore that being such as i am i may not become such as you would have me  he sank back in his chair eyeing them with a glance never so wistful and after a seconds silence da lodis voice implored him in accents that trembled with pathetic emphasis to reconsider his resolve the old man would have proceeded to fresh argument but aquila cut him short  i have already so well considered it messer fabrizio he answered resolutely that nothing now could sway me but this sirs i will promise you i will ride with you to babbiano and i will seek to reason with my cousin more will i do i will seek at his hands the office of gonfalonier and if he grant it me i will so reorganise our forces and enter into such alliances with our neighbours as shall ensure at least in some degree the safety of our state  still they endeavoured to cajole him but he held firm against their efforts until in the end with a sorrowful mien da lodi thanked him for his promise to use his influence with gian maria  for this at least we thank your excellency and on our part we shall exert such power as we still wield in babbiano to the end that the high office of gonfalonier be conferred upon you we had preferred to see you fill with honour a position higher still and should you later come to consider  dismiss your hopes of that put in the count with a solemn shake of his head and then before another word was uttered young fanfulla degli arcipreti leapt of a sudden to his feet his brows knit and an expression of alarm spreading upon his comely face a second he remained thus then going swiftly to the door he opened it and stood listening followed by the surprised glances of the assembled company but it needed not the warning cry with which he turned to afford them the explanation of his odd behaviour in the moments tense silence that had followed his sudden opening of the door they had caught from without the distant fall of marching feet     chapter ii on a mountain path   armed men my lords had been fanfullas cry we are betrayed  they looked at one another with stern eyes and with that grimness that takes the place which fear would hold in meaner souls  then aquila rose slowly to his feet and with him rose the others looking to their weapons he softly breathed a namemasuccio torri  aye cried lodi bitterly would that we had heeded your warning masuccio it will be and at his heels his fifty mercenaries  not less ill swear by the sound of them said ferrabraccio and we but six without our harness  seven the count laconically amended resuming his hat and loosening his sword in its scabbard  not so my lord exclaimed lodi laying a hand upon the counts arm you must not stay with us you are our only hopethe only hope of babbiano if we are indeed betrayedthough by what infernal means i know notand they have knowledge that six traitors met here tonight to conspire against the throne of gian maria at least ill swear it is not known that you were to have met us his highness may conjecture but he cannot know for sure and if you but escape all may yet he wellsaving with us who matter not go my lord remember your promise to seek at your cousins hand the gonfalon and may god and his blessed saints prosper your excellency  the old man caught the young mans hand and bending his head until his face was hidden in his long white hair he imprinted a kiss of fealty upon it but aquila was not so easily to be dismissed  where are your horses he demanded  tethered at the back but who would dare ride them at night adown this precipice  i dare for one answered the young man steadily and so shall you all dare a broken neck is the worst that can befall us and i would as lief break mine on the rocks of sant angelo as have it broken by the executioner of babbiano  bravely said by the virgin roared ferrabraccio to horse sirs  but the only way is the way by which they come fanfulla remonstrated the rest is sheer cliff  why then my sweet seducer well go to meet them rejoined ferrabraccio gaily they are on foot and well sweep over them like a mountain torrent come sirs hasten they draw nigh  we have but six horses and we are seven another objected  i have no horse said francesco ill follow you afoot  what cried ferrabraccio who seemed now to have assumed command of the enterprise let our st michael bring up the rear no no you da lodi you are too old for this work  too old blazed the old man drawing himself up to the full height of what was still a very imposing figure and his eyes seeming to take fire at this reflection upon his knightly worth were the season other ferrabraccio i could crave leave to show you how much of youth there is still left in me but he paused his angry eyes had alighted upon the count who stood waiting by the door and the whole expression of his countenance changed you are right ferrabraccio i grow old indeeda dotard take you my horse and begone  but you quoth the count solicitously  i shall remain if you do your duty well by those hirelings they will not trouble me it will not occur to them that one was left behind they will think only of following you after you have cut through them go go sirs or all is lost  they obeyed him now with a rush that seemed almost to partake of panic in a frenzied haste fanfulla and another tore the tetherings loose and a moment later they were all mounted and ready for that fearful ride the night was dark yet not too dark the sky was cloudless and thickly starred whilst a minguant moon helped to illumine the way by which they were to go but on that broken and uncertain mountain path the shadows lay thickly enough to make their venture desperate  ferrabraccio claiming a better knowledge than his comrades of the way placed himself at their head with the count beside him behind them two by two came the four others they stood on a small ledge in the shadow of the great cliff that loomed on their left thence the mountainside might be scannedas well as in such a light it was to be discerned the tramp of feet had now grown louder and nearer and with it came the clank of armour in front of them lay the path which sloped for a hundred yards or more to the first corner below them on the right the path again appeared at the point where it jutted out for some halfdozen yards in its zigzag course and there fanfulla caught the gleam of steel reflecting the feeble moonlight he drew ferrabraccios attention to it and that stout warrior at once gave the word to start but francesco interposed  if we do so he objected we shall come upon them past the corner and at that corner we shall be forced to slacken speed to avoid being carried over the edge of the cliff besides in such a strait our horses may fail us and refuse the ground in any event we shall not descend upon them with the same force as we shall carry if we wait until they come into a straight line with us the shadows here will screen us from them meanwhile  you are right lord count we will wait was the ready answer and what time they waited he grumbled lustily  to be caught in such a trap as this body of satan it was a madness to have met in a hut with but one approach  we might perhaps have retreated down the cliff behind said francesco  we might indeedhad we been sparrows or mountain cats but being men the way we go is the only wayand a mighty bad way it is i should like to be buried at sant angelo lord count he continued whimsically it will be conveniently near for once i go over the mountainside ill swear naught will stop me until i reach the valleya parcel of broken bones  steady my friends murmured the voice of aquila they come  and round that fateful corner they were now swinging into viewa company in steel heads and bodies with partisan on shoulder a moment they halted now so that the waiting party almost deemed itself observed but it soon became clear that the halt was to the end that the stragglers might come up masuccio was a man who took no chances every knave of his fifty would he have before he ventured the assault  now murmured the count tightening his hat upon his brow so that it might the better mask his features then rising in his stirrups and raising his sword on high he let his voice be heard again but no longer in a whisper like a trumpetcall it rang echoed and reechoed up the mountainside  forward st michael and the virgin  that mighty shout followed as it was by a thunder of hooves gave pause to the advancing mercenaries masuccios voice was heard calling to them to stand firm bidding them kneel and ward the charge with their pikes assuring them with curses that they had but to deal with halfdozen men but the mountain echoes were delusive and that thunder of descending hooves seemed to them not of a halfdozen but of a regiment despite masuccios imprecations the foremost turned and in that moment the riders were upon them through them and over them like the mighty torrent of which ferrabraccio had spoken  a dozen swiss went down beneath that onslaught and another dozen that had been swept aside and over the precipice were halfway to the valley before that cavalcade met any check masuccios remaining men strove lustily to stem this human cataract now that they realised how small was the number of their assailants they got their partisans to work and for a few moments the battle raged hot upon that narrow way the air was charged with the grind and ring of steel the stamping of men and horses and the shrieks and curses of the maimed  the lord of aquila ever foremost fought desperately on not only with his sword fought he but with his horse as well rearing the beast on its hind legs he would swing it round and let it descend where least it was expected laying about him with his sword at the same time in vain they sought to bring down his charger with their pikes so swift and furious was his action that before their design could be accomplished he was upon those that meditated it scattering them out of reach to save their skins  in this ferocious manner he cleared a way before him and luck served him so well that what blows were wildly aimed at him as he dashed by went wide of striking him at last he was all but through the press and but three men now fronted him again his charger reared snorting and pawing the air like a cat and two of the three knaves before him fled incontinently aside but the third who was of braver stuff dropped on one knee and presented his pike at the horses belly francesco made a wild attempt to save the roan that had served him so gallantly but he was too late it came down to impale itself upon that waiting partisan with a hideous scream the horse sank upon its slayer crushing him beneath its mighty weight and hurling its rider forward on to the ground in an instant he was up and had turned for all that he was halfstunned by his fall and weakened by the loss of blood from a pikethrust in the shoulderof which he had hitherto remained unconscious in the heat of battle two mercenaries were bearing down upon himthe same two that had been the last to fall back before him he braced himself to meet them thinking that his last hour was indeed come when fanfulla degli arcipreti who had followed him closely through the press now descended upon his assailants from behind and rode them down beside the count he reined up and stretched down his hand  mount behind me excellency he urged him  there is not time answered francesco who discerned a halfdozen figures hurrying towards them i will cling to your stirrupleather thus now spur and without waiting for fanfulla to obey him he caught the horse a blow with the flat of his sword across the hams which sent it bounding forward thus they continued now that perilous descent fanfulla riding and the count halfrunning halfswinging from his stirrup at last when they had covered a halfmile in this fashion and the going had grown easier they halted that the count might mount behind his companion and as they now rode along at an easier pace francesco realised that he and fanfulla were the only two that had come through that ugly place the gallant ferrabraccio hero of a hundred strenuous battles had gone to the ignoble doom which half in jest he had prophesied himself his horse had played him false at the outset of the charge and taking fright it had veered aside despite his efforts to control it until losing its foothold man and beast had gone hurtling over the cliff amerini fanfulla had seen slain whilst the remaining two being both unhorsed would doubtless be the prisoners of masuccio  some three miles beyond sant angelo fanfullas weary horse splashed across a ford of the metauro and thus towards the second hour of night they gained the territory of urbino where for the time they might hold themselves safe from all pursuit     chapter iii sackcloth and motley   the fool and the friar had fallen aquarrelling andto the shame of the friar and the glory of the fool be it spokentheir subject of contention was a woman now the friar finding himself no match for the fool in words and being as broad and stout of girth and limb as the other was puny and misshapen he had plucked off his sandal that with it he might drive the full force of his arguments through the jesters skull at that the fool being a very coward had fled incontinently through the trees  running like the fool he was with his head turned to learn whether the good father followed him he never saw the figure that lay halfhidden in the bracken and might never have guessed its presence but that tripping over it he shot forward with a tinkle of bells on to his crooked nose  he sat up with a groan which was answered by an oath from the man into whose sides he had dug his flying feet the two looked at one another in surprise tempered with anger in the one and dismay in the other  a good awakening to you noble sir quoth the fool politely for by the mien and inches of the man he had roused he thought that courtesy might serve him best  the other eyed him with interest as well he might for an odder figure it would be hard to find in italy  hunched of back undersized and fragile of limb he was arrayed in doublet hose and hood the half of which was black the other crimson whilst on his shoulders fell from that same hoodwhich tightly framed his ugly little facea foliated cape from every point of which there hung a tiny silver bell that glimmered in the sunlight and tinkled as he moved from under bulging brows a pair of bright eyes set wide as an owls took up the mischievous humour of his prodigious mouth  a curse on you and him that sent you was the answering greeting he received then the man checked his anger and broke into a laugh at sight of the fear that sprang into the jesters eyes  i crave your pardonmost humbly do i crave it illustrious said the fool still in fear i was pursued  pursued echoed the other in a tone not free from a sudden uneasiness and pray by whom  by the very fiend disguised in the gross flesh and semblance of a dominican brother  do you jest came the angry question  jest had you caught his villainous sandal between your shoulders as did i you would know how little i have a mind to jest  now answer me a plain question if you have the wit to answer with quoth the other anger ever rising in his voice is there hereabouts a monk  aye is theremay a foul plague rot himlurking in the bushes yonder he is overfat to run or you had seen him at my heels arrayed in that panoply of avenging wrath that is the cognisance of the church militant  go bring him hither was the short answer  gesù gasped the fool in very real affright ill not go near him till his anger coolsnot if you made me straight and bribed me with the patrimony of st peter  the man turned from him impatiently and rising his voice  fanfulla he called over his shoulder and then after a moments pause again olá fanfulla  i am here my lord came an answering voice from behind a clump of bushes on their right and almost immediately the very splendid youth who had gone to sleep in its shadow stood up and came round to them at sight of the fool he paused to take stock of him what time the fool returned the compliment with wonderstricken interest for however much fanfullas raiment might have suffered in yesternights affray it was very gorgeous still and in the velvet cap upon his head a string of jewels was entwined yet not so much by the richness of his trappings was the fool impressed as by the fact that one so manifestly noble should address by such a title and in a tone of so much deference this indifferently apparelled fellow over whom he had stumbled then his gaze wandered back to the man who lay supported on his elbow and he noticed now the gold net in which his hair was coiffed and which was by no means common to mean folk his little twinkling eyes turned their attention full upon the face before him and of a sudden a gleam of recognition entered them his countenance underwent a change and from grotesque that it had been it became more grotesque still in its hasty assumption of reverence  my lord of aquila he murmured scrambling to his feet  scarcely had he got erect when a hand gripped him by the shoulder and fanfullas dagger flashed before his startled eyes  swear on the cross of this never to divulge his excellencys presence here or take you the point of it in your foolish heart  i swear i swear he cried in fearful haste his hand upon the hilt which fanfulla now held towards him  now fetch the priest good fool said the count with a smile at the hunchbacks sudden terror you have nothing to fear from us  when the jester had left them to go upon his errand francesco turned to his companion  fanfulla you are overcautious he said with an easy smile what shall it matter that i am recognised  i would not have it happen for a kingdom while you are so near sant angelo the six of us who met last night are doomedthose of us who are not dead already for me and for lodi if he was not taken there may be safety in flight into the territory of babbiano i shall never again set foot whilst gian maria is duke unless i be weary of this world but of the seventhyourselfyou heard old lodi swear that the secret could not have transpired yet should his highness come to hear of your presence in these parts and in my company suspicion might set him on the road that leads to knowledge  ah and then  then returned the other eyeing francesco in surprise why then the hopes we found on youthe hopes of every man in babbiano worthy of the namewould be frustrated but here comes our friend the fool and in his wake the friar  fra domenicoso was he very fitly named this follower of st dominicapproached with a solemnity that proceeded rather from his great girth than from any inflated sense of the dignity of his calling he bowed before fanfulla until his great crimson face was hidden and he displayed instead a yellow shaven crown it was as if the sun had set and the moon had risen in its place  are you skilled in medicine quoth fanfulla shortly  i have some knowledge illustrious  then see to this gentlemans wounds  eh dio mio you are wounded then he began turning to the count and he would have added other questions as pregnant but that aquila drawing aside his hacketon at the shoulder answered him quickly  here sir priest  his lips pursed in solicitude the friar would have gone upon his knees but that francesco seeing with what labour the movement must be fraught rose up at once  it is not so bad that i cannot stand said he submitting himself to the monks examination  the latter expressed the opinion that it was nowise dangerous however much it might be irksome whereupon the count invited him to bind it up to this fra domenico replied that he had neither unguents nor linen but fanfulla suggested that he might get these things from the convent of acquasparta hard by and proffered to accompany him thither  this being determined they departed leaving the count in the company of the jester francesco spread his cloak and lay down again whilst the fool craving his permission to remain disposed himself upon his haunches like a turk  who is your master fool quoth the count in an idle spirit  there is a man who clothes and feeds me noble sir but folly is my only master  to what end does he do this  because i pretend to be a greater fool than he so that by contrast with me he seems unto himself wise which flatters his conceit again perhaps because i am so much uglier than he that again by contrast he may account himself a prodigy of beauty  odd is it not the count humoured him  not half so odd as that the lord of aquila should lie here roughly clad a wound in his shoulder talking to a fool  francesco eyed him with a smile  give thanks to god that fanfulla is not here to hear you or they had been your last words for pretty though he be messer fanfulla is a very monster of bloodthirstiness with me it is different i am a man of very gentle ways as you may have heard messer buffoon but see that you forget at once my station and my name or you may realise how little they need buffoons in the court of heaven  my lord forgive i shall obey you answered the hunchback with a stricken manner and then through the glade came a voicea womans voice wondrous sweet and richcalling peppino peppino  it is my mistress calling me quoth the fool leaping to his feet  so that you own a mistress though folly be your only master laughed the count it would pleasure me to behold the lady whose property you have the honour to be ser peppino  you may behold her if you but turn your head peppino whispered  idly with a smile upon his lips that was almost scornful the lord of aquila turned his eyes in the direction in which the fool was already walking and on the instant his whole expression changed the amused scorn was swept from his countenance and in its place there sat now a look of wonder that was almost awe  standing there on the edge of the clearing in which he lay he beheld a woman he had a vague impression of a slender shapely height a fleeting vision of a robe of white damask a camorra of green velvet and a choicely wrought girdle of gold but it was the glory of her peerless face that caught and held his glance in such ecstatic awe the miracle of her eyes which riveted on his returned his glance with one of mild surprise a child she almost seemed despite her height and womanly proportions so fresh and youthful was her countenance  raised on his elbow he lay there for a spell and gazed and gazed his mind running on visions which godly men have had of saints from paradise  at last the spell was broken by peppinos voice addressing her his back servilely bent francesco bethought him of the deference due to one so clearly noble and leaping to his feet his wound forgotten he bowed profoundly a second later he gasped for breath reeled and swooning collapsed supine among the bracken     chapter iv monna valentina   in after years the lord of aquila was wont to aver in all solemnity that it was the sight of her wondrous beauty set up such a disorder in his soul that it overcame his senses and laid him swooning at her feet that he himself believed it so it is not ours to doubt for all that we may be more prone to agree with the opinion afterwards expressed by fanfulla and the friarand deeply resented by the countthat in leaping to his feet in overviolent haste his wound reopened and the pain of this combining with the weak condition that resulted from his loss of blood had caused his sudden faintness  who is this peppe she asked the fool and he mindful of the oath he had sworn answered her brazenly that he did not know adding that it wasas she might seesome poor wounded fellow  wounded she echoed and her glorious eyes grew very pitiful and alone  there was a gentleman here tending him madonna but he is gone with fra domenico to the convent of acquasparta to seek the necessaries to mend his shoulder  poor gentleman she murmured approaching the fallen figure how came he by his hurt  that madonna is more than i can tell  can we do nothing for him until his friends return was her next question bending over the count as she spoke come peppino she cried lend me your aid get me water from the brook yonder  the fool looked about him for a vessel and his eye falling upon the counts capacious hat he snatched it up and went his errand when he returned the lady was kneeling with the unconscious mans head in her lap into the hatful of water that peppe brought her she dipped a kerchief and with this she bathed the brow on which his long black hair lay matted and disordered  see how he has bled peppe said she his doublet is drenched and he is bleeding still vergine santa she cried beholding now the ugly wound that gaped in his shoulder and turning pale at the sight assuredly he will die of itand he so young peppino and so comely to behold  francesco stirred and a sigh fluttered through his pallid lips then he raised his heavy lids and their glances met and held each other and so eyes that were brown and tender looked down into feverish languid eyes of black what time her gentle hand held the moist cloth to his aching brow  angel of beauty he murmured dreamily being but halfawake as yet to his position then becoming conscious of her ministrations angel of goodness he added with yet deeper fervour  she had no answer for him saving such answerand in itself it was eloquent enoughas her blushes made for she was fresh from a convent and all innocent of worldly ways and tricks of gallant speech  do you suffer she asked at last  suffer quoth he now waking more and more and his voice sounding a note of scorn suffer my head so pillowed and a saint from heaven ministering to my ills nay i am in no pain madonna but in a joy more sweet than i have ever known  gesù what a nimble tongue gibed the fool from the background  are you there too master buffoon quoth francesco and fanfulla is he not here why now i bethink me he went to acquasparta with the friar he thrust his elbow under him for more support  you must not move said she thinking that he would essay to rise  i would not lady if i must he answered solemnly and then with his eyes upon her face he boldly asked her name  my name she answered readily is valentina della rovere and i am niece to guidobaldo of urbino  his brows shot up  do i indeed live he questioned or do i but dream the memories of some old romancers tale in which a wandering knight is tended thus by a princess  are you a knight she asked a wonder coming now into her eyes for even into the seclusion of her conventlife had crept strange stories of these mighty menatarms  your knight at least sweet lady answered he and ever your poor champion if you will do me so much honour  a crimson flush stole now into her cheeks summoned by his bold words and bolder glances and her eyes fell yet resentment had no part in her confusion she found no presumption in his speech nor aught that a brave knight might not say to the lady who had succoured him in his distress peppe who stood listening and marking the counts manner knowing the knights station was filled now with wonder now with mockery yet never interfered  what is your name sir knight she asked after a pause  his eyes looked troubled and as they shot beyond her to the fool they caught on peppes face a grin of sly amusement  my name he said at last is francesco and then to prevent that she should further question himbut tell me madonna he inquired how comes a lady of your station here alone with that poor fraction of a man and he indicated the grinning peppe  my people are yonder in the woods where we have halted for a little space i am on my way to my uncles court from the convent of santa sofia and for my escort i have messer romeo gonzaga and twenty spears so that you see i am well protected without counting ser peppe here and the saintly fra domenico my confessor  there was a pause ended at length by francesco  you will be the younger niece of his highness of urbino said he  not so messer francesco she answered readily i am the elder  at that his brows grew of a sudden dark  can you be she whom they would wed to gian maria he exclaimed at which the fool pricked up his ears whilst she looked at the count with a gaze that plainly showed how far she was from understanding him  you said she asked  why nothing he answered with a sigh and in that moment a mans voice came ringing through the wood  madonna madonna valentina  francesco and the lady turned their eyes in the direction whence the voice proceeded and they beheld a superbly dazzling figure entering the glade in beauty of person and richness of apparel he was well worthy of the company of valentina his doublet was of grey velvet set off with scales of beaten gold and revealing a goldembroidered vest beneath his bonnet matched his doublet and was decked by a feather that sparkled with costly gems his goldhilted sword was sheathed in a scabbard also of grey velvet set with jewels his face was comely as a damsels his eyes blue and his hair golden  behold announced peppino gravely italys latest translation of the golden ass of apuleius  upon seeing the noble niece of guidobaldo kneeling there with francescos head still pillowed in her lap the newcomer cast up his arms in a gesture of dismay  saints in heaven he exclaimed hurrying towards them what occupation have you found who is this ugly fellow  ugly was all she answered him in accents of profound surprise  who is he the young man insisted his tone growing heated and what does he here and thus with you gesù what would his highness say how would he deal with me were he to learn of this who is the man madonna  why as you see messer gonzaga she answered with some heat a wounded knight  a knight he gibed gonzaga a thief more likely a prowling masnadiero what is your name he roughly asked the count  drawing himself a little away from valentina and reclining entirely upon his elbow francesco motioned him with a wave of the hand to come no nearer  i beg lady that you will bid your pretty page stand back a little i am still faint and his perfumes overpower me  under the mask of the polite request gonzaga detected the mocking contemptuous note and it gave fuel to his anger  i am no page fool he answered then clapping his hands together he raised his voice to shoutolá beltrame to me  what would you do cried the lady rising to confront him  carry this ruffian in bonds to urbino as is my duty  sir you may wound your pretty hands in grasping me replied the count in chill indifference  ah you would threaten me with violence vassal cried the other retreating some paces farther as he spoke beltrame he called again are you never coming a voice answered him from the thicket and with a clank of steel a halfdozen men flung themselves into the glade  your orders sir craved he that led them his eyes wandering to the still prostrate count  tie me up this dog gonzaga bade him but before the fellow could move a foot to carry out the order valentina barred his way  you shall not she commanded and so transformed was she from the ingenuous child that lately had talked with him that francesco gaped in pure astonishment in my uncles name i bid you leave this gentleman where he lies he is a wounded knight whom i have been pleased to tenda matter which seems to have aroused messer gonzagas anger against him  beltrame paused and looked from valentina to gonzaga undecided  madonna said gonzaga with assumed humility your word is law with us but i would have you consider that what i bid beltrame do is in the interest of his highness whose territory is infested by these vagabonding robbers it is a fact that may not have reached you in your convent retreat no more than has sufficient knowledge reached you yetin your incomparable innocenceto distinguish between rogues and honest men beltrame do my bidding  valentinas foot tapped the ground impatiently and into her eyes there came a look of anger that heightened her likeness to her martial uncle but peppe it was who spoke  for all that there seem to be fools enough already meddling in this business he said in tones of mock lament permit that i join their number ser romeo and listen to my counsel  out fool cried gonzaga cutting at him with his ridingswitch we need not your capers  no but you need my wisdom retorted ser peppe as he leapt beyond gonzagas reach hear me beltrame for all that we do not doubt messer gonzagas keen discrimination in judging twixt a rogue and an honest man i do promise you as surely as though i were fate herself that if you obey him now and tie up that gentleman you will yourself be tied up for it later on in a yet uglier fashion  beltrame looked alarmed gonzaga incredulous valentina thanked peppe with her eyes thinking that he had but hit upon a subterfuge to serve her wishes whilst francesco who had now risen to his feet looked on with an amused smile as though the matter concerned him nowise personally and then in the very crux of the situation fanfulla and fra domenico appeared upon the scene  you are wellreturned fanfulla the count called to him this pretty gentleman would have had me bound  have you bound echoed fanfulla in angry horror upon what grounds pray he demanded turning fiercely upon gonzaga  impressed by fanfullas lordly air romeo gonzaga grew amazingly humble for one that but a moment back had been so overbearing  it would seem sir that my judgment was at fault in esteeming his condition he excused himself  your judgment returned the hot fanfulla and who bade you judge go cut your milkteeth boy and meddle not with men if you would live to be a man yourself some day  valentina smiled peppe laughed outright whilst even beltrame and his followers grinned all of which added not a little to gonzagas choler but scant though his wisdom might be it was yet enough to dictate prudence  the presence of madonna here restrains me he answered with elaborate dignity but should we meet again i shall make bold to show you what manhood means  perhapsif by then you shall have come to it and with a shrug fanfulla turned to give his attention to the count whom fra domenico was already tending  valentina to relieve the awkwardness of the moment proposed to gonzaga that he should get his escort to horse and have her litter in readiness so that they might resume their journey as soon as fra domenico should have concluded his ministrations  gonzaga bowed and with a vicious glance at the strangers and an angry follow me to beltrame and the others he departed with the menatarms at his heels  valentina remained with fanfulla and peppe whilst fra domenico dressed francescos wound and presently when the task was accomplished they departed leaving fanfulla amid the count alone but ere she went she listened to francescos thanks and suffered him to touch her ivory fingers with his lips  there was much he might have said but that the presence of the other three restrained him yet some little of that much she may have seen reflected in his eyes for all that day she rode pensive a fond wistful smile at the corners of her lips and although to gonzaga she manifested no resentment yet did she twit him touching that mistake of his sore in his dignity he liked her playful mockery little yet he liked the words in which she framed it less  how came you into so grievous an error ser romeo she asked him more than once how could you deem him a roguehe with so noble a mien and so beautiful a countenance and without heeding the sullenness of his answers she would lapse with a sigh once more into reflectiona thing that galled gonzaga more perhaps than did her gibes     chapter v gian maria   it was a week after the meeting twixt the niece of guidobaldo and the count of aquila when the latterhis wound being wellnigh healedrode one morning under the great archway that was the main entrance to the city of babbiano the captain of the gate saluted him respectfully as he rode by and permitted himself to marvel at the pallor of his excellencys face and yet the cause was not very far to seek it stood upon four spears among a noisy flock of circling crows above that very gatecalled of san bacoloand consisted of four detruncated human heads  the sight of those dead faces grinning horribly their long matted hair fluttering like rags in the april breeze had arrested francescos attention as he drew nigh but when presently he came nearer and looked with more intentness a shudder of recognition ran through him and a great horror filled his soul and paled his cheek the first of those heads was that of the valiant and wellnamed ferrabraccio the next that of amerino amerini and the other two those of his captured companions on that night at sant angelo  so it would seem that gian maria had been busy during the week that was sped and that there on the walls of babbiano lay rotting the only fruits which that illstarred conspiracy was likely to bear  for a second it entered his mind to turn back but his stout and fearless nature drove him on all unattended as he was and in despite of such vague forebodings as beset him how much he wondered might gian maria know of his own share in that mountain meeting and how would it fare with him if his cousin was aware that it had been proposed to the count of aquila to supplant him  he was not long however in learning that grounds were wanting for such fears as he had entertained gian maria received him with even more than wonted welcome for he laid much store by francescos judgment and was in sore need of it at present  francesco found him at table which had been laid for him amidst the treasures of art and learning that enriched the splendid palace library it was a place beloved by gian maria for the material comforts that it offered him and so he turned it to a score of vulgar purposes of his own yet never to that for which it was equipped being an utter stranger to letters and ignorant as a ploughboy  ensconced in a great chair of crimson leather at a board overladen with choice viands and sparkling with crystal flagons and with vessels and dishes of gold and enamel francesco found his cousin and the air that had been heavy once with the scholarly smell of parchments and musty tomes was saturated now with pungent odours of the table  in stature gian maria was short and inclining young though he was to corpulency his face was round and pale and flabby his eyes blue and beady his mouth sensual and cruel he was dressed in a suit of lilac velvet trimmed with lynx fur and slashed spanish fashion in the sleeves to show the shirt of fine rheims linen underneath about his neck hung a gold chain bearing an agnus dei which contained a relic of the true crossfor gian maria pushed his devoutness to great lengths  his welcome of francesco was more effusive than its wont he bade the two servants who attended him to lay a plate for his illustrious cousin and when aquila shortly yet courteously declined with the assurance that he had dined already the duke insisted that at least he should drink a cup of malvasia when out of a vessel of beaten gold they had filled a goblet for the count his highness bade the servants go and relaxedif indeed so much may be said of one who never knew much dignitybefore his visitor  i hear said aquila when the first compliments were spent strange stories of a conspiracy in your duchy and on the walls at the gate of san bacolo i beheld four heads of men whom i have known and honoured  and who dishonoured themselves ere their heads were made a banquet for the crows there francesco he shuddered and crossed himself it is unlucky to speak of the dead at table  let us speak then of their offence alone persisted francesco subtly in what did it lie  in what returned the duke amusedly his voice was thin and inclining to shrillness it is more than i can say masuccio knew but the dog would not disclose his secret nor the names of the conspirators until his task should be accomplished and he had taken them at the treason he knew they had gathered to ripen but he continued an olive poised twixt thumb and forefinger it seems they were not to be captured as easily as he thought he told me the traitors numbered six and that they were to meet a seventh there the men who returned from the venture tell me too and without shame that there were but some six or seven that beset them yet they gave the swiss trouble enough and killed some nine of them besides a halfscore of more or less grievously wounded whilst they but slew two of their assailants and captured another two those were the four heads you saw at the porta san bacolo  and masuccio inquired francesco has he not told you since who were those others that escaped  his highness paused to masticate the olive  why there lies the difficulty said he at length the dog is dead he was killed in the affray may he rot in hell for his obstinate reticence no no he checked himself hastily hes dead and the secret of this treason as well as the names of the traitors have perished with him yet i am a clement man francesco and sorely though that dog has wronged me by his silence i thank heaven for the grace to saygod rest his vile soul  the count flung himself into a chair as much to dissemble such signs of relief as might show upon his face as because he wished to sit  but surely masuccio left you some information he exclaimed  the very scantiest returned gian maria in chagrined accents it was ever the way of that secretive vassal damn him he frankly told me that if i knew i would talk heard you ever of such insufferable insolence to a prince all that he would let me learn was that there was a conspiracy afoot to supplant me and that he was going to capture the conspirators together with the man whom they were inviting to take my place ponder it francesco such are the murderous plans my loving subjects form for my undoingi who rule them with a rod of gold the most clement just and generous prince in italy cristo buono do you marvel that i lost patience and had their hideous heads set upon spears  but did you not say that two of these conspirators were brought back captive  the duke nodded his mouth too full for words  then at their trial what transpired  trial there was no trial gian maria chewed vigorously for a moment i tell you i was so heated with anger at this base ingratitude that i had not even the wit to have the names of their associates tortured out of them within a halfhour of their arrival in babbiano the heads of these men whom it had pleased heaven to deliver up to me were where you saw them today  you sent them thus to their death gasped francesco rising to his feet and eyeing his cousin with mingled wonder and anger you sent men of such families as these to the headsman without a trial i think gian maria that you must be mad if so rashly you can shed such blood as this  the duke sank back in his chair to gape at his impetuous cousin then in sullen anger to whom do you speak he demanded  to a tyrant who calls himself the most clement just and generous prince in italy and who lacks the wisdom to see that he is undermining with his own hands and by his own rash actions a throne that is already tottering can you not think that this might mean a revolution it amounts to murder and though dukes resort to it freely enough in italy it is not openly and defiantly wrought as is this  anger there was in the dukes soul but there was still more fearso much that it shouldered the anger aside  i have provided against rebellion he announced with an ease that he vainly strove to feel i have given the command of my guards to martino armstadt and he has engaged for me a company of five hundred swiss lanzknechte that were lately in the pay of the baglioni of perugia  and you deem this security rejoined francesco with a smile of scorn to hedge your throne with foreign spears commanded by a foreigner  this and gods grace was the pious answer  bah answered francesco impatient at the hypocrisy win the hearts of your people let that be your buckler  hush whispered gian maria you blaspheme does not every act of my selfsacrificing life point to such an aim i live for my people but by my soul they ask too much when they ask that i should die for them if i serve those who plot against my life as i have served these men you speak of who shall blame me i tell you francesco i wish i might have those others who escaped that i might do as much by them by the living god i do and as for the man who was to have supplanted me he paused a deadly smile on his sensual mouth completing the sentence more effectively than lay within the power of words who could it have been he mused ive vowed that if heaven will grant me that i discover him ill burn a candle to santa fosca every saturday for a twelvemonth and go fasting on the vigil of the dead whowho could it have been franceschino  how should i know returned francesco evading the question  you know so much checco mio your mind is so quick to fathom matters of this kind think you now it might have been the duca valentino  francesco shook his head  when caesar borgia comes he will know no need to resort to such poor means he will come in arms to reduce you by his might  god and the saints protect me gasped the duke you talk of it as if he were already marching  then i talk of it advisedly the event is none so remote as you would make yourself believe listen gian maria i have not ridden from aquila for just the pleasure of passing the time of day with you fabrizio da lodi and fanfulla degli arcipreti have been with me of late  with you cried the duke his little eyes narrowing themselves as they glanced up at his cousin with you­eh he shrugged his shoulders and spread his palms before him pish see into what errors even so clear a mind as mine may fall do you know francesco that marking their absence since that conspiracy was laid i had a halfsuspicion they were connected with it and he devoted his attention to a honeycomb  you have not in all your duchy two hearts more faithful to babbiano was the equivocal reply it was on the matter of this very peril that threatens you that they came to me  ah gian marias white face grew interested  and now the count of aquila talked to the duke of babbiano much as fabrizio da lodi had talked to the count that night at sant angelo he spoke of the danger that threatened from the borgia of the utter lack of preparation and of gian marias contempt of the counsels given him he alluded to the discontent rife among his subjects at this state of things and to the urgent need to set them right when he had done the duke sat silent a while his eyes bent thoughtfully upon his platter on which the food lay now unheeded  an easy thing is it not francesco to say to a man this is wrong and that is wrong but who is there pray to set it right for me  that if you will say but the word i will attempt to do  you cried the duke and far from manifesting satisfaction at having one offer himself to undertake to right this very crooked business gian marias face reflected an incredulous anger and some little scorn and how my marvellous cousin would you set about it he inquired a sneer lurking in his tone  i would place such matters as the levying of money by taxation in the hands of messer despuglio and at whatever sacrifice to your own extravagance i would see that for months to come the bulk of these moneys is applied to the levying and arming of suitable men i have some skill as a condottieroleastways so more than one foreign prince has been forced to acknowledge i will lead your army when i have raised it and i will enter into alliances for you with our neighbouring states who seeing us armed will deem us a power worthy of their alliance and so what man can do to stem the impending flood of this invasion that will i do to defend your duchy make me your gonfalonier and in a month i will tell you whether it lies in my power or not to save your state  the eyes of gian maria had narrowed more and more whilst francesco spoke and into his shallow face had crept an evil suspicious look as the count ceased he gave vent to a subdued laugh bitter with mockery  make you my gonfalonier he muttered in consummate amusement and since when has babbiano been a republicor is it your aim to make it one and establish yourself as its chief magistrate  if you misapprehend me so began francesco but his cousin interrupted him with heightening scorn  misapprehend you messer franceschino no no i understand you but too well he rose suddenly from his interrupted meal and came a step nearer his cousin i hear rumours of this growing love my people are manifesting for the count of aquila and i have let them go unheeded that rogue masuccio warned me ere he died and i answered him with my whip across his face but i am by no means sure that i have been proceeding wisely i had a dream two nights ago but let that be when it so happens that in any state there is a man whom the people prefer to him who rules them and when it so happens that this man is of as good blood and high birth as are you he becomes a danger to him that sits the throne i need scarce remind you he added with a horrid grin of how the borgias deal with such individuals nor need i add that a sforza may see fit to emulate those very conclusive measures of precaution the family of sforza has bred as yet no fools nor shall i prove myself the first by placing in anothers hands the power to make himself my master you see my gentle cousin how transparent your aims become under my eyes i am keen of vision franceschino keen of vision he tapped his nose and chuckled a malicious appreciation of his own acute perceptions  francesco regarded him with an eye of stony scorn he might have answered had he been so disposed that the duchy of babbiano was his to take whenever he pleased he might have told him that and defied him but he went more slowly than did this man of a family that bred no fools  do you know me then so little gian maria said he not without bitterness that you think i hunger for so empty a thing as this ducal pomp you clutch so fearfully i tell you man that i prefer my liberty to an imperial throne but i waste breath with you yet some day when your crown shall have passed from you and your power have been engulfed in the borgias rapacious maw remember my offer which might have saved you and which with insults you disregarded as you disregarded the advice your older counsellors gave you  gian maria shrugged his fat shoulders  if by that other advice you mean the counsel that i should take guidobaldos niece to wife you may give ease unto your patriotic soul i have consented to enter into this alliance and now he ended with another of his infernal chuckles you see how little i need dread this terrible son of pope alexander allied with urbino and the other states that are its friends i can defy the might of caesar borgia i shall sleep tranquil of nights beside my beauteous bride secure in the protection her uncles armies will afford me and never needing so much as my valiant cousins aid as my gonfalonier  the count of aquila changed colour despite himself and the dukes suspicious eyes were as quick to observe it as was his mind to misinterpret its meaning he registered a vow to set a watch on this solicitous cousin who offered so readily to bear his gonfalon  i felicitate you at least said francesco gravely upon the wisdom of that step had i known of it i had not troubled you with other proposals for the safety of your state but may i ask you gian maria what influences led you to a course which hitherto you have so obstinately refused to follow  the duke shrugged his shoulders  they plagued me so he lamented with a grimace that in the end i consented i could withstand lodi and the others but when my mother joined them with her prayersi should say her commandsand pointed out again my peril to me i gave way after all a man must wed and since in my station he need not let his marriage weigh too much upon him i resolved on it for the sake of security and peace  since it was the salvation of babbiano that he aimed at the count of aquila should have rejoiced at gian marias wise resolve and no other consideration should have tempered so encompassing a thing as that joy of his should have been yet when later he left his cousins presence the only feeling that he carried with him was a deep and bitter resentment against the fate that willed such things blent with a sorrowing pity for the girl that was to wed his cousin and a growing hatred for the cousin who made him pity her     chapter vi the amorous duke   from a window of the palace of babbiano the lord of aquila watched the amazing bustle in the courtyard below and at his side stood fanfulla degli arcipreti whom he had summoned from perugia with assurances that masuccio being dead no peril now menaced him  it was a week after that interview at which gian maria had made known his intentions to his cousin and his highness was now upon the point of setting out for urbino to perform the comedy of wooing the lady valentina this was the explanation of that scurrying of servitors and pages that parading of menatarms and that stamping of horses and mules in the quadrangle below francesco watched the scene with a smile of some bitterness his companion with one of supreme satisfaction  praised be heaven for having brought his highness at last to a sense of his duty remarked the courtier  it has often happened to me said francesco disregarding his companions words to malign the fates for having brought me into the world a count but in the future i shall give them thanks for i see how much worse it might have beeni might have been born a prince with a duchy to rule over i might have been as that poor man my cousin a creature whose life is all pomp and no real dignity all merry­making and no real mirthloveless isolated and vain  but cried the amazed fanfulla assuredly there are compensations  you see that bustle you know what it portends what compensation can there be for that  it is a question you should be the last to ask my lord you have seen the niece of guidobaldo and having seen her can you still ask what compensation does this marriage offer gian maria  do you then not understand returned aquila with a wan smile do you not see the tragedy of it is it nothing that two states having found that this marriage would be mutually advantageous have determined that it shall take place that meanwhile the chief actorsthe victims i might almost call themhave no opportunity of selecting for themselves gian maria goes about it resignedly he will tell you that he has always known that some day he must wed and do his best to beget a son he held out long enough against this alliance but now that necessity is driving him at last he goes about it much as he would go about any other state affaira coronation a banquet or a ball can you wonder now that i would not accept the throne of babbiano when it was offered me i tell you fanfulla that were i at present in my cousins shoes i would cast crown and purple at whomsoever had a fancy for them ere they crushed the life out of me and left me a poor puppet sooner than endure that hollow mockery of a life i would become a peasant or a vassal i would delve the earth and lead a humble life but lead it in my own way and thank god for the freedom of it choose my own comrades live as i list where i list love as i list where i list and die when god pleases with the knowledge that my life had not been altogether barren and that poor girl fanfulla think of her she is to be joined in loveless union to such a gross unfeeling clod as gian maria have you no pity for her  fanfulla sighed his brow clouded  i am not so dull but that i can see why you should reason thus today said he these thoughts have come to you since you have seen her  franceseo sighed deeply  who knows he made answer wistfully in the few moments that we talked together in the little time that i beheld her it may be that she dealt me a wound far deeper than the one to which she so mercifully sought to minister  now for all that in what the lord of aquila said touching the projected union there was a deal of justice yet when he asserted that the chief actors were to have no opportunity of selecting for themselves he said too much that opportunity they were to have it occurred three days later at urbino when the duke and valentina were brought together at the banquet of welcome given by guidobaldo to his intended nephewinlaw the sight of her resplendent beauty came as a joyful shock to gian maria and filled him with as much impatience to possess her as did his own gross ugliness render him offensive in her eyes averse had she been to this wedding from the moment that it had been broached to her the sight of gian maria completed her loathing of the part assigned her and in her heart she registered a vow that sooner than become the duchess of babbiano she would return to her convent of santa sofia and take the veil  gian maria sat beside her at the banquet and in the intervals of eatingwhich absorbed him mightilyhe whispered compliments at which she shuddered and turned pale the more strenuously did he strive to please in his gross and clumsy fashion the more did he succeed in repelling and disgusting her until in the end with all his fatuousness he came to deem her oddly cold of this anon he made complaint to that magnificent prince her uncle but guidobaldo scoffed at his qualms  do you account my niece a peasant girl he asked would you have her smirk and squirm at every piece of flattery you utter so that she weds your highness what shall the rest signify  i would she loved me a little complained gian maria foolishly  guidobaldo looked him over with an eye that smiled inscrutably and it may have crossed his mind that this coarse whitefaced duke was too ambitious  i doubt not that she will he answered in tones as inscrutable as his glance so that you woo with grace and ardour what woman could withstand your highness be not put off by such modesty as becomes a maid  those words of guidobaldos breathed new courage into him nor ever after could he think that her coldness was other than a cloak a sort of maidenly garment behind which modesty bade her conceal the inclinations of her heart reasoning thus and having in support of it his wondrous fatuity it so befell that the more she shunned and avoided him the more did he gather conviction of the intensity of her affection the more loathing she betrayed the more proof did it afford him of the consuming quality of her passion in the end he went even so far as to applaud and esteem in her this very maidenly conduct  there were huntingparties hawkingparties waterparties banquets comedies balls and revels of every description and for a week all went well at urbino then as suddenly as if a cannon had been fired upon the palace the festivities were interrupted the news that an envoy of caesar borgias was at babbiano with a message from his master came like a cold douche upon gian maria it was borne to him in a letter from fabrizio da lodi imploring his immediate return to treat with this plenipotentiary of valentinos  no longer did he disregard the peril that threatened him from the allconquering borgia no longer deem exaggerated by his advisers the cause for fear this sudden presence of valentinos messenger coming too at a time when it would almost seem as if the impending union with urbino had spurred the borgia to act before the alliance was established filled him with apprehension  in one of the princely chambers that had been set aside for his use during his visit to urbino he discussed the tragic news with the two nobles who had accompanied himalvaro de alvari and gismondo santiand both of them whilst urging him to take the advice of lodi and return at once urged him too to establish his betrothal ere he left  bring the matter to an issue at once your highness said santi and thus you will go back to babbiano wellarmed to meet the duca valentinos messenger  readily accepting this advice gian maria went in quest of guidobaldo and laid before him his proposals together with the news which had arrived and which was the cause of the haste he now manifested guidobaldo listened gravely in its way the news affected him as well for he feared the might of caesar borgia as much as any man in italy and he was by virtue of it the readier to hasten forward an alliance which should bring another of the neighbouring states into the powerful coalition he was forming  it shall be as you wish answered him the gracious lord of urbino and the betrothal shall be proclaimed today so that you can bear news of it to valentinos messenger when you have heard this envoy deliver him an answer of such defiance or such caution as you please then return in ten days time to urbino and all shall be ready for the nuptials but first of all go you and tell monna valentina  confident of success gian maria obeyed his host and went in quest of the lady he gained her antechamber and thence he despatched an idling page to request of her the honour of an audience  as the youth passed through the door that led to the room beyond gian maria caught for a moment the accents of an exquisite male voice singing a lovesong to the accompaniment of a lute       una donna più bella assai che l sole  came the words of petrarch and he heard them still though muffled for a moment or two after the boy had gone then it ceased abruptly and a pause followed at the end of which the page returned raising the portière of blue and gold he invited gian maria to enter  it was a room that spoke with eloquence of the wealth and refinement of montefeltro from the gilding and ultramarine of the vaulted ceiling with its carved frieze of delicately inlaid woodwork to the priceless tapestries beneath it above a crimson priedieu hung a silver crucifix the exquisite workmanship of the famous anichino of ferrara yonder stood an inlaid cabinet surmounted by a crystal mirror and some wonders of murano glass there was a picture by mantegna some costly cameos and delicate enamels an abundance of books a dulcimer which a fairhaired page was examining with inquisitive eyes and by a window on the right stood a very handsome harp that guidobaldo had bought his niece in venice  in that choice apartment of hers the duke found valentina surrounded by her ladies peppe the fool a couple of pages and a halfdozen gentlemen of her uncles court one of thesethat same gonzaga who had escorted her from the convent of santa sofiamost splendidly arrayed in white taby his vest and doublet rich with gold sat upon a low stool idly fingering the lute in his lap from which gian maria inferred that his had been the voice that had reached him in the antechamber  at the dukes advent they all rose saving valentina and received him with a ceremony that somewhat chilled his ardour he advanced then halted clumsily and in a clumsy manner framed a request that he might speak with her alone in a tired longsuffering way she dismissed that court of hers and gian maria stood waiting until the last of them had passed out through the tall windows that abutted on to a delightful terrace where in the midst of a green square a marble fountain flashed and glimmered in the sunlight  lady he said when they were at last alone i have news from babbiano that demands my instant return and he approached her by another step  in truth he was a dullwitted fellow or else too blinded by fatuity to see and interpret aright the sudden sparkle in her eye the sudden unmistakable expression of relief that spread itself upon her face  my lord she answered in a low collected voice we shall grieve at your departure  fool of a duke that he was blind crass and most fatuous of wooers had he been bred in courts and his ears attuned to words that meant nothing that were but the empty echoes of what should have been meant was he so new to courtesies in which the heart had no share that those words of valentinas must bring him down upon his knees beside her to take her dainty fingers in his fat hands and to become transformed into a boorish lover of the most outrageous type  shall you so he lisped his glance growing mighty amorous shall you indeed grieve  she rose abruptly to her feet  i beg that your highness will rise she enjoined him coldly a coldness which changed swiftly to alarm as her endeavours to release her hand proved vain for despite her struggles he held on stoutly this was mere coyness he assured himself mere maidenly artifice which he must bear with until he had overcome it for all time  my lord i implore you she continued bethink you of where you areof who you are  here will i stay until the crack of doom he answered with an odd mixture of humour ardour and ferocity unless you consent to listen to me  i am ready to listen my lord she answered without veiling a repugnance that he lacked the wit to see but it is not necessary that you should hold my hand nor fitting that you should kneel  not fitting he exclaimed lady you do not apprehend me rightly is it not fitting that all of usbe we princes or vassalsshall kneel sometimes  at your prayers my lord yes most fitting  and is not a man at his prayers when he woos what fitter shrine in all the world than his mistresss feet  release me she commanded still struggling your highness grows tiresome and ridiculous  ridiculous  his great sensual mouth fell open his white cheeks grew mottled and his little eyes looked up with a mighty evil gleam in their cruel blue a moment he stayed so then he rose up he released her hands as she had bidden him but he clutched her arms instead which was yet worse  valentina he said in a voice that was far from steady why do you use me thus unkindly  but i do not she protested wearily drawing back with a shudder from the white face that was so near her own inspiring her with a loathing she could not repress i would not have your highness look foolish and you cannot conceive how  can you conceive how deeply how passionately i love you he broke in his grasp tightening  my lord you are hurting me  and are you not hurting me he snarled what is a pinched arm when compared with such wounds as your eyes are dealing me are you not  she had twisted from his grasp and in a bound she had reached the windowdoor through which her attendants had passed  valentina he cried as he sprang after her and it was more like the growl of a beast than the cry of a lover he caught her and with scant ceremony he dragged her back into the room  at this her latent loathing contempt and indignation rose up in arms never had she heard tell of a woman of her rank being used in this fashion she abhorred him yet she had spared him the humiliation of hearing it from her lips intending to fight for her liberty with her uncle but now since he handled her as though she had been a servingwench since he appeared to know nothing of the deference due to her nothing of the delicacies of people wellborn and wellbred she would endure his odious lovemaking no further since he elected to pursue his wooing like a clown the highspirited daughter of urbino promised herself that in like fashion would she deal with him  swinging herself free from his grasp a second time she caught him a stinging buffet on the ducal cheek whichso greatly did it take him by surpriseall but sent him sprawling  madonna he panted this indignity to me  and what indignities have not i suffered at your hands she retorted with a fierceness of glance before which he recoiled and as she now towered before him a beautiful embodiment of wrath he knew not whether he loved her more than he feared her yet the desire to possess her and to tame her was strong within him  am i a baggage of your camps she questioned furiously to be so handled by you do you forget that i am the niece of guidobaldo a lady of the house of rovere and that from my cradle i have known naught but the respect of all men be they born never so high that to such by my birth i have the right must i tell you in plain words sir that though born to a throne your manners are those of a groom and must i tell you ere you will realise it that no man to whom with my own lips i have not given the right shall set hands upon me as you have done  her eyes flashed her voice rose and higher raged the storm and gian maria was so tossed and shattered by it that he could but humbly sue for pardon  what shall it signify that i am a duke he pleaded timidly since i am become a lover what is a duke then he is but a man and as the meanest of his subjects his love must take expression for what does love know of rank  she was moving towards the window again and for all that he dared not a second time arrest her by force he sought by words to do so  madonna he exclaimed i implore you to hear me in another hour i shall be in the saddle on my way to babbiano  that sir she answered him is the best news i have heard since your coming and without waiting for his reply she stepped through the open window on to the terrace  for a second he hesitated a sense of angry humiliation oppressing his wits then he started to follow her but as he reached the window the little crookbacked figure of ser peppe stood suddenly before him with a tinkle of bells and a mocking grin illumining his face  out of the way fool growled the angry duke but the odd figure in its motley of red and black continued where it stood  if it is madonna valentina you seek said he behold her yonder  and gian maria following the indication of peppes lean finger saw that she had rejoined her ladies and that thus his opportunity of speaking with her was at an end he turned his shoulder upon the jester and moved ponderously towards the door by which he had originally entered the room it had been well for ser peppe had he let him go but the fool who loved his mistress dearly and had many of the instincts of the faithful dog loving where she loved and hating where she hated could not repress the desire to send a gibe after the retreating figure and inflict another wound in that much wounded spirit  you find it a hard road to madonnas heart magnificent he called after him where your wisdom is blind be aided by the keen eyes of folly  the duke stood still a man more dignified would have left that treacherous tongue unheeded but dignity and gian maria were strangers he turned and eyed the figure that now followed him into the room  you have knowledge to sell he guessed contemptuously  knowledge i havea vast storebut none for sale lord duke such as imports you i will bestow if you ask me for no more than the joy of beholding you smile  say on the duke bade him without relaxing the grimness that tightened his flabby face  peppe bowed  it were an easy thing most high and mighty to win the love of madonna if he paused dramatically  yes yes e dunque if  if you had the noble countenance the splendid height the shapely limbs the courtly speech and princely manner of one i wot of  are you deriding me the duke questioned unbelieving  ah no highness i do but tell you how it were possible that my lady might come to love you had you those glorious attributes of him i speak of and of whom she dreams it might be easy but since god fashioned you such as you aregross of countenance fat and stunted of shape boorish of  with a roar the infuriated duke was upon him but the fool as nimble of legs as he was of tongue eluded the vicious grasp of those fat hands and leaping through the window ran to the shelter of his mistresss petticoats     chapter vii gonzaga the insidious   well indeed had it been for ser peppe had he restrained his malicious mood and curbed the mocking speech that had been as vinegar to gian marias wounds for when gian maria was sore he was wont to be vindictive and on the present occasion he was something even more  there abode with him the memory of the fools words and the suggestion that in the heart of valentina was framed the image of some other man now loving her in his own coarse way and as he understood love the rejected duke waxed furiously jealous of this other at whose existence peppe had hinted this unknown stood in his path to valentina and to clear that path it suggested itself to gian maria that the simplest method was to remove the obstacle but first he must discover it and to this he thought with a grim smile the fool mightwillynillyhelp him  he returned to his own apartments and whilst the preparations for his departure were toward he bade alvaro summon martin armstadtthe captain of his guard to the latter his orders were short and secret  take four men he bade him and remain in urbino after i am gone discover the haunts of peppe the fool seize him and bring him after me see that you do it diligently and let no suspicion of your task arise  the bravohe was little better for all that he commanded the guards of the duke of babbianobowed and answered in his foreign guttural voice that his highness should be obeyed  thereafter gian maria made shift to depart he took his leave of guidobaldo promising to return within a few days for the nuptials and leaving an impression upon the mind of his host that his interview with valentina had been very different from the actual  it was from valentina herself that guidobaldo was to learn after gian marias departure the true nature of that interview and what had passed between his niece and his guest she sought him out in his closet whither he had repaired driven thither by the demon of gout that already inhabited his body and was wont to urge him at times to isolate himself from his court she found him reclining upon a couch seeking distraction in a volume of the prose works of piccinino he was a handsome man of excellent shape scarce thirty years of age his face was pale and there were dark circles round his eyes and lines of pain about his strong mouth  he sat up at her advent and setting his book upon the table beside him he listened to her angry complaints  at first the courtly montefeltro inclined to anger upon learning of the roughness with which gian maria had borne himself but presently he smiled  when all is said i see in this no great cause for indignation he assured her i acknowledge that it may lack the formality that should attend the addresses of a man in the dukes position to a lady in yours but since he is to wed you and that soon why be angered at that he seeks to pay his court like any other man  i have talked in vain then she answered petulantly and i am misunderstood i do not intend to wed this ducal clod you have chosen to be my husband  guidobaldo stared at her with brows raised and wonder in his fine eyes then he shrugged his shoulders a trifle wearily this handsome and wellbeloved guidobaldo was very much a prince so schooled to princely ways as to sometimes forget that he was a man  we forgive much to the impetuousness of youth said he very coldly but there are bounds to the endurance of every one of us as your uncle and your prince i claim a double duty from you and you owe a double allegiance to my wishes by my twofold authority i have commanded you to wed with gian maria  the princess in her was all forgotten and it was just the woman who answered him in a voice of protest  but highness i do not love him  a shade of impatience crossed his lofty face  i do not remember he made answer wearily that i loved your aunt yet we were wed and through habit came to love each other and to be happy together  i can understand that monna elizabetta should have come to love you she returned you are not as gian maria you were not fat and ugly stupid and cruel as is he  it was an appeal that might have won its way to a mans heart through the everready channel of his vanity but it did not so with guidobaldo he only shook his head  the matter is not one that i will argue it were unworthy in us both princes my child are not as ordinary folk  in what are they different she flashed back at him do they not hunger and thirst as ordinary folk are they not subject to the same ills do they not experience the same joys are they not born and do they not die just as ordinary folk in what then lies this difference that forbids them to mate as ordinary folk  guidobaldo tossed his arms to heaven his eyes full of a consternation that clearly defied utterance the violence of his gesture drew a gasp of pain from him at last when he had mastered it  they are different said he in that their lives are not their own to dispose of as they will they belong to the state which they were born to govern and in nothing else does this become of so much importance as in their mating it behoves them to contract such alliances as shall redound to the advantage of their people a toss of her auburn head was valentinas interpolation but her uncle continued relentlessly in his cold formal tonessuch tones as those in which he might have addressed an assembly of his captains  in the present instance we are threatenedbabbiano and urbinoby a common foe and whilst divided neither of us could withstand him united we shall combine to his overthrow therefore does this alliance become necessaryimperative  i do not apprehend the necessity she answered in a voice that breathed defiance if such an alliance as you speak of is desirable why may it not be made a purely political onesuch a one for instance as now binds perugia and camerino to you what need to bring me into question  a little knowledge of history would afford you an answer such political alliances are daily made and daily broken when more profit offers in another quarter but cemented by marriage the tie whilst continuing political becomes also one of blood in the case of urbino and babbiano it enters also into consideration that i have no son it might well be valentina he pursued with a calculating coldness that revolted her that a son of yours would yet more strongly link the two duchies in time both might become united under him into one great power that might vie successfully with any in italy now leave me child as you see i am suffering and when it is thus with me and this evil tyrant has me in its clutches i prefer to be alone  there was a pause and whilst his eyes were upon hers hers were upon the ground in avoidance of his glance a frown marred her white brow her lips were set and her hands clenched pity for his physical ills fought a while with pity for her own mental torment at last she threw back her beautiful head and the manner of that action was instinct with insubordination  it grieves me to harass your highness in such a season she assured him but i must beg your indulgence these things may be as you say your plans may be the noblest that were ever conceived since to their consummation would be entailed the sacrifice of your own flesh and bloodin the person of your niece but i will have no part in them it may be that i lack a like nobility of soul it may be that i am all unworthy of the high station to which i was born through no fault of my own and so my lord she ended her voice her face her gesture all imparting an irrevocable finality to her words i will not wed this duke of babbianono not to cement alliances with a hundred duchies  valentina he exclaimed roused out of his wonted calm do you forget that you are my niece  since you appear to have forgotten it  these womans whims he began when she interrupted him  perhaps they will serve to remind you that i am a woman and perhaps if you remember that you may consider how very natural it is that being a woman i should refuse to wed forfor political ends  to your chamber he commanded now thoroughly aroused and on your knees beg heavens grace to help you to see your duty since no words of mine prevail  oh that the duchess were returned from mantua she sighed the good monna elizabetta might melt you to some pity  monna elizabetta is too dutiful herself to do aught but urge you to dutifulness there child he added in a more wheedling tone set aside this disobedient mood which is unlike you and becomes you ill you shall be wed with a splendour and magnificence that will set every princess in italy green with envy your dowry is set at fifty thousand ducats and giuliano della rovere shall pronounce the benediction already i have sent orders to ferrara to the incomparable anichino for the majestate girdle i will send to venice for gold leaf and  but do you not heed me that i will not wed she broke in with passionate calm her face white her bosom heaving  he rose leaning heavily upon a goldheaded cane and looked at her a moment without speaking his brows contracted then  your betrothal to gian maria is proclaimed he announced in a voice cold with finality i have passed my word to the duke and your marriage shall take place so soon as he returns now go such scenes as these are wearisome to a sick man and they are undignified  but your highness she began an imploring note now taking the place that lately had been held by defiance  go he blazed stamping his foot and then to save his dignityfor he feared that she might still remainhe himself turned on his heel and passed from the apartment  left to herself she stood there a moment allowed a sigh to escape her and brushed an angry tear from her brown eyes then with a sudden movement that seemed to imply suppression of her mood she walked to the door by which she entered and left the chamber  she went down the long gallery whose walls glowed with the new frescoes from the wonderworking brush of andrea mantegna she crossed her antechamber and gained the very room where some hours ago she had received the insult of gian marias odious advances she passed through the now empty room and stepped out on to the terrace that overlooked the paradiselike gardens of the palace  close by the fountain stood a white marble seat over which earlier that day one of her women had thrown a cloak of crimson velvet there she now sat herself to think out the monstrous situation that beset her the air was warm and balmy and heavy with the scent of flowers from the garden below the splashing of the fountain seemed to soothe her and for a little while her eyes were upon that gleaming water which rose high in a crystal column then broke and fell a shower of glittering jewels into the broad marble basin then her eyes growing tired they strayed to the marble balustrade where a peacock strode with overweening dignity they passed on to the gardens below gay with early blossoms in their stately frames of tall boxwood hedges and flanked by myrtles and tall cypresses standing gaunt and black against the deep saffron of the vesper sky  saving the splashing of the fountain and the occasional harsh scream of the peacock all was at peace as if by contrast with the tumult that raged in valentinas soul then another sound broke the stillnessa soft step crunching the gravel of the walk she turned and behind her stood the magnificent gonzaga a smile that at once reflected pleasure and surprise upon his handsome face  alone madonna he said in accents of mild wonder his fingers softly stirring the strings of the lute he carried and without which he seldom appeared about the court  as you see she answered and her tone was the tone of one whose thoughts are taken up with other things  her glance moved away from him again and in a moment it seemed as if she had forgotten his presence so absorbed grew the expression of her face  but gonzaga was not easily discouraged patience was the one virtue that valentina more than any womanand there had been many in his young lifehad inculcated into a soul that in the main was anything but virtuous he came a step nearer and leant lightly against the edge of her seat his shapely legs crossed his graceful body inclining ever so slightly towards her  you are pensive madonna he murmured in his rich caressing voice  why then she reproved him but in a mild tone do you intrude upon my thoughts  because they seem sad thoughts madonna he answered glibly and i were a poor friend did i not seek to rouse you out of them  you are that gonzaga she questioned without looking at him you are my friend  he seemed to quiver and then draw himself upright whilst across his face there swept a shade of something that may have been good or bad or partly both then he leant down until his head came very near her own  your friend quoth he ah more than your friend count me your very slave madonna  she looked at him now and in his countenance she saw a reflection of the ardour that had spoken in his voice in his eyes there was a glance of burning intensity she drew away from him and at first he accounted himself repulsed but pointing to the space she had left  sit here beside me gonzaga she said quietly and he scarce crediting his own good fortune that so much favour should be showered upon him obeyed her in a halftimid fashion that was at odd variance with his late bold words  he laughed lightly perhaps to cover the embarrassment that beset him and dropping his jewelled cap he flung one whitecased leg over the other and took his lute in his lap his fingers again wandering to the strings  i have a new song madonna he announced with a gaiety that was obviously forced it is in ottava rima a faint echo of the immortal niccolo correggio composed in honour of one whose description is beyond the flight of human song  yet you sing of her  it is no better than an acknowledgment of the impossibility to sing of her thus and striking a chord or two he began a mezza voce       quando sorriderán in ciel       gli occhi tuoi ai santi  she laid a hand upon his arm to stay him  not now gonzaga she begged i am in no humour for your song sweet though i doubt not that it be  a shade of disappointment and ruffled vanity crossed his face women had been wont to listen greedily to his strambotti enthralled by the cunning of the words and the seductive sweetness of his voice  ah never look so glum she cried smiling now at his crestfallen air if i have not hearkened now i will again forgive me good gonzaga she begged him with a sweetness no man could have resisted and then a sigh fluttered from her lips a sound that was like a sob came after it and her hand closed upon his arm  they are breaking my heart my friend oh that you had left me at peace in the convent of santa sofia  he turned to her all solicitude and gentleness to inquire the reason of her outburst  it is this odious alliance into which they seek to force me with that man from babbiano i have told guidobaldo that i will not wed this duke but as profitably might i tell fate that i will not die the one is as unheeding as the other  gonzaga sighed profoundly in sympathy but said nothing  here was a grief to which he could not minister a grievance that he could do nothing to remove she turned from him with a gesture of impatience  you sigh she exclaimed and you bewail the cruelty of the fate in store for me but you can do nothing for me you are all words gonzaga you can call yourself more than my friendmy very slave yet when i need your help what do you offer me a sigh  madonna you are unjust he was quick to answer with some heat i did not dreami did not dare to dreamthat it was my help you sought my sympathy i believed was all that you invited and so lest i should seem presumptuous it was all i offered but if my help you need if you seek a means to evade this alliance that you rightly describe as odious such help as it lies in a mans power to render shall you have from me  he spoke almost fiercely and with a certain grim confidence for all that as yet no plan had formed itself in his mind  indeed had a course been clear to him there had been perhaps less confidence in his tone for after all he was not by nature a man of action and his character was the very reverse of valiant yet so excellent an actor was he as to deceive even himself by his acting and in this suggestion of some vague fine deeds that he would do he felt himself stirred by a sudden martial ardour and capable of all he was stirred too by the passion with which valentinas beauty filled hima passion that went nearer to making a man of him than nature had succeeded in doing  that now in the hour of her need she should turn so readily to him for assistance he accepted as proof that she was not deaf to the voice of this great love he bore her but of which he never yet had dared to show a sign the passing jelousy that he had entertained for that wounded knight they had met at acquasparta was laid to rest by her present attitude towards him the knight himself forgotten  as for valentina she listened to his ready speech and earnest tone with growing wonder both at him and at herself her own words had been little more than a petulant outburst of actually finding a way to elude her uncles wishes she had no thoughtunless it lay in carrying out that threat of hers to take the veil now however that gonzaga spoke so bravely of doing what man could do to help her to evade that marriage the thought of active resistance took an inviting shape  a timid hopea hope that was afraid of being shattered before it grew to any strengthpeeped now from the wondering eyes she turned on her companion  is there a way gonzaga she asked after a pause  now during that pause his mind had been very busy something of a poet he was blessed with wits of a certain quickness and was a man of very ready fancy like an inspiration an idea had come to him out of this had sprung another and yet another until a chain of events by which the frustration of the schemes of babbiano and urbino might be accomplished was complete  i think he said slowly his eyes upon the ground that i know a way  her glance was now eager her lip tremulous and her face a little pale she leant towards him  tell me she besought him feverishly  he set his lute on the seat beside him and his eyes looked round in apprehensive survey  not here he muttered there are too many ears in the palace of urbino will it please you to walk in the gardens i will tell you there  they rose together so ready was her assent they looked at each other for a second then side by side they passed down the wide marble steps that led from the terrace to the boxflanked walks of the gardens here among the lengthening shadows they paced in silence for a while what time gonzaga sought for words in which to propound his plan at length grown impatient valentina urged him with a question  what i counsel madonna he answered her is open defiance  such a course i am already pursuing but whither will it lead me  i do not mean the mere defiance of wordsmere protestations that you will not wed gian maria listen madonna the castle of roccaleone is your property it is perhaps the stoutest fortress in all italy today lightly garrisoned and wellprovisioned it might withstand a years siege  she turned to him having guessed already the proposal in his mind and for all that at first her eyes looked startled yet presently they kindled to a light of daring that augured well for a very stout adventure it was a wildly romantic notion this of gonzagas worthy of a poets perfervid brain and yet it attracted her by its unprecedented flavour  could it be done she wondered her eyes sparkling at the anticipation of such a deed  it could indeed it could he answered with an eagerness no whit less than her own immure yourself in roccaleone and thence hurl defiance at urbino and babbiano refusing to surrender until they grant your termsthat you are to marry as you list  and you will help me in this she questioned her mindin its innocenceinclining more and more to the mad project  with all my strength and wit he answered readily and gallantly i will so victual the place that it shall be able to stand siege for a whole year should the need arise and i will find you the men to arm ita score will i should think be ample for our needs since it is mainly upon the natural strength of the place that we rely  and then said she i shall need a captain  gonzaga made her a low bow  if you will honour me with the office madonna i shall serve you loyally whilst i have life  a smile quivered for a second on her lips but was gone ere the courtier had straightened himself from his bow for far was it from her wishes to wound his spirit but the notion of this scented fop in the role of captain ruling a handful of rough mercenaries and directing the operations for the resistance of an assiduous siege touched her with its ludicrous note yet if she refused him this it was more than likely he would deem himself offended and refuse to advance their plans it crossed her mindin the full confidence of youththat if he should fail her when the hour of action came she was of stout enough heart to aid herself and so she consented whereat again he bowed this time in gratitude and then a sudden thought occurred to her and with it came dismay  but for all this gonzagafor the men and the victuallingmoney will be needed  if you will let my friendship be proven also in that he began  but she interrupted him struck suddenly with a solution to the riddle  no no she exclaimed his face fell a little he had hoped to place her in his debt in every possible way yet here was one in which she raised a barrier upon her head she wore a fret of gold so richly laced with pearls as to be worth a princes ransom this she now made haste to unfasten with fingers that excitement set atremble there she cried holding it out to him turn that to money my friend it should yield you ducats enough for this enterprise  it next occurred to her that she could not go alone into that castle with just gonzaga and the men he was about to enrol his answer came with a promptness that showed he had considered also that  by no means he answered her when the time comes you must select such of your ladiessay three or fouras appear suitable and have your trust you may take a priest as well a page or two and a few servants  thus in the gloaming amid the shadows of that old italian garden was the plot laid by which valentina was to escape alliance with his highness of babbiano but there was more than that in it although that was all that valentina saw it was too a plot by which she might become the wife of messer romeo gonzaga  he was an exiled member of that famous mantua family which has bred some scoundrels and one saint with the money which at parting a doting mother had bestowed upon him he was cutting a brave figure at the urbino court where he was tolerated by virtue of his kinship with guidobaldos duchess monna elizabetta but his means were running low and it behoved him to turn his attention to such quarters as might yield him profit being poorspirited andsince his tastes had not inclined that wayuntrained in arms it would have been futile for him to have sought the career common to adventurers of his age yet an adventurer at heart he was and since the fields of mars were little suited to his nature he had long pondered upon the possibilities afforded him by the lists of cupid guidobaldopurely out of consideration for monna elizabettahad shown him a high degree of favour and upon this he had been vain enough to found great hopesfor guidobaldo had two nieces high had these hopes run when he was chosen to escort the lovely valentina della rovere from the convent of santa sofia to her uncles court but of late they had withered since he had learnt what were her uncles plans for this ladys future and now by her own action and by the plot into which she had entered with him they rose once more  to thwart guidobaldo might prove a dangerous thing and his life might pay the forfeit if his schemes miscarriedclement and merciful though guidobaldo was but if they succeeded and if by love or by force he could bring valentina to wed him he was tolerably confident that guidobaldo seeing matters had gone too farsince gian maria would certainly refuse to wed gonzagas widowwould let them be to this end no plan could be more propitious than that into which he had lured her guidobaldo might besiege them in roccaleone and might eventually reduce them by force of armsa circumstance however which despite his words he deemed extremely remote but if only he could wed valentina before they capitulated he thought that he would have little cause to fear any consequences of guidobaldos wrath after all in so far as birth and family were concerned romeo gonzaga was nowise the inferior of his highness of urbino guidobaldo had yet another niece and he might cement with her the desired alliance with babbiano  alone in the gardens of the palace gonzaga paced after night had fallen and with his eyes to the stars that began to fleck the violet sky he smiled a smile of cunning gratification he bethought him how well advised had been his suggestion that they should take a priest to roccaleone unless his prophetic sense led him deeply into error they would find work for that priest before the castle was surrendered     chapter viii among the dregs of wine   and so it befell that whilst by guidobaldos orders the preparations for valentinas nuptials went forward with feverish hastewhilst painters carvers and artificers in gold and silver applied themselves to their hurried tasks whilst messengers raced to venice for gold leaf and ultramarine for the weddingchests whilst the nuptial bed was being brought from rome and the chariot from ferrara whilst costly stuffs were being collected and the weddinggarments fashionedthe magnificent romeo gonzaga was on his side as diligently contriving to render vain all that toil of preparation  on the evening of the third day of his conspiring he sat in the room allotted to him in the palace of urbino and matured his plans and so well pleased was he with his selfcommunion that as he sat at his window there was a contented smile upon his lips  he allowed his glance to stray adown the slopes of that arid waste of rocks to the river metauro winding its way to the sea through fertile plains and gleaming here silver and yonder gold in the evening light not quite so complacently would he have smiled had he deemed the enterprise upon which he was engaging to be of that warlike character which he had represented to valentina he did not want for cunning nor for judgment of the working of human minds and he very reasonably opined that once the lady valentina immured herself in roccaleone and sent word to her uncle that she would not wed gian maria nor return to the court of urbino until he passed her his ducal word that she should hear no more of the union the duke would be the first to capitulate  he contended that this might not happen at oncenor did he wish it to messages would pass and guidobaldo would seek by cajolery to win back his niece this she would resist and in the end her uncle would see the impassable nature of the situation and agree to her terms that it might be ended that it should come to arms and that guidobaldo should move to besiege roccaleone he did not for a moment believefor what manner of ridicule would he not draw upon himself from the neighbouring states at the worst even if a siege there was it would never be carried out with the rigour of ordinary warfare there would be no assaults no bombarding it would be a simple investment with the object of intercepting resources so as to starve the garrison into submissionfor they would never dream of such victualling as gonzaga was preparing  thus communed gonzaga with himself and the smile enlivening the corners of his weak mouth grew more thoughtful he dreamed great dreams that evening he had wondrous visions of a future princely power that should come to be his own by virtue of this alliance that he was so skilfully encompassinga fool in a fools paradise with his folly for only company  but for all that his dreams were wondrous sweet to indulge and his visions truly alluring to contemplate there were plans to be formed and means to be devised for the flight to roccaleone there were calculations to be made the estimating of victuals arms and men and once these calculations were complete there were all these things to be obtained the victuals he had already provided for whilst of arms he had no need to think roccaleone should be well stocked with them but the finding of the men gave him some concern he had decided to enrol a score which was surely the smallest number with which he could make a fair show of being martially in earnest but even though the number was modest where was he to find twenty fellows who reeked so little of their lives as to embark upon such an enterpriseeven if lured by generous payand thereby incur the ducal displeasure of guidobaido  he dressed himself with sober rigour for once in his foppish life and descended after night had fallen to a tavern in a poor street behind the duomo hoping that there among the dregs of wine he might find what he required  by great good fortune he chanced upon an old freebooting captain who once had been a meaner sort of condottiero but who was sorely reduced by bad fortune and bad wine  the tavern was a dingy cutthroat place which the delicate gonzaga had not entered without a tremor invoking the saints protection and crossing himself ere he set foot across the threshold some pieces of goat were being cooked on the embers in a great fireplace at the end of the room farthest from the door before this ser lucianothe tavernersquatted on his heels and fanned so diligently that a cloud of ashes rose ceiling high and spread itself together with the noisome smoke throughout the squalid chamber a brass lamp swung from the ceiling and shone freely through that smoke as shines the moon through an evening mist so foully stank the place that at first gonzaga was moved to get him thence only the reflection that nowhere in urbino was he as likely as here to find the thing he sought impelled him to stifle his natural squeamishness and remain he slipped upon some grease and barely saved himself from measuring his length upon that filthy floor a matter which provoked a malicious guffaw from a tattered giant who watched with interest his mincing advent  perspiring and with nerves unstrung the courtier picked his way to a table by the wall and seated himself upon the coarse deal bench before it praying that he might be left its sole occupant  on the opposite wall hung a blackened crucifix and a small holywater stoup that had been dry for a generation and was now a receptacle for dust and a withered sprig of rosemary immediately beneath thisin the company of a couple of tatterdemalions worthy of himsat the giant who had mocked his escape from falling and as gonzaga took his seat he heard the fellows voice guttural bottlethickened and contentious  and this wine luciano sangue della madonna will you bring it before dropping dead pig  gonzaga shuddered and would have crossed himself again for protection against what seemed a very devil incarnate but that the ruffians bloodshot eye was set upon him in a stony stare  i come cavaliere i come cried the timid host leaping to his feet and leaving the goat to burn while he ministered to the giants unquenchable thirst  the title caused gonzaga to start and he bent his eyes again on the mans face he found it villainous of expression inflamed and blotched the hair hung matted about a bullet head and the eyes glared fiercely from either side of a pendulous nose of the knightly rank by which the taverner addressed him the fellow bore no outward signs arms he carried it is true a sword and dagger at his belt whilst beside him on the table stood a rusty steelcap but these warlike tools served only to give him the appearance of a roving masnadiero or a cutthroat for hire presently abandoning the comtemplation of gonzaga he turned to his companions and across to the listener floated a coarse and boasting tale of a plunderous warfare in sicily ten years agone gonzaga became excited it seemed indeed as if this were man who might be useful to him he made pretence to sip the wine luciano had brought him and listened avidly to that swashbuckling story from which it appeared that this knave had once been better circumstanced and something of a leader intently he listened and wondered whether such men as he boasted he had led in that campaign were still to be found and could be brought together  at the end of perhaps a halfhour the two companions of that thirsty giant rose and took their leave of him they cast a passing glance upon gonzaga and were gone  a little while he hesitated the ruffian seemed to have lapsed into a reverie or else he slept with open eyes calling up his courage the gallant rose at last and moved across the room all unversed in tavern ways was the magnificent gonzaga and he who at court in ballroom or in antechamber was a very mirror of all the graces of a courtier felt awkward here and ill at ease  at length summoning his wits to his aid  good sir said he with some timidity will you do me the honour to share a flagon with me  the ruffians eye which but a moment back had looked vacuous and melancholy now quickened until it seemed ablaze he raised his bloodshot orbs and boldly encountered gonzagas uneasy glance his lips fell apart with an anticipatory smack his back stiffened and his head was raised until his chin took on so haughty a tilt that gonzaga feared his proffered hospitality was on the point of suffering a scornful rejection  will i share a flagon gasped the fellow as being the sinner that he was and knew himself to be he might have gasped will i go to heaven will iwill i he paused and pursed his lips his eyebrows were puckered and his expression grew mighty cunning as again he took stock of this pretty fellow who offered flagons of wine to downatheel adventurers like himself he had all but asked what was to be required of him in exchange for this when suddenly he bethought himwith the knavish philosophy adversity had taught himthat were he told for what it was intended that the wine should bribe him and did the business suit him not he should in the confession of it lose the wine whilst did he but hold his peace until he had drunk it would be his thereafter to please himself about the business when it came to be proposed  he composed his rugged features into the rude semblance of a smile  sweet young sir he murmured sweet gentle and most illustrious lord i would share a hogshead with such a nobleman as you  i am to take it that you will drink quoth gonzaga who had scarce known what to make of the mans last words  body of bacchus yes ill drink with you gentile signorino until your purse be empty or the world run dry and he leered a mixture of mockery and satisfaction  gonzaga still half uncertain of his ground called the taverner and bade him bring a flagon of his best while luciano was about the fetching of the wine constraint sat upon that oddly discordant pair  it is a chill night commented gonzaga presently seating himself opposite his swashbuckler  young sir your wits have lost their edge the night is warm  i said spluttered gonzaga who was unused to contradiction from his inferiors and wished now to assert himself that the night is chill  you lied then returned the other with a fresh leer for as i answered you the night is warm piaghe di cristo i am an ill man to contradict my pretty gallant and if i say the night is warm warm it shall be though there be snow on mount vesuvius  the courtier turned pink at that and but for the arrival of the taverner with the wine it is possible he might have done an unconscionable rashness at sight of the red liquor the fury died out of the rufflers face  a long life a long thirst a long purse and a short memory was his toast into whose cryptic meaning gonzaga made no attempt to pry as the fellow set down his cup and with his sleeve removed the moisture from his unshorn mouth may i not learn he inquired whose hospitality i have the honour of enjoying  heard you ever of romeo gonzaga  of gonzaga yes though of romeo gonzaga never are you he  gonzaga bowed his head  a noble family yours returned the swashbuckler in a tone that implied his own to be as good let me name myself to you i am ercole fortemani he said with the proud air of one who announced himself an emperor  a formidable name said gonzaga in accents of surprise and it bears a noble sound  the great fellow turned on him in a sudden anger  why that astonishment he blazed i tell you my name is both noble and formidable and you shall find me as formidable as i am noble diavolo seems it incredible  said i so protested gonzaga  you had been dead by now if you had messer gonzaga but you thought so and i may take leave to show you how bold a man it needs to think so without suffering  ruffled as a turkeycock wounded in his pride and in his vanity ercole hastened to enlighten gonzaga on his personality  learn sir he announced that i am captain ercole fortemani i held that rank in the army of the pope i have served the pisans and the noble baglioni of perugia with honour and distinction i have commanded a hundred lances of gianinonis famous freecompany i have fought with the french against the spaniards and with the spaniards against the french and i have served the borgia who is plotting against both i have trailed a pike in the emperors following and i have held the rank of captain too in the army of the king of naples now young sir you have learned something of me and if my name is not written in letters of fire from one end of italy to the other it isbody of godbecause the hands that hired me to the work garnered the glory of my deeds  a noble record said gonzaga who had credulously absorbed that catalogue of lies a very noble record  not so the other contradicted for the lust of contradiction that was a part of him a great record if you will to commend me to hireling service but you may not call the service of a hireling noble  it is a matter we will not quarrel over said gonzaga soothingly the mans ferocity was terrific  who says that we shall not he demanded who will baulk me if i have a mind to quarrel over it answer me and he half rose from his seat moved by the anger into which he was lashing himself but patience he broke off subsiding on a sudden i take it it was not out of regard for my fine eyes nor drawn by the elegance of my appareland he raised a corner of his tattered cloaknor yet because you wish to throw a main with me that you have sought my acquaintance and called for this wine you require service of me  you have guessed it  a prodigious discernment by the host he seemed to incline rather tediously to irony then his face grew stern and he lowered his voice until it was no more than a growling whisper heed me messer gonzaga if the service you require be the slitting of a gullet or some kindred foul business which my seeming neediness leads you to suppose me ripe for let me counsel you as you value your own skin to leave the service unmentioned and get you gone  in hasty frantic fearful protest were gonzagas hands outspread  sir sirii could not have thought it of you he spluttered with warmth much of which was genuine for it rejoiced him to see some scruples still shining in the foul heap of this mans rascally existence a knave whose knavery knew no limits would hardly have suited his ends i do need a service but it is no darkcorner work it is a considerable enterprise and one in which i think you should prove the very man i need  let me know more quoth ercole grandiloquently  i need first your word that should the undertaking prove unsuited to you or beyond you you will respect the matter and keep it secret  body of satan no corpse was ever half so dumb as i shall be  excellent can you find me a score of stout fellows to form a bodyguard and a garrison who in return for good quartersperchance for some weeksand payment at four times the ordinary mercenaries rate will be willing to take some risk and chance even a brush with the dukes forces  ercole blew out his mottled cheeks until gonzaga feared that he would burst them  its outlawry he roared when he had found his voice outlawry or im a fool  why yes confessed gonzaga it is outlaw matter of a kind but the risk is slender  can you tell me no more  i dare not  ercole emptied his winecup at a draught and splashed the dregs on to the floor then setting down the empty vessel he sat steeped in thought awhile growing impatient  well cried gonzaga at last can you help me can you find the men  if you were to tell me more of the nature of this service you require i might find a hundred with ease  as i have saidi need but a score  ercole looked mighty grave and thoughtfully rubbed his long nose  it might be done said he after a pause but we shall have to look for desperate knaves men who are already under a ban and to whom it will matter little to have another item added to their indebtedness to the law should they fall into its talons how soon shall you require this forlorn company  by tomorrow night  i wonder mused ercole he was counting on his fingers and appeared to have lapsed into mental calculations i could get halfascore or a dozen within a couple of hours but a score again he paused and again he fell to thinking at last more briskly let us hear what pay you offer me to thrust myself thus blindfolded into this business of yours as leader of the company you require he asked suddenly  gonzagas face fell at that then he suddenly stiffened and put on an expression of haughtiness  it is my intent to lead this company myself he loftily informed the ruffler  body of god gasped ercole upon whose mind intruded a grotesque picture of such a company as he would assemble being led by this mincing carpetknight then recollecting himself if that be so said he you had best yourself enrol it felicissima notte and he waved him a farewell across the table  here was a poser for gonzaga how was he to go about such a business as that it was beyond his powers thus much he protested frankly  now attend to me young sir was the others answer the matter stands thus if i can repair to certain friends of mine with the information that an affair is afoot the particulars of which i may not give them but in which i am to lead them myself sharing such risk as there may be i do not doubt but that by this time tomorrow i can have a score of them enrolledsuch is their confidence in ercole fortemani but if i take them to enter a service unknown under a leader equally unknown the forming of such a company would be a mighty tedious matter  this was an argument to the force of which gonzaga could not remain insensible after a moments consideration he offered ercole fifty gold florins in earnest of good faith and the promise of pay thereafter at the rate of twenty gold florins a month for as long as he should need his services and ercole who in all his freelancing days had never earned the tenth of such a sum was ready to fall upon this most noble gentlemans neck and weep for very joy and brotherly affection  the matter being settled gonzaga produced a heavy bag which gave forth a jangle mighty pleasant to the ears of fortemani and let it drop with a chink upon the table  there are a hundred florins for the equipment of this company i do not wish to have a regiment of outatelbow tatterdemalions at my heels and his eye swept in an uncomplimentary manner over ercoles apparel see that you dress them fittingly  it shall be done magnificent answered ercole with a show of such respect as he had not hitherto manifested and arms  give them pikes and arquebuses if you will but nothing more the place we are bound for is well stocked with armourbut even that may not be required  may not be required echoed the more and more astonished swashbuckler were they to be paid on so lordly a scale clothed and fed to induce them upon a business that might carry no fighting with it surely he had never sold himself into a more likely or promising service and that night he dreamt in his sleep that he was become a gentlemans steward and that at his heels marched an endless company of lacqueys in flamboyant liveries on the morrow he awoke to the persuasion that at last of a truth was his fortune made and that hereafter there would be no more piketrailing for his warworn old arms  conscientiously he set about enrolling the company for in his way this ercole fortemani was a conscientious manboisterous and unruly if you will a rogue in his way with scant respect for property not above cogging dice or even filching a purse upon occasion when hard driven by necessityfor all that he was gently born and had held honourable employment a drunkard by long habit and a swaggering brawler upon the merest provocation but for all that riotous and dishonest though he might be in the general commerce of life yet to the hand that hired him he strovenot always successfully perhaps but at least always earnestlyto be loyal     chapter ix the tratta di corde   whilst the bustle of preparation went on briskly in urbino gian maria on his side was rapidly disposing of affairs in babbiano that he might return to the nuptials for which he was impatient but he had chanced upon a deeper tangle than he had reckoned with and more to do than he had looked for  on the day of his departure from urbino he had ridden as far as cagli and halted at the house of the noble messer valdicampo this had been placed at his disposal and there he proposed to lie the night they had suppedthe duke de alvari gismondo santi messér valdicampo his wife and two daughters and a couple of friends potential citizens of cagli whom he had invited that they might witness the honour that was being done his house it waxed late and the torpor that ensues upon the generous gratification of appetite was settling upon the company when armstadtgian marias swiss captainentered and approached his master with the air of a man who is the bearer of news he halted a pace or two from the dukes highbacked chair and stood eyeing gian maria in stupid patience  well fool growled the duke turning his head  the swiss approached another step they have brought him highness he said in a confidential whisper  am i a wizard that i must read your thoughts hectored gian maria who has brought whom  armstadt eyed the company in hesitation then stepping close to the duke he murmured in his ear  the men i left behind have brought the foolser peppe  a sudden brightening of the eye showed that gian maria understood without apology to the board he turned and whispered back to his captain to have the fellow taken to his chamber there to await him let a couple of your knaves be in attendance and do you come too martino  martin bowed and withdrew whereupon gian maria found grace to crave his hosts pardon with the explanation that the man had brought him news he had been expecting valdicampo who for the honour of having a duke sleep beneath his roof would have stomached improprieties far more flagrant belittled the matter and dismissed it and presently gian maria rose with the announcement that he had far to journey on the morrow and so with his hosts good leave would be abed  valdicampo himself then played the part of chamberlain and taking up one of the large candle branches he lighted the duke to his apartments he would have carried his good offices and his candles as far as gian marias very bedchamber but that in the anteroom his highness as politely as might be bade him set down the lights and leave him  the duke remained standing for a moment deliberating whether to afford knowledge to alvari and santiwho had followed him and stood awaiting his commandsof what he was about to do in the end he decided that he would act alone and upon his sole discretion so he dismissed them  when they had gone and he was quite alone he clapped his hands together and in answer to that summons the door of his bedroom opened revealing martin armstadt on the threshold  he is there inquired the duke  awaiting your highness answered the swiss and he held the door for gian maria to enter  the bedchamber apportioned the duke in the palazzo valdicampo was a noble and lofty room in the midst of which loomed the great carved bed of honour with its upright pillars and funereal canopy  on the overmantel stood two fivearmed sconces with lighted tapers yet gian maria did not seem to deem that there was light enough for such purpose as he entertained for he bade martin fetch him the candelabra that had been left behind then he turned his attention to the group standing by the window where the light from the overmantel fell full upon it  this consisted of three men two being mercenaries of armstadts guard in corselet and morion and the third who stood captive between the unfortunate ser peppe the fools face was paler than its wont whilst the usual roguery had passed from his eyes and his mouth fear having taken possession of its room he met the dukes cruel glance with one of alarm and piteous entreaty  having assured himself that peppe had no weapons and that his arms were pinioned behind him gian maria bade the two guards withdraw but hold themselves in readiness in the antechamber with armstadt then he turned to peppe with a scowl on his low brow  you are not so merry as you were this morning fool he scoffed  peppino squirmed a little but his nature schooled by the long habit of jest prompted a bold whimsicality in his reply  the circumstances are scarcely as propitiousto me your highness though seems in excellent good­humour  gian maria looked at him angrily a moment he was a slowwitted man and he could devise no ready answer no such cutting gibe as it would have pleasured him to administer he walked leisurely to the fireplace and leant his elbow on the overmantel  your humour led you into saying some things for which i should be merciful if i had you whipped  and by the same reasoning charitable if you had me hanged returned the fool dryly a pale smile on his lips  ah you acknowledge it cried gian maria never seeing the irony intended but i am a very clement prince fool  proverbially clement the jester protested but he did not succeed this time in excluding the sarcasm from his voice  gian maria shot him a furious glance  are you mocking me animal keep your venomous tongue in bounds or ill have you deprived of it  peppes face turned grey at the threat as well it mightfor what should such a one as he do in the world without a tongue  seeing him dumb and stricken the duke continued  now for all that you deserve a hanging for your insolence i am willing that you should come by no hurt so that you answer truthfully such questions as i have for you  peppinos grotesque figure was doubled in a bow  i await your questions glorious lord he answered  you spoke the duke hesitated a moment writhing inwardly at the memory of the exact words in which the fool had spoken you spoke this morning of one whom the lady valentina had met  the fear seemed to increase on the jesters face yes he answered in a choking voice  where did she meet this knight you spoke of and in such wondrous words of praise described to me  in the woods at acquasparta where the river metauro is no better than a brook some two leagues this side of sant angelo  sant angelo echoed gian maria starting at the very mention of the place where the late conspiracy against him had been hatched and when was this  on the wednesday before easter as monna valentina was journeying from santa sofia to urbino  no word spake the duke in answer he stood still his head bowed and his thoughts running again on that conspiracy the mountain fight in which masuccio had been killed had taken place on the tuesday night and the convictionscant though the evidence might begrew upon him that this man was one of the conspirators who had escaped  how came your lady to speak with this manwas he known to her he inquired at last  no highness but he was wounded and so aroused her compassion she sought to minister to his hurt  wounded cried gian maria in a shout now by god it is as i suspected ill swear he got that wound the night before at sant angelo what was his name fool tell me that and you shall go free  for just a second the hunchback seemed to hesitate he stood in awesome fear of gian maria of whose cruelties some ghastly tales were told but in greater fear he stood of the eternal damnation he might earn did he break the oath he had plighted not to divulge that knights identity  alas he sighed i would it might be mine to earn my freedom at so light a price yet it is one that ignorance will not let me pay i do not know his name  the duke looked at him searchingly and suspiciously  dull though he was by nature eagerness seemed now to have set a cunning edge upon his wits and suspicion had led him to observe the fools momentary hesitation  of what appearance was he describe him to me how was he dressed what was the manner of his face  again lord duke i cannot answer you i had but the most fleeting glimpse of him  the dukes sallow countenance grew very evillooking and an ugly smile twisted his lip and laid bare his strong white teeth  so fleeting that no memory of him is left you quoth he  precisely highness  you lie you filth gian maria thundered in a towering rage it was but this morning that you said his height was splendid his countenance noble his manner princely his speech courtly andi know not what besides yet now you tell meyou tell methat your glimpse of him was so fleeting that you cannot describe him you know his name rogue and i will have it from you or else  indeed indeed most noble lord be not incensed the fool began in fearful protestation but the duke interrupted him  incensed he echoed his eyes dilating in a sort of horror at the notion do you dare impute to me the mortal sin of choler i am not incensed there is no anger in me he crossed himself as if to exorcise the evil mood if it indeed existed and devotedly bowing his head and folding his handslibera me a malo domine he murmured audibly then with a greater fierceness than beforenow he demanded will you tell me his name  i would i could the terrified hunchback began but at that the duke turned from him with a shrug of angry impatience and clapping his hands together  olá martino he called instantly the door opened and the swiss appeared bring in your men and your rope  the captain turned on his heel and simultaneously the fool cast himself at gian marias feet  mercy your highness he wailed do not have me hanged i am  we are not going to hang you the duke broke in coldly dead you would indeed be dumb and avail us nothing we want you alive messer peppinoalive and talkative we find you very reserved for a fool but we hope to make you speak  on his knees peppe raised his wild eyes to heaven  mother of the afflicted he prayed at which the duke broke into a contemptuous laugh  what has the heavenly mother to do with such filth as you make your appeals to me i am the more immediate arbiter of your fate tell me the name of that man you met in the woods and all may yet be well with you  peppino knelt in silence a cold sweat gathering on his pale brow and a horrid fear tightening at his heart and throat  and yet greater than this horror they were preparing for him was the horror of losing his immortal soul by a breach of the solemn oath he had sworn gian maria turned from him at last to his bravi who now entered silently and with the air of men who knew the work expected of them martino mounted the bed and swung for an instant from the framework of the canopy  it will hold highness he announced  gian maria bade him since that was so remove the velvet hangings whilst he despatched one of the men to see that the antechamber door was closed so that no cry should penetrate to the apartments of the valdicampo household  in a few seconds all was ready and peppino was rudely lifted from his knees and from the prayers he had been pattering to the virgin to lend him strength in this hour of need  for the last time sir fool quoth the duke will you tell us his name  highness i cannot answered peppe for all that terror was freezing his very blood  a light of satisfaction gleamed now in gian marias eyes  so you know it he exclaimed you no longer protest your ignorance but only that you cannot tell me up with him martino  in a last pitiable struggle against the inevitable the fool broke from his guards and flung himself towards the door one of the burly swiss caught him by the neck in a grip that made him cry out with pain gian maria eyed him with a sinister smile and martin proceeded to fasten one end of the rope to his pinioned wrists then they led him shivering to the great bed the other end of the cord was passed over one of the bared arms of the canopyframe this end was grasped by the two menatarms martin stood beside the prisoner the duke flung himself into a great carved chair an air of relish now investing his round pale face  you know what is about to befall you he said in tones of chilling indifference will you speak before we begin  my lord said the fool in a voice that terror was throttling you are a good christian a loyal son of mother church and a believer in the eternal fires of hell  a frown settled on gian marias brow was the fool about to intimidate him with talk of supernatural vengeance  thus peppe continued you will perhaps be merciful when i confess my position i made most solemn oath to the man i met at acquasparta on that luckless day that i would never reveal his identity what am i to do if i keep my oath you will torture me to death perhaps if i break it i shall be damned eternally have mercy noble lord since now you know how i am placed  the smile broadened on gian marias face and the cruelty of his mouth and eyes seemed intensified by it the fool had told him that which he would have given much to learn he had told him that this man whose name he sought had so feared that his presence that day at acquasparta should become known that he had bound the fool by oath not to divulge the secret of it of what he had before suspected he was now assured the man in question was one of the conspirators probably the very chief of them nothing short of the fools death under torture would now restrain him from learning the name of that unknown who had done him the double injury of conspiring against him andif the fool were to be believedof capturing the heart of valentina  for the damnation of your soul i shall not be called to answer he said at last care enough have i to save my ownfor temptations are many and this poor flesh is weak but it is this mans name i need andby the five wounds of lucia of viterboi will have it will you speak  something like a sob shook the poor fools deformed frame but that was all with bowed head he preserved a stubborn silence the duke made a sign to the men and instantly the two of them threw their weight upon the rope hoisting peppe by his wrists until he was at the height of the canopy itself that done they paused and turned their eyes upon the duke for further orders again gian maria called upon the fool to answer his questions but peppe a writhing misshapen mass from which two wriggling legs depended maintained a stubborn silence  let him go snarled gian maria out of patience the men released the rope and allowed some three feet of it to run through their hands then they grasped it again so that peppes sudden fall was as suddenly arrested by a jerk that almost wrenched his arms from their sockets a shriek broke from him at that exquisite torture and he was dragged once more to the full height of the canopy  will you speak now asked gian maria coldly amusedly almost but still the fool was silent his nether lip caught so tightly in his teeth that the blood trickled from it adown his chin again the duke gave the signal and again they let him go this time they allowed him a longer drop so that the wrench with which they arrested it was more severe than had been the first  peppe felt his bones starting from their joints and it was as if a burning iron were searing him at shoulder elbow and wrist  merciful god he screamed oh have pity noble lord  but the noble lord had him hoisted anew to the canopy writhing there in the extremity of his anguish the poor hunchback poured forth from frothing lips a stream of curses and imprecations invoking heaven and hell to strike his tormentors dead  but the duke from whose demeanour it might be inferred that he was inured to the effect produced by this form of torture looked on with a cruel smile as of one who watches the progress of events towards the end that he desires and has planned he was less patient and his signal came more quickly now for a third time the fool was dropped and drawn up now a short three feet from the ground  this time he did not so much as scream he hung there dangling at the ropes end his mouth all bloody his face ghastly in its glistening pallor and of his eyes naught showing save the whites he hung there and moaned piteously and incessantly martin glanced questioningly at gian maria and his eyes very plainly inquired whether they had not better cease but gian maria paid no heed to him  will that suffice you he asked the fool will you speak now  but the fools only answer was a moan whereupon again at the dukes relentless signal he was swung aloft but at the terror of a fourth drop more fearful than any of its three predecessors he awoke very suddenly to the impossible horror of his position that this agony would endure until he died or fainted he was assured and since he seemed incapable of either fainting or dying suffer more he could not what was heaven or hell to him then that the thought of either could efface the horror of this torture and strengthen him to continue to endure the agony of it he could endure no moreno not to save a dozen souls if he had had them  ill speak he screamed let me down and you shall have his name lord duke  pronounce it first or the manner of your descent shall be as the others  peppe passed his tongue over his bleeding lips hung still and spoke  it was your cousin he panted francesco del falco count of aquila  the duke stared at him a moment with startled countenance and mouth agape  you are telling me the truth animal he demanded in a quivering voice it was the count of aquila who was wounded and whom monna valentina tended  i swear it answered the fool now in the name of god and his blessed saints let me down  for a moment yet he was held there awaiting gian marias signal the duke continued to eye him with that same astonished look what time he turned over in his mind the news he had gathered then conviction of the truth sank into his mind it was the lord of aquila who was the idol of the babbianians what then more natural than that the conspirators should have sought to place him on the throne they proposed to wrest from gian maria he dubbed himself a fool that he had not guessed so much before  let him down he curtly bade his men then take him hence and let him go with god he has served his purpose  gently they lowered him but when his feet touched the ground he was unable to stand his legs doubled under him and he laya little crookbacked heapupon the rushes of the floor his senses had deserted him  at a sign from armstadt the two men picked him up and carried him out between them  gian maria moved across the room to a tapestried prie­dieu and knelt down before an ivory crucifix to render thanks to god for the signal light of grace by which he had vouchsafed to show the duke his enemy  thereafter drawing from the breast of his doublet a chaplet of gold and amber beads he piously discharged his nightly devotions     chapter x the braying of an ass   when on the morrow towards the twentysecond hour the high and mighty gian maria sforza rode into his capital at babbiano he found the city in violent turmoil occasioned as he rightly guessed by the ominous presence of caesar borgias envoy  a dense and sullen crowd met him at the porta romana and preserved a profound silence as he rode into the city accompanied by alvari and santi and surrounded by his escort of twenty spears in full armour there was a threat in that silence more ominous than any vociferations and very white was the dukes face as he darted scowls of impotent anger this way and that but there was worse to come as they rode up the borgo dell annunziata the crowd thickened and the silence was now replaced by a storm of hooting and angry cries the people became menacing and by armstadts ordersthe duke was by now too paralysed with fear to issue anythe menatarms lowered their pikes in order to open a way whilst one or two of the populace who were thrust too near the cavalcade by the surging human tide went down and were trampled under foot  satirical voices asked the duke derisively was he wed and where might be his uncleinlaws spears that were to protect them against the borgia some demanded to know whither the last outrageous levy of taxes was gone and where was the army it should have served to raise to this others replied for the duke suggesting a score of vile uses to which the money had been put  then of a sudden a cry of murderer arose followed by angry demands that he should restore life to the valiant ferrabraccio to amerini the peoples friend and to those others whom he had lately butchered or else follow them in death lastly the name of the count of aquila rang wildly in his ears provoking a storm of evviva live francesco del falco and one persistent voice sounding loudly above the others styled him already il duca francesco at that the blood mounted to gian marias brain and a wave of anger beat back the fear from his heart he rose in his stirrups his eyes ablaze with the jealous wrath that possessed him  ser martino he roared hoarsely to his captain couch lances and go through them at the gallop  the burly swiss hesitated brave man though he was alvaro de alvari and gismondo santi looked at each other in alarm and the intrepid old statesman in whose heart no pang of fear had been awakened by the rabbles threatening bay changed colour as he heard that order given  highness he implored the duke you cannot mean this  not mean it flashed back gian maria his eye travelling from santi to the hesitating captain fool he blazed at the latter brute beast for what do you wait did you not hear me  without a seconds delay the captain now raised his sword and his deep guttural voice barked an order to his men which brought their lances below the horizontal the mob too had heard that fierce command and awakening to their peril those nearest the cavalcade would have fallen back but that the others pressing tightly from behind held them in the deathtide that now swept by with clattering arms and hoarse cries  shrieks filled the air where lately threats had been loudly tossed but some there were in that crowd that would be no passive witnesses of this butchery half the stones of the borgo went after that cavalcade and fell in a persistent shower upon them rattling like giant hail upon their armour dinting many a steelcap to its wearers sore discomfort the duke himself was struck twice and on santis unprotected scalp an ugly wound was opened from which the blood flowed in profusion to dye his snowy locks  in this undignified manner they reached at last the palazzo ducale leaving a trail of dead and maimed to mark the way by which they had come  in a white heat of passion gian maria sought his apartments and came not forth again until some two hours later the presence was announced him of the emissary from caesar borgia duke of valentinois who sought an audience  still beside himself and boiling with wrath at the indignities he had received gian mariain no mood for an interview that would have demanded coolness and presence of mind from a keener brain than hisreceived the envoy a gloomy priestlyfaced spaniard in the throneroom of the palace the duke was attended by alvari santi and fabrizio da lodi whilst his mother caterina colonna occupied a chair of crimson velvet on which the sforza lion was wrought in gold  the interview was brief and marked by a rudeness at its close that contrasted sharply with the ceremoniousness of its inception it soon became clear that the ambassadors true mission was to pick a quarrel with babbiano on his masters behalf to the end that the borgia might be afforded a sound pretext for invading the duchy he demanded at first politely and calmly and laterwhen deniedwith arrogant insistance that gian maria should provide the duke of valentinois with a hundred lancesequivalent to five hundred menas some contribution on his part towards the stand which caesar borgia meant to make against the impending french invasion  gian maria never heeded the restraining words which lodi whispered in his ear urging him to temporise and to put off this messenger until the alliance with the house of urbino should be complete and their position strengthened sufficiently to permit them to brave the anger of caesar borgia but neither this nor the wrathful meaning glances which his cunning mother bent upon him served to curb him he obeyed only the voice of his headstrong mood never dreaming of the consequences with which he might be visited  you will bear to the duca valentino this message from me he said in conclusion you will tell him that what lances i have in babbiano i intend to keep that with them i may defend my own frontiers against his briganding advances messer da lodi he added turning to fabrizio and without so much as waiting to see if the envoy had anything further to say let this gentleman be reconducted to his quarters and see that he has safe conduct hence until he is out of our duchy  when the envoy crimson of face and threatening of eye had withdrawn under lodis escort monna caterina rose the very incarnation of outraged patience and poured her bitter invective upon her rash sons head  fool she stormed at him there goes your duchyin the hollow of that mans hand then she laughed in bitterness after all in casting it from you perhaps you have chosen the wiser course for as truly as there is a god in heaven you are utterly unfitted to retain it  my lady mother he answered her with such dignity as he could muster from the wretched heap in which his wits now seemed to lie you will be well advised to devote yourself to your womans tasks and not to interfere in a mans work  mans work she sneered and you perform it like a petulant boy or a peevish woman  i perform it madonna as best seems to me for it happens that i am duke of babbiano he answered sullenly i do not fear any popes son that ever stepped the alliance with urbino is all but completed let that be established and if valentino shows his teethby god well show ours  aye but with this difference that his are a wolfs teeth and yours a lambs besides this alliance with urbino is all incomplete as yet you had been better advised to have sent away the envoy with some indefinite promise that would have afforded you respite enough in which to seal matters with the house of montefeltro as it is your days are numbered upon that message you have sent him caesar will act at once for my own part i have no mind to fall a prey to the invader and i shall leave babbiano and seek refuge in naples and if a last word of advice i may offer you it is that you do the same  gian maria rose and came down from the dais eyeing her in a sort of dull amazement then he looked as if for help to alvari to santi and lastly to lodi who had returned while caterina was speaking but no word said any of them and grave were the eyes of all  poorspirited are you all he sneered then his face grew dark and his tone concentrated not so am i he assured them if in the past i may have seemed it sometimes i am aroused at length sirs i heard a voice in the streets of babbiano today and i saw a sight that has put a fire into my veins this goodtempered soft indulgent duke you knew is gone the lion is awake at last and you shall see such things as you had not dreamt of  they regarded him now with eyes in which the gravity was increased by a light of fearsome wonder and inquiry was his mind giving way under the prodigious strain that had been set upon it that day if not madness what else did that wild boasting argue  are you all dumb he asked them his eyes feverish or do you deem that i promise more than is mine to fulfil you shall judge and soon tomorrow my lady mother whilst you journey south as you have told us i go north again back to urbino not a day will i now waste within the week sirs by gods grace i shall be wed that will give us urbino for a buckler and with urbino comes perugia and camerino but more than that there is a princely dowry comes to us with the lady valentina how think you will i spend it to the last florin it shall go to the arming of men i will hire me every free condotta in italy i will raise me such an army as has never before been seen at any one time and with this i shall seek out the duca valentino ill not sit here at home awaiting the pleasure of his coming but ill out to meet him and with that army i shall descend upon him as a thunderbolt out of heaven aye my lady mother he laughed in his madness the lamb shall hunt the wolf and rend it so that it shall never stand again to prey on other lambs this will i do my friends and there shall be such fighting as has not been seen since the longdead days of castracani  they stared at him scarce believing now that he was sane and marvelling deeply whence had sprung this sudden martial fervour in one whose nature was more indolent than active more timid than warlike and yet the reason was not far to seek had they but cared to follow the line of thought to which he himself had given them the clue when he referred to the voice he had heard and the sights he had seen in the streets of babbiano the voice was the voice that had acclaimed his cousin francesco duke that it was through that a fierce jealousy had fired him this man had robbed him at once of the love of his people and of valentina and thereby had set in his heart the burning desire to outdo him and to prove wrong in their preference both his people and valentina he was like a gamer who risks all on a single throw and his stake was to be the dowry of his bride the game a tilt with the forces of the borgia if he won he came out covered with glory and not only the saviour of his people and the champion of their liberty but a glorious figure that all italyor at least that part of it that had known the iron heel of valentinoshould revere thus would he set himself right and thus crush from their minds the memory of his rebellious cousin with whom he was about to deal  his mother turned to him now and her words were words of caution prayers that he should adventure on naught so vast and appalling to her womans mind without due thought and argument in council a servant entered at that moment and approached the duke  madonna gian maria announced breaking in upon her earnest words i am fully resolved upon my course if you will but delay a moment and resume your seat you shall witness the first scene of this great drama that i am preparing then turning to the waiting servant your message he demanded  captain armstadt has returned highness and has brought his excellency  fetch lights and then admit them he commanded briefly to your places sirs and you my mother i am about to sit in judgment  amazed and uncomprehending they obeyed his wild gestures and resumed their places by the throne even as he walked back to the dais and sat himself upon the ducal chair servants entered bearing great candelabra of beaten gold which they set on table and overmantel they withdrew and when the doors opened again a clank of mail reaching them from without increased the astonishment of the company  this rose yet higher and left them cold and speechless when into the chamber stepped the count of aquila with a manatarms on either side of him marking him a prisoner with a swift comprehensive glance that took in the entire group about the throneand without manifesting the slightest surprise at lodis presencefrancesco stood still and awaited his cousins words  he was elegantly dressed but without lavishness and if he had the air of a great lord it was rather derived from the distinction of his face and carriage he was without arms and bareheaded save for the gold coif he always wore which seemed to accentuate the lustrous blackness of his hair his face was impassive and the glance as that of a man rather weary of the entertainment provided him  there was an oppressive silence of some moments during which his cousin regarded him with an eye that glittered oddly at last gian maria broke into speech his voice shrill with excitement  know you of any reason he demanded why your head should not be flaunted on a spear among those others on the gate of san bacolo  francescos eyebrows shot up in justifiable astonishment  i know of many he answered with a smile an answer which by its simplicity seemed to nonplus the duke  let us hear some of them he challenged presently  nay let us hear rather some reason why my poor head should be so harshly dealt with when a man is rudely taken as i have been it is a custom which perhaps your highness will follow to afford him some reason for the outrage  you smoothtongued traitor quoth the duke with infinite malice made angrier by his cousins dignity you choicelyspoken villain you would learn why you have been taken tell me sir what did you at acquasparta on the morning of the wednesday before easter  the counts impassive face remained inscrutable a mask of patient wonder by the sudden clenching of his hands alone did he betray how that thrust had smitten him and his hands none there remarked fabrizio da lodi standing behind the duke went pale to the lips  i do not recall that i did anything there of much account he answered i breathed the good spring air in the woods  and nothing else sneered gian maria  i can bethink me of little else that signifies i met a lady there with whom i had some talk a friar a fool a popinjay and some soldiers buthe shifted abruptly his tone growing haughtywhatever i did i did as best seemed to me and i have yet to learn that the count of aquila must give account of what he does and where he does it you have not told me yet sir by what right or fancied right you hold me prisoner  have i not indeed see you no link between your offence and your presence near sant angelo on that day  if i am to apprehend that you have had me brought here with this indignity to set me riddles for your amusement i am enlightened and yet amazed i am no court buffoon  words words snapped the duke do not think to beguile me with them with a short laugh he turned from francesco to those upon the dais you will be marvelling sirs and you my lady mother upon what grounds i have had this traitor seized you shall learn on the night of the tuesday before easter seven traitors met at sant angelo to plot my overthrow of those the heads of four may be seen on the walls of babbiano now the other three made off but there stands one of themthe one that was to have occupied this throne after they had unseated me  the eyes of all were now upon the young count whilst his own glance strayed to the face of lodi on which there was written a consternation so great that it must have betrayed him had the duke but chanced to look his way a pause ensued which none present dared to break gian maria seemed to await an answer from francesco but francesco stood impassively regarding him and made no sign that he would speak at length unable longer to endure the silence  e dunque cried the duke have you no answer  i would submit returned francesco that i have heard no question i heard a wild statement extravagant and mad the accusation of one demented a charge of which no proofs can be forthcoming else i take it you had not withheld them i ask you sirs and you madonna he continued turning to the others has his highness said anything to which an answer can by any means be necessary  is it proofs you lack cried gian maria but less confidently than hitherto and so less fiercely a doubt had arisen in his mind born of this strange calm on the part of francescoa calm that to gian marias perceptions seemed hardly the garb of guilt but belonged rather to one who is assured that no peril threatens him is it proofs you lack quoth the duke again and then with the air of a man launching an unanswerable question how came you by the wound you had that day in the woods  a smile quivered on francescos face and was gone  i asked for proofs not questions he protested wearily what shall it prove if i had a hundred wounds  prove echoed the duke less and less confident of his ground fearing already that he had perhaps gone too fast and too far upon the road of his suspicions it proves to me when coupled with your presence there that you were in the fight the night before  francesco stirred at that he sighed and smiled at once then assuming a tone of brisk command  bid these men begone he said pointing to his guards then hear me scatter your foul suspicions as the hurricane scatters the leaves in autumn  gian maria stared at him in stupefaction that overwhelming assurance that lofty dignified bearing which made such a noble contrast with his own coarse hectoring were gradually undermining more and more his confidence with a wave of his hand he motioned the soldiers to withdraw obeying almost unconsciously the mastermind of his cousin by which he was as unconsciously being swayed  now highness said francesco as soon as the men were gone before i refute the charge you make let me clearly understand it from the expressions you have used i gather it to be this a conspiracy was laid a little time ago at sant angelo which had for object to supplant you on the throne of babbiano and set me in your place you charge me with having had in that conspiracy a partthe part assigned to me it is so is it not  gian maria nodded  you have put it very clearly he sneered if you can make out your innocence as clearly i shall be satisfied that i have wronged you  that this conspiracy took place we will accept as proven although to the people of babbiano the proof may have seemed scant a man since dead had told your highness that such a plot was being hatched hardly perhaps in itself evidence enough to warrant setting the heads of four very valiant gentlemen on spears but no doubt your highness had other proofs to which the rest of us had no access  gian maria shivered at the words he recalled what francesco had said on the occasion of their last talk upon this very subject he remembered the manner of his own reception that day in babbiano  we must be content that it is so calmly pursued francesco indeed your highnesss action in the matter leaves no doubt we will accept then that such a plot was laid but that i had a part in it that i was the man chosen to take your placeneed i prove the idleness of such a charge  you need in truth by god you need if you would save your head  the count stood in an easy posture his hands clasped behind his back and smiled up at his cousins pale face and scowling brow  how mysterious are the ways of your justice cousin he murmured with infinite relish what a wondrous equity invests your methods you have me dragged here by force and sitting there you say to me prove that you have not conspired against me or the headsman shall have you by my faith soloman was a foolish prattler when compared with you  gian maria smote the gilded arm of his chair a blow for which he was to find his hand blackened on the morrow  prove it he screamed like a child in a pet prove it prove it prove it  and have my words not already proven it quoth the count in a voice of such mild wonder and gentle protest that it left gian maria gasping  then the duke made a hasty gesture of impatience  messer alvari he said in a voice of concentrated rage i think you had best recall the guard  wait the count compelled him raising his hand and now it was seen that the easy insouciance was gone from his face the smile had vanished and in its place there was a look of lofty and contemptuous wrath i will repeat my words you have dragged me here before you by force and sitting there on the throne of babbiano you say prove that you have not conspired against me if you would save your head a second he paused and noted the puzzled look with which all regarded him  is this a parable sneered the uncomprehending duke  you have said it flashed back francesco a parable it is and if you consider it does it not afford you proof enough he asked a note of triumph in his voice do not our relative positions irrefutably show the baselessness of this your charge should i stand here and you sit there if what you allege against me were true he laughed almost savagely and his eyes flashed scornfully upon the duke if more plainly still you need it gian maria i tell you that had i plotted to occupy your tottering throne i should be on it now not standing here defending myself against a foolish charge but can you doubt it did you learn no lesson as you rode into babbiano today did you not hear them acclaim me and groan at you and yet he ended with a lofty pity you tell me that i plotted why if i desired your throne my only need would be to unfurl my banner in the streets of your capital and within the hour gian maria would be duke no more have i proved my innocence highness he ended quietly sadly almost are you convinced how little is my need for plots  but the duke had no answer for him speechless and in a sort of dazed horror he sat and scowled before him at his cousins handsome face what time the others watched him furtively in silence trembling for the young man who here in his grasp had dared say such things to him presently he covered his face with his hands and sat so as one deeply in thought a little while at last he withdrew them slowly and presented a countenance that passion and chagrin had strangely ravaged in so little time he turned to santi who stood nearest  the guard he said hoarsely with a wave of the hand and santi went none daring to utter a word they waited thus an odd group all very grave save one and he the one that had most cause for gravity then the captain reentered followed by his two men and gian maria waved a hand towards the prisoner  take him away he muttered harshly his face ghastly and passion shaking him like an aspen take him away and await my orders in the antechamber  if it is farewell cousin said francesco may i hope that you will send a priest to me i have lived a faithful christian  gian maria returned him no answer but his baleful eye was upon martino reading the significance of that glance the captain touched francesco lightly on the arm a moment the count stood looking from the duke to the soldiers a second his glance rested on those assembled there then with a light raising of his shoulders he turned on his heel and with his head high passed out of the ducal chamber  and silence continued after he was gone until caterina colonna broke it with a laugh that grated on gian marias now very tender nerves  you promised bravely she mocked him to play the lion but so far we have only heard the braying of an ass     chapter xi wandering knights   that taunt of his mothers stirred gian maria he rose from his ducal chair and descended from the dais on which it stood possessed by a tempestuous mood that would not brook him to sit still  the braying of an ass he muttered facing caterina then he laughed unpleasantly the jawbone of an ass did sore execution on one occasion madonna and it may again a little patience and you shall see next and with a brisker air he addressed the four silent courtiers you heard him sirs he exclaimed how do you say that i shall deal with such a traitor he waited some seconds for an answer and it seemed to anger him that none came have you then no counsel for me he demanded harshly  i had not thought said lodi hardily that this was a case in which your highness needed counsel you were drawn to conclude that the lord of aquila was a traitor but from what we have all heard your highness should now see that he is not  should i so the duke returned standing still and fixing upon fabrizio an eye that was dull as a snakes messer da lodi your loyalty is a thing that has given signs of wavering of late now if by the grace of god and his blessed saints i have ruled as a merciful prince who errs too much upon the side of clemency i would enjoin you not to try that clemency too far i am but a man after all  he turned from the fearless front presented by the old statesman to face the troubled glances of the others  your silence sirs tells me that in this matter your judgement runs parallel with mine and you are wise for in such a case there can be but one course my cousin has uttered words today which no man has ever said to a prince and lived nor shall we make exception to that rule my lord of aquilas head must pay the price of his temerity  my son cried caterina in a voice of horror gian maria faced her in a passion his countenance grown mottled  i have said it he growled i will not sleep until he dies  yet never may you wake again she answered and with that preamble she launched upon his head the bitterest criticism he had ever heard by stinging epithets and contemptuous words she sought to make him see the folly of what he meditated was he indeed tired of ruling babbiano if that were so she told him he had but to wait for caesar borgias coming he need not precipitate matters by a deed that must lead to a revolt a rising of the people to avenge their idol  you have given me but added reasons he answered her stoutly there is no room in my duchy for a man whose death if it pleased me to encompass it would be avenged upon me by my own people  then send him from your dominions she urged banish him and all may be well but if you slay him i should not count your life worth a days purchase  this advice was sound and in the end they prevailed upon him to adopt it but it was not done save at the cost of endless prayers on the part of those courtiers and the persuasions of caterinas biting scorn and prophecies of the fate that surely awaited him did he touch the life of one so well­beloved at last against his will he sullenly consented that the banishment of his cousin should content him but it was with infinite bitterness and regret that he passed his word for his jealousy was of a quality that nothing short of francescos death could have appeased certain it is that nothing but the fear of the consequences which his mother had instilled into his heart could have swayed him to be satisfied that the count of aquila should be banished  he sent for martino and bade him return the count his sword and he entrusted the message of exile to fabrizio da lodi charging him to apprise francesco that he was allowed twentyfour hours grace in which to take himself beyond the dominions of gian maria sforza  that doneand with an exceedingly ill gracethe duke turned on his heel and with a sullen brow he left the ducal chamber and passed unattended to his own apartments  rejoicing fabrizio da lodi went his errand which he discharged with certain additions that might have cost him his head had knowledge of them come to gian maria in fact he seized the opportunity to again press upon francesco the throne of babbiano  the hour is very ripe he urged the count and the people love you as surely prince was never loved it is in their interests that i plead you are their only hope will you not come to them  if for a moment francesco hesitated it was rather in consideration of the manner in which the crown was offered than in consequence of any allurement that the offer may have had for him oncethat night at sant angelohe had known temptation and for a moment had listened to the seductions in the voice that invited him to power but not so now a thought he gave to the people who had such faith in him and showered upon him such admiring love and whom as a matter of reciprocity he wished well and would have served in any capacity but this he shook his head and with a smile of regret declined the offer  have patience old friend he added i am not of the stuff that goes to make good princes although you think it it is a bondage into which i would not sell myself a mans life for me fabrizioa free life that is not directed by councillors and at the mercy of the rabble  fabrizios face grew sad he sighed profoundly yet since it might not be well for him that he should remain overlong in talk with one who in the dukes eyes was attainted with treason he had not leisure to insist with persuasions which after all he clearly saw must in the end prove barren  what was the salvation of the people of babbiano he murmured was also your excellencys since did you adopt the course i urge there would be no need to go in banishment  why this exile suits me excellently well returned francesco idle have i been overlong and the wish to roam is in my veins again ill see the world once more and when i weary of my vagrancy i can withdraw to my lands of aquila and in that corner of tuscany too mean to draw a conquerors eye none will molest me and i shall rest babbiano my friend shall know me no more after tonight when i am gone and the people realise that they may not have what they would they may rest content perhaps with what they may and he waved a hand in the direction of the doors leading to the ducal chamber with that he took his leave of his old friend and carrying in his hand the sword and dagger which captain armstadt had returned to him he repaired briskly to the northern wing of the palace in which he had his lodging  in the anteroom he dismissed those of his servants who had been taken from the ranks of the dukes people and bade his own tuscan followers zaccaria and lanciotto see to the packing of his effects and make all ready to set out within the hour  he was no coward but he had no wish to die just yet if it might be honourably avoided life had some sweets to offer francesco del falco and this spurred him to hasten for he well knew his cousins unscrupulous ways he was aware that gian maria had been forced by weight of argument to let him go and he shrewdly feared that did he linger his cousin might veer round again and without pausing to seek advice a second time have him disposed of out of hand and reckless of consequences  whilst lanciotto was left busy in the anteroom the count passed into his bedchamber attended by zaccaria to make in his raiment such changes as were expedient but scarce had he begun when he was interrupted by the arrival of fanfulla degli arcipreti whom lanciotto ushered in francescos face lighted at sight of his friend and he held out his hand  what is it that has happened cried the young gallant adding that which showed his question to be unnecessary for from fabrizio da lodi he had had the whole story of what was befallen he sat himself upon the bed and utterly disregarding the presence of zaccariawhom he knew to be faithfulhe attempted to persuade the count where fabrizio had failed but paolo cut him short ere he had gone very far  have done with that he said and for all that he said it with a laugh determination sounded sturdy in his accents i am a knighterrant not a prince and ill not be converted from one to the other it were making a helot of a free man and you do not love me fanfulla if you drive this argument further do you think me sad cast down at the prospect of this banishment why boy the blood runs swifter through my veins since i heard the sentence it frees me from babbiano in an hour when perhaps my dutythe reciprocation of the peoples lovemight otherwise have held me here and it gives me liberty to go forth my good fanfulla in quest of such adventure as i choose to follow he threw out his arms and displayed his splendid teeth in a hearty laugh  fanfulla eyed him infected by the boisterous gladness of his mood  why true indeed my lord he acknowledged you are too fine a bird to sing in a cage but to go knighterranting he paused and spread his hands in protest there are no longer dragons holding princesses captive  alas no but the venetians are on the eve of war and they will find work for these hands of mine i want not for friends among them  fanfulla sighed  and so we lose you the stoutest arm in babbiano leaves us in the hour of need driven out by that loutish duke by my soul ser francesco i would i might go with you here is nothing to be done  francesco paused in the act of drawing on a boot and raised his eyes to stare a moment at his friend  but if you wish it fanfulla i shall rejoice to have your company  and now the idea of it entered fanfullas mind in earnest for his expression had been more or less an idle one but since francesco invited him why not indeed  and thus it came to pass that at the third hour of that warm may night a party of four men on horseback and two sumpter mules passed out of babbiano and took the road that leads to vinamare and thence into the territory of urbino these riders were the count of aquila and fanfulla degli arcipreti followed by lanciotto leading a mule that bore the arms of those knightserrant and zaccaria leading another with their general baggage  all night they rode beneath the stars and on until some three hours after sunrise when they made halt in a hollow of the hills not far from fabriano they tethered their horses in a grove of peaceful laurel and sheltering mulberry at the foot of a slope that was set with olive trees grey gnarled and bent as aged cripples and beside the river esino at a spot where it was so narrow that an agile man might leap its width here then they spread their cloaks and zaccaria unpacked his victuals and set before them a simple meal of bread and wine and roasted fowl which to their hunger made more appeal than a banquet at another season and when they had eaten they laid them down beside the stream and there beguiled in pleasant talk the time until they fell asleep they rested them through the heat of the day and waking some three hours after noon the count rose up and went some dozen paces down the stream to a spot where it fell into a tiny lakea pool deep and blue as the cloudless heavens which it mirrored here he stripped off his garments and plunged headlong in to emerge again some moments later refreshed and reinvigorated in body and in soul  as fanfulla awoke he beheld an apparition coming towards him a figure lithe and stalwart as a sylvian god the water shining on the ivory whiteness of his skin and glistening in his sable hair as the sunlight caught it  tell me now fanfulla lives there a man of so depraved a mind that he would prefer a ducal crown to this  and the courtier seeing francescos radiant mien understood perhaps at last how sordid was the ambition that could lure a man from such a godlike freedom and from the holy allconsuming joys it brought him his thoughts being started upon that course it was of this they talked what time the count resumed his garmentshis hose of red his kneehigh boots of untanned leather and his quilted brigandine of plain brown cloth reputed daggerproof he rose at last to buckle on his belt of hammered steel from which there hung behind his loins a stout lengthy dagger the only weapon that he carried  at his command the horses were saddled and the sumpters laden once more lanciotto held his stirrup and zaccaria did like service for fanfulla and presently they were cantering out of that fragrant grove on to the elastic sward of broad green pasturelands they crossed the stream at a spot where the widened sheet of water scarce went higher than their horses hocks then veering to the east they rode away from the hills for a halfleague or so until they gained a road here they turned northward again and pushed on towards cagli  as the bells were ringing the ave maria the cavalcade drew up before the palazzo valdicampo where two nights ago gian maria had been entertained its gates were now as readily thrown wide to welcome the illustrious and glorious count of aquila who was esteemed by messer valdicampo no less than his more puissant cousin chambers were set at his disposal and at fanfullas servants were bidden to wait upon them fresh raiment was laid out for them and a noble supper was prepared to do honour to francesco nor did the generous valdicampos manner cool when he learned that francesco was in disgrace at the court of babbiano and banished from the dominions of duke gian maria he expressed sympathetic regret at so untoward a circumstance and discreetly refrained from passing any opinion thereupon  yet later as they supped and when perhaps the choice wines had somewhat relaxed his discretion he permitted himself to speak of gian marias ways in terms that were very far from laudatory  here in my house he informed them he committed an outrage upon a poor unfortunate for which an account may yet be asked of mesince it was under my roof that the thing befell for all that i knew nothing of it  upon being pressed by paolo to tell them more he parted with the information that the unfortunate in question was urbinos jester peppe at that paolos glance became more intent the memory of his meeting with the fool and his mistress in the woods a month ago flashed now across his mind and it came to him that he could rightly guess the source whence his cousin had drawn the information that had led to his own arrest and banishment  of what nature was the outrage he inquired  from what peppe himself has told me it would seem that the fool was possessed of some knowledge which gian maria sought but on which peppe was bound by oath to silence gian maria caused him to be secretly taken and carried off from urbino his sbirri brought the fellow here and to make him speak the duke improvised in his bedchamber a tratta di corde which had the desired result  the counts face grew dark with anger the coward he muttered the dastardly craven  but bethink you sir count exclaimed valdicampo that this poor peppe is a frail and deformed creature lacking the strength of an ordinary man and do not judge him overharshly  it was not of him i spoke replied francesco but of my cousin that cowardly tyrant gian maria sforza tell me messer valdicampowhat has become of ser peppe  he is still here i have had him tended and his condition is already much improved it will not be long ere he is recovered but for a few days yet his arms will remain almost useless they were all but torn from his body  when the meal was done francesco begged his host to conduct him to peppes chamber this valdicampo did and leaving fanfulla in the company of the ladies of his house he escorted the count to the room where the poor illused hunchback was abed tended by one of the women of valdicampos household  here is a visitor to see you ser peppe the old gentleman announced setting down his candle on a table by the bed the jester turned his great head towards the newcomers and sought with melancoly eyes the face of his visitor at sight of him a look of terror spread itself upon his countenance  my lord he cried struggling into a sitting posture my noble gracious lord have mercy on me i could tear out this craven tongue of mine but did you know what agonies i suffered and to what a torture they submitted me to render me unfaithful it may be that you yourself would pity me  why that i do answered francesco gently indeed could i have seen the consequences that oath would have for you i had not bound you by it  the fear in peppes face gave place to unbelief  and you forgive me lord he cried i dreaded when you entered that you were come to punish me for what wrong i may have done you in speaking but if you forgive me it may be that heaven will forgive me also and that i may not be damned and that were a thousand pities for what my lord should i do in hell  deride the agonies of gian maria answered francesco with a laugh  it were almost worth burning for mused peppe putting forth a hand whose lacerated swollen wrist bore evidence to the torture he had suffered at sight of it the count made an exclamation of angry horror and hastened to inquire into the poor fools condition  it is not so bad now peppe answered him and it is only in consequence of messer valdicampos insistence that i have kept my bed i can scarce use my arms it is true but they are improving tomorrow i shall be up and i hope to set out for urbino where my dear mistress must be distressed with fears for my absence for she is a very kind and tender­hearted lady  this resolve of peppes prompted the count to offer to conduct him to urbino on the morrow since he himself would be journeying that wayan offer which the fool accepted without hesitation and with lively gratitude     chapter xii the fools inquisitiveness   in the morning francesco set out once more accompanied by his servants fanfulla and the fool the latter was now so far restored as to be able to sit a mule but lest the riding should overtire him they proceeded at little more than an ambling pace along the lovely valleys of the metauro thus it befell that when night descended it found them still journeying and some two leagues distant from urbino another league they travelled in the moonlight and the fool was beguiling the time for them with a droll story culled from the bright pages of messer boccaccio when of a sudden his sharp ears caught a sound that struck him dumb in the middle of a sentence  are you faint asked francesco turning quickly towards him and mindful of the fellows sore condition  no no answered the fool with a readiness that dispelled the counts alarm on that score i thought i heard a sound of marching in the distance  the wind in the trees peppino explained fanfulla  i do not think he stopped short and listened and now they all heard it for it came wafted to them on a gust of the fitful breeze that smote their faces  you are right said francesco it is the tramp of men but what of that peppe men will march in italy let us hear the end of your story  but who should march in urbino and by night the fool persisted  do i know or do i care quoth the count your story man  for all that he was far from satisfied the fool resumed his narrative but he no longer told it with his former irresistible humour his mind was occupied with that sound of marching which came steadily nearer at length he could endure it no longer and the apathy of his companions fired him openly to rebel  my lord he cried turning to the count and again leaving his story interrupted they are all but upon us  true agreed francesco indifferently the next turn yonder should bring us into them  then i beg you lord count to step aside let us pause here under the trees until they have passed i am full of fears perhaps i am a coward but i mislike these roving nighthands it may be a company of masnadieri  what then returned the count without slackening speed what cause have we to fear a party of robbers  but fanfulla and the servants joined their advice to peppes and prevailed at last upon francesco to take cover until this company should have passed he consented to pacify them and wheeling to the right they entered the border of the forest drawing rein well in the shadow whence they could survey the road and see who passed across the patch of moonlight that illumined it and presently the company came along and swung into that revealing flood of light to the astonishment of the watchers they beheld no marauding party such as they had been led to expect but a very orderly company of some twenty men soberly arrayed in leather hacketons and salades of bright steel marching sword on thigh and pike on shoulder at the head of this company rode a powerfullybuilt man on a great sorrel horse at sight of whom the fool swore softly in astonishment in the middle of the party came four litters borne by mules and at the side of one of them rode a slender graceful figure that provoked from peppe a second oath but the profoundest objurgation of all was wrung from him at sight of a portly bulk in the black habit of the dominicans ambling in the rear who just then was in angry altercation with a fellow that was urging his mule along with the butt of his partisan  may you be roasted on a gridiron like saint lawrence gasped the irate priest would you break my neck brute beast that you are do you but wait until we reach roccaleone and by st dominic ill get your ruffianly commander to hang you for this illseasoned jest  but his tormentor laughed for answer and smote the mule again a blow this time that almost caused it to rear up the friar cried out in angry alarm and then still storming and threatening his persecutor he passed on after him came six heavilyladen carts each drawn by a pair of bullocks and the rear of the procession was brought up by a flock of a dozen bleating sheep herded by a blasphemant manatarms they passed the astonished watchers who remained concealed until that odd company had melted away into the night  i could swear said fanfulla that that friar and i have met before  nor would you do a perjury answered him the fool for it is that fat hog fra domenicohe that went with you to the convent of acquasparta to fetch unguents for his excellency  what does he in that company and who are they asked the count turning to the fool as they rode out of their ambush  ask me where the devil keeps his lures quoth the fool and ill make some shift to answer you but as for what does fra domenico in that galley it is more than i can hazard a guess on he is not the only one known to me peppino added there was ercole fortemani a great dirty blustering ruffian whom i never saw in aught but rags riding at their heads in garments of most unwonted wholeness and there was romeo gonzaga whom i never knew to stir by night save to an assignation strange things must be happening in urbino  and the litters inquired francesco can you hazard no guess as to their meaning  none said he saving that they may account for the presence of messer gonzaga for litters argue women  it seems fool that not even your wisdom shall avail us but you heard the friar say they were bound for roccaleone  yes i heard that and by means of it we shall probably learn the rest at the end of our journey  and being a man of extremely inquisitive mind the fool set his inquiries on foot the moment they entered the gates of urbino in the morningfor they had reached the city overlate to gain admittance that same night and were forced to seek shelter in one of the houses by the river it was of the captain of the gate that he sought information  can you tell me ser capitan he inquired what company was that that travelled yesternight to roccaleone  the captain looked at him a moment  there was none that i know of said he certainly none from urbino  you keep a marvellous watch said the fool drily i tell you that a company of menatarms some twenty strong went last night from urbino to roccaleone  to roccaleone echoed the captain with a musing air more attentively than before as if the repetition of that name had suggested something to his mind why it is the castle of monna valentina  true sapient sir but what of the company and why was it travelling so by night  how know you it proceeded from urbino quoth the captain earnestly  because at its head i recognised the roaring warrior ercole fortemani in the middle rode romeo gonzaga in the rear came fra domenico madonnas confessormen of urbino all  the officers face grew purple at the news  were there any women in the party he cried  i saw none replied the fool in whom this sudden eagerness of the captains awakened caution and reflection  but there were four litters put in francesco whose nature was less suspicious and alert than the wise fools  too late peppe scowled caution at him the captain swore a great oath  it is she he cried with assurance and this company was travelling to roccaleone you say how know you that  we heard it from the friar answered francesco readily  then by the virgin we have them olá he turned from them and ran shouting into the gatehouse to reemerge a moment later with halfdozen soldiers at his heels  to the palace he commanded and as his men surrounded francescos party come sir he said to the count you must go with us and tell your story to the duke  there is no need for all this force answered francesco coldly in any case i could not pass through urbino without seeing duke guidobaldo i am the count of aquila  at once the captains bearing grew respectful he made his apologies for the violent measures of his zeal and bade his men fall behind ordering them to follow him he mounted a horse that was brought him and rode briskly through the borgo at the counts side and as he rode he told them what the jesters quick intuition had already whispered to him the lady valentina was fled from urbino in the night and in her company were gone three of her ladies andit was also supposed since they had disappearedfra domenico and romeo gonzaga  aghast at what he heard francesco pressed his informer for more news but there was little more that the captain could tell him beyond the fact that it was believed she had been driven to it to escape her impending marriage with the duke of babbiano guidobaldo was distraught at what had happened and anxious to bring the lady back before news of her behaviour should reach the ears of gian maria it was therefore a matter of no little satisfaction to the captain that the task should be his to bear guidobaldo this news of her whereabouts which from francesco and the jester he had derived  peppe looked glum and sullen had he but bridled his cursed curiosity and had the count but taken the alarm in time and held his peace all might have been well with his beloved patrona as it was hethe one man ready to die that he might serve herhad been the very one to betray her refuge he heard the counts laugh and the sound of it was fuel to his anger but francesco only thought of the splendid daring of the ladys action  but these menatarms that she had with her he cried for what purpose so numerous a bodyguard  the captain looked at him a moment  can you not guess he inquired perhaps you do not know the castle of roccaleone  it were odd if i did not know the most impregnable fortress in italy  why then does it not become clear she has taken this company for a garrison and in roccaleone she clearly intends to resist in rebel fashion the wishes of his highness  at that the count threw back his head and scared the passersby with as hearty a peal of laughter as ever crossed his lips  by the host he gasped laughter still choking his utterance there is a maid for you do you hear what the captain says fanfulla she means to resist this wedding by armed force if needs be now on my soul if guidobaldo insists upon the union after this why then he has no heart no feeling as i live she is a kinswoman that such a warlike prince might well be proud of small wonder that they do not fear the borgia in urbino and he laughed again but the captain scowled at him and peppe frowned  she is a rebellious jade quoth the captain sourly  nay softly returned francesco for all that he still laughed if you were of knightly rank id break a lance with you on that score as it is he paused his laughter ceased and his dark eyes took the captains measure in a curious way best leave her uncensured ser capitano she is of the house of rovere and closely allied to that of montefeltro  the officer felt the rebuke and silence reigned between them after that  it was whilst francesco fanfulla and peppe waited in the antechamber for admittance to the duke that the jester vented some of the bitterness he felt at their babbling the splendid room was thronged with a courtly crowd there were magnificent nobles and envoys dark ecclesiastics and purple prelates captains in steel and court officers in silk and velvet yet heedless of who might hear him peppe voiced his rebuke and the terms he employed were neither as measured nor as respectful as the counts rank dictated yet with that fairness of mind that made him so universally beloved francesco offered no resentment to the fools reproof he saw that it was deserved for it threw upon the matter a light that was new and more searching but he presently saw further than did the fool and he smiled at the others scowls  not so loud peppe said he you overestimate the harm at worst we have but anticipated by a little what the duke must have learnt from other sources  but it is just that littlethe few hours or daysthat will do the mischief snapped the jester testily for all that he lowered his voice in a few days gian maria will be back if he were met with the news that the lady valentina were missing that she had run away with romeo gonzagafor that youll see will presently be the taledo you think he would linger here or further care to pursue his wooing not he these alliances that are for state purposes alone in which the heart plays no part demand at least that on the ladys side there shall be a record unblemished by the breath of scandal his highness would have returned him home and madonna would have been rid of him  but at a strange price peppe answered franeesco gravely still he added i agree that i would have served her purpose better by keeping silent but that such an affair will cool the ardour of my cousin i do not think you are wrong in placing this among the alliances in which the heart has no part on my cousins sideif all they say be truethe heart plays a very considerable part indeed but for the restwhat harm have we done  time will show said the hunchback  it will show then that i have done no hurt whatever to her interests by now she is safe in roccaleone what then can befall her guidobaldo no doubt will repair to her and across the moat he will entreat her to be a dutiful niece and to return she will offer to do so on condition that he pass her his princely word not to further molest her with the matter of this marriage and then  well growled the fool and then who shall say what may befall then let us say that his highness reduces her by force  a siege laughed the count pooh where is your wisdom fool do you think the splendid guidobaldo is eager to become the sport of italy and go down to posterity as the duke who besieged his niece because she resisted his ordainings touching the matter of her wedding  guidobaldo da montefeltro can be a violent man upon occasion the fool was answering when the officer who had left them reappeared with the announcement that his highness awaited them  they found the prince in a very gloomy mood and after greeting francesco with cool ceremony he questioned him on the matter of the company they had met yesternight these inquiries he conducted with characteristic dignity and no more show of concern than if it had been an affair of a strayed falcon he thanked francesco for his information and gave orders that the seneschal should place apartments at his and fanfullas disposal for as long as it should please them to grace his court with that he dismissed them bidding the officer remain to receive his orders  and that said francesco to peppe as they crossed the antechamber in the wake of a servant is the man who would lay siege to his nieces castle for once sir fool your wisdom is at fault  you do not know the duke excellency answered the fool beneath that frozen exterior burns a furnace and there is no madness he would not commit  but francesco only laughed as linking arms with fanfulla he passed down the gallery on his way to the apartments to which the servant was conducting them     chapter xiii gian maria makes a vow   in a measure the events that followed would almost tend to show that the fool was right for even if the notion of besieging valentina and reducing her by force of arms was not guidobaldos own in the first place yet he lent a very willing ear to the counsel that they should thus proceed when angrily urged two days thereafter by the duke of babbiano  upon hearing the news gian maria had abandoned himself to such a licence of rage as made those about him tremble from the highest to the meanest the disappointment of his passion was in itself justification enough for this but in addition gian maria beheld in the flight of valentina the frustration of those bold schemes of which had talked so loudly to his councillors and his mother it was his confidence in those same schemes that had induced him to send that defiant answer to caesar borgia as a consequence of this there was hastemost desperate hastethat he should wed since wedding was to lend him the power to carry out his brave promises of protecting his crown from the duke of valentinois not to speak of the utter routing of the borgia which he had wildly undertaken to accomplish  that the destinies of states should be tossed to the winds of heaven by a slip of a girl was to him something as insufferable as it had been unexpected  she must be brought back he had screeched in his towering passion she must be brought back at once  true answered guidobaldo in his serene way she must be brought back so far i agree with you entirely tell me now how the thing is to be accomplished and there was sarcasm in his voice  what difficulties does it present inquired gian maria  no difficulties was the ironical reply she has shut herself up in the stoutest castle in italy and tells me that she will not come forth until i promise her freedom of choice in the matter of marriage clearly there are no difficulties attached to her being brought back  gian maria showed his teeth  do you give me leave to go about it in my own way he asked  not only do i give you leave but ill render you all the assistance in my power if you can devise a means for luring her from roccaleone  i hesitate no longer your niece lord duke is a rebel and as a rebel is she to be treated she has garrisoned a castle and hurled defiance at the ruler of the land it is a declaration of war highness and war we shall have  you would resort to force asked guidobaldo disapproval lurking in his voice  to the force of arms your highness answered gian maria with prompt fierceness i will lay siege to this castle of hers and i shall tear it stone from stone oh i would have wooed her nicely had she let me with gentle words and mincing ways that maidens love but since she defies us ill woo her with arquebuse and cannon and seek by starvation to make her surrender to my suit my love shall put on armour to subject her and i vow to god that i shall not shave my beard until i am inside her castle  guidobaldo looked grave  i should counsel gentler measures said he besiege her if you will but do not resort to too much violence cut off their resources and let hunger be your advocate even so i fear me you will be laughed at by all italy he added bluntly  a fig for that let the fools laugh if they be minded to what forces has she at roccaleone  at the question guidobaldos brow grew dark it was as if he had recalled some circumstance that had lain forgotten  some twenty knaves led by a notorious ruffian of the name of fortemani the company was enrolled they tell me by a gentleman of my court a kinsman of my duchess messer romeo gonzaga  is he with her now gasped gian maria  it would seem he is  by the virgins ring of perugia spluttered gian maria in increased dismay do you suggest that they fled together  my lord guidobaldos voice rang sharp and threatening it is of my niece that you are speaking she took this gentleman with her just as she took three of her ladies and a page or two to form such attendance as befits her birth  gian maria took a turn in the apartment a frown wrinkling his brow and his lips pressed tight guidobaldos proud words by no means convinced him but the one preponderating desire in his heart just then was to humble the girl who had dared to flout him to make her bend her stubborn neck at last  i may indeed become the laughingstock of italy he muttered in a concentrated voice but i shall carry my resolve through and my first act upon entering roccaleone will be to hang this knave gonzaga from its highest turret  that very day gian maria began his preparations for the expedition against roccaleone and word of it was carried by fanfulla to francescofor the latter had left his quarters at the palace upon hearing of gian marias coming and was now lodging at the sign of the sun  upon hearing the news he swore a mighty oath in which he consigned his cousin to the devil by whom in that moment he pronounced him begotten  do you think he asked when he was calmer that this man gonzaga is her lover  it is more than i can say answered fanfulla there is the fact that she fled with him though when i questioned peppe on this same subject he first laughed the notion to scorn and then grew grave she loves him not the popinjay he said but he loves her or i am blind else and hes a villain i know  francesco stood up his face mighty serious and his dark eyes full of uneasy thought  by the host it is a shameful thing he cried out at last this poor lady so beset on every hand by a parcel of villains each more unscrupulous than the other fanfulla send for peppe we must despatch the fool to her with warning of gian marias coming and warning too against this man of mantua she has fled with  too late answered fanfulla the fool departed this morning for roccaleone to join his patrona  francesco looked his dismay  she will be undone he groaned thus between the upper and the nether stonebetween gian maria and romeo gonzaga gesù she will be undone and she so brave and so highspirited  he moved slowly to the casement and stood staring at the windows across the street on which the setting sun fell in a ruddy glow but it was not the windows that he saw it was a scene in the woods at acquasparta on that morning after the mountain fight a man lying wounded in the bracken and over him a gentle lady bending with eyes of pity and solicitude often since had his thoughts revisited that scene sometimes with a smile sometimes with a sigh and sometimes with both at once  he turned suddenly upon fanfulla i will go myself he announced  you echoed fanfulla but the venetians  by a gesture the count signified how little the venetians weighed with him when compared with the fortunes of this lady  i am going to roccaleone he insisted nowat once and striding to the door he beat his hands together and called lanciotto  you said fanfulla that in these days there are no longer maidens held in bondage to whom a knighterrant may lend aid you were at fault for in monna valentina we have the captive maiden in my cousin the dragon in gonzaga another and in me the errant knight who is destinedi hopeto save her  you will save her from gian maria questioned fanfulla incredulously  i will attempt it  he turned to his servant who entered as he spoke  we set out in a quarter of an hour lanciotto said he saddle for me and for yourself you are to go with me zaccaria may remain with messer degli arcipreti you will care for him fanfulla and he will serve you well  but what of me cried fanfulla do i not accompany you  if you will yes but you might serve me better by returning to babbiano and watching the events there sending me word of what befallsfor great things will befall soon if my cousin returns not and the borgia advances it is upon this that i am founding such hopes as i have  but whither shall i send you word to roccaleone  francesco reflected a moment if you do not hear from me then send your news to roccaleone for if i should linger there and we are besieged it will perhaps be impossible to send a message to you but ifas i hopei go to aquila i will send you word of it  to aquila  yes it may be that i shall be at aquila before the week is out but keep it secret fanfulla and ill fool these dukes to the very top of their unhealthy bent  a halfhour later the count of aquila mounted on a stout calabrian horse and attended by lanciotto on a mule rode gently down towards the valley they went unnoticed for what cared for them the peasants that sang at their labours in the contado  they met a merchant whose servant was urging his laden sumpters up the hilly road to the city on the heights and they passed him with a courteous greeting farther they came upon a mounted company of nobles and ladies returning from a hawking party and followed by attendants bearing their hooded falcons and their gay laughter still rang in francescos ears after he had passed from their sight and vanished in the purple mists of eventide that came up to meet him from the river  they turned westward towards the apennines and pushed on after night had fallen until the fourth hour when at francescos suggestion they drew rein before a sleepy wayside locanda and awoke the host to demand shelter there they slept no longer than until matins so that the grey light of dawn saw them once more upon their way and by the time the sun had struck with its first golden shaft the grey crest of the old hills they drew rein on the brink of the roaring torrent at the foot of the mighty crag that was crowned by the castle of roccaleone  grim and gaunt it loomed above the fertile vale with that torrent circling it in a natural moat like a giant sentinel of the apennines that were its background and now the sunlight raced down the slopes of the old mountains like a tide it smote the square tower of the keep then flowed adown the wall setting the old grey stone agleaming and flashing back from a mullioned window placed high up lower it came revealing grotesque gargoyles flooding the crenellated battlements and turning green the ivy and lichen that but a moment back had blackened the stout projecting buttresses thence it leapt to the ground and drove the shadow before it down the grassy slope until it reached the stream and sparkled on its foaming tumbling waters scattering a hundred colours through the flying spray  and all that time until the sun had reached him and included him in the picture it was awakening the count of aquila sat in his saddle with thoughtful eyes uplifted to the fortress  then lanciotto following him he walked his horse round the western side where the torrent was replaced by a smooth arm of water for which a cutting had been made to complete the isolation of the crag of roccaleone but here where the castle might more easily have become vulnerable a blank wall greeted him broken by no more than a narrow slit or two midway below the battlements he rode on towards the northern side crossing a footbridge that spanned the river and at last coming to a halt before the entrance tower here again the moat was formed by the torrential waters of the mountain stream  he bade his servant rouse the inmates and lanciotto hallooed in a voice that nature had made deep and powerful the echo of it went booming up to scare the birds on the hillside but evoked no answer from the silent castle  they keep a zealous watch laughed the count again lanciotto  the man obeyed him and again and again his deep voice rang out like a trumpetcall before sign was made from within that it had been heard at length above the parapet of the tower appeared a stunted figure with head unkempt as grotesque almost as any of the gargoyles beneath and an owlish face peered at them from one of the crenels of the battlement and demanded in surly croaking tones their business instantly the count recognised peppe  good morrow fool he bade him  you my lord exclaimed the jester  you sleep soundly at roccaleone quoth francesco bestir that knavish garrison of yours and bid the lazy dogs let down the bridge i have news for monna valentina  at once excellency the fool replied and would have gone upon the instant but that francesco recalled him  say peppe a knightthe knight she met at acquasparta if you will but leave my name unspoken  with the assurance that he would obey his wishes peppe went his errand a slight delay ensued and then upon the battlements appeared gonzaga sleepy and contentious attended by a couple of fortemanis knaves who came to ask the nature of francescos business  it is with monna valentina answered him francesco raising head and voice so that gonzaga recognised him for the wounded knight of acquasparta remembered and scowled  i am monna valentinas captain here he announced with arrogance and you may deliver to me such messages as you bear  there followed a contention conducted illhumouredly on the part of gonzaga and scarcely less so on the counts francesco stoutly refusing to communicate his business to any but valentina and gonzaga as stoutly refusing to disturb the lady at that hour or to lower the bridge words flew between them across the waters of the moat and grew hotter at each fresh exchange till in the end they were abruptly terminated by the appearance of valentina herself attended by peppino  what is this gonzaga she inquired her manner excited for the fool had told her that it was the knight francesco who sought admittance and at the very mention of the name she had flushed then paled then started for the ramparts why is this knight denied admittance since he bears a message for me and from where she stood she sought with admiring eyes the graceful shape of the count of aquilathe knighterrant of her dreams francesco bared his head and bent to the withers of his horse in courteous greeting she turned to gonzaga impatiently  for what do you wait she cried have you not understood my wishes let the bridge be lowered  bethink you madonna he remonstrated you do not know this man he may be a spy of gian mariasa hireling paid to betray us  you fool she answered sharply do you not see that it is the wounded knight we met that day you were escorting me to urbino  what shall that signify demanded he is it proof of his honesty of purpose or loyalty to you be advised madonna and let him deliver his message from where he is he is safer there  she measured him with a determined eye  messer gonzaga order them to lower the bridge she bade him  but lady bethink you of your peril  peril she echoed peril from two men and we a garrison of over twenty surely the man is a coward who talks so readily of perils have the drawbridge lowered  but if he began with a desperate vehemence when again she cut him short  am i to be obeyed am i mistress and will you bid them lower the bridge or must i myself go see to it  with a look of despairing anger and a shrug of the shoulders he turned from her and despatched one of his men with an order a few moments later with a creaking of hinges and a clanking of chains the great bridge swung down and dropped with a thud to span the gulf instantly the count spurred his horse forward and followed by lanciotto rode across the plank and under the archway of the entrance tower into the first courtyard  now scarcely had he drawn rein there when through a door at the far end appeared the gigantic figure of fortemani halfclad and sword in hand at sight of francesco the fellow leaped down a halfdozen steps and advanced towards him with a burst of oaths  to me he shouted in a voice that might have waked the dead olá olá what devils work is this how come you here by whose orders was the bridge let down  by the orders of monna valentinas captain answered francesco wondering what madman might be this  captain cried the other coming to a standstill and his face turning purple body of satan what captain i am captain here  the count looked him over in surprise  why then said he you are the very man i seek i congratulate you on the watch you keep messer capitano your castle is so excellently patrolled that had i been minded for a climb i had scaled your walls and got within your gates without arousing any of your slumbering sentries  fortemani eyed him with a lowering glance the prosperity of the past four days had increased the insolence inherent in the man  is that your affair he growled menacingly you are overbold sir stranger to seek a quarrel with me and overpert to tell me how i shall discharge my captaincy by the passion you shall be punished  punishedi echoed francesco on whose brow there now descended a scowl as black as ercoles own  aye punished young sir ercole fortemani is my name  i have heard of you answered the count contemptuously and of how you belie that name of yours for they tell me that a more drunken cowardly goodfornothing rogue is not to be found in italyno not even in the popes dominions and have a care how you cast the word punishment at your betters animal the moat is none so distant and the immersion may profit you for ill swear youve not been washed since they baptized youif indeed you be a son of mother church at all  sangue di cristo spluttered the enraged bully his face mottled this to me come down from that horse  he laid hold of francescos leg to drag him to the ground but the count wrenched it free by a quick motion that left a gash from his spur upon the captains hands simultaneously he raised his whip and would have laid the lash of it across the broad of fortemanis backfor it had angered him beyond words to have a ruffian of this fellows quality seeking to ruffle it with himbut at that moment a female voice stern and imperative bade them hold in their quarrel  fortemani fell back nursing his lacerated hand and muttering curses whilst francesco turned in the direction whence that voice had come midway on the flight of stone steps he beheld valentina followed by gonzaga peppe and a couple of menatarms descending from the battlements  calm and queenly she stood dressed in a camorra of grey velvet with black sleeves which excellently set off her handsome height gonzaga was leaning forward speaking into her ear and for all that his voice was subdued some of his words travelled down to francesco on the still morning air  was i not wise madonna in that i hesitated to admit him you see what manner of man he is  the blood flamed in francescos cheeks nor did it soften his chagrin to note the look which valentina flashed down at him  instantly he leapt to the ground and flinging his reins to lanciotto he went forward to the foot of that stone staircase his broad hat slung back upon his shoulders to meet that descending company  is this seemly sir she questioned angrily does it become you to brawl with my garrison the moment you are admitted  the blood rose higher in francescos face and now suffused his temples and reached his hair yet his voice was well restrained as he made answer  madonna this knave was insolent  an insolence that you no doubt provoked put in gonzaga a dimple showing on his womans cheek but the sterner rebuke fell from the lips of valentina  knave she questioned with flushed countenance if you would not have me regret your admittance messer francesco i pray you curb your words here are no knaves that sir is the captain of my soldiers  francesco bowed submissively as patient under her reproof as he had been hasty under fortemanis  it was on the matter of this captaincy that we fell to words he answered with more humility by his own announcement i understood this noblemanand his eyes turned to gonzagato be your captain  he is the captain of my castle she informed him  as you see ser francesco put in peppe who had perched himself upon the balustrade we suffer from no lack of captains here we have also fra domenico who is captain of our souls and of the kitchen myself am captain of  devil take you fool snapped gonzaga thrusting him roughly from his perch then turning abruptly to the count you bear a message for us sir he questioned loftily  swallowing the cavalier tone and overlooking the pronoun gonzaga employed francesco inclined his head again to the lady  i should prefer to deliver it in more privacy than this and his eye travelled round the court and up the steps behind where was now collected the entire company of fortemani gonzaga sneered and tossed his golden curls but valentina saw naught unreasonable in the request and bidding romeo attend her and francesco follow she led the way  they crossed the quadrangle and mounting the steps down which fortemani had dashed to meet the count they passed into the banquetinghall which opened directly upon the south side of the courtyard the count following in her wake ran the gauntlet of scowls of the assembled mercenaries he stalked past them unmoved taking their measure as he went and estimating their true value with the unerring eye of the practised condottiero who has had to do with the enrolling of men and the handling of them so little did he like their looks that on the threshold of the hall he paused and stayed gonzaga  i am loath to leave my servant at the mercy of those ruffians sir may i beg that you will warn them against offering him violence  ruffians cried the lady angrily before gonzaga could offer a reply they are my soldiers  again he bowed and there was a cold politeness in the tones in which he answered her  i crave your pardon and i will say no moreunless it be to deplore that i may not felicitate you on your choice  it was gonzagas turn to wax angry for the choice had been his  your message will have need to be a weighty one sir to earn our patience for your impertinence  francesco returned the look of those blue eyes which vainly sought to flash ferociously and he made little attempt to keep his scorn from showing in his glance he permitted himself even to shrug his shoulders a trifle impatiently  indeed indeed i think that i had best begone he answered regretfully for it is a place whose inmates seem all bent on quarrelling with me first your captain fortemani greets me with an insolence hard to leave unpunished you yourself madonna resent that i should crave protection for my man against those fellows whose looks give rise for my solicitation you are angry that i should dub them ruffians as if i had followed the calling of arms these ten years without acquiring knowledge of the quality of a man however much you may disguise him and lastly to crown all this cicisbeoand he spread a hand contemptuously towards gonzagaspeaks of my impertinences  madonna cried gonzaga i beg that you will let me deal with him  unwittingly unwillingly gonzaga saved the situation by that prayer the anger that was fast rising in madonnas heart stirred by the proud bearing of the count was scattered before the unconscious humour of her captains appeal in such ludicrous contrast was his mincing speech and slender figure with francescos firm tones and lean active height she did not laugh for that would have been to have spoilt all but she looked from one to the other with quiet relish noting the glance of surprise and raised eyebrows with which the count received the courtiers request to be let deal with him and thus being turned from anger the balance of her mind was quick to adjust itself and she bethought her that perhaps there was reason in what this knight advanced and that his reception had lacked the courtesy that was his due in a moment with incomparable grace and skill she had soothed gonzagas ruffled vanity and appeased the counts more sturdy resentment  and now messer francesco she concluded let us be friends and let me hear your business i beg that you will sit  they had passed into the banquetinghalla noble apartment whose walls were frescoed with hunting and pastoral scenes one or two of which were the work of pisaniello there were too some stray trophies of the chase and here and there a suit of costly armour that caught the sunlight pouring through the tall mullioned windows at the far end stood a richly carved screen of cedar and above this appeared the twisted railing of the minstrels gallery in a tall armchair of untanned leather at the head of the capacious board monna valentina sat herself gonzaga taking his stand at her elbow and francesco fronting her leaning lightly against the table  the news i bear you lady is soon told said the count i would its quality were better your suitor gian maria returning to guidobaldos court eager for the nuptials that were promised him has learnt of your flight to roccaleone and is raisingindeed will have raised by nowan army to invest and reduce your fortress  gonzaga turned as pale as the vest of white silk that gleamed beneath his doublet of pearlcoloured velvet at this realisation of the prophecies he had uttered without believing a sickly fear possessed his soul what fate would they mete out to him who had been the leading spirit in valentinas rebellion he could have groaned aloud at this miscarriage of all his fine plans where now would be the time to talk of love to press and carry his suit with valentina and render himself her husband there would be war in the air and bloody work that made his skin creep and turn cold to ponder on and the irony of it all was keenly cruel it was the very contingency that he had prophesied assured that neither guidobaldo nor gian maria would be so mad as to court ridicule by engaging upon it  for a second francescos eyes rested on the courtiers face and saw the fear written there for all to read the shadow of a smile quivered on his lips as his glance moved on to meet the eyes of valentina sparkling as sparkles frost beneath the sun  why let them come she exclaimed almost in exultation this ducal oaf shall find me very ready for him we are armed at all points we have victuals to last us three months if need be and we have no lack of weapons let gian maria come and he will find valentina della rovere none so easy to reduce to you sir she continued with more calm to you on whom i have no claim i am more than grateful for your chivalrous act in riding here to warn me  francesco sighed a look of regret crossed his face  alas he said when i rode hither madonna i had hoped to serve you to a better purpose i had advice to offer and assistance if you should need it but the sight of those menatarms of yours makes me fear that it is not advice upon which it would be wise to act for the plan i had in mind it would be of the first importance that your soldiers should be trustworthy and this i fear me they are not  nevertheless put in gonzaga feverishly clinging to a slender hope let us hear it  i beg that you will said valentina  thus enjoined francesco pondered a moment  are you acquainted with the politics of babbiano he inquired  i know something of them  i will make the position quite clear to you madonna he rejoined and with that he told her of the threatened descent of caesar borgia upon gian marias duchy and hence of the little time at her suitors disposal so that if he could but be held in check before the walls of roccaleone for a little while all might be well but seeing in what haste he is he ended his methods are likely to be rough and desperate and i had thought that meanwhile you need not remain here madonna  not remain she cried scorn of the notion in her voice not remain quoth gonzaga timorously hope sounding in his  precisely madonna i would have proposed that you leave gian maria an empty nest so that even if the castle should fall into his hands he would gain nothing  you would advise me to fly she demanded  i came prepared to do so but the sight of your men restrains me they are not trustworthy and to save their dirty skins they might throw roccaleone open to the besiegers and thus your flight would be discovered while yet there might be time to render it futile  before she could frame an answer there was gonzaga feverishly urging her to act upon so wise and timely a suggestion and seek safety in flight from a place that gian maria would tear stone from stone his words pattered quickly and piteously in entreaty till in the end facing him squarely  are you afraid gonzaga she asked him  i amafraid for you madonna he answered readily  then let your fears have peace for whether i stay or whether i go one thing is certain gian maria never shall set hands upon me she turned again to francesco i see a certain wisdom in the counsel of flight you would have offered me no less than in what i take to be your advice that i should remain did i but consult my humour i should stay and deliver battle when this tyrant shows himself but prudence too must be consulted and i will give the matter thought and now she thanked him with a generous charm for having come to her with this news and proffered his assistance asking what motives brought him  such motives as must ever impel a knight to serve a lady in distress said he and perhaps too the memory of the charity with which you tended my wounds that day at acquasparta  for a second their glances met quivered in the meeting and fell apart again an odd confusion in the breast of each all of which gonzaga sunk in moody rumination observed not to lighten the awkward silence that was fallen she asked him how it had transpired so soon that it was to roccaleone she had fled  do you not know he cried has not peppe told you  i have had no speech with him he but reached the castle himself late last night and i first saw him this morning when he came to announce your presence  and then before more could be said there arose a din of shouting from without the door was pushed suddenly open and peppe darted into the room  your man ser francesco he cried his face white with excitement come quickly or they will kill him     chapter xiv fortemani drinks water   the thing had begun with the lowering glances that francesco had observed and had grown to gibes and insults after he had disappeared but lanciotto had preserved an unruffled front being a man schooled in the count of aquilas service to silence and a wondrous patience this insensibility those hinds translated into cowardice and emboldened by itlike the mongrels that they weretheir offensiveness grew more direct and gradually more threatening lanciottos patience was slowly oozing away and indeed it was no longer anything but the fear of provoking his masters anger that restrained him at length one burly ruffian who had bidden him remove his headpiece in the company of gentlemen and whose request had been by lanciotto as disregarded as the rest advanced menacingly towards him and caught him by the leg as ercole had caught his master exasperated at that lanciotto had swung his leg free and caught the rash fellow a vicious kick in the face that had felled him stunned and bleeding  the roar from the mans companions told lanciotto what to expect in an instant they were upon him clamouring for his blood he sought to draw his masters sword which together with the counts other armour was slung across his saddlebow but before he could extricate it he was seized by a dozen hands and cropped fighting from the saddle on the ground they overpowered him and a mailed hand was set upon his mouth crushing back into his throat the cry for help he would have raised  on the west side of the courtyard a fountain issuing from the wall had once poured its water through a lions head into a vast tank of mossgrown granite but it had been disused for some time and the pipe in the lions mouth was dry the tank however was more than half full of water which during the late untenanting of the castle had turned foul and stagnant to drown lanciotto in this was the amiable suggestion that emanated from fortemani himselfa suggestion uproariously received by his knaves who set themselves to act upon it they roughly dragged the bleeding and frantically struggling lanciotto across the yard and gained the border of the tank intending fully to sink him into it and hold him under to drown there like a rat  but in that instant a something burst upon him like a bolt from out of heaven in one or two and presently in more the cruel laughter turned to sudden howls of pain as a lash of bullockhide caught them about head and face and shoulders  back there you beasts you animals back roared a voice of thunder and back they went unquestioning before that pitiless lash like the pack of craven hounds they were  it was francesco who singlehanded and armed with no more than a whip was scattering them from about his maltreated servant as the hawk scatters a flight of noisy sparrows and now between him and lanciotto there stood no more than the broad bulk of ercole fortemani his back to the count for as yet he had not realised the interruption  francesco dropped his whip and setting one hand at the captains girdle and the other at his dirty neck he hoisted him up with a strength incredible and hurled him from his path and into the slimy water of the tank  there was a mighty roar drowned in a mightier splash as fortemani spreadeagle struck the surface and sank from sight whilst with the flying spray there came a fetid odour to tell of the unsavouriness of that unexpected bath  without pausing to see the completion of his work francesco stooped over his prostrate servant  have the beasts hurt you lanciotto he questioned but before the fellow could reply one of those hinds had sprung upon the stooping count and struck him with a dagger between the shoulderblades  a womans alarmed cry rang out for valentina was watching the affray from the steps of the hall with gonzaga at her elbow  but francescos quilted brigandine had stood the test of steel and the point of that assassins dagger glanced harmlessly aside doing no worse hurt than a rent in the silk surface of the garment a second later the fellow found himself caught as in a bond of steel the dagger was wrenched from his grasp and the point of it laid against his breast even as the count forced him down upon his knees  in a flash was the thing done yet to the wretched man who saw himself upon the threshold of eternity and wholike a true son of the churchhad a wholesome fear of hell it seemed an hour whilst with livid cheeks and eyes starting from his head he waited for that poniard to sink into his heart as it was aimed but not in his heart did the blow fall with a sudden snort of angry amusement the count pitched the dagger from him and brought down his clenched fist with a crushing force into the ruffians face the fellow sank unconscious beneath that mighty blow and francesco regaining the whip that lay almost at his feet rose up to confront what others there might be  from the tank standing breastdeep in that stinking water his head and face grotesquely masked in a vile green slime of putrid vegetation ercole fortemani bellowed with horrid blasphemy that he would have his aggressors blood but stirred never a foot to take it not that he was by nature wholly a coward but inspired by a wholesome fear of the man who could perform such a miracle of strength he remained out of francescos reach well in the middle of that square basin and lustily roared orders to his men to tear the fellow to pieces but his men had seen enough of the counts methods and made no advance upon that stalwart dauntless figure that stood waiting for them with a whip which several had already tasted huddled together more like a flock of frightened sheep than a body of men of war they stood near the entrance tower the mock of peppe who from the stonegallery abovemuch to the amusement of valentinas ladies and two pert pages that were with himapplauded in highflown terms their wondrous valour  they stirred at last but it was at valentinas bidding she had been conferring with gonzaga whogiving it for his reason that she herself might need protectionhad remained beside her well out of the fray she had been urging him to do something and at last he had obeyed her and moved down the short flight of steps into the court but so reluctantly and slowly that with an exclamation of impatience she suddenly brushed past him herself to do the task she had begged of him past francesco she went with a word of such commendation of his valour and a look of such deep admiration that the blood sprang responsive to his cheek she paused with a solicitous inquiry for the now risen but sorely bruised lanciotto she flashed an angry look and an angry command of silence at the great ercole still bellowing from his tank and then within ten paces of his followers she halted and with wrathful mien and hand outstretched towards their captain she bade them arrest him  that sudden unexpected order struck dumb the vociferous fortemani he ceased and gaped at his men who eyed one another now in doubt but the doubt was quickly dispelled by the ladys own words  you will make him prisoner and conduct him to the guardroom or i will have you and him swept out of my castle she informed them as confidently as though she had a hundred menatarms to do her bidding on them  a pace or so behind her stood the lilycheeked gonzaga gnawing his lip timid and conjecturing behind him again loomed the stalwart height of francesco del falco with at his side lanciotto of mien almost as resolute as his own  that was the full force with which the lady spoke of sweeping themas if they had been so much foulnessfrom roccaleone unless they did her bidding they were still hesitating when the count advanced to valentinas side  you have heard the choice our lady gives you he said sternly let us know whether you will obey or disobey this choice that is yours now may not be yours again but if you elect to disobey madonna the gate is behind you the bridge still down get you gone  furtively from under lowering brows gonzaga darted a look of impotent malice at the count whatever issue had the affair this man must not remain in roccaleone he was too strong too dominant and he would render himself master of the place by no other title than that strength of his and that manner of command which gonzaga accounted a coarse swashbuckling bullys gift but would have given much to be possessed of of how strong and dominant indeed he was never had francesco offered a more signal proof those men bruised and maltreated by him would beyond doubt have massed together and made short work of one less dauntless but when a mighty courage such as his goes handinhand with the habit of command such hinds as they can never long withstand it they grumbled something among themselves and one of them at last made answer  noble sir it is our captain that we are bidden to arrest  true but your captain like yourselves is in this ladys pay and she your true your paramount commander bids you arrest him and now whilst yet they hesitated his quick wits flung them the bait that must prove most attractive he has shown himself today unfitted for the command entrusted him and it may become a question when he has been judged of choosing one of you to fill the place he may leave empty  hinds were they in very truth the scum of the bravi that haunted the meanest borgo of urbino their hesitation vanished and such slight loyalty as they felt towards ercole was overruled by the prospect of his position and his pay should his disgrace become accomplished  they called upon him to come forth from his refuge where he still stood dumb and stricken at this sudden turn events had taken he sullenly refused to obey the call to yield until francescowho now assumed command with a readiness that galled gonzaga more and morebade one of them go fetch an arquebuse and shoot the dog at that he cried out for mercy and came wading to the edge of the tank swearing that if the immersion had not drowned him it were a miracle but he was poisoned  thus closed an incident that had worn a mighty ugly look and it served to open valentinas eyes to the true quality of the men gonzaga had hired her maybe that it opened his own for that amiable lutethrummer was green of experience in these matters she bade gonzaga care for francesco and called one of the grinning pages from the gallery to be his esquire a room was placed at his disposal for the little time that he might spend at roccaleone whilst she debated what her course should be  a bell tolled in the far southern wing of the castle beyond the second courtyard and summoned her to chapel for there fra domenico said mass each morning and so she took her leave of francesco saying she would pray heaven to direct her to a wise choice whether to fly from roccaleone or whether to remain and ward off the onslaught of gian maria  francesco attended by gonzaga and the page repaired to a handsome room under the lions tower which rose upon the southeastern angle of the fortress his windows overlooked the second or inner courtyard across which valentina and her ladies were now speeding on their way to mass  gonzaga made shift to stifle the resentment that he felt against this man in whom he saw an interloper and strove to treat him with the courtesy that was his due he would even have gone the length of discussing with him the situationprompted by a certain mistrust and cunningly eager to probe the real motive that had brought this stranger to interest himself in the affairs of valentina but francesco wearily yet with an unimpeachable politeness staved him off and requested that lanciotto might be sent to attend him seeing the futility of his endeavours gonzaga withdrew in increased resentment but with a heightened sweetness of smile and profoundness of courtesies  he went below to issue orders for the raising of the bridge and finding the men singularly meek and tractable after the sharp lesson francesco had read them he vented upon them some of the vast illhumour that possessed him next he passed on to his own apartments and there he sat himself by a window overlooking the castle gardens with his unpleasant thoughts for only company  but presently his mood lightened and he took courage for he could be very brave when peril was remote it was best he reflected that valentina should leave roccaleone such was the course he would advise and urge naturally he would go with her and so he might advance his suit as well elsewhere as in that castle on the other hand if she remained why so would he and after all what if gian maria came as francesco had said the siege could not be protracted thanks to the tangled affairs of babbiano soon gian maria would be forced to turn him homeward to defend his duchy if then for a little while they could hold him in check all would yet be well surely he had been overquick to despond  he rose and stretched himself with indolent relish then pushing wide his casement he leaned out to breathe the morning air a soft laugh escaped him he had been a fool indeed to plague himself with fears when he had first heard of gian marias coming properly viewed it became a service gian maria did himwhether they remained or whether they went love has no stronger promoter than a danger shared and a week of such disturbances as gian maria was likely to occasion them should do more to advance his suit than he might hope to achieve in a whole month of peaceful wooing then the memory of francesco set a wrinkle twixt his brows and he bethought him how taken valentina had been with the fellow when first she had beheld him at acquasparta and of how as she rode that day she had seen naught but the dark eyes of this knight francesco  knight francesco of what or where he muttered to himself bah a nameless homeless adventurer a swashbuckling bully reeking of blood and leather and fit to drive such a pack as fortemanis but with a ladywhat shalt such an oaf attain how shall he prevail he laughed the incipient jealousy to scorn and his brow grew clear for now he was in an optimistic moodperhaps a reaction from his recent tremors yet by the host he pursued bethinking him of the amazing boldness francesco had shown in the courtyard he has the strength of hercules and a way with him that makes him feared and obeyed pish he laughed again as turning he unhooked his lute from where it hung upon the wall the byblow of some condottiero who blends with his fathers bullying arrogance the peasant soul of his careless mother and i fear that such a one as that shall touch the heart of my peerless valentina why it is a thought that does her but poor honour  and dismissing francesco from his mind he sought the strings with his fingers and thrummed an accompaniment as he returned to the window his voice wondrous sweet and tender breaking into a gentle lovesong     chapter xv the mercy of francesco   monna valentina and her ladies dined at noon in a small chamber opening from the great hall and thither were bidden francesco and gonzaga the company was waited upon by the two pages whilst fra domenico with a snowwhite apron girt about his portentous waist brought up the steaming viands from the kitchen where he had prepared them for like a true conventual he was something of a master in the confectionand a very glutton in the consumptionof delectable comestibles the kitchen was to him as the shrine of some minor cult and if his breviary and beads commanded from him the half of the ecstatic fervour of his devotions to pot and pan to cauldron and to spit then was canonisation indeed assured him  he set before them that day a dinner than which a better no prince commanded unless it were the pope there were ortolans shot in the valley done with truffles that made the epicurean gonzaga roll his eyes translated through the medium of his palate into a very paradise of sensual delight there was a hare trapped on the hillside and stewed in malmsey of a flavour so delicate that gonzaga was regretting him his heavy indulgence in the ortolans there was trout fresh caught in the stream below and a wondrous pasty that turned liquid in the mouth to wash down these good things there was stout red wine of puglia and more delicate malvasia for in his provisioning of the fortress gonzaga had contrived that at least they should not go thirsty  for a garrison awaiting siege you fare mighty well at roccaleone was francescos comment on that excellent repast  it was the fool who answered him he sat out of sight upon the floor hunched against the chair of one of valentinas ladies who now and again would toss him down a morsel from her plate much as she might have treated a favourite hound  you have the friar to thank for it said he in a muffled voice for his mouth was crammed with pasty let me be damned when i die if i make him not my confessor the man who can so minister to bodies should deal amazingly well with souls fra domenico you shall confess me after sunset  you need me not answered the monk in disdainful wrath there is a beatitude for such as youblessed are the poor in spirit  and is there no curse for such as you flashed back the fool does it say nowheredamned are the gross of flesh the fat and rotund gluttons who fashion themselves a god of their own bellies  with his sandalled foot the friar caught the fool a surreptitious kick  be still you adder you bag of venom  fearing worse the fool gathered himself up  beware he cried shrilly bethink you friar that anger is a cardinal sin beware i say  fra domenico checked his upraised hand and fell to muttering scraps of latin his lids veiling his suddenly down­cast eyes thus peppe gained the door  say friar in my ear nowwas that a hare you stewed or an outworn sandal  now god forgive me roared the monk springing towards him  for your cooking aye prayon your knees he dodged a blow ducked and doubled back into the room a cook you pish you tun of convent lard your ortolans were burnt your trout swam in grease your pasty  what the pasty may have been the company was not to learn for fra domenico crimson of face had swooped down upon the fool and would have caught him but that he dived under the table by valentinas skirts and craved her protection from this gross maniac that held himself a cook  now hold your wrath father she said laughing with the rest he does but plague you bear with him for the sake of that beautitude you cited which has fired him to reprisals  mollified but still grumbling threats of a beating to be bestowed on peppe when the opportunity should better serve him the friar turned to his domestic duties they rose soon after and at gonzagas suggestion valentina paused in the great hall to issue orders that fortemani be brought before her for judgment in a score of ways since their coming to roccaleone had ercole been wanting in that respect to which gonzaga held himself entitled and this opportunity he seized with eagerness to vent his vindictive rancour  valentina begged of francesco that he too would stay and help them with his wide experience a phrase that sent an unpleasant pang through the heart of romeo gonzaga it was perhaps as much to assert himself as to gratify his rancour against fortemani that having despatched a soldier to fetch the prisoner he turned to suggest curtly that ercole should be hanged at once  what boots a trial he demanded we were all witnesses of his insubordination and for that there can be but one punishment let the animal hang  but the trial is of your own suggestion she protested  nay madonna i but suggested judgment it is since you have begged messer francesco here to assist us that i opine you mean to give the knave a trial  would you credit this dear gonzaga with so much bloodthirstiness she asked francesco do you sir share his opinion that the captain should hang unheard i fear me you do for from what i have seen of them your ways do not incline to gentleness  gonzaga smiled gathering from that sentence how truly she apprised the coarse nature of this stranger francescos answer surprised them  nay i hold messer gonzagas an ill counsel show mercy to fortemani now where he expects none and you will have made a faithful servant of him i know his kind  ser francesco speaks without the knowledge that we have madonna was gonzagas rude comment an example must be made if we would have respect and orderliness from these men  then make it an example of mercy suggested francesco sweetly  well we shall see was valentinas answer i like your counsel messer francesco and yet i see a certain wisdom in gonzagas words though in such a case as this i would sooner consort with folly than have a mans death upon my conscience but here he comes and at least well give him trial maybe he is penitent by now  gonzaga sneered and took his place on the right of valentinas chair francesco standing on her left and in this fashion they disposed themselves to hold judgment upon the captain of her forces  he was brought in between two mailed menatarms his hands pinioned behind him his tread heavy as that of a man in fear his eyes directed sullenly upon the waiting trio but sullenest of all upon francesco who had so signally encompassed his discomfiture valentina spread a hand to gonzaga and from gonzaga waved it slightly in the direction of the bully responsive to that gesture gonzaga faced the pinioned captain truculently  you know your offence knave he bawled at him have you aught to urge that may deter us from hanging you  fortemani raised his brows a moment in surprise at this ferocity from one whom he had always deemed a very woman then he uttered a laugh of such contempt that the colour sprang to gonzagas cheek  take him out he began furiously when valentina interposed setting a hand upon his arm  nay nay gonzaga your methods are all wrong tell him nay i will question him myself messer fortemani you have been guilty of an act of gross abuse you and your men were hired for me by messer gonzaga and to you was given the honourable office of captain over them that you might lead them in this service of mine in the ways of duty submission and loyalty instead of that you were the instigator of that outrage this morning when murder was almost done upon an inoffensive man who was my guest what have you to say  that i was not the instigator he answered sullenly  it is all one she returned for at least it was done with your sanction and you took a share in that cruel sport instead of restraining it as was clearly your duty it is upon you the captain that the responsibility rests  lady he explained they are wild souls but very true  true to their wildness maybe she answered him disdainfully then she proceeded you will remember that twice before has messer gonzaga had occasion to admonish you these last two nights your men have behaved riotously within my walls there has been hard drinking there has been dicing and such brawling once or twice as led me to think there would be throats cut among your ranks you were warned by messer gonzaga to hold your followers in better leash and yet today without so much as drunkenness to excuse them we have this vile affair with yourself for a ringleader in it  there followed a pause during which ercole stood with bent head like one who thinks and francesco turned his wonderladen glance upon this slight girl with the gentle brown eyes which had been so tender and pitiful marvelling at the greatness of her spirit he grewall unconsciouslythe more enslaved  gonzaga all unconcerned in this eyed fortemani in expectation of his answer  madonna said the bully at last what can you look for from such a troop as this messer gonzaga cannot have expected me to enlist acolytes for a business that he told me bordered upon outlawry touching their drunkenness and the trifle of rioting what soldiers have not these faults when they have them not neither have they merit the man that is tame in times of peace is a skulking woman in times of war for the rest whence came the wine they drank it was of messer gonzagas providing  you lie hound blazed gonzaga i provided wine for madonnas table not for the men  yet some found its way to them which is well for water on the stomach makes a man poorspirited where is the sin of a little indulgence madonna he went on turning again to valentina these men of mine will prove their mettle when it comes to blows they are dogs perhapsbut mastiffs every one of them and would lose a hundred lives in your service if they had them  aye if they had them put in gonzaga sourly but having no more than one apiece theyll not care to spare it  nay there you wrong them cried fortemani with heat give them a leader strong enough to hold them to encourage and subject them and they will go anywhere at his bidding  and there put in gonzaga quickly you bring us back to the main issue such a leader you have shown us that you are not you have done worse you have been insubordinate when you should not only have been orderly but have enforced orderliness in others and for that by my lights you should be hanged waste no more time on him madonna he concluded turning to valentina let the example be made  but madonna began fortemani paling under the tan of his rugged countenance  gonzaga silenced him  your words are vain you have been insubordinate and for insubordination there is but one penalty  the bully hung his head deeming himself lost and lacking the wit to retort as francesco unexpectedly retorted for him  madonna there your adviser is at fault the charge against the man is wrong there has been no insubordination  how she questioned turning to the count none say you  a solomon is arisen sneered gonzaga then peevishly waste not words with him madonna he pursued our business is with fortemani  but stay my good gonzaga he may be right  your heart is overtender answered romeo impatiently but she had turned from him now and was begging francesco to make his meaning clearer  had he raised his hand against you madonna or even against messer gonzaga or had he disobeyed an order given him by either of you then and then only could there be question of insubordination but he has done none of these things he is guilty of grossly misusing my servant it is true but there is no insubordination in that since he was under no promise of loyalty to lanciotto  they stared at him as though his words were words of recondite wisdom instead of the simple statement of a plain case gonzaga crestfallen fortemani with a light of hope and wonder shining in his eyes and madonna with a faint nodding of the head that argued agreement they wrangled a while yet gonzaga bitter and vindictive and rashly scornful of both francesco and fortemani but the count so resolutely held the ground he had taken that in the end valentina shrugged her shoulders acknowledged herself convinced and bade francesco deliver judgment  you are in earnest madonna quoth francesco in surprise whilst a black scowl disfigured the serenity of gonzagas brow  i am indeed deal with him as you account best and most just and it shall fare with him precisely as you ordain  francesco turned to the menatarms unbind him one of you he said shortly  i believe that you are mad cried gonzaga in a frenzy but his mood sprang rather from the chagrin of seeing his interloper prevail where he had failed madonna do not heed him  i pray you let be my good gonzaga she answered soothingly and gonzaga ready to faint from spite obeyed her  leave him there and go was paolos next order to the men and they departed leaving the astonished fortemani standing alone unbound and sheepish  now mark me well messer fortemani francesco admonished him you did a cowardly thing unworthy of the soldier that you would have men believe you and for that i think the punishment you received at my hands has been sufficient in that the indignity to which i submitted you has shaken your standing with your followers go back to them now and retrieve what you have lost and see that in the future you are worthier let this be a lesson to you messer fortemani you have gone perilously near hanging and you have had it proved to you that in moments of peril your men are ready to raise their hands against you why is that because you have not sought their respect you have been too much a fellow of theirs in their drinking and their brawling instead of holding yourself aloof with dignity  lord i have learnt my lesson answered the cowed bully  then act upon it resume your command and discipline your men to a better order madonna here and messer gonzaga will forget this thing is it not so madonna is it not so messer gonzaga  swayed by his will and by an intuition that told her that to whatever end he might be working he was working wisely valentina gave fortemani the assurance francesco begged and gonzaga was forced grudgingly to follow her example  fortemani bowed low his face pale and his limbs trembling as not even fear had made them tremble he advanced towards valentina and sinking on one knee he humbly kissed the hem of her gown  your clemency madonna shall give you no regret i will serve you to the death lady and you lord at the last words he raised his eyes to francescos calm face then without so much as a glance at the disappointed gonzaga he rose and bowing againa very courtierhe withdrew  the closing of the door was to gonzaga a signal to break out in a torrent of bitter reproofs against francesco reproofs that were stemmed midway by valentina  you are beside yourself gonzaga she exclaimed what has been done has been done with my sanction i do not doubt the wisdom of it  do you not god send you never may but that man will know no peace until he is avenged on us  messer gonzaga returned francesco with an incomparable politeness i am an older man than are you and maybe that i have seen more warring and more of such men there is a certain valour lurks in that bully for all his blustering boastfulness and swagger and there is too a certain sense of justice mercy he has had today and time will show how right i am in having pardoned him in madonnas name i tell you sir that nowhere has monna valentina a more faithful servant than he is now likely to become  i believe you messer francesco indeed i am sure your act was wisdom itself  gonzaga gnawed his lip  i may be wrong said he in grudging acquiescence i hope indeed i may be     chapter xvi gonzaga unmasks   the four great outer walls of roccaleone stood ranged into a mighty square of which the castle proper occupied but half the other half running from north to south was a stretch of garden broken into three terraces the highest of these was no more than a narrow alley under the southern wall roofed from end to end by a trellis of vines on beams blackened with age supported by uprights of granite square and roughly hewn  a steep flight of granite steps weedy in the interstices of the old stone and terminating in a pair of couchant lions at the base led down to the middle terrace which was called the upper garden this was split in twain by a very gallery of gigantic box trees running down towards the lower terrace and bearing eloquent witness to the age of that old garden into this gallery no sun ever penetrated by more than a furtive ray and on the hottest day in summer a grateful cool dwelt in its green gloom rose gardens spread on either side of it but neglect of late had left them rank with weeds  the third and lowest of these terraces which was longer and broader than either of those above was no more than a smooth stretch of lawn bordered by acacias and plane trees from the extreme corner of which sprang a winding ironrailed staircase of stone leading to an eerie which corresponded diagonally with the lions tower where the count of aquila was lodged  on this green lawn valentinas ladies and a page beguiled the eventide in a game of bowls their clumsiness at the unwonted pastime provoking the goodhumoured banter of peppe who looked on and their own still betterhumoured laughter  fortemani too was there brazening out the mornings affair which it almost seemed he must have forgotten so selfpossessed and mightily at his ease was he he was of the kind with whom shame strikes never very deeply and he ruffled it gaily there among the women rolling his fierce eyes to ogle them seductively tossing his gaudy new cloak with a highborn disdaingloriously conscious that it would not rend in the tossing like the cloaks to which grim circumstance had lately accustomed himand strutting it like any cock upon a dunghill  but the lesson he had learnt was not likely to share the same forgetfulness indeed its fruits were to be observed already in the more orderly conduct of his men four of whom partisan on shoulder were doing duty on the walls of the castle they had greeted his return amongst them with sneers and derisive allusions to his immersion but with a few choicelyaimed blows he had cuffed the noisiest into silence and a more subservient humour he had spoken to them in a rasping truculent tone issuing orders that he meant should be obeyed unless the disobeyer were eager for a reckoning with him  indeed he was an altered man and when that night his followers having drunk what he accounted enough for their good and disregarding his orders that they should desist and get them to bed he went in quest of monna valentina he found her in conversation with francesco and gonzaga seated in the loggia of the diningroom they had been there since supper discussing the wisdom of going or remaining of fleeing or standing firm to receive gian maria their conference was interrupted now by ercole with his complaint  she despatched gonzaga to quell the men a course that fortemani treated to a covert sneer the fop went rejoicing at this proof that her estimate of his commanding qualities had nowise suffered by contrast with those of that swashbuckling francesco but his pride rode him to a bitter fall  they made a mock of his remonstrances and when he emulated francescos methods addressing them with sharp ferocity and dubbing them beasts and swine they caught the false ring of his fierceness which was as unlike the true as the ring of lead is unlike that of silver they jeered him insults they mimicked his tenor voice which excitement had rendered shrill and they bade him go thrum a lute for his ladys delectation and leave mens work to men  his anger rose and they lost patience and from showing their teeth in laughter they began to show them in snarls at this his ferocity deserted him brushing past fortemani who stood cold and contemptuous by the doorway watching the failure he had expected he returned with burning cheeks and bitter words to madonna valentina  she was dismayed at the tale he bore her magnified to cover his own shame francesco sat quietly drumming on the sill his eyes upon the moonlit garden below and never by word or sign suggesting that he might succeed where romeo had failed at last she turned to him  could you she began and stopped her eyes wandering back to gonzaga loath to further wound a pride that was very sore already on the instant francesco rose  i might try madonna he said quietly although messer gonzagas failure gives me little hope and yet it may be that he has taken the keen edge from their assurance and that thus an easier task awaits me i will try madonna and with that he went  he will succeed gonzaga she said after he had gone he is a man of war and knows the words to which these fellows have no answer  i wish him well of his errand sneered gonzaga his pretty face white now with sullenness and ill wager you he fails  but valentina disdained the offer whose rashness was more than proven when at the end of some ten minutes francesco reentered as imperturbable as when he went  they are quiet now madonna he announced  she looked at him questioningly how did you accomplish it she inquired  i had a little difficulty he said yet not overmuch his eye roved to gonzaga and he smiled messer gonzaga is too gentle with them too true a courtier to avail himself of the brutality that is necessary when we deal with brutes you should not disdain to use your hands upon them he admonished the fop in all seriousness and without a trace of irony nor did gonzaga suspect any  i soil my hands on that vermin he cried in a voice of horror i would die sooner  or else soon after squeaked peppe who had entered unobserved patrona mia you should have seen this paladin he continued coming forward why orlando was never half so furious as he when he stood there telling them what manner of dirt they were and bidding them to bed ere he drove them with a broomstick  and they went she asked  not at first said the fool they had drunk enough to make them very brave and one who was very drunk was so brave as to assault him but ser francesco fells him with his hands and calling fortemani he bids him have the man dropped in a dungeon to grow sober then without waiting so much as to see his orders carried out he stalks away assured that no more was needed nor was it they rose up muttering a curse or two maybeyet not so loud that it might reach the ears of fortemaniand got themselves to bed  she looked again at francesco with admiring eyes and spoke of his audacity in commending terms this he belittled but she persisted  you have seen much warring sir she halfasked half­asserted  why yes madonna  and here the writhing gonzaga espied his opportunity  i do not call to mind your name good sir he purred  francesco halfturned towards him and for all that his mind was working with a lightning quickness his face was indolently calm to disclose his true identity he deemed unwise for all connected with the sforza brood must earn mistrust at the hands of valentina it was known that the count of aquila stood high in the favour of gian maria and the news of his sudden fall and banishment could not have reached guidobaldos niece who had fled before the knowledge of it was in urbino his name would awaken suspicion and any story of disgrace and banishment might be accounted the very mask to fit a spy there was this sleek venomous gonzaga whom she trusted and relied on to whisper insidiously into her ear  my name he said serenely is as i have told you francesco  but you have another quoth valentina interest prompting the question  why yes but so closely allied to the first as to be scarce worth reciting i am francesco franceschi a wandering knight  and a true one as i know she smiled at him so sweetly that gonzaga was enraged  i have not heard the name before he murmured adding  your father was  a gentleman of tuscany  but not at court suggested romeo  why yes at court  then with a sly insolence that brought the blood to francescos cheeks though to the chaste mind of valentinas it meant nothingah he rejoined but then your mother  was more discriminating sir than yours came the sharp answer and from the shadows the fools smothered burst of laughter added gall to it  gonzaga rose heavily drawing a sharp breath and the two men stabbed each other with their eyes valentina uncomprehending looked from one to the other  sirs sirs what have you said she cried why all this war of looks  he is overquick to take offence madonna for an honest man was gonzagas answer like the snake in the grass he is very ready with his sting when we seek to disclose him  for shame gonzaga she cried now rising too what are you saying are you turned witless come sirs since you are both my friends be friends each with the other  most perfect syllogism murmured the fool unheeded  and you messer francesco forget his words he means them not he is very hot of fancy but sweet at heart this good gonzaga  on the instant the cloud lifted from francescos brow  why since you ask me he answered inclining his head if hell but say he meant no malice by his words i will confess as much for mine  gonzaga cooling saw that haply he had gone too fast and was the readier to make amends yet in his bosom he nursed an added store of poison a breath of which escaped him as he was leaving valentina and after francesco had already gone  madonna he muttered i mistrust that man  mistrust him why she asked frowning despite her faith in the magnificent romeo  i know not why but it is here i feel it and with his hand he touched the region of his heart say that he is no spy and call me a fool  why ill do both she laughed then more sternly added get you to bed gonzaga your wits play you false peppino call my ladies  in the moment that they were left alone he stepped close up to her spurred to madness by the jealous pangs he had that day endured his face gleamed white in the candlelight and in his eyes there was a lurking fierceness that gave her pause  have your way madonna he said in a concentrated voice but tomorrow whether we go hence or whether we stay he remains not with us  she drew herself up to the full of her slender graceful height her eyes on a level with gonzagas own  that she answered is as shall be decreed by me or him  he breathed sharply and his voice hardened beyond belief in one usually so gentle of tone and manner  be warned madonna he muttered coming so close that with the slightest swaying she must touch him that if this nameless sbirro shall ever dare to stand twixt you and me by god and his saints ill kill him be warned i say  and the door reopening at that moment he fell back bowed and brushing past the entering ladies gained the threshold here someone tugged at the prodigious foliated sleeves that spread beside him on the air like the wings of a bird he turned and saw peppino motioning him to lower his head  a word in your ear magnificent there was a man once went out for wool that came back shorn  angrily cuffing the fool aside he was gone  valentina sank down upon her windowseat in a turmoil of mingled anger and amazement that paled her cheek and set her bosom heaving it was the first hint of his aims respecting her that gonzaga had ever dared let fall and the condition in which it left her boded ill for his ultimate success her anger he could have borne had he beheld it for he would have laid it to the score of the tone he had taken with her but her incredulity that he could indeed have dared to mean that which her senses told her he had meant would have shown him how hopeless was his case and how affronted how outraged in soul she had been left by this moment of passionate selfrevealing he would have understood then that in her eyes he never had been was never like to be aught but a servantand one hereafter that deeming presumptuous she would keep at greater distance  but he dreaming little of this as he paced his chamber smiled at his thoughts which flowed with ready optimism he had been a fool to give way so soon perhaps the season was not yet the fruit was not ripe enough for plucking still what should it signify that he had given the tree a slight premonitory shake a little premature perhaps but it would predispose the fruit to fall he bethought him of her nevervarying kindness to him her fond gentleness and he lacked the wit to see that this was no more than the natural sweetness that flowed from her as freely as flows the perfume from the flowerbecause nature has so fashioned it and not because messer gonzaga likes the smell lacking that wit he went in blissful confidence to bed and smiled himself softly to his sleep  away in the room under the lions tower the count of aquila too paced his chamber ere he sought his couch and in his pacing caught sight of something that arrested his attention and provoked a smile in a corner among his harness which lanciotto had piled there his shield threw back the light displaying the sforza lion quartered with the aquila eagle  did my sweet gonzaga get a glimpse of that he would have no further need to pry into my parentage he mused and dragging the escutcheon from amongst that heap of armour he softly opened his window and flung it far out so that it dropped with a splash into the moat that done he went to bed and he too fell asleep with a smile upon his lips and in his mind a floating vision of valentina she needed a strong and ready hand to guide her in this rebellion against the loveatarms of gian maria and that hand he swore should be his unless she scorned the offer of it and so murmuring her name with a lingering fervour of whose true significance he was allnescient he sank to sleep nor waked again until a thundering at his door aroused him and to his still dormant senses came the voice of lanciotto laden with hurry and alarm  awake lord up afoot we are beset     chapter xvii the enemy   the count leapt from his bed and hastened to throw wide the door to admit his servant who with excited face and voice bore him the news that gian maria had reached roccaleone in the night and was now encamped in the plain before the castle  he was still at his tale when a page came with the message that monna valentina besought messer francescos presence in the great hall he dressed in all haste and then with lanciotto at his heels he descended to answer her summons as he crossed the second courtyard he beheld valentinas ladies grouped upon the chapelsteps in excited discussion of this happening with fra domenico who in full canonicals was waiting to say the mornings mass he gave them a courteous good morrow and passed on to the banquetinghall leaving lanciotto without  here he found valentina in conference with fortemani she was pacing the great room as she talked but beyond that there was no sign of excitement in her bearing and if any fear of the issue touched her heart now that the moment for action was at hand it was wondrously wellsuppressed at sight of francesco a look that was partly dismay and partly pleasure lighted her face she greeted him with such a smile as she would bestow in that hour upon none but a trusted friend then with a look of regret  i am beyond measure grieved sir that you should thus stand committed to my fortunes they will have told you that already we are besieged and so you will see how your fate is now bound up with ours for i fear me there is no road hence for you until gian maria raises this siege the choice of going or remaining is no longer mine we must remain and fight this battle out  at least lady he answered readily gaily almost i cannot share your regrets for me the act of yours may be a madness madonna but it is the bravest sweetest madness that ever was and i shall be proud to play my part if youll assign me one  but sir i have no claim upon you  the claim that every beset lady has upon a true knight he assured her i could ask no better employment for these arms of mine than in your defence against the duke of babbiano i am at your service and with a glad heart monna valentina i have seen something of war and you may find me useful  make him provost of roccaleone madonna urged fortemani whose gratitude to the man who had saved his life was blent with an admiring appreciation of his powers of which the bully had had such practical experience  you hear what ercole says she cried turning to francesco with a sudden eagerness that showed how welcome that suggestion was  it were too great an honour he answered solemnly yet if you were to place in my hands that trust i would defend it to my last breath  and then before she could answer him gonzaga entered by the sidedoor and frowned to see francesco there before him he was a trifle pale he carried his cloak on the right shoulder instead of the left and in general his apparel was less meticulous than usual and showed signs of hasty donning with a curt nod to the count and an utter ignoring of fortemaniwho was scowling upon him in memory of yesterdayhe bowed low before valentina  i am distraught madonna he began when she cut him short  you have little cause to be have things fallen out other than we expected  perhaps not yet i had hoped that gian maria would not allow his humour to carry him so far  you had hoped thatafter the message messer francesco brought us and she looked him over with an eye of sudden understanding yet you expressed no such hope when you advised this flight to roccaleone you were all for fighting then a martial ardour consumed you whence this change is it the imminence of danger that gives it a reality too grim for your appetite  there was a scorn in her words that wounded him as she meant it should his last nights rashness had shown her the need to leave him in no false opinion of the extent of her esteem and in addition those last words of his had shown him revealed in a new light and she liked him the less by it  he inclined his head slightly shame blazing red in his cheeks that he should be thus reproved before fortemani and that upstart francesco that francesco was an upstart was no longer a matter of surmise with him his soul assured him of it  madonna he said with some show of dignity ignoring her gibes i came to bear you news that a herald from gian maria craves a hearing shall i hold parley with him for you  you are too good she answered sweetly i will hear the man myself  he bowed submissively and then his eye moved to francesco  we might arrange with him for the safeconduct of this gentleman he suggested  there is no hope they would accord it she answered easily nor could i hope so if they would for messer francesco has consented to fill the office of provost of roccaleone but we are keeping the messenger waiting sirs will you attend me to the ramparts  they bowed and followed her gonzaga coming last his tread heavy as a drunkards his face white to the lips in the bitter rage with which he saw himself superseded and read his answer to the hot words that last night he had whispered in valentinas ear  as they crossed the courtyard francesco discharged the first act of his new office in ordering a halfdozen menatarms to fall in behind them to the end that they might make some show upon the wall when they came to parley with the herald  they found a tall man on a tall grey horse whose polished helm shone like silver in the morning sun and whose haubergeon was almost hidden under a crimson tabard ornamented with the sforza lion he bowed low as valentina appeared followed by her escort foremost in which stood the count of aquila his broad castor pulled down upon his brow so that it left his face in shadow  in the name of my master the high and mighty lord gian maria sforza duke of babbiano i call upon you to yield lady laying down your arms and throwing open your gates  there followed a pause at the end of which she asked him was that the sum of his message or was there something that he had forgotten the herald bowing gracefully upon the arched neck of his caracoling palfrey answered her that what he had said was all he had been bidden say  she turned with a bewildered and rather helpless look to those behind her she wished that the matter might be conducted with due dignity and her convent rearing left her in doubt of how this might best be achieved she addressed herself to francesco  will you give him his answer my lord provost she said with a smile and francesco stepping forward and leaning on a merlon of that embattled wall obeyed her  sir herald he said in a gruff voice that was unlike his own will you tell me since when has the duke of babbiano been at war with urbino that he should thus beset one of its fortresses and demand the surrender of it  his highness replied the herald is acting with the full sanction of the duke of urbino in sending this message to the lady valentina della rovere  at that valentina elbowed the count aside and forgetting her purpose of conducting this affair with dignity she let her womans tongue deliver the answer of her heart  this message sir and the presence here of your master is but another of the impertinences that i have suffered at his hands and it is the crowning one take you that message back to him and tell him that when i am instructed by what right he dares to send you upon such an errand i may render him an answer more germane with his challenge  would you prefer madonna that his highness should come himself to speak with you  there is nothing i should prefer less already has necessity compelled me to have more to say to gian maria than i could have wished and with a proud gesture she signified that the audience was at an end and turned to quit the wall  she had a brief conference with francesco during which he consulted her as to certain measures of defence to be taken and made suggestions to all of which she agreed her hopes rising fast to see that here at least she had a man with knowledge of the work to which he had set his hand it lightened her heart and gave her a glad confidence to look on that straight martial figure the hand so familiarly resting on the hilt of the sword that seemed a part of him and the eyes so calm whilst when he spoke of perils they seemed to dwindle neath the disdain of them so manifest in his tone  with fortemani at his heels he went about the execution of the measures he had suggested the bully following him now with the faithful wonder of a dog for its master realising that here indeed was a soldier of fortune by comparison with whom the likes of himself were no better than campfollowers confidence too did ercole gather from that magnetism of francescos unfaltering confidence for he seemed to treat the matter as a great jest a comedy played for the duke of babbiano and at that same dukes expense and just as francescos brisk tone breathed confidence into fortemani and valentina so too did it breathe it into fortemanis wretched followers they grew zestful in the reflection of his zest and out of admiration for him they came to admire the business on which they were engaged and finally to take a pride in the part he assigned to each of them within an hour there was such diligent bustle in roccaleone such an air of grim gaiety and high spirits that valentina observing it wondered what manner of magician was this she had raised to the command of her fortress who in so little time could work so marvellous a change in the demeanour of her garrison  once only did francescos lightheartedness fail him and this was when upon visiting the armoury he found but one single cask of gunpowder stored there he turned to fortemani to inquire where gonzaga had bestowed it and fortemani being as ignorant as himself upon the subject he went forthwith in quest of gonzaga after ransacking the castle for him he found him pacing the vinealley in the garden in animated conversation with valentina at his approach the courtiers manner grew more subdued and his brows sullen  messer gonzaga francesco hailed him the courtier surprised looked up where have you hidden your store of powder  powder faltered gonzaga chilled by a sudden apprehension is there none in the armoury  yesone small cask enough to load a cannon once or twice leaving us nothing for our handguns is that your store  if that is all there is in the armoury that is all we have  franceseo stood speechless staring at him a dull flush creeping into his cheeks in that moment of wrath he forgot their positions and gave never a thought to the smarting that must be with gonzaga at the loss of rank he had suffered since valentina had appointed a provost  and are these your methods of fortifying roccaleone he asked in a voice that cut like a knife you have laid in good store of wine a flock of sheep and endless delicacies sir he jeered did you expect to pelt the enemy with these or did you reckon upon no enemy at all  now this question touched so closely upon the truth that it fired in gonzagas bosom an anger that for the moment made a man of him it was the last breath that blew into a blaze the smouldering wrath he carried in his soul  his retort came fierce and hot it was as unmeasured and contemptuous as francescos erst recriminations and it terminated in a challenge to the count to meet him on horse or foot with sword or lance and that as soon as might be  but valentina intervened and rebuked them both yet to francesco her rebuke was courteous and ended in a prayer that he should do the best with such resources as roccaleone offered to gonzaga it was contemptuous in the last degree for francescos questionwhich gonzaga had left unansweredcoming at a moment when she was full of suspicions of gonzaga and the ends he had sought to serve in advising her upon a course which he had since shown himself so utterly unfitted to guide had opened wide her eyes she remembered how strangely moved he had been upon learning yesterday that gian maria was marching upon roccaleone and how ardently he had advised flight from the fortresshe that had so bravely talked of holding it against the duke  they were still wrangling there in a most unseemly fashion when a trumpetblast reached them from beyond the walls  the herald again she cried come messer francesco let us hear what fresh message he brings  she led francesco away leaving gonzaga in the shadow of the vines reduced wellnigh to tears in the extremity of his mortification  the herald was returned with the announcement that valentinas answer left gian maria no alternative but to await the arrival of duke guidobaldo who was then marching to join him the duke of urbinos presence would be he thought ample justification in her eyes for the challenge gian maria had sent and which he would send again when her uncle arrived to confirm it  thereafter the remainder of the day was passed in peace at roccaleone if we except the very hell of unrest that surged in the heart of romeo gonzaga he sat disregarded at supper that evening save by valentinas ladies and the fool who occasionally rallied him upon his glumness valentina herself turned her whole attention to the count and whilst gonzagagonzaga the poet of burning fancy the gay songster the acknowledged wit the mirror of courtlinesswas silent and tonguetied this ruffling upstart swashbuckler entertained them with a sprightliness that won him every heartalways excepting that of romeo gonzaga  francesco made light of the siege in a manner that enlivened every soul present with relief he grew merry at the expense of gian maria and made it very plain that he could have found naught more captivating to his warlike fancy than this business upon which an accident had embarked him he was as full of confidence for the issue as he was full of eager anticipation of the fray itself  is it wonderful thatnever having known any but artificial men men of court and antechamber men of dainty ways and mincing affected tricks of speech in short such men as circumstance ordains shall surround the greatmonna valentinas eyes should open very wide the better to behold this new pattern of a man who whilst clearly a gentleman of high degree carried with him an air of the camp rather than the camerion was imbued by a spirit of chivalry and adventure and ignored with a certain lofty dignity as if beneath his observance the poses that she was wont to see characterising the demeanour of the gentlemen of his highness her uncle  he was young moreover yet no longer callow comely yet with a strong male comeliness he had a pleasantly modulated voice yet one that they had heard swell into a compelling note of command he had the most joyous careless laugh in all the worldsuch a laugh as endears a man to all that hear itand he indulged it without stint  gonzaga sat glum and moody his heart bursting with the resentment of the mean and the incompetent for the man of brilliant parts but the morrow was to bring him worse  the duke of urbino arrived next morning and rode up to the moat in person attended only by a trumpeter who for the third time wound a note of challenge to the fortress  as on the previous day valentina answered the summons attended by francesco fortemani and gonzagathe latter uninvited yet not denied and following sullenly in her train in a last despairing attempt to assert himself one of her captains  francesco had put on his harness and came arrayed from head to foot in resplendent steel to do worthy honour to the occasion a bunch of plumes nodded in his helm and for all that his beaver was open yet the shadows of the headpiece afforded at the distance sufficient concealment to his features  the sight of her uncle left valentina unmoved wellbeloved though he was of his people between himself and his niece he had made no effort ever to establish relations of affection less than ever did he now seek to prevail by the voice of kinship he came in the panoply of war as a prince to a rebel subject and in precisely such a tone did he greet her  monna valentina he saidseeming entirely to overlook the circumstance that she was his kinswomandeeply though this rebellion grieves me you are not to think that your sex shall gain you any privileges or any clemency we will treat you precisely as we would any other rebel subject who acted as you have done  highness she replied i solicit no privilege beyond that to which my sex gives me the absolute right and which has no concern with war and arms i allude to the privilege of disposing of myself my hand and heart as it shall please me until you come to recognise that i am a woman endowed with a womans nature and until having realised it you are prepared to submit to it and pass me your princely word to urge the duke of babbianos suit no further with me here will i stay in spite of you your menatarms and your paltry ally gian maria who imagines that love may be made successfully in armour and that a way to a womans heart is to be opened with cannonshot  i think we shall bring you to a more subjective and dutiful frame of mind madonna was the grim answer  dutiful to whom  to the state a princess of which you have had the honour to be born  and what of my duty to myself to my heart and to my womanhood is no account to be taken of that  these are matters madonna that are not to be discussed in shouts from the walls of a castlenor indeed do i wish to discuss them anywhere i am here to summon you to surrender if you resist us you do so at your peril  then at my peril i will resist yougladly i defy you do your worst against me disgrace your manhood and the very name of chivalry by whatsoever violence may occur to you yet i promise you that valentina della rovere never shall become the wife of his highness of babbiano  you refuse to open your gates he returned in a voice that shook with anger  utterly and finally  and you think to persist in this  as long as i have life  the prince laughed sardonically  i wash my hands of the affair and of its consequences he answered grimly i leave it in the care of your future husband gian maria sforza and if in his very natural eagerness for the nuptials he uses your castle roughly the blame of it must rest with you but what he does he does with my full sanction and i have come hither to advise you of it since you appeared in doubt i beg that you will remain there for a few moments to hear what his highness himself may have to say i trust his eloquence may prove more persuasive  he saluted ceremoniously and wheeling his horse about he rode away valentina would have withdrawn but francesco urged her to remain and await the duke of babbianos coming and so they paced the battlements valentina in earnest talk with francesco gonzaga following in moody silence with fortemani and devouring them with his eyes  from their eminence they surveyed the bustling camp in the plain where tents green brown and white were being hastily erected by halfstripped soldiers the little army altogether may have numbered a hundred men which in his vainglory gian maria accounted all that would be needed to reduce roccaleone but the most formidable portion of his forces rolled into the field even as they watched it was heralded by a hoarse groaning of the wheels of bullockcarts to the number of ten on each of which was borne a cannon other carts followed with ammunition and victuals for the men encamped  they looked on with interest at the busy scene that was toward and as they watched they saw guidobaldo ride into the heart of the camp and dismount then from out of a tent more roomy and imposing than the rest advanced the short stout figure of gian maria not to be recognised at that distance save by the keen eyes of francesco that were familiar with his shape  a groom held a horse for him and assisted him to mount and then attended by the same trumpeter that had escorted guidobaldo he rode forward towards the castle at the edge of the moat he halted and at sight of valentina and her company he doffed his feathered hat and bowed his strawcoloured head  monna valentina he called and when she stepped forth in answer he raised his little cruel eyes in a malicious glance and showed the round moon of his white face to be whiter even than its wonta pallor atrabilious and almost green  i am grieved that his highness your uncle should not have prevailed with you where he has failed i may have little hope of succeedingby the persuasion of words yet i would beg you to allow me to have speech of your captain whoever he may be  my captains are here in attendance she answered tranquilly  so you have a plurality of them to commandhow many men  enough roared francesco interposing his voice sounding hollow from his helmet to blow you and your woman besieging scullions to perdition  the duke stirred on his horse and peered up at the speaker but there was too little of his face visible for recognition whilst his voice was altered and his figure dissembled in its steel casing  who are you rogue he asked  rogue in your teeth be you twenty times a duke returned the other at which valentina laughed outright  never from the day when he had uttered his first wail had his highness of babbiano heard words of such import from the lips of living man a purple flush mottled his cheeks at the indignity of it  attend to me knave he bellowed whatever betide the rest of this misguided garrison when ultimately it falls into my hands for you i can promise a rope and a crossbeam  bah sneered the knight first catch your bird be none so sure that roccaleone ever will fall into your hands while i live you do not enter here and my life highness is for me a precious thing which ill not part with lightly  valentinas eyes were mirthless now as she turned them upon that gleaming martial figure standing so proudly at her side and seeming so wellattuned to the proud defiance he hurled at the princely bully below  hush sir she murmured do not anger him further  aye groaned gonzaga in gods name say no more or youll undo us hopelessly  madonna said the duke without further heeding francesco i give you twentyfour hours in which to resolve upon your action yonder you see them bringing the cannon into camp when you wake tomorrow you shall find those guns trained upon your walls meanwhile enough said may i speak a word with messer gonzaga ere i depart  so that you depart you may say a word to whom you will she answered contemptuously and turning aside she motioned gonzaga to the crenel she abandoned  ill swear that mincing jester is trembling already with the fear of what is to come bawled the duke and perhaps fear will show him the way to reason messer gonzaga he called raising his voice as i believe the men of roccaleone are in your service i call upon you to bid them throw down that drawbridge and in the name of guidobaldo as well as my own i promise them free pardon and no hurtsaving only that rascal at your side but if your knaves resist me i promise you that when i shall have dashed roccaleone stone from stone not a man of you all will i spare  shaking like an aspen gonzaga stood there his voice palsied and making no reply whereupon francesco leant forward again  we have heard your terms he answered and we are not like to heed them waste not the day in vain threats  sir my terms were not for you i know you not i addressed you not nor will i suffer myself to be addressed by you  linger there another moment answered the vibrating voice of the knight and you will find yourself addressed with a volley of arquebuseshot olá there he commanded turning and addressing an imaginary body of men on the lower ramparts of the garden to his left arquebusiers to the postern blow your matches make ready now my lord duke will you draw off or must we blow you off  the dukes reply took the form of a bunch of blasphemous threats of how he would serve his interlocutor when he came to set hands on him  present arms roared the knight to his imaginary arquebusiers whereupon without another word the duke turned his horse and rode off in disgraceful haste his trumpeter following hot upon his heels pursued by a derisive burst of laughter from francesco     chapter xviii treachery   sir gulped gonzaga as they were descending from the battlements you will end by having us all hanged was that a way to address a prince  valentina frowned that he should dare rebuke her knight but francesco only laughed  by st paul how would you have had me address him he inquired would you have had me use cajolery with himthe lout would you have had me plead mercy from him and beg him in honeyed words to be patient with a wilful lady let be messer gonzaga we shall weather it yet never doubt it  messer gonzagas courage seems of a quality that wanes as the need for it increases said valentina  you are confounding courage madonna with foolhardy recklessness the courtier returned you may learn it to your undoing  that gonzaga was not the only one entertaining this opinion they were soon to learn for as they reached the courtyard a burly blackbrowed ruffian cappoccio by name thrust himself in their path  a word with you messer gonzaga and you ser ercole his attitude was full of truculent insolence and all paused francesco and valentina turning from him to the two men whom he addressed and waiting to hear what he might have to say to them when i accepted service under you i was given to understand that i was entering a business that should entail little risk to my skin i was told that probably there would be no fighting and that if there were it would be no more than a brush with the dukes men so too did you assure my comrades  did you indeed quoth valentina intervening and addressing herself to fortemani to whom cappoccios words had been directed  i did madonna answered ercole but i had messer gonzagas word for it  did you she continued turning to gonzaga permit their engagement on that understanding  on some such understanding yes madonna he was forced to confess  she looked at him a moment in amazement then  msser gonzaga she said at length i think that i begin to know you  but cappoccio who was nowise interested in the extent of valentinas knowledge of the man broke in impetuously  now we have heard what has passed between this new provost here and his highness of babbiano we have heard the terms that were offered and his rejection of them and i am come to tell you ser ercole and you messer gonzaga that i for one will not remain here to be hanged when roccaleone shall fall into the hands of gian maria and there are others of my comrades who are of the same mind  valentina looked at the rugged determined features of the man and fear for the first time stole into her heart and was reflected on her countenance she was halfturning to gonzaga to vent upon him some of the bitterness of her humourfor him she accounted to blamewhen once again francesco came to the rescue  now shame on you cappoccio for a paltry hind are these words for the ears of a besieged and sorely harassed lady craven  i am no craven the man answered hoarsely his face flushing under the whip of francescos scorn out in the open i will take my chances and fight in any cause that pays me but this is not my tradethis waiting for the death of a trapped rat  francesco met his eyes steadily for a moment then glanced at the other men to the number of a halfscore or soall in fact whom the duties he had apportioned them did not hold elsewhere they hung in the rear of cappoccio all ears for what was being said and their countenances plainly showing how their feelings were in sympathy with their spokesman  and you a soldier cappoccio sneered francesco shall i tell you in what fortemani was wrong when he enlisted you he was wrong in not hiring you for scullion duty in the castle kitchen  sir knight  bah do you raise your voice to me do you think i am of your kind animal to be affrighted by soundshowever hideous  i am not affrighted by sounds  are you not why then all this ado about a bunch of empty threats cast at us by the duke of babbiano if you were indeed the soldier you would have us think you would you come here and say i will not die this way or that confess yourself a boaster when you tell us that you are ready to die in the open  nay that am i not  then if you are ready to die out there why not in here shall it signify aught to him that dies where he gets his dying done but reassure yourself you woman he added with a laugh and in a voice loud enough to be heard by the others you are not going to dieneither here nor there  when roccaleone capitulates  it will not capitulate thundered francesco  well thenwhen it is taken  nor will it be taken the provost insisted with an assurance that carried conviction if gian maria had time unlimited at his command he might starve us into submission but he has not an enemy is menacing his own frontiers and in a few daysa week at mosthe will be forced to get him hence to defend his crown  the greater reason for him to use stern measures and bombard us as he threatens answered cappoccio shrewdly but rather in the tone of a man who expects to have his argument disproved and francesco if he could not disprove it could at least contradict it  believe it not he cried with a scornful laugh i tell you that gian maria will never dare so much and if he did are these walls that will crumble at a few cannonshots assault he might attempt but i need not tell a soldier that twenty men who are stout and resolute as i will believe you are for all your craven words could hold so strong a place as this against the assault of twenty times the men the duke has with him and for the rest if you think i tell you more than i believe myself i ask you to remember how i am included in gian marias threat i am but a soldier like you and such risks as are yours are mine as well do you see any sign of faltering in me any sign of doubting the issue or any fear of a rope that shall touch me no more than it shall touch you there cappoccio a less merciful provost would have hanged you for your wordsfor they reek of sedition yet i have stood and argued with you because i cannot spare a brave man such as you will prove yourself let us hear no more of your doubtings they are unworthy be brave and resolute and you shall find yourself well rewarded when the baffled duke shall be forced to raise this siege  he turned without waiting for the reply of cappocciowho stood crestfallen his cheeks reddened by shame of his threat to get him henceand conducted valentina calmly across the yard and up the steps of the hall  it was his way never to show a doubt that his orders would be obeyed yet on this occasion scarce had the door of the hall closed after them when he turned sharply to the following ercole  get you an arquebuse he said quickly and take my man lanciotto with you should those dogs still prove mutinous fire into any that attempt the gatesfire to killand send me word but above all ercole do not let them see you or suspect your presence that were to undermine such effect as my words may have produced  from out of a woefully pale face valentina raised her brown eyes to his in a look that was as a stab to the observing gonzaga  i needed a man here she said and i think that heaven it must have been that sent you to my aid but do you think she asked and with her eyes she closely scanned his face for any sign of doubt that they are pacified  i am assured of it madonna come there are signs of tears in your eyes andby my soulthere is naught to weep at  i am but a woman after all she smiled up at him and so subject to a womans weakness it seemed as if the end were indeed come just now it had come but for you if they should mutiny  they shall not while i am here he answered with a cheering confidence and she full of faith in this true knight of hers went to seek her ladies and to soothe in her turn any alarm to which they might have fallen a prey  francesco went to disarm and gonzaga to take the air upon the ramparts his heart a very bag of gall his hatred for the interloper was as nothing now to his rage against valentina a rage that had its birth in a wondering uncomprehension of how she should prefer that coarse swashbuckling bully to himself the peerless gonzaga and as he walked there under the noontide sky the memory of francescos assurance that the men would not mutiny returned to him and he caught himself most ardently desiring that they might if only to bear it home to valentina how misplaced was her trust how foolish her belief in that loud boaster he thought nextand with increasing bitternessof his own brave schemes of his love for valentina and of how assured he had been that his affections were returned before this ruffler came amongst them he laughed in bitter scorn as the thought returned to her preferring francesco to himself well it might be so nownow that the times were warlike and this francesco was such a man as shone at his best in them but what manner of companion would this sbirro make in times of peace had he the wit the grace the beauty even that was gonzagas circumstance it seemed to him was here to blame and he roundly cursed that same circumstance in other surroundings he was assured that she would not have cast an eye upon francesco whilst he himself was by and if he recalled their first meeting at acquasparta it was again to curse circumstance for having placed the knight in such case as to appeal to the tenderness that is a part of womans nature  he reflectedassured that he was rightthat if francesco had not come to roccaleone he might by now have been wed to valentina and once wed he could throw down the bridge and march out of roccaleone assured that gian maria would not care to espouse his widow and no less assured that guidobaldowho was at heart a kind and clement princewould be content to let be what was accomplished since there would be naught gained beyond his nieces widowhood in hanging gonzaga it was the specious argument that had lured him upon this rash enterprise the hopes that he was confident would have fructified but for the interloping of francesco  he stood looking down at the tented plain with black rage and black despair blotting the beauty from the sunlight of that may morning and then it came to him that since there was naught to be hoped from his old plans might it not be wise to turn his attention to new ones that would at least save him from hanging for he was assured that whatever might betide the others his own fate was sealed whether roccaleone fell or not it would be remembered against him that the affair was of his instigating and from neither gian maria nor guidobaldo might he look for mercy  and now the thought of extricating himself from his desperate peril turned him cold by its suddenness he stood very still a moment then looked about him as though he feared that some watching spy might read on him the ugly intention that of a sudden had leapt to life in his heart swiftly it spread and took more definite shape the reflection of it showing now upon his smooth handsome face and disfiguring it beyond belief he drew away from the wall and took a turn or two upon the ramparts one hand behind him the other raised to support his drooping chin thus he brooded for a little while then with another of his furtive glances he turned to the northwestern tower and entered the armoury there he rummaged until he had found the pen ink and paper that he sought and with the door wide openthe better that he might hear the sound of approaching stepshe set himself feverishly to write it was soon done and he stood up waving the sheet to dry the ink then he looked it over again and this is what he had written  i have it in my power to stir the garrison to mutiny and to throw open the gates of roccaleone thus shall the castle fall immediately into your hands and you shall have a proof of how little i am in sympathy with this rebellion of monna valentinas what terms do you offer me if i accomplish this answer me now and by the same means as i am employing but dispatch not your answer if i show myself upon the ramparts  romeo gonzaga   he folded the paper and on the back he wrote the superscriptionto the high and mighty duke of babbiano then opening a large chest that stood against the wall he rummaged a moment and at last withdrew an arbalest quarrel about the body of this he tied his note next from the wall he took down a crossbow and from a corner a moulinet for winding it with his foot in the stirrup he made the cord taut and set the shaft in position  and now he closed the door and going to the window which was little more than an arrowslit he shouldered his arbalest he took careful aim in the direction of the ducal tent and loosed the quarrel he watched its light and it almost thrilled him with pride in his archery to see it strike the tent at which he had aimed and set the canvas shuddering  in a moment there was a commotion men ran to the spot others emerged from the tent and amongst the latter gonzaga recognised the figures of gian maria and guidobaldo  the bolt was delivered to the duke of babbiano who with an upward glance at the ramparts vanished into the tent once more  gonzaga moved from his eerie and set wide the door of the tower so that his eyes could range the whole of the sunbathed ramparts returning to his window he waited impatiently for the answer nor was his impatience to endure long at the end of some ten minutes gian maria reappeared and summoning an archer to his side he delivered him something and made a motion of his hand towards roccaleone gonzaga moved to the door and stood listening breathlessly at the least sign of an approach he would have shown himself and thus by the provision made in his letter have cautioned the archer against shooting his bolt but all was quiet and so gonzaga remained where he was until something flashed like a bird across his vision struck sharply against the posterior wall and fell with a tinkle on the broad stones of the rampart a moment later the answer from gian maria was in his hands  he swiftly unwound it from the shaft that had brought it and dropped the bolt into a corner then unfolding the letter he read it leaning against one of the merlons of the wall  if you can devise a means to deliver roccaleone at once into my hands you shall earn my gratitude full pardon for your share in monna valentinas rebellion and the sum of a thousand gold florins  gian maria   as he read a light of joy leapt to his eyes gian marias terms were very generous he would accept them and valentina should realise when too late upon what manner of broken reed she leaned in relying upon messer francesco would he save her now as he so loudly boasted would there indeed be no mutiny as he so confidently prophesied gonzaga chuckled evilly to himself she should learn her lesson and when she was gian marias wife she might perhaps repent her of her treatment of romeo gonzaga  he laughed softly to himself then suddenly he turned cold and he felt his skin roughening a stealthy step sounded behind him  he crumpled the dukes letter in his hand and in the alarm of the moment he dropped it over the wall seeking vainly to compose the features that a chilling fear had now disturbed he turned to see who came  behind him stood peppe his solemn eyes bent with uncanny intentness upon gonzagas face  you were seeking me quoth romeo and the quaver in his voice sorted ill with his arrogance  the fool made him a grotesque bow  monna valentina desires that you attend her in the garden illustrious     chapter xix plot and counterplot   peppes quick eyes had seen gonzaga crumple and drop the paper no less than he had observed the courtiers startled face and his suspicions had been aroused he was by nature prying and experience had taught him that the things men seek to conceal are usually the very things it imports most to have knowledge of so when gonzaga had gone in obedience to valentinas summons the jester peered carefully over the battlements  at first he saw nothing and he was concluding with disappointment that the thing gonzaga had cast from him was lost in the torrential waters of the moat but presently lodged on a jutting stone above the foaming stream into which it would seem that a miracle had prevented it from falling he espied a ball of crumpled paper he observed with satisfaction that it lay some ten feet immediately below the posterngate by the drawbridge  secretly for it was not peppys way to take men into his confidence where it might be avoided he got himself a coil of rope having descended and quietly opened the postern he made one end fast and lowered the other to the water with extreme care lest he should dislodge and so lose that paper  assuring himself again that he was unobserved he went down hand over hand like a monkey his feet against the roughhewn granite of the wall then with a little swinging of the rope he brought himself nearer that crumpled ball his legs now dangling in the angry water and by a mighty stretch that all but precipitated him into the torrent he seized the paper and transferred it to his teeth then hand over hand again and with a frantic haste for he feared observation not only from the castle sentries but also from the watchers in the besiegers camp he climbed back to the postern exulting in that he had gone unobserved and contemptuous for the vigilance of those that should have observed him  softly he closed the wicket locked it and shot home the bolts at top and base and went to replace the key on its nail in the guardroom which he found untenanted next with that mysterious letter in his hand he scampered off across the courtyard and through the porch leading to the domestic quarters nor paused until he had gained the kitchen where fra domenico was roasting the quarter of a lamb that he had that morning butchered for now that the siege was established there was no more fish from the brook nor hares and ortolans from the countryside  the friar cursed the fool roundly as was his wont upon every occasion for he was none so holy that he disdained the milder forms of objurgatory oaths but peppe for once had no vicious answer ready a matter that led the dominican to ask him was he ill  never heeding him the fool unfolded and smoothed the crumpled paper in a corner by the fire he read it and whistled then stuffed it into the bosom of his absurd tunic  what ails you quoth the friar what have you there  a recipe for a dish of friars brains a most rare delicacy and rendered costly by virtue of the scarcity of the ingredients and with that answer peppe was gone leaving the monk with an ugly look in his eyes and an unuttered imprecation on his tongue  straight to the count of aquila went the fool with his letter francesco read it and questioned him closely as to what he knew of the manner in which it had come into gonzagas possession for the rest those lines far from causing him the uneasiness peppe expected seemed a source of satisfaction and assurance to him  he offers a thousand gold florins he muttered in addition to gonzagas liberty and advancement why then i have said no more than was true when i assured the men that gian maria was but idly threatening us with bombardment keep this matter secret peppe  but you will watch messer gonzaga quoth the fool  watch him why where is the need you do not imagine him so vile that this offer could tempt him  peppe looked up his great whimsical face screwed into an expression of cunning doubt  you do not think lord that he invited it  now shame on you for that thought messer gonzaga may be an idle lutethrummer a poorspirited coward but a traitor and to betray monna valentina no no  but the fool was far from reassured he had had the longer acquaintance of messer gonzaga and his shrewd eyes had long since taken the mans exact measure let francesco scorn the notion of betrayal at romeos hands peppe would dog him like a shadow this he did for the remainder of that day clinging to gonzaga as if he loved him dearly and furtively observing the mans demeanour yet he saw nothing to confirm his suspicions beyond a certain preoccupied moodiness on the courtiers part  that night as they supped gonzaga pleaded toothache and with valentinas leave he quitted the table at the very outset of the meal peppe rose to follow him but as he reached the door his natural enemy the friarever anxious to thwart him where he couldcaught him by the nape of the neck and flung him unceremoniously back into the room  have you a toothache too goodfornaught quoth the frate stay you here and help me to wait upon the company  let me go good fra domenico the fool whispered in a voice so earnest that the monk left his way clear but valentinas voice now bade him stay with them and so his opportunity was lost  he moved about the room a very dispirited moody fool with no quip for anyone for his thoughts were all on gonzaga and the treason that he was sure he was hatching yet faithful to francesco who sat all unconcerned and not wishing to alarm valentina he choked back the warning that rose to his lips seeking to convince himself that his fears sprang perhaps from an excess of suspicion had he known how wellfounded indeed they were he might have practised less selfrestraint  for whilst he moved sullenly about the room assisting fra domenico with the dishes and platters gonzaga paced the ramparts beside cappoccio who was on sentry duty on the north wall  his business called for no great diplomacy nor did gonzaga employ much he bluntly told cappoccio that he and his comrades had allowed messer francescos glib tongue to befool them that morning and that the assurances francesco had given them were not worthy of an intelligent mans consideration  i tell you cappoccio he ended that to remain here and protract this hopeless resistance will cost you your life at the unsavoury hands of the hangman you see i am frank with you  now for all that what gonzaga told him might sort excellently well with the ideas he had himself entertained cappoccio was of a suspicious nature and his suspicions whispered to him now that gonzaga was actuated by some purpose he could not gauge  he stood still and leaning with both hands upon his partisan he sought to make out the courtiers features in the dim light of the rising moon  do you mean he asked and in his voice sounded the surprise with which gonzagas odd speech had filled him that we are foolish to have listened to messer francesco and that we should be better advised to march out of roccaleone  yes that is what i mean  but why he insisted his surprise increasing do you urge such a course upon us  because cappoccio was the plausible reply like yourselves i was lured into this business by insidious misrepresentations the assurances that i gave fortemani and with which he enrolled you into his service were those that had been given to me i did not bargain with such a death as awaits us here and i frankly tell you that i have no stomach for it  i begin to understand murmured cappoccio sagely wagging his head and there was a shrewd insolence in his tone and manner when we leave roccaleone you come with us  gonzaga nodded  but why do you not say these things to fortemani questioned cappoccio still doubting  fortemani echoed gonzaga by the host no the man is bewitched by that plausible rogue francesco far from resenting the fellows treatment of him he follows and obeys his every word like the meanspirited dog that he is  again cappoccio sought to scrutinise gonzagas face but the light was indifferent  are you dealing with me fairly he asked or does some deeper purpose lie under your wish that we should rebel against the lady  my friend answered gonzaga do you but wait until gian marias herald comes for his answer in the morning then you will learn again the terms on which your lives are offered you do nothing until then but when you hear yourselves threatened with the rope and the wheel bethink you of what course you will be best advised in pursuing you ask me what purpose inspires me i have already told youfor i am as open as the daylight with youthat i am inspired by the purpose of saving my own neck is not that purpose enough  a laugh of such understanding as would have set a better man on fire with indignation was the answer he received  why yes it is more than enough tomorrow then my comrades and i march out of roccaleone count upon that  but do not accept my word wait until the herald comes again do nothing until you have heard the terms he brings  why no assuredly not  and do not let it transpire among your fellows that it is i who have suggested this  why no ill keep your secret laughed the bravo offensively shouldering his partisan and resuming his sentinels pacing  gonzaga sought his bed a fierce joy consumed him at having so consummately planned valentinas ruin yet he did not wish to face her again that night  but when on the morrow the herald wound his horn again beneath the castle walls gonzaga was prominent in the little group that attended monna valentina the count of aquila was superintending the work to which he had set a halfscore of men with a great show and as much noise as possibleby which francesco intended that the herald should be impressedthey were rolling forward four small culverins and some three cannons of larger calibre and planting them so that they made a menacing show in the crenels of the parapet  whilst watching and directing the men he kept his ears open for the message and he heard the herald again recite the terms on which the garrison might surrender and again the threat to hang every man from the castlewalls if they compelled him to reduce them by force of arms he brought his message to an end by announcing that in his extreme clemency gian maria accorded them another halfhours grace in which to resolve themselves upon their course should the end of that time still find them obstinate the bombardment would commence such was the message that in another of his arrowborne letters gonzaga had suggested gian maria should send  it was francesco who stepped forward to reply he had been stooping over one of the guns as if to assure himself of the accuracy of its aim and as he rose he pronounced himself satisfied in a voice loud enough for the heralds hearing then he advanced to valentinas side and whilst he stood there delivering his answer he never noticed the silent departure of the men from the wall  you will tell his highness of babbiano he replied that he reminds us of the boy in the fable who cried wolf too often tell him sir that his threats leave this garrison as unmoved as do his promises if so be that he intends in truth to bombard us let him begin forthwith we are ready for him as you perceive maybe he did not suppose us equipped with cannon but there they stand those guns are trained upon his camp and the first shot he fires upon us shall be a signal for such a reply as he little dreams of tell him too that we expect no quarter and will yield none we are unwilling for bloodshed but if he drives us to it and executes his purpose of employing cannon then the consequences be upon his own head bear him that answer and tell him to send you no more with empty threats  the herald bowed upon the withers of his horse the arrogance the cold imperiousness of the message struck him dumb with amazement amazement was his too that roccaleone should be armed with cannon as with his own eyes he saw that those guns were empty he could not guess nor could gian maria when he heard a message that filled him with rage and would have filled him with dismay but that he counted upon the mutiny which gonzaga had pledged himself to stir up  as the herald was riding away a gruff laugh broke from fortemani who stood behind the count  valentina turned to francesco with eyes that beamed admiration and a singular tenderness  oh what had i done without you messer francesco she cried for surely the twentieth time since his coming i tremble to think how things had gone without your wit and valour to assist me she never noticed the malicious smile that trembled on gonzagas pretty face where did you find the powder she asked innocently for her mind had not yet caught that humour of the situation that had drawn a laugh from fortemani  i found none answered francesco smiling from the shadow of his helm my threatsand he waved his hand in the direction of that formidable array of gunsare as empty as gian marias yet i think they will impress him more than his do us i will answer for it madonna that they deter him from bombarding usif so be that he ever intended to so let us go and break our fast with a glad courage  those guns are empty she gasped and you could talk so boldly and threaten so defiantly  mirth crept now into her face and thrust back the alarm a little of which had peeped from her eyes even as she was extolling francesco  there he cried joyously you are smiling now madonna nor have you cause for aught else shall we descend this early morning work has given me the hunger of a wolf  she turned to go with him and in that moment peppe his owlish face spread over with alarm dashed up the steps from the courtyard  madonna he gasped breathless messer francesco the mencappoccio he is haranguing them heis inciting them to treachery  so in gasps he got out his tale which swept the mirth again from valentinas eyes and painted very white her cheek strong and brave though she was she felt her senses swimming at that sudden revulsion from confidence to fear was all indeed ended at the very moment when hope had reached its high meridian  you are faint madonna lean on me  it was gonzaga who spoke but beyond the fact that the words had been uttered she realised nothing she saw an arm advanced and she took it then she dragged gonzaga with her to the side overlooking the courtyard that with her own eyes she might have evidence of what was toward  she heard an oatha vigorous wicked oathfrom francesco followed by a command sharp and rasping  to the armoury yonder peppe fetch me a twohanded swordthe stoutest you can find ercole come with me gonzaga nay you had best stay here see to monna valentina  he stepped to her side now and rapidly surveyed the surging scene below where cappoccio was still addressing the men at sight of francesco they raised a fierce yell as might a pack of dogs that have sighted their quarry  to the gates was the shout down the draw­bridge we accept the terms of gian maria we will not die like rats  by god but you shall if i so will it snarled francesco through his set teeth then turning his head in a fever of impatience peppe he shouted will you never bring that sword  the fool came up at that moment staggering under the weight of a great doubleedged twohander equipped with lugs and measuring a good six feet from point to pummel francesco caught it from him and bending he muttered a swift order in peppinos ear  in the box that stands upon the table in my chamber gonzaga overheard him say now go and bring it to me in the yard speed you peppino  a look of understanding flashed up from the hunchbacks eyes and as he departed at a run francesco hoisted the mighty sword to his shoulder as though its weight were that of a feather in that instant valentinas white hand was laid upon the brassart that steeled his forearm  what will you do she questioned in a whisper her eyes dilating with alarm  stem the treachery of that rabble he answered shortly stay you here madonna fortemani and i will pacify themor make an end of them and so grimly did he say it that gonzaga believed it to lie within his power  but you are mad she cried and the fear in her eyes increased what can you do against twenty  what god pleases he answered and for a second put the ferocity from his heart that he might smile reassurance  but you will be killed she cried oh dont go dont go let them have their way messer francesco let gian maria invest the castle i care not so that you do not go  her voice and the tale it told of sweet anxiety for his fate overruling everything else in that momenteven her horror of gian mariaquickened his blood to the pace of ecstasy he was taken by a wild longing to catch her in his armsthis lady hitherto so brave and daunted now by the fear of his peril only every fibre of his being urged him to gather her to his breast whilst he poured courage and comfort into her ear he fainted almost with desire to kiss those tender eyes upturned to his in her piteous pleading that he should not endanger his own life but suppressing all he only smiled though very tenderly  be brave madonna and trust in me a little have i failed you yet need you then fear that i shall fail you now  at that she seemed to gather courage the words reawakened her confidence in his splendid strength  we shall laugh over this when we break our fast he cried come ercole and without waiting for more he leapt down the steps with an agility surprising in one so heavily armed as he  they were no more than in time as they gained the courtyard the men came sweeping along towards the gates their voices raucous and threatening they were full of assurance all hell they thought could not have hindered them and yet at sight of that tall figure bright as an angel in his panoply of glittering steel with that great sword poised on his left shoulder some of the impetuousness seemed to fall from them  still they advanced cappoccios voice shouting encouragement almost were they within range of that lengthy sword when of a sudden it flashed from his shoulder and swept a halfcircle of dazzling light before their eyes round his head it went and back again before them handled as though it had been a whip and bringing them silent to a standstill he bore it back to his shoulder and alert for the first movement his blood on fire and ready to slay a man or two should the example become necessary he addressed them  you see what awaits you if you persist in this he said in a dangerously quiet voice have you no shame you herd of cowardly animals you are loudvoiced enough where treason to the hand that pays you is in question but there it seems your valour ends  he spoke to them now in burning words he recapitulated the arguments which yesterday he had made use of to quell the mutinous spirit of cappoccio he assured them that gian maria threatened more than he could accomplish and so perhaps more than he would fulfil if they were so foolish as to place themselves in his power their safety he pointed out to them lay here behind these walls the siege could not long endure they had a stout ally in caesar borgia and he was marching upon babbiano by then so that gian maria must get him home perforce ere long their pay was good he reminded them and if the siege were soon raised they should be well rewarded  gian maria threatens to hang you when he captures roccaleone but even should he capture it do you think he would be allowed to carry out so inhuman a threat you are mercenaries after all in the pay of monna valentina on whom and her captains the blame must fall this is urbino not babbiano and gian maria is not master here do you think the noble and magnanimous guidobaldo would let you hang have you so poor an opinion of your duke fools you are as safe from violence as are those ladies in the gallery up there for guidobaldo would no more think of harming you than of permitting harm to come to them if any hanging there is it will be for me and perhaps for messer gonzaga who hired you yet do i talk of throwing down my arms what think you holds me here interestjust as interest holds youand if i think the risk worth taking why should not you are you so tame and so poorspirited that a threat is to vanquish you will you become a byword in italy and when men speak of cowardice will you have them say craven as monna valentinas garrison  in this strain he talked to them now smiting hard with his scorn now cajoling them with his assurances and breeding confidence anew in their shaken spirits it was a thing that went afterwards to the making of an epic that was sung from calabria to piedmont how this brave knight by his words by the power of his will and the might of his presence curbed and subdued that turbulent score of rebellious hinds  and from the wall above valentina watched him her eyes sparkling with tears that had not their source in sorrow nor yet in fear for she knew that he must prevail how could it be else with one so dauntless  thus thought she now but in the moment of his going fear had chilled her to the heart and when she first saw him take his stand before them she had turned halfdistraught and begged gonzaga not to linger at her side but to go lend what aid he could to that brave knight who stood so sorely in need of it and gonzaga had smiled a smile as pale as january sunshine and his soft blue eyes had hardened in their glance not weakness now was it that held him there well out of the dangerous turmoil for he felt that had he possessed the strength of hercules and the courage of achilles he would not in that instant have moved a step to francescos aid and as much he told her  why should i madonna he had returned coldly why should i raise a hand to help the man whom you prefer to me why should i draw sword in the cause of this fortress  she looked at him with troubled eyes what are you saying my good gonzaga  ayeyour good gonzaga he mocked her bitterly your lapdog your lutethrummer but not man enough to be your captain not man enough to earn a thought that is kinder than any earned by peppe or your hounds i may endanger my neck to serve you to bring you hither to a place of safety from gian marias persecution and be cast aside for one who it happens has a little more knowledge of this coarse trade of arms cast me aside if you will he pursued with increasing bitterness but having done so do not ask me to serve you again let messer francesco fight it out  hush gonzaga she interrupted let me hear what he is saying  and her tone told the courtier that his words had been lost upon the morning air engrossed in the scene below she had not so much as listened to his bitter tirade for now francesco was behaving oddly the fool was returned from the errand on which he had been despatched and francesco called him to his side lowering his sword he received a paper from peppes hand  burning with indignation at having gone unheeded gonzaga stood gnawing his lip whilst valentina craned forward to catch francescos words  i have here a proof he cried of what i tell you proof of how little gian maria is prepared to carry out his threats of cannon it is that fellow cappoccio has seduced you with his talk and you like the sheep you are let yourselves be driven by his foul tongue now listen to the bribe that gian maria offers to one within these walls if he can contrive a means to deliver roccaleone into his hands and to gonzagas paralysing consternation he heard francesco read the letter with which gian maria had answered his proposed betrayal of the fortress he went white with fear and he leant against the low wall to steady the telltale trembling that had seized him then francescos voice scornful and confident floated up to his ears i ask you my friends would his highness of babbiano be disposed to the payment of a thousand gold florins if by bombardment he thought to break a way into roccaleone this letter was written yesterday since then we have made a brave display of cannon ourselves and if yesterday he dared not fire think you he will today but here assure yourselves if there is one amongst you that can read  he held out the letter to them cappoccio took it and calling one aventano he held it out in his turn this aventano a youth who had been partly educated for the church but had fallen from that lofty purpose now stood forward and took the letter he scrutinised it read it aloud and pronounced it genuine  whom is it addressed to demanded cappoccio  nay nay cried francesco what need for that  let be cappoccio answered almost fiercely if you would have us remain in roccaleone let be aventano tell me  to messer romeo gonzaga answered the youth in a voice of wonder  so evil a light leapt to cappoccios eye that francesco carried his free hand to the sword which he had lowered but cappoccio only looked up at gonzaga and grinned malevolently it had penetrated his dull wits that he had been the tool of a judas who sought to sell the castle for a thousand florins further than that cappoccio did not see nor was he very resentful and his grin was rather of mockery than of anger he was troubled by no lofty notions of honour that should cause him to see in this deed of gonzagas anything more than such a tricksters act as it is always agreeable to foil and then to the others who knew naught of what was passing in cappoccios mind he did a mighty strange thing from being the one to instigate them to treachery and mutiny he was the one now to raise his voice in a stout argument of loyalty he agreed with all that messer francesco had said and he for one ranged himself on messer francescos side to defend the gates from any traitors who sought to open them to gian maria sforza  his defection from the cause of mutiny was the signal for the utter abandoning of that cause itself and another stout ally came opportunely to weigh in francescos favour was the fact that the halfhour of grace was now elapsed and gian marias guns continued silent he drew their attention to the fact with a laugh and bade them go in peace adding the fresh assurance that those guns would not speak that day nor the next nor indeed ever  utterly conquered by francesco andperhaps even moreby his unexpected ally cappoccio they slunk shamefacedly away to the food and drink that he bade them seek at fra domenicos hands     chapter xx the lovers   how came that letter to your hands valentina asked gonzaga when presently they stood together in the courtyard whither the courtier had followed her when she descended  wrapped round an arbalestbolt that fell on the ramparts yesterday whilst i was walking there alone returned gonzaga coolly  he had by now regained his composure he saw that he stood in deadly peril and the very fear that possessed him seemed by an odd paradox to lend him the strength to play his part  valentina eyed him with a something of mistrust in her glance but on francescos clear countenance no shadow of suspicion showed his eyes almost smiled as he asked gonzaga  why did you not bear it to monna valentina  a flush reddened the courtiers cheeks he shrugged his shoulders impatiently and in a voice that choked with anger he delivered his reply  to you sir who seem bred in camps and reared in guardrooms the fulness of this insult offered me by gian maria may not be apparent it may not be yours to perceive that the very contact of that letter soiled my hands that it shamed me unutterably to think that that loutish duke should have deemed me a target for such a shaft it were idle therefore to seek to make you understand how little i could bear to submit to the further shame of allowing another to see the affront that i was powerless to avenge i did sir with that letter the only thing conceivable i crumpled it in my hand and cast it from me just as i sought to cast its contents from my mind but your watchful spies ser francesco bore it to you and if my shame has been paraded before the eyes of that rabble soldiery at least it has served the purpose of saving monna valentina to do that i would if the need arose immolate more than the pride that caused me to be silent on the matter of this communication  he spoke with such heat of sincerity that he convinced both francesco and valentina and the ladys eyes took on a softer expression as she surveyed gonzagathis poor gonzaga whom her heart told her she had sorely wronged in thought francesco ever generous took his passionate utterances in excellent part  messer gonzaga i understand your scruples you do me wrong to think that i should fail in that  he checked the suggestion he was on the point of renewing that nevertheless gonzaga would have been better advised to have laid that letter at once before monna valentina instead he dismissed the subject with a laugh and proposed that they should break their fast so soon as he had put off his harness  he went to do so whilst valentina bent her steps towards the diningroom attended by gonzaga to whom she now sought to make amends for her suspicions by an almost excessive friendliness of bearing  but there was one whom gonzagas highsounding words in connection with that letter had left cold this was peppe that most wise of fools he hastened after francesco and while the knight was disarming he came to voice his suspicions but francesco drove him out with impatience and peppe went sorrowing and swearing that the wisdom of the fool was truly better than the folly of the wise  throughout that day gonzaga hardly stirred from valentinas side he talked with her in the morning at great length and upon subjects poetical or erudite by which he meant to display his vast mental superiority over the swashbuckling francesco in the evening when the heat of the day was spent and whilst that same messer francesco was at some defensive measures on the walls gonzaga played at bowls with valentina and her ladiesthe latter having now recovered from the panic to which earlier they had been a prey  that morning gonzaga had stood at bay seeing his plans crumble that evening after the day spent in valentinas companyand she so sweet and kind to himhe began to take heart of grace once more and his volatile mind whispered to his soul the hope that after all things might well be as he had first intended if he but played his cards adroitly and did not mar his chances by the precipitancy that had once gone near to losing him his purpose gathered strength from a message that came that evening from gian maria who was by then assured that gonzagas plan had failed he sent word that being unwilling to provoke the bloodshed threatened by the reckless madman who called himself monna valentinas provost he would delay the bombardment hoping that in the meantime hunger would beget in that rebellious garrison a more submissive mood  francesco read the message to madonnas soldiers and they received it joyously their confidence in him increased a hundredfold by this proof of the accuracy of his foresight they were a gay company at supper in consequence and gayest of all was messer gonzaga most bravely dressed in a purple suit of taby silk to honour so portentous an occasion  francesco was the first to quit the table craving monna valentinas leave to be about some duty that took him to the walls she let him go and afterwards sat pensive nor heeded now romeos light chatter nor yet the sonnet of petrarca that presently he sang the company her thoughts were all with him that had left the board scarcely a word had she exchanged with francesco since that delirious moment when they had looked into each others eyes upon the ramparts and seen the secret that each was keeping from the other why had he not come to her she asked herself and then she bethought her of how gonzaga had all day long been glued to her side and she realised too that it was she had shunned francescos company grown of a sudden strangely shy  but greater than her shyness was now her desire to be near him and to hear his voice to have him look again upon her as he had looked that morning when in terror for him she had sought to dissuade him from opposing the craven impulse of her menatarms a woman of mature age or one riper in experience would have waited for him to seek her out but valentina in her sweet naturalness thought never of subterfuge or of dalliant wiles she rose quietly from the table ere gonzagas song was done and as quietly she slipped from the room  it was a fine night the air heavy with the vernal scent of fertile lands and the deep cobalt of the heavens a glittering starflecked dome in a lighter space of which floated the halfdisk of the growing moon such a moon she bethought her as she had looked at with thoughts of him the night after their brief meeting at acquasparta she had gained that north rampart on which he had announced that duty took him and yonder she saw a manthe only tenant of the wallleaning upon the embattled parapet looking down at the lights of gian marias camp he was bareheaded and by the gold coif that gleamed in his hair she knew him softly she stole up behind him  do we dream here messer francesco she asked him as she reached his side and there was laughter running through her words  he started round at the sound of her voice then he laughed too softly and gladly  it is a night for dreams and i was dreaming indeed but you have scattered them  you grieve me she rallied him for assuredly they were pleasant since to come here and indulge them you leftus  ayethey were pleasant he answered and yet they were fraught with a certain sadness but idle as is the stuff of dreams they were yours to dispel for they were of you  of me she questioned her heartbeats quickening and bringing to her cheeks a flush that she thanked the night for concealing  yes madonnaof you and our first meeting in the woods at acquasparta do you recall it  i do i do she murmured fondly  and do you recall how i then swore myself your knight and ever your champion little did we dream how the honour that i sighed for was to be mine  she made him no answer her mind harking back to that first meeting on which so often and so fondly she had pondered  i was thinking too he said presently of that man gian maria in the plain yonder and of this shameful siege  youyou have no misgivings she faltered for his words had disappointed her a little  misgivings  for being here with me for being implicated in what they call my rebellion  he laughed softly his eyes upon the silver gleam of waters below  my misgivings are all for the time when this siege shall be ended when you and i shall have gone each our separate way he answered boldly he turned to face her now and his voice rang a little tense but for being here to guide this fine resistance and lend you the little aid i can no no i have no misgiving for that it is the dearest frolic ever my soldiering led me into i came to roccaleone with a message of warning but underneath deep down in my heart i bore the hope that mine should be more than a messengers part that mine it might be to remain by you and do such work as i am doing  without you they would have forced me by now to surrender  perhaps they would but while i am here i do not think they will i burn for news of babbiano if i could but tell what is happening there i might cheer you with the assurance that this siege can last but a few days longer gian maria must get him home or submit to the loss of his throne and if he loses that your uncle would no longer support so strenuously his suit with you to you madonna this must be a cheering thought to mealas why should i hope for it  he was looking away now into the night but his voice quivered with the emotion that was in him she was silent and emboldened perhaps by that silence of hers encouraged by the memory of what he had seen that morning reflected in her eyes  madonna he cried i would it might be mine to cut a road for you through that besieging camp and bear you away to some blessed place where there are neither courts nor princes but since this may not be madonna mia i would that this siege might last for ever  and thenwas it the night breeze faintly stirring through his hair that mocked him with the whisper so indeed would i he turned to her his hand brown and nervous fell upon hers ivorywhite where it rested on the stone  valentina he cried his voice no louder than a whisper his eyes ardently seeking her averted ones and then as suddenly as it had leapt up was the fire in his glance extinguished he withdrew his hand from hers he sighed and shifted his gaze to the camp once more forgive forget madonna he murmured bitterly that which in my madness i have presumed  silent she stood for a long moment then she edged nearer to him and her voice murmured back what if i account it no presumption  with a gasp he swung round to face her and they stood very close glance holding glance and hers the less timid of the two they thus remained for a little space then shaking his head and speaking with an infinite sadness  it were better that you did madonna he made answer  better but why  because i am no duke madonna  and what of that she cried to add with scorn out yonder sits a duke oh sir how shall i account presumptuous in you the very words that i would hear what does your rank signify to me i know you for the truest knight the noblest gentleman and the most valiant friend that ever came to the aid of distressed maiden do you forget the very principles that have led me to make this resistance that i am a woman and ask of life no more than is a womans dueand no less  there she stopped again the blood suffused her cheeks as she bethought her of how fast she talked and of how bold her words might sound she turned slightly from him and leant now upon the parapet gazing out into the night and as she stood thus a very ardent voice it was that whispered in her ear  valentina by my soul i love you and there that whisper which filled her with an ecstasy that was almost painful in its poignancy ended sharply as if throttled again his hand sought hers which was yielded to him as she would have yielded her whole life at his sweet bidding and now his voice came less passionately  why delude ourselves with cruel hopes my valentina he was saying there is the future there is the time when this siege shall be done with and when gian maria having got him home you will be free to depart whither will you go  she looked at him as if she did not understand the question and her eyes were troubled although in such light as there was he could scarce see this  i will go whither you bid me where else have i to go she added with a note of bitterness  he started her answer was so far from what he had expected  but your uncle  what duty do i owe to him oh i have thought of it and untiluntil this morning it seemed that a convent must be my ultimate refuge i have spent most of my young life at santa sofia and the little that i have seen of the world at my uncles court scarce invites me to see more of it the mother abbess loved me a little she would take me back unless  she broke off and looked at him and before that look of absolute and sweet surrender his senses swam that she was niece to the duke of urbino he remembered no more than that he was count of aquila wellborn but of none too rich estate and certainly no more a match for her in guidobaldos eyes than if he had been the simple knighterrant that he seemed  he moved closer to her his handsas if obeying a bidding greater than his will the bidding of that glance of hers perhapstook her by the shoulders whilst his whole soul looked at her from his eyes then with a stifled cry he caught her to him for a moment she lay palpitant within his arms her tall bronze head on a level with his chin her heart beating against his heart stooping suddenly he kissed her on the lips she suffered it with an unresistance that invited but when it was done she gently put him from her and he obedient to her slightest wish curbed the wild ardour of his mood and set her free  anima mia he cried rapturously you are mine now betide what may not gian maria nor all the dukes in christendom shall take you from me  she set her hand upon his lips to silence him and he kissed the palm so that laughing she drew back again and now from laughter she passed to a great solemnity and with arm outstretched towards the ducal camp win me a way through those lines said she and bear me away from urbinofar away where guidobaldos power and the vengeance of gian maria may not follow usand you shall have won me for your own but until then let there be a truce toto this between us here is a mans work to be done and if i am weak as tonight i may weaken you and then we should both be undone it is upon your strength i count franceschino mio my true knight  he would have answered her he had much to tell herwho and what he was but she pointed to the head of the steps where a mans figure loomed  yonder comes the sentinel she said leave me now dear francesco go it is growing late  he bowed low before her obedient ever like the true knight he was and took his leave of her his soul on fire  valentina watched his retreating figure until it had vanished round the angle of the wall then with a profound sigh that was as a prayer of thanksgiving for this great good that had come into her life she leaned upon the parapet and looked out into the darkness her cheeks flushed her heart still beating high she laughed softly to herself out of the pure happiness of her mood the camp of gian maria became a subject for her scorn what should his might avail whilst she had such a champion to defend her now and hereafter  there was an irony in that siege on which her fancy fastened by coming thus in arms against her gian maria sought to win her for his wife yet all that he had accomplished was to place her in the arms of the one man whom she had learnt to love by virtue of this very siege the mellow warmth of the night the ambient perfume of the fields were wellsorted to her mood and the faint breeze that breathed caressingly upon her cheek seemed to reecho the melodies her heart was giving forth in that hour those old grey walls of roccaleone seemed to enclose for her a very paradise and the snatch of an old love song stole softly from her parted lips but like a paradisealasit had its snake that crept up unheard behind her and was presently hissing in her ear and its voice was the voice of romeo gonzaga  it comforts me madonna that there is one at least in roccaleone has the heart to sing  startled out of her happy pensiveness by that smooth and now unutterably sinister voice she turned to face its owner  she saw the white gleam of his face and something of the anger that smouldered in his eye and despite herself a thrill of alarm ran through her like a shudder she looked beyond him to a spot where lately she had seen the sentry there was no one there nor anywhere upon that wall they were alone and messer gonzaga looked singularly evil  for a moment there was a tense silence broken only by the tumbling waters of the torrentmoat and the hoarse challenge of a sentrys chi va là in gian marias camp then she turned nervously wondering how much he might have heard of what had passed between herself and francesco how much have seen  and yet gonzaga she answered him i left you singing below when i came away  to wanton it here in the moonlight with that damned swashbuckler that brigand that kennelbred beast of a sbirro  gonzaga you would dare  dare he mocked her beside himself with passion is it you who speak of daringyou the niece of guidobaldo da montefeltro a lady of the noble and illustrious house of rovere who cast yourself into the arms of a lowborn vassal such as that a masnadiero a bandit a bravo and can you yet speak of daring and take that tone with me when shame should strike you either dead or dumb  gonzaga she answered him her face as white as his own but her voice steady and hard with anger leave me nowupon the instant or i will have you floggedflogged to the bone  a moment he stared at her like a man dazed then he tossed his arms to heaven and letting them fall heavily to his sides he shrugged his shoulders and laughed evilly but of going he made no shift  call your men he answered her in a choking voice do your will on me flog me to the bone or to the deathlet that be the reward of all that i have done all that i have risked all that i have sacrificed to serve you it were of a piece with your other actions  her eyes sought his in the gloom her bosom heaving wildly in her endeavours to master herself before she spoke  messer gonzaga said she at last ill not deny that you served me faithfully in the matter of my escape from urbino  why speak of it he sneered it was a service of which you but avail yourself until another offered on whom you might bestow your favour and the supreme command of your fortress why speak of it  to show you that the service you allude to is now paid she riposted sternly by reproaching me you have taken payment and by insulting me you have stamped out my gratitude  a most convenient logic yours he mocked i am cast aside like an outworn garment and the garment is accounted paid for because through much hard usage it has come to look a little threadbare  and now it entered her mind that perhaps there was some justice in what he said perhaps she had used him a little hardly  do you think gonzaga she said and her tone was now a shade more gentle that because you have served me you may affront me and that knight who has served me also and  in what can such service as his compare with mine what has he done that i have not done more  why when the men rebelled here  bah cite me not that body of god it is his trade to lead such swine he is one of themselves but for the rest what has such a man as this to lose by his share in your rebellion compared with such a loss as mine must be  why if things go ill i take it he may lose his life she answered in a low voice can you lose more  he made a gesture of impatience  if things go illyes it may cost him dearly but if they go well and this siege is raised he has nothing more to fear mine is a parlous case however ends this siege for me there will be no escape from the vengeance of gian maria and guidobaldo they know my share in it they know that your action was helped by me and that without me you could never have equipped yourself for such resistance whatever may betide you and this ser franceseo for me there will be no escape  she drew a deep breath then set him the obvious question  did you not consider itdid you not weigh these chancesbefore you embarked upon this business before you yourself urged me to this step  aye did i he answered sullenly  then why these complaints now  he was singularly madly frank with her in his reply he told her that he had done it because he loved her because she had given him signs that his love was not in vain  i gave you signs she interrupted him mother in heaven recite these signs that i may know them  were you not ever kind to me he demanded did you not ever manifest a liking for my company were you not ever pleased that i should sing to you the songs that in your honour i had made was it not to me you turned in the hour of your need  see now how poor a thing you are gonzaga she answered witheringly a woman may not smile on you may not give you a kind word may not suffer you to sing to her but you must conclude she is enamoured of you and if i turned to you in my hour of need as you remind me needs that be a sign of my infatuation does every cavalier so think when a helpless woman turns to him in her distress but even so she continued how should all that diminish the peril you now talk of even were your suit with me to prosper would that make you any the less romeo gonzaga the butt of the anger of my uncle and gian maria rather do i think that it should make you more  but he disillusioned her he did not scruple in his angry mood to lay before her his reasonings that as her husband he would be screened  she laughed aloud at that  and so it is by such sophistries as these that your presumption came to life  that stung him quivering with the passion that obsessed him he stepped close up to her  tell me madonnawhy shall we account presumption in romeo gonzaga a suit that in a nameless adventurer we encourage he asked his voice thick and tremulous  have a care she bade him  a care of what he flashed back answer me monna valentina am i so base a man that by the very thought of love for you i must presume whilst you can give yourself into the arms of this swashbuckling bravo and take his kisses your reasoning sorts ill with your deeds  craven she answered him dog that you are and before the blaze of passion in her eyes he recoiled his courage faltering she cropped her anger in midcareer and in a dangerously calm voice she bade him see to it that by morning he was no longer in roccaleone profit by the night she counselled him and escape the vigilance of gian maria as best you can here you shall not stay  at that a great fear took possession of him putting to flight the last remnant of his anger nor fear alone was it to do him full justice it was also the realisation that if he would take payment from her for this treatment of him if he would slake his vengeance he must stay one plan had failed him but his mind was fertile and he might devise another that might succeed and place gian maria in roccaleone thus should he be amply venged she was turning away having pronounced his banishment but he sprang after her and upon his knees he now besought her piteously to hear him yet awhile  and she regretting her already of her harshness and thinking that perhaps in his jealousy he had been scarce responsible for what he had said stood still to hear him  not that not that madonna he wailed his tone suggesting the imminence of tears do not send me away if die i must let me die here at roccaleone helping the defence to my last breath but do not cast me out to fall into the hands of gian maria he will hang me for my share in this business do not requite me thus madonna you owe me a little surely and if i was mad when i talked to you just now it was love of you that drove melove of you and suspicion of that man of whom none of us know anything madonna be pitiful a little suffer me to remain  she looked down at him her mind swayed between pity and contempt then pity won the day in the wayward but ever gentle heart of valentina she bade him rise  and go gonzaga get you to bed and sleep you into a saner frame of mind we will forget all this that you have said so that you never speak of it againnor of this love you say you bear me  the hypocrite caught the hem of her cloak and bore it to his lips  may god keep your heart ever as pure and noble and forgiving he murmured brokenly i know how little i am deserving of your clemency but i shall repay you madonna he protestedand truly meant it though not in the sense it seemed     chapter xxi the penitent   a week passed peacefully at roccaleone so peacefully that it was difficult to conceive that out there in the plain sat gian maria with his fivescore men besieging them  this inaction fretted the count of aquila as did the lack of news from fanfulla and he wondered vaguely what might be taking place at babbiano that gian maria should be content to sit idly before them as though he had months at his disposal in which to starve them into yielding the mystery would have been dispelled had he known that he had gonzaga to thank for this singular patience of gian marias for the courtier had found occasion to send another lettercarrying shaft into the dukes camp informing him of how and why the last plot had failed and urging gian maria to wait and trust in him to devise a better scheme for delivering the castle into his power he had promised boldly and confidently enough and gian mariafacts showedhad trusted to that promise of his and awaited its fulfilment but tax his mind though he did incessantly no inspiration came to him no scheme suggested itself by which he might accomplish his treacherous purpose  he employed the time cunningly to win back valentinas favour and confidence on the morning after his stormy interview with guidobaldos niece he had confessed himself to fra domenico and approached the sacrament every morning thereafter he appeared at mass and by the piety and fervour of his devotions became an example to all the others now this was not lost on valentina who was conventbred and in a measure devout she read in this singular alteration of his ways the undoubtable indication of an altered character that he had approached the sacrament on the morning after his wild words to her she took to mean that he repented him the viciousness of the animosity he had entertained that he continued so extremely devout thereafter she construed into meaning that his repentance was sincere and persistent  and so she came to ask herself whether indeed he had not been as much sinned against as sinning and she ended by assuring herself that in a measure the fault was hers seeing him so penitent and concluding from it that he was not likely to transgress again she readmitted him to her favour and little by little the old friendly state was reestablished and was the sounder perhaps by virtue of her confidence that after what had passed he would not again misunderstand her  he did not nor did he again allow his optimism and everready vanity to cozen him with false hopes he read her with exact precision and whilst the reading but served to embitter him the more and render him more steadfast in his vengeful purpose it nevertheless made him smile the more sweetly and fawn the more obsequiously  and not content with this he did not limit his sycophancy to valentina but sought also by a smiling persistence to ingratiate himself with francesco no voice in roccaleonenot even that of the bully ercolewas raised more often or more enthusiastically to praise and glorify their provost valentina observing this and accepting it as another sign of his contrition for the past and purpose of amendment for the future grew yet more cordial towards him he was not lacking in astuteness this pretty ser romeo nor in knowledge of a womans heart and the apprehension of the fact that there is no flattery she prefers to that which has for object the man she loves  thus did gonzaga conquer the confidence and esteem of all during that peaceful week he seemed a changed man and all save peppe saw in this change a matter for increased trust and friendship towards him but the astute fool looked on and pondered such transformations as these were not effected in a night he was no believer in any human chrysalis that shall make of the grub of yesterday the butterfly of today and so in this fawning smiling subservient gonzaga he saw nothing but an object of mistrust a fellow to be watched with the utmost vigilance to this vigilance the hunchback applied himself with a zeal born of his cordial detestation of the courtier but gonzaga aware of the fools mistrust and watchfulness contrived for once to elude him and to get a letter to gian maria setting forth the ingenious plan he had hatched  the notion had come to him that sunday at mass on all sanctified days it was monna valentinas way to insist that the entire garrison with the exception of one single sentineland this only at francescos very earnest urgingshould attend the morning service like an inspiration it came to him that such a halfhour as that would be a most opportune season in which to throw open the gates of roccaleone to the besiegers the following wednesday was the feast of corpus christi then would be his opportunity  kneeling there with head bent in ecstatic devotion he matured his treacherous plan the single sentry he could suborn or elseif bribery failedponiard he realised that singlehanded he might not lower the cumbrous drawbridge nor would it be wise even if possible for the noise of it might give the alarm but there was the postern gian maria must construct him a light portable bridge and have it in readiness to span the moat and silently pour his soldiers into the castle through that little gate  and so the plot matured and every detail clear he got him to his chamber and penned the letter that was to rejoice the heart of gian maria he chose a favourable moment to despatch it as he had despatched the former ones tied about the quarrel of an arbalest and he saw gian marias signalfor which the letter had providedthat the plan would be adopted humming a gay measure jubilant at the prospect of seeing himself so amply avenged gonzaga passed down and out into the castle gardens to join the ladies in their merrymaking over a game of hoodman blind  now however much the duke of babbiano may have congratulated himself upon the ally he possessed in gonzaga and the cunning scheme the latter had devised for placing him in possession of roccaleone there came news to him on the morrow that caused him to rejoice a hundredfold more fervently his subjects of babbiano were in a condition approaching open rebellion resulting from the disquieting rumours that caesar borgia was arming at rome for a decent upon the duchy and the continued absence of gian maria in such a season upon a wooing that they deemed illtimed a strong party had been formed and the leaders had nailed upon the palace gates a proclamation that unless gian maria returned within three days to organise the defence of babbiano they would depose him and repair to aquila to invite his cousin francesco del falcowhose patriotism and military skill were known to allto assume the crown of babbiano and protect them  at the news and upon reading the proclamation which alvari had brought with him gian maria flew into one of those fits of rage that made his name a byword in babbiano presently however he cooled there was gonzaga yonder who had promised to admit him to roccaleone on wednesday that left him time to first possess himself of his reluctant bride and then ride hard to babbiano to arrive there before the expiry of the three days grace his subjects gave him  he conferred with guidobaldo and urged that a priest should be in waiting to wed them so soon as he should have brought her out of the fortress upon that detail they were within an ace of quarrelling guidobaldo would not at first agree to such hasty nuptials they were unfitting the dignity and the station of his niece and if gian maria would wed her he must come to urbino and let the ceremony be performed by a cardinal well was it then for gian maria that he mastered his wonted hastiness and curbed the hot defiant retort that rose to his lips had he done so an enduring rupture between them would probably have ensued for guidobaldo was not one to permit himself to be hectored and after all he amply realised that gian maria had more need of him than he of gian maria and this in that moment the duke of babbiano realised too and realising it he set himself to plead where otherwise he might have demanded to beg as a favour that which otherwise he might have commanded with a threat and so he won guidobaldoalthough reluctantto his wishes in the matter and in his goodnature the duke of urbino consented to pocket the dignity that prompted him to see the ceremony performed with princely pomp  this being settled gian maria blessed gonzaga who rendered it all possible and came most opportunely to his aid where without him he should have been forced to resort to cannon and bloodshed  with gonzaga the only shadow of doubt that remained to mar the perfect certainty of his success lay in his appreciation of francescos daring character and resourceful mind and now as if the gods were eager to favour him to the very last degreea strange weapon to combat this was unexpectedly thrust into his hand  it happened that alvari was not the only messenger who travelled that day to roccaleone there followed him by some hours the count of aquilas servant zaccaria who rode hard and reached the approaches of the castle by sunset his destination being the fortress itself he was forced to wait in the woods until night had fallen and even then his mission was fraught with peril  it befell that somewhere near the second hour of night the moon being overcast at the timefor there were threats of a storm in the skythe sentinel on the eastern wall heard a sound of splashing in the moat below accompanied by the stertorous breathing of a swimmer whose mouth is not well above water he challenged the sound but receiving no reply he turned to go and give the alarm and ran into the arms of gonzaga who had come up to take the air  illustrious he exclaimed there is someone swimming the moat  eh cried gonzaga a hundred suspicions of gian maria running through his mind treachery  it is what i thought  gonzaga took the man by the sleeve of his doublet and drew him back to the parapet they peered over and from out of the blackness they were hailed by a faint olá  who goes there demanded romeo  a friend came the answer softly a messenger from babbiano with letters for the lord count of aquila throw me a rope friends before i drown in this trough  you rave fool answered him gonzaga we have no counts at roccaleone  surely sir sentinel replied the voice my master messer francesco del falco is here throw me a rope i say  messer fran began gonzaga then he made a noise like a man choking it was as if a sudden light of revelation had flooded his brain get a rope he harshly bade the sentry in the armoury yard despatch fool he added sharply now fearing interruption  in a moment the man was back and the rope was lowered to the visitor below a few seconds later zaccaria stood on the ramparts of roccaleone the water dripping from his sodden garments and gathering in a pool about his feet  this way said gonzaga leading the man towards the armoury tower where a lanthorn was burning by the light of it he surveyed the newcomer and bade the sentry close the door and remain within call without  zaccaria looked startled at the order this was scarcely the reception he had expected after so imperilling his life to reach the castle with his letter  where is my lord he inquired through teeth that chattered from the cold of his immersion wondering vaguely who this very magnificent gentleman might be  is messer francesco del falco your lord asked romeo  he is sir i have had the honour to serve him these ten years i bring him letters from messer fanfulla degli arcipreti they are very urgent will you lead me to him  you are very wet murmured gonzaga solicitously you will take your death from cold and the death of a man so brave as to have found a way through gian marias lines were truly deplorable he stepped to the door olá he called to the sentry take this brave fellow up there and find him a change of raiment he pointed to the upper chamber of the tower where indeed such things were stored  but my letters sir cried zaccaria impatiently they are very urgent and hours have i wasted already in waiting for the night  surely you can wait until you have changed your garments your life i take it is of more account than the loss of a few moments  but my orders from messer degli arcipreti were that i must not lose an instant  oh si si cried gonzaga with a show of goodtempered impatience give me the letters then and i will take them to the count while you are stripping those wet clothes  zaccaria eyed him a moment in doubt but he looked so harmless in his finery and the expression of his comely face was so winning and honest that the mans hesitancy faded as soon as it sprang up removing his cap he drew from within the crown the letter which he had placed there to keep dry this package he now handed to gonzaga who with a final word of instruction to the sentry touching the finding of raiment for the messenger stepped out to go his errand but outside the door he paused and called the sentry to him again  here is a ducat for you he whispered do my bidding and you shall have more detain him in the tower till i return and on no account let him be seen or heard by anyone  yes excellency the man replied but what if the captain comes and finds me absent from my post  i will provide for that i will tell messer fortemani that i have employed you on a special matter and ask him to replace you you are dispensed sentry duty for tonight  the man bowed and quietly withdrew to attend to his prisoner for in that light he now regarded zaccaria  gonzaga sought fortemani in the guardroom below and did as he had promised the sentry  but snapped ercole reddening by whose authority have you done this by what right do you send sentinels on missions of your own christo santo is the castle to be invaded while you send my watchmen to fetch your comfit­box or a book of verses  you will remember began romeo with an air of overwhelming dignity  devil take you and him that sent you broke in the bully the messer provost shall hear of this  on no account cried gonzaga now passing from anger to alarm and snatching the skirts of fortemanis cloak as the captain was in the act of going out to execute his threat ser ercole be reasonable i beg of you are we to alarm the castle and disturb monna valentina over a trumpery affair such as this man they will laugh at you  eh there was nothing ercole relished less than to be laughed at he pondered a moment and it occurred to him that perhaps he was making much of nothing then  you aventano he called take your partisan and patrol the eastern rampart there messer gonzaga i have obeyed your wishes but messer francesco shall hear of it when he comes his rounds  gonzaga left him francesco would not make his rounds for another hour and by then it would not matter what fortemani told him in one way or another he would be able to account for his action  he crossed the courtyard and mounted the steps leading to his own chamber once there he closed and barred the door he kindled a light and flinging the letter on the table he sat and contemplated its exterior and the great red seal that gleamed in the yellow light of his taper  so this knighterrant this man whom he had accounted a lowborn hind was none other than the famous count of aquila the wellbeloved of the people of babbiano the beauideal of all military folk from sicily to the alps and he had never suspected it dullwitted did he now account himself enough descriptions had he heard of that famous condottiero that mirror of italian chivalry he might have known that there did not live two men of such commanding ways as he had seen instanced at roccaleone what was his object there was it love of valentina or was it he paused as in his mind he made a swift review of the politics of babbiano a sudden possibility occurred to him that made his eyes sparkle and his hands tremble with eagerness was this but a political scheme to undermine his cousins throne to which gonzaga had heard it rumoured that francesco del falco was an aspirant if it were so what a vengeance would be his to unmask him how it must humble valentina the letter lay before him within it the true facts would be disclosed what did his friend fanfulla write him  he took the letter up and made a close inspection of the seal then softly quietly slowly he drew his dagger if his suspicions were unfounded his dagger heated in the taper should afford him the means to conceal the fact that he had tampered with that missive he slipped his blade under the seal and worked it cautiously until it came up and set the letter open he unfolded it and as he read his eyes dilated he seemed to crouch on his chair and the hand that held the paper shook he drew the candle nearer and shading his eyes he read it again word for word  my dear lord counti have delayed writing until the time when the signs i observed should have become more definite as they have now done so that i may delay no longer this then goes by the hand of zaccaria to tell you that today has word been sent gian maria giving him three days in which to return to babbiano or to abandon all hope of his crown of which the people will send the offer then to you at aquila where you are believed to be so now my dear lord you have the tyrant at your mercy tossed between scylla and charybdis yours it is to resolve how you will act but i rejoice in being the one to send you word that your presence at roccaleone and your stubborn defence of the fortress has not been vain and that presently you are to reap the wellearned reward of it the people have been stirred to this extreme action by the confusion prevailing here  news has reached us that caesar borgia is arming at rome a condotta to invade babbiano and the people are exasperated at gian marias continued absence in such a season they are shortsighted in this for they overlook the results that must attend the alliance with urbino may god protect and prosper your excellency whose most devoted servant is  fanfulla degli aroipreti     chapter xxii a revelation   francesco said valentina and the name came from her lips as if it were an endearment why that frowning care­worn look  they were in the diningroom alone where the others had left them and they were still seated at the table at which they had supped francesco raised his dark thoughtful eyes and as they lighted now on valentina the thoughtfulness that was in them gave place to tenderness  i am fretted by this lack of news he acknowledged i would i knew what is being done in babbiano i had thought that ere now caesar borgia had stirred gian marias subjects into some manner of action i would i knew  she rose and coming close to him she stood with one hand resting upon his shoulder her eyes smiling down upon his upturned face  and shall such a trifle fret youyou who professed a week ago that you would this siege might last for ever  account me not fickle anima mia he answered her and he kissed the ivory fingers that rested on his shoulder for that was before the world changed for me at the magic of your bidding and so he repeated i would i knew what is toward at babbiano  but why sigh over a wish so idle she exclaimed by what means can news reach you here of the happenings of the world without  he pondered a moment seeking words in which to answer her a score of times during that week had he been on the point of disclosing himself of telling her who and what he was yet ever had he hesitated putting off that disclosure until the season should appear more fitting this he now considered the present she trusted him and there was no reason to remain silent longer perhaps already he had delayed too long and so he was about to speak when she started from his side and crossed hastily to the window alarmed by the sound of approaching steps a second later the door opened and gonzaga appeared  a moment he hesitated in the doorway looking from one to the other and francesco lazily regarding him in his turn noted that his cheeks were pale and that his eyes glittered like those of a man with the fever then he stepped forward and leaving the door open behind him he advanced into the room  monna valentina i have something to communicate to you his voice shook slightly messerfrancesco will you give us leave and his feverish eyes moved to the open door with an eloquence that asked no words  francesco rose slowly endeavouring to repress his surprise and glanced across at valentina as if awaiting her confirmation or refusal of this request that he should leave them  a communication for me she marvelled a slight frown drawing her brows together of what nature sir  of a nature as important as it is private  she raised her chin and with a patient smile she seemed to beg of francesco that he would suffer her to humour this mood of gonzagas in quick obedience francesco inclined his head  i shall be in my chamber until the hour of my rounds madonna he announced and with that took his departure  gonzaga attended him to the door which he closed after him and composing his features to an expression of sorrowing indignation he came back and stood facing valentina across the table  madonna he said i would to heaven this communication i have to make to you came from other lips in the light of what has passedhere at roccaleonethrough my follyyouyou may think my mission charged with vindictiveness  perplexity stared at him from her eyes  you fill me with alarm my good gonzaga she answered him though smiling  alas it has fallen to my unfortunate lot to do more than that i have made the discovery of as foul a piece of treachery here in your fortress as ever traitor hatched  she looked at him more seriously now the vehemence of his tone and the suggestion of sorrow that ran through it and gave it so frank an accent commanded her attention  treachery she echoed in a low voice her eyes dilating and from whom  he hesitated a moment then waving his hand  will you not sit madonna he suggested nervously  mechanically she seated herself at the table her eyes ever on his face alarm spreading in her heart born of suspense  be seated too she bade him and tell me  he drew up a chair sat down opposite to her and taking a deep breath heard you ever of the count of aquila he inquired  it were odd if i had not the most valiant knight in italy fame dubs him  his eyes were intently on her face and what he saw there satisfied him  you know how he stands with the people of babbiano  i know that he is beloved of them  and do you know that he is a pretender to the throne of babbiano you will remember that he is cousin to gian maria  his relationship to gian maria i know that he pretends to the throne of babbiano i was not aware but whither are we straying  we are not straying madonna answered gonzaga we are making a straight line for the very heart and soul of this treachery i spoke of would you believe me if i told you that here in roccaleone we have an agent of the count of aquila one who in the counts interest is protracting this siege with the pretended aim of driving gian maria off  gonzaga she began more than half guessing the drift of his explanation but he interrupted her with unusual brusqueness  wait madonna he cried his eyes upon her face his hand imperiously raised hear me out in patience i am not talking idly of what i tell you i am armed with proof and witness such an agent ofof the counts interests we have among us and his true object in protracting this siege and encouraging and aiding you in your resistance is to outwear the patience of the people of babbiano with gian maria and drive them in the hour of their approaching peril from caesar borgias armies to bestow the throne on aquila  where learnt you this foul lie she asked him her cheeks crimson her eyes on fire  madonna he said in a patient voice this that you call a lie is already an accomplished fact i am not laying before you the fruits of idle speculation i have upon me the most positive proof that such a result as was hoped for has already been reached gian maria has received from his subjects a notification that unless he is in his capital within three days from this they will invest the lord of aquila with the ducal crown  she rose her anger well controlled her voice calm  where is this proof no no i dont need to see it whatever it is what shall it prove to me that your words in so far as the politics of babbiano are concerned may be true our resistance of gian maria may indeed be losing him his throne and doing good service to the cause of the count of aquila but how shall all this prove that lie of yours that messer francescofor it is clearly of him you speakthat messer francesco should be this agent of the counts it is a lie gonzaga for which you shall be punished as you deserve  she ceased and stood awaiting his reply and as she watched him his calm demeanour struck a chill into her heart he was so confident so full of assurance and that in gonzaga she had learnt to know meant a strong bulwark twixt himself and danger he sighed profoundly  madonna these cruel words of yours do not wound me since they are no more than i expected but it will wound meand sorelyif when you shall have learnt the rest you do not humbly acknowledge how you have wronged me how grossly you have misjudged me you think i come to you with evil in my heart urged by a spirit of vindictiveness against messer francesco instead i come to you with nothing but a profound sorrow that mine must be the voice to disillusion you and a deep indignation against him that has so foully used you to his own ends wait madonna in a measure you are right it was not strictly true to say that this messer francesco is the agent of the count of aquila  ah you are recanting already  only a littlean insignificant little he is no agent because he hesitated and glanced swiftly up then he sighed lowered his voice and with consummately simulated sorrow he concluded because he is himself francesco del falco count of aquila  she swayed a moment and the colour died from her cheeks leaving them ivory pale she leaned heavily against the table and turned over in her mind what she had heard and then as suddenly as it had gone the blood rushed back into her face mounting to her very temples  its a lie she blazed at him a lie for which you shall be whipped  he shrugged his shoulders and cast francescos letter on to the table  there madonna is something that will prove all that i have said  she eyed the paper coldly her first impulse was to call fortemani and carry out her threat of having gonzaga whipped refusing so much as to see this thing that he so confidently termed a proof but it may be that his confidence wrought upon her touching a chord of feminine curiosity that he was wrong she never doubted but that he believed himself right she was also assured and she wondered what this thing might be that had so convinced him still she did not touch it but asked in an indifferent voice  what is it  a letter that was brought hither tonight by a man who swam the moat and whom i have ordered to be detained in the armoury tower it is from fanfulla degli arcipreti to the count of aquila if your memory will bear you back to a certain day at acquasparta you may recall that fanfulla was the name of a very gallant cavalier who addressed this messer francesco with marked respect  she took that backward mental glance he bade her and remembered then she remembered too how that very evening francesco had said that he was fretting for news of babbiano and that when she had asked how he hoped that news could reach him at roccaleone gonzaga had entered before he answered her indeed he had seemed to hesitate upon that answer a sudden chill encompassed her at that reflection oh it was impossible absurd and yet she took the letter from the table with knit brows she read it whilst gonzaga watched her scarce able to keep the satisfaction from gleaming in his eyes  she read it slowly and as she read her face grew deathly pale when she had finished she stood silent for a long minute her eyes upon the signature and her mind harking back to what gonzaga had said and drawing comparison between that and such things as had been done and uttered and nowhere did she find the slightest gleam of that discrepancy which so ardently she sought  it was as if a hand were crushing the heart in her bosom this man whom she had trusted this peerless champion of her cause to be nothing but a selfseeker an intriguer who to advance his own ends had made a pawn of her she thought of how for a moment he had held her in his arms and kissed her and at that her whole soul revolted against the notion that here was no more than treachery  its all a plot against him she cried her cheeks scarlet again its an infamous thing of your devising messer gonzaga an odious lie  madonna the man that brought the letter is still detained confront him with messer francesco or apply the question to him and learn his masters true name and station as for the rest if that letter is insufficient proof for you i beg that you will look back at facts why should he lie to you and say that his name was francesco franceschi why should he have urged youagainst all reasonto remain here when he brought you news that gian maria was advancing surely had he but sought to serve you he had better accomplished this by placing his own castle of aquila at your disposal and leaving here an empty nest for gian maria as i urged  she sank to a chair a fever in her mind  i tell you madonna there is no mistake what i have said is true another three days would he have held gian maria here whilst if you gave him that letter it is odds he would slip away in the night of tomorrow that he might be in babbiano on the third day to take the throne his cousin treats so lightly sainted god he cried out i think this is the most diabolically treacherous plot that ever mind of man conceived and human heartlessness executed  butbut she faltered all this is presupposing that messer francesco is indeed the count of aquila may theremay it not be that this letter was meant for some other destination  will you confront this messenger with the count  with the count she inquired dully with messer francesco you mean she shuddered and with strange inconsistence no she said in a choking voice her lip twisting oddly at the corner i do not wish to see his face again  a light gleamed in gonzagas eye and was extinguished on the instant  best make certain he suggested rising i have ordered fortemani to bring lanciotto here he will be waiting now without shall i admit them  she nodded without speaking and gonzaga opened the door and called fortemani a voice answered him from the gloom of the banquetinghall  bring lanciotto here he commanded  when francescos servant entered a look of surprise on his face at these mysterious proceedings it was valentina who questioned him and that in a voice as cold as though the issue concerned her no whit  tell me sirrah she said and as you value your neck see that you answer me trulywhat is your masters name  lanciotto looked from her to gonzaga who stood by a cynical curl on his sensual lips  answer monna valentina the courtier urged him state your masters true name and station  but lady began lanciotto bewildered  answer me she stormed her small clenched hands beating the table in harsh impatience and lanciotto seeing no help for it answered  messer francesco del falco count of aquila  something that began in a sob and ended in a laugh burst from the lips of valentina ercoles eyes were wide at the news and he might have gone the length of interposing a question when gonzaga curtly bade him go to the armoury tower and bring thence the soldier and the man gonzaga had left in his care  i will leave no shadow of doubt in your mind madonna he said in explanation  they waited in silencefor lanciottos presence hindered conversationuntil ercole returned accompanied by the manatarms and zaccaria who had now changed his raiment before they could question the newcomer such questions as they might have put were answered by the greeting that passed between him and his fellowservant lanciotto  gonzaga turned to valentina she sat very still her tawny head bowed and in her eyes a look of sore distress and in that instant a brisk step sounded without the door was thrust open and francesco himself stood upon the threshold with peppes alarmed face showing behind him gonzaga instinctively drew back a pace and his countenance lost some of its colour  at sight of francesco zaccaria rushed forward and bowed profoundly  my lord he greeted him  and if one little thing had been wanting to complete the evidence against the count that thing by an odd mischance francesco himself seemed to supply the strange group in that diningroom claiming his attention and the portentous air that hung about those present confirmed the warning peppe had brought him that something was amiss he disregarded utterly his servants greeting and with eyes of a perplexity that may have worn the look of alarm he sought the face of valentina  she rose upon the instant an angry red colouring her cheeks his very glance it seemed was become an affront unbearable after what had passedfor the memory of his kiss bit like a poisoned fang into her brain an odd laugh broke from her she made a gesture towards francesco  fortemani you will place the count of aquila under arrest she commanded in a stern steady voice and as you value your life you will see that he does not elude you  the great bully hesitated his knowledge of francescos methods was not encouraging  madonna gasped francesco his bewilderment increasing  did you hear me fortemani she demanded remove him  my lord cried lanciotto laying hand to his sword his eyes upon his masters ready to draw and lay about him at a glance of bidding  sh let be answered franeesco coldly here messer fortemani and he proffered his dagger the only weapon that he carried  valentina calling gonzaga to attend her made shift to quit the apartment at that francesco seemed to awaken to his position  madonna wait he cried and he stepped deliberately before her you must hear me i have surrendered in earnest of my faith and confident that once you have heard me  captain fortemani she cried almost angrily will you restrain your prisoner i wish to pass  ercole with visible reluctance laid a hand on francescos shoulder but it was unnecessary before her words the count recoiled as if he had been struck he stood clear of her path with a gasp at once of unbelief and angry resignation an instant his eyes rested on gonzaga so fiercely that the faint smile withered on the courtiers lips and his knees trembled under him as he hastened from the room in valentinas wake     chapter xxiii in the armoury tower   the rough stones of the inner courtyard shone clean and bright in the morning sun still wet with the heavy rains that had washed them yesternight  the fool sat on a rude stool within the porch of the long gallery and moodily eyeing that glistening pavement ruminated he was angry which saving where fra domenico was concerned was a rare thing with goodhumoured peppe he had sought to reason with monna valentina touching the imprisonment in his chamber of messer francesco and she had bidden him confine his attention to his capers with a harshness he had never known in her before but he had braved her commands and astonished her with the information that the true identity of this messer francesco had been known to him since that day when they had first met him at acquasparta he had meant to say more he had meant to add the announcement of francescos banishment from babbiano and his notorious unwillingness to mount his cousins throne he had meant to make her understand that had francesco been so minded he had no need to stoop to such an act as this that she imputed to him but she had cut him short and with angry words and angrier threats she had driven him from her presence  and so she was gone to mass and the fool had taken shelter in the porch of the gallery that there he might vent some of his illhumouror indeed indulge itin pondering the obtuseness of woman and the insidiousness of gonzaga to whom he never doubted that this miserable state of things was due  and as he sat therea grotesque misshapen figure in gaudy motleyan ungovernable rage possessed him what was to become of them now without the count of aquilas stern support the garrison would have forced her to capitulate a week ago what would betide now that the restraint of his formidable command was withdrawn  she will know her folly when its too late its the way of women he assured himself and loving his mistress as he did his faithful soul was stricken at the thought he would wait there until she returned from mass and then she should hear himall should hear him he would not permit himself to be driven away again so easily he was intently turning over in his mind what he would say with what startling pregnant sentence he would compel attention when he was startled by the appearance of a figure on the chapel steps sudden and quietly as an apparition it came but it bore the semblance of romeo gonzaga  at sight of him peppe instinctively drew back into the shadows of the porch his eyes discerning the suspicious furtiveness of the courtiers movements and watching them with a grim eagerness he saw romeo look carefully about him and then descend the steps on tiptoe evidently so that no echo of his footfalls should reach those within the chapel then never suspecting the presence of peppe he sped briskly across the yard and vanished through the archway that led to the outer court and the fool assured that some knowledge of the courtiers purpose would not be amiss set out to follow him  in his room under the lions tower the count of aquila had spent a restless night exercised by those same fears touching the fate of the castle that had beset the fool but less readily attributing his confinement to gonzagas scheming zaccarias presence had told him that fanfulla must at last have written and he could but assume that the letter falling into monna valentinas hands should have contained something that she construed into treason on his part  bitterly he reproached himself now with not having from the very outset been frank with her touching his identity bitterly he reproached her with not so much as giving a hearing to the man she had professed to love had she but told him upon what grounds her suspicions against him had been founded he was assured that he could have dispelled them at a word making clear their baselessness and his own honesty of purpose towards her most of all was he fretted by the fact that zaccarias presence after a coming so long expected and so long delayed argued that the news he bore was momentous from this it might result that gian maria should move at any moment and that his action might be of a desperate character  now through the ranks of fortemanis men there had run an inevitable dismay at francescos arrest and a resentment against valentina who had encompassed it his hand it was that had held them together his judgmentof which they had had unequivocal signsthat had given them courage he was a leader who had shown himself capable of leading and out of confidence for whom they would have undertaken anything that he bade them whom had they now fortemani was but one of themselves placed in command over them by an event purely adventitious gonzaga was a fop whose capers they mimicked and whose wits they despised whilst valentina though brave enough and highspirited remained a girl of no worldly and less military knowledge whose orders it might be suicidal to carry out  now by none were these opinions more strongly entertained than by ercole fortemani himself never had he performed anything with greater reluctance than the apprehension of francesco and when he thought of what was likely to follow his consternation knew no bounds he had come to respect and in his rough way even to love their masterful provost and since learning his true identity in the hour of arresting him his admiration had grown to something akin to reverence for the condottiero whose name to the menatarms of italy was like the name of some patron saint  to ensure the safe keeping of his captive he had been ordered by gonzaga who now resumed command of roccaleone to spend the night in the anteroom of francescos chamber these orders he had exceeded by spending a considerable portion of the night in the counts very room  you have but to speak the bully had sworn by way of showing francesco the true nature of his feelings and the castle is yours at a word from you my men will flock to obey you and you may do your will at roccaleone  foul traitor that you are francesco had laughed at him do you forget under whom you have taken service let be what is ercole but if a favour you would do me let me see zaccariathe man that came to roccaleone tonight  this ercole had done for him now zaccaria was fully aware of the contents of the letter he had carried having been instructed by fanfulla against the chance arising of his being compelled for his safety to destroy itan expedient to which he now bitterly repented him that he had not had recourse from zaccaria then francesco learnt all that there was to learn and since the knowledge but confirmed his fears that gian maria would delay action no longer he fell a prey to the most passionate impatience at his own detention  in the grey hours of the morning he grew calmer and by the light of a lamp that he had called ercole to replenish he sat down to write a letter to valentina which he thought should carry conviction of his honesty to her heart since she would not hear him this was the only course at the end of an hourhis moribund light grown yellow now that the sun was risenhis letter was accomplished and he summoned ercole again to charge him to deliver it at once to monna valentina  i shall await her return from chapel answered ercole he took the letter and departed as he emerged into the courtyard he was startled to see the fool dash towards him gasping for breath and with excitement in every line of his quaint face  quickly ercole peppe enjoined him come with me  devil take you spawn of satanwhither growled the soldier  i will tell you as we go we have not a moment to spare there is treachery afoot gonzaga he gasped and ended desperately will you come  fortemani needed no second bidding the chance of catching pretty messer romeo at a treachery was too sweet a lure snorting and puffingfor hard drinking had sorely impaired his windthe great captain hurried the fool along listening as they went to the gasps in which he brought out his story it was not much after all peppe had seen messer gonzaga repair to the armoury tower through an arrowslit he had watched him take down and examine an arbalest place it on the table and sit down to write  well demanded ercole what else  naught else that is all answered the hunchback  heaven and hell roared the swashbuckler coming to a standstill and glowering down upon his impatient companion and you have made me run for this  and is it not enough retorted peppe testily will you come on  not a foot farther returned the captain getting very angry is this a miserable jest what of the treachery you spoke of  a letter and an arbalest panted the maddened peppe grimacing horribly at this delay god was there ever such a fool does this mean nothing to that thick empty thing you call a head have you forgotten how gian marias offer of a thousand florins came to roccaleone on an arbalest quarrel stupid come on i say and afterwards you shall have my motleythe only livery you have a right to wear  in the shock of enlightenment ercole forgot to cuff the jester for his insolence and allowed himself once more to be hurried along across the outer court and up the steps that led to the battlements  you think he began  i think you had best tread more softly snapped the fool under his breath and control that thunderous wheeze if you would surprise ser romeo  ercole accepted the hint meek as a lamb and leaving the fool behind him on the steps he went softly up and approached the armoury tower peering cautiously through the arrowslit and favoured by the fact that gonzagas back was towards him he saw that he was no more than in time  the courtier was bending down and by the creaking sound that reached him ercole guessed his occupation to be the winding of the arbalest string on the table at his side lay a quarrel swathed in a sheet of paper  swiftly and silently ercole moved round the tower and the next instant he had pushed open the unfastened door and entered  a scream of terror greeted him and a very startled face was turned upon him by gonzaga who instantly sprang upright then seeing who it was the courtiers face reassumed some of its normal composure but his glance was uneasy and his cheek pale  sant iddio he gasped you startled me ercole i did not hear you coming  and now something in the bullys face heightened the alarm in gonzaga he still made an effort at selfcontrol as planting himself between ercole and the table so as to screen the telltale shaft he asked him what he sought there  that letter you have written gian maria was the gruff uncompromising answer for ercole reeked nothing of diplomatic issues  gonzagas mouth jerked itself open and his upper lip shuddered against his teeth  what wha  give me that letter ercole insisted now advancing upon him and wearing an air of ferocity that drove back into gonzagas throat such resentful words as he bethought him of then like an animal at bayand even a rat will assert itself thenhe swung aloft the heavy arbalest he held and stood barring ercoles way  stand back he cried or by god and his saints ill beat your brains out  there was a guttural laugh from the swashbuckler and then his arms were round gonzagas shapely waist and the popinjay was lifted from his feet viciously he brought down the crossbow as he had threatened but it smote the empty air the next instant gonzaga was hurtled bruised into a corner of the tower  in a rage so great that he felt it draining him of his very strength and choking the breath in his body he made a movement to rise and fling himself again upon his aggressor but fortemani was down upon him and for all his struggles contrived to turn him over on his face twisting his arms behind him and making them fast with a belt that lay at hand  lie still you scorpion growled the ruffler breathing hard from his exertions he rose took the shaft with the letter tied about it read the superscriptionto the high and mighty lord gian maria sforzaand with a chuckle of mingled relish and scorn he was gone locking the door  left alone gonzaga lay face downward where he had been flung able to do little more than groan and sweat in the extremity of his despair whilst he awaited the coming of those who would probably make an end of him not even from valentina could he hope for mercy so incriminating was the note he had penned his letter was to enjoin the duke to hold his men in readiness at the hour of the angelus next morning and to wait until gonzaga should wave a handkerchief from the battlements at that he was to advance immediately to the postern which he would find open and the rest gonzaga promised him would be easy he would take the whole garrison at their prayers and weaponless  when francesco read it a light leapt to his eye and an oath to his lips but neither glance nor oath were of execration as ercole stood expecting a sudden idea flashed through the counts mind so strange and humorous and yet so full of promise of easy accomplishment that he burst into a laugh  now may god bless this fool for the most opportune of traitors he exclaimed in surprise at which fortemanis mouth fell open and the eyes of peppe grew very round  ercole my friend here is a bait to trap that lout my cousin such as i could never have devised myself  you mean  take it back to him cried the count holding out the letter with a hand that trembled in the eagerness of his spirit take it back and get him by fair means or foul to shoot it as he intended or if he refuses why then do you seal it up and shoot it yourself but see that it gets to gian maria  may i not know what you intend quoth the bewildered ercole  all in good time my friend first do my bidding with that letter listen it were best that having read it you agree to join him in his betrayal of roccaleone your own fears as to the ultimate fate awaiting you at gian marias hands being aroused urge him to promise you money immunity what you will as your reward but make him believe you sincere and induce him to shoot his precious bolt now go lose no time or they may be returning from chapel and your opportunity will be lost come to me here afterwards and i will tell you what is in my mind we shall have a busy night of it tonight ercole and you must set me free when the others are abed now go  ercole went and peppe remaining plagued the count with questions which he answered until in the end the fool caught the drift of his scheme and swore impudently that a greater jester than his excellency did not live then ercole returned  is it done has the letter gone cried francesco fortemani nodded  we are sworn brothers in this business he and i he added a line to his note to say that he had gained my cooperation and that therefore immunity was expected for me too  you have done well ercole francesco applauded him now return me the letter i gave you for monna valentina there is no longer the need for it but return to me tonight toward the fourth hour when all are abed and bring with you my men lanciotto and zaccaria     chapter xxiv the interrupted mass   the morning of that wednesday of corpus christi fateful to all concerned in this chronicle dawned misty and grey and the air was chilled by the wind that blew from the sea the chapel bell tinkled out its summons and the garrison trooped faithfully to mass  presently came monna valentina followed by her ladies her pages and lastly peppe wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager anxiety and unrest valentina was very pale and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness and as she bowed her head in prayer her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated massbook over which she bent and now came fra domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the church ordains for the corpus christi feast followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black and the mass commenced  there were absent only from the gathering gonzaga and fortemani besides a sentry and the three prisoners francesco and his two followers  gonzaga had presented himself to valentina with the plausible tale that as the events of which fanfullas letter had given them knowledge might lead gian maria at any moment to desperate measures it might be well that he should reinforce the single manatarms patrolling the walls valentina little recking now whether the castle held or fell and still less such trifles as gonzagas attendance at mass had assented without heeding the import of what he said  and so his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel the sentinel was that same clerkly youth aventano who had read to the soldiers that letter gian maria had sent gonzaga this the courtier accepted as a good omen if a man there was among the soldiery at roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an account to settle that man was aventano  the mist was rapidly lightening and the country grew visible for miles around in the camp of gian maria he observed a coming and going of men that argued an inordinate bustle for so early an hour they awaited his signal  he approached the young sentinel growing more and more nervous as the time for action advanced he cursed fortemani who had selfishly refused to take an active part in the admission of gian maria here was a task that fortemani could perform more satisfactorily than he he had urged this fact on ercoles attention but the swashbuckler had grinned and shook his head to gonzaga fell the greater reward and so gonzaga must do the greater work it was only fair the knave had urged and while gonzaga was about it he would watch the chapel door against interruption and so gonzaga had been forced to come alone to try conclusions with the sentry  he gave the young man a nervous but pleasant goodmorrow and observed with satisfaction that he wore no body armour his original intention had been to attempt to suborn him and render him pliable by bribery but now that the moment for action was arrived he dared not make the offer he lacked for words in which to present his proposal and he was afraid lest the man should resent it and in a fit of indignation attack him with his partisan he little imagined that aventano had been forewarned by ercole that a bribe would be offered him and that he was to accept it promptly ercole had chosen this man because he was intelligent and had made him understand enough of what was toward besides offering a substantial reward if he played his part well and aventano waited but gonzaga knowing naught of this abandoned at the last moment the notion of bribing himwhich ercole had enjoined him and which he in his turn had promised ercole was the course he would pursue  you seem cold excellency said the young man deferentially for he had observed that gonzaga shivered  a chill morning aventano returned the gallant with a grin  true but the sun is breaking through yonder it will be warmer soon  why yes answered the other abstractedly and still he remained by the sentinel his hand under the gay mantle of blue velvet nervously fingering the hilt of a dagger that he dared not draw it came to him that moments were passing and that the thing must be done yet aventano was a sinewy youth and if the sudden stab he meditated failed him he would be at the fellows mercy at the thought he shivered again and his face turned grey he moved away a step and then inspiration brought him a cruel ruse he uttered a cry  what is that he exclaimed his eyes on the ground  in an instant aventano was beside him for his voice had sounded alarmeda tone in his present condition not difficult to simulate  what excellency  down there cried gonzaga excitedly there from that fissure in the stone saw you nothing and he pointed to the ground at a spot where two slabs met  i saw nothing illustrious  it was like a flash of yellow light below there what is under us here ill swear theres treachery at work get down on your knees and try if anything is to be seen  with a wondering glance at the courtiers white twitching face the unfortunate young man went down on all fours to do his bidding after allpoor fellowhe was hardly intelligent as fortemani opined  there is nothing excellency he said the plaster is cracked but ah  in a panic of haste gonzaga had whipped the dagger from its sheath and sunk it into the middle of aventanos broad back the fellows arms slid out and with a longdrawn gurgling sigh he sank down and stretched himself horribly on the stones  in that instant the clouds parted overhead and the sun came out in a blaze of golden glory high above gonzagas head a lark burst into song  for a moment the assassin remained standing above the body of his victim with head sunk between the shoulders like a man who expects a blow his face grey his teeth chattering and his mouth twitching hideously a shudder shook him it was the first life he had taken and that carrion at his feet filled him with sickly horror not for a kingdomnot to save his vile soul from the eternal damnation that act had earned itwould he have dared stoop to pluck the dagger from the back of the wretch he had murdered with something like a scream he turned and fled in a panic from the spot panting with horror yet subconsciously aware of the work he had to do he paused a moment to wave a kerchief then dashed down the steps to the postern  with trembling fingers he unlocked the door and set it wide to gian marias men who in answer to his signal were now hurrying forward with a bridge composed of pine trees that they had hastily and roughly put together during the previous day this with some efforts and more noise than gonzaga relished was thrust across the moat one of the men crept across and assisted gonzaga to make fast his end  a moment later gian maria and guidobaldo stood in the castleyard and after them came almost every man of the five score that gian maria had brought to that siege this was what francesco had confidently expected knowing that it was not his cousins way to run any risks  the duke of babbiauo whose face was disfigured by a bristling hedge of reddish stubblefor in obedience to the vow he had made he now carried a fortnights growth of beard on his round faceturned to gonzaga  is all well he asked in a friendly tone whilst guidobaldo contemptuously eyed the popinjay  gonzaga assured them that the whole thing had been effected without disturbing the garrison at their prayers now that he deemed himself well protected his usual serenity of manner returned  you may felicitate yourself highness he ventured to say with a grin to guidobaldo that you have reared your niece in devout ways  did you address me quoth the duke of urbino coldly i trust it may not again be necessary  before the look of loathing in his handsome face gonzaga cringed gian maria laughed in his piping treble  have i not served your highness faithfully fawned the gallant  so has the meanest scullion in my kitchens the lowliest groom in my stablesand with more honour to himself answered the proud duke yet he does not go the length of jesting with me his eye carried a menace so eloquent that gonzaga drew back afraid but gian maria clapped him on the shoulder in a friendly manner  be of good heart judas he laughed his pale face agrin i shall find room for you in babbiano and work too if you do it as well as this come the men are here now let us go forward whilst they are at their prayers but we must not disturb them he added more seriously i will not be guilty of an impiety we can lie in wait for them without  he laughed gaily for he seemed in a preposterously good humour and bidding gonzaga lead the way he followed with guidobaldo at his side they crossed the courtyard where his men were ranged armed to the teeth and at the door of the archway leading to the inner court they paused for gonzaga to open it  a moment the gallant stood staring then he turned a face of consternation on the dukes his knees shook visibly  it is locked he announced in a husky voice  we made too much noise in entering suggested guidobaldo and they have taken the alarm  the explanation relieved the growing uneasiness in gian marias mind he turned with an oath to his men  here some of you his sharp voice commanded beat me down this door by the host do the fools think to keep me out so easily  the door was broken down and they advanced but only some halfdozen paces for at the end of that short gallery they found the second door barring their progress through this too they broke gian maria fiercely blaspheming at the delay yet when it was done he was none so eager to lead the way  in the second courtyard he deemed it extremely probable that they should find valentinas soldiers awaiting them so bidding his men pass on he remained behind with guidobaldo until he heard word that the inner court was likewise empty  and now the entire hundred of his followers were assembled there to overpower the twenty that served monna valentina and guidobaldodespite gian marias scruplesstrode coolly forward to the chapel door                                            within the chapel mass had started fra domenico at the foot of the altar had pattered through the confiteor his deep voice responded to by the soprano of the ministering page the kyrie was being uttered when the attention of the congregation was attracted by the sound of steps approaching the chapel door to the accompaniment of an ominous clank of steel the men rose in a body fearing treachery and cursingdespite the sanctity of the placethe circumstance that they were without weapons  then the door opened and down the steps rang the armed heels of the newcomers so that every eye was turned upon them including that of fra domenico who had pronounced the last christe eleison in a quavering voice  a gasp of relief followed by an angry cry from valentina went up when they recognised those that came first stepped the count of aquila in full armour sword at side and dagger on hip carrying his headpiece on the crook of his left arm behind him towered the bulk of fortemani his great face flushed with a strange excitement a leather hacketon over his steel cuirass girt too with sword and dagger and carrying his shining morion in his hand last came lanciotto and zaccaria both fully equipped and armed at all points  who are you that come thus accoutred into gods house to interrupt the holy mass cried the bass voice of the friar  patience good father answered francesco calmly the occasion is our justification  what does this mean fortemani demanded valentina imperiously her eyes angrily set upon her captain utterly ignoring the count do you betray me too  it means madonna answered the giant bluntly that your lapdog messer gonzaga is at this very moment admitting gian maria and his forces to roccaleone by the postern  there was a hoarse cry from the men which francesco silenced by a wave of his mailed hand  valentina looked wildly at fortemani and then as if drawn by a greater will than her own her eyes were forced to travel to the count he instantly advanced and bowed his head before her  madonna this is no hour for explanations action is needed and that at once i was wrong in not disclosing my identity to you before you discovered it by such unfortunate means and with the assistance of the only traitor roccaleone has harboured romeo gonzagawho as fortemani has just told you is at this moment admitting my cousin and your uncle to the castle but that my object was ever other than to serve you or that i sought as was represented to you to turn this siege to my own political profit that madonna i implore you in your own interests to believe untrue  she sank on to her knees and with folded hands began to pray to the mother of mercy deeming herself lost for his tone carried conviction and he had said that gian maria was entering the castle  madonna he cried touching her lightly on the shoulder let your prayers wait until they can be of thanksgiving listen by the vigilance of peppe there who good soul that he is never lost faith in me or deemed me a dastard we were informed last nightfortemani and iof this that gonzaga was preparing and we have made our plans and prepared the ground when gian marias soldiers enter they will find the outer doors barred and locked and we shall gain a little time while they break through them my men as you will observe are even now barring the door of the chapel to impose a further obstacle now while they are thus engaged we must act briefly then if you will trust us we will bear you out of this for we four have worked through the night to some purpose  she looked at him through a film of tears her face drawn and startled then she put her hands to her brow in a gesture of bewildered helplessness  but they will follow us she complained  not so he answered smiling for that too have we provided come madonna time presses  a long moment she looked at him then brushing aside the tears that dimmed her sight she set a hand on either of his shoulders and stood so before them all gazing up into his calm face  how shall i know that what you say is truethat i may trust you she asked but her voice was not the voice of one that demands an overwhelming proof ere she will believe  by my honour and my knighthood he answered in a ringing voice i make oath here at the foot of gods altar that my purposemy only purposehas been is and shall be to serve you monna valentina  i believe you she cried to sob a moment later  forgive me francesco and may god too forgive my lack of faith in you  he softly breathed her name in such sweet accents that a happy peace pervaded her and the bright courage of yore shone in her brown eyes  come sirs he cried now with a sudden briskness that startled them into feverish obedience you fra domenico cut off your sacerdotals and gird high your habit there is climbing for you here a couple of you move aside that altarstep my men and i have spent the night in loosening its old hinges  they raised the slab and in the gap beneath it was disclosed a flight of steps leading down to the dungeons and cellars of roccaleone  down this they went in haste but in good order marshalled by francesco and when the last had passed down he and lanciotto aided by others below who had seized a rope that he had lowered them replaced the slab from underneath so that no trace should remain of the way by which they had come  a postern had been unbarred below by fortemani who had led the way with a halfdozen of the men and a huge scaling ladder that lay in readiness in that subterranean gallery was rushed out across the moat which at this point was a roaring torrent  fortemani was the first to descend that sloping bridge and upon reaching the ground he made fast the lower end  next went a dozen men at francescos bidding armed with the pikes that had been left overnight in the gallery at a word of command they slipped quietly away then came the women and lastly the remainder of the men  of the enemy they caught no glimpse not so much as a sentry for every one of gian marias men had been pressed into the investment of the castle thus they emerged from roccaleone and made their way down that rough bridge into the pleasant meadows to the south already fortemani and his dozen men had disappeared at the trot making for the front of the castle when francesco stepped last upon the bridge and closed the postern after him then he glided rapidly to the ground and with the assistance of a dozen ready hands he dragged away the scaling ladder they carried it some yards from the brink of the torrent and deposited it in the meadow with a laugh of purest relish francesco stepped to valentinas side  it will exercise their minds to discover how we got out he cried and they will be forced to the conclusion that we are angels all with wings beneath our armour we have not left them a single ladder or a strand of rope in roccaleone by which to attempt to follow us even if they discover how we came but come valentina mia the comedy is not finished yet already fortemani will have removed the bridge by which they entered and engaged such few men as may have been left behind and we have the high and mighty gian maria in the tightest trap that was ever fashioned     chapter xxv the capitulation of roccaleone   in the sunshine of that bright may morning francesco and his men went merrily to work to possess themselves of the ducal camp and the first business of the day was to arm those soldiers who had come out unarmed of weapons there was no lack and to these they helped themselves in liberal fashion whilst here and there a man would pause to don a haubergeon or press a steel cap on his head  three sentries only had been left to guard the tents and of these fortemani and a couple of his men had made prisoners whilst the others were removing the bridge by which the invaders had entered and now beneath the open postern by the drawbridge gaped a surging torrent that no man would have the hardihood to attempt to swim  in that opening presently appeared gian maria his face red for once and behind him a clamouring crowd of menatarms who shared their masters rage at the manner in which they had been trapped  at the rear of the tents valentina and her ladies awaited the issue of the parley that now seemed toward the bulk of the men were busy at gian marias cannons and under francescos supervision they were training them upon the drawbridge  from the castle a mighty shout went up the men disappeared from the postern to reappear a moment later on the ramparts and francesco laughed deep down in his throat as he perceived the purpose of this they had bethought them of the guns that were mounted there and were gone to use them against valentinas little army gun after gun they tried and a fierce cry of rage burst forth when they realised by what dummies they had been held in check during the past week this was followed by a silence of some moments terminated at last by the sound of a bugle  answering that summons to a parley and with a last word of injunction to fortemani who was left in charge of the men at the guns francesco rode forward on one of gian marias horses escorted by lanciotto and zaccaria similarly mounted and each armed with a loaded arquebuse  under the walls of roccaleone he drew rein laughing to himself at this monstrous change of sides as he haltedhelmet on head but beaver opena body came hurtling over the battlements and splashed into the foaming waters below it was the corpse of aventano which gian maria had peremptorily bidden them to remove from his sight  i desire to speak with monna valentina della rovere cried the furious duke  you may speak with me gian maria answered francescos voice clear and metallic i am her representative her sometime provost of roccaleone  who are you quoth the duke struck by a familiar note in that mocking voice  francesco del falco count of aquila  by god you  an age of marvels is it not laughed francesco  which will you lose my cousina wife or a duchy  rage struck gian maria speechless for a moment then he turned to guidobaldo and whispered something but guidobaldo who seemed vastly interested now in this knight below merely shrugged his shoulders  i will lose neither messer francesco roared the duke neither by god he screamed neither do you hear me  i should be deaf else was the easy answer but you are gravely at fault one or the other you must relinquish and it is yours to make a choice between them the game has gone against you gian maria and you must pay  but have i no voice in the bartering of my niece asked guidobaldo with cold dignity is it for you lord count to say whether your cousin shall wed her or not  why no he may wed her if he will but he will be a duke no longer in fact he will be an outcast with no title to lay claim to if indeed the babbianians will leave him a head at all whilst i at least though not a duke with a tottering throne am a count with lands small but securely held and shall become a duke if gian maria refuses to relinquish me your niece so that if he be disposed to marry her will you be disposed to let her marry a homeless vagrant or a headless corpse  guidobaldos face seemed to change and his eyes looked curiously at the whitefaced duke beside him  so you are the other pretender to my nieces hand lord count he asked in his coldest voice  i am highness answered francesco quietly the matter stands thus unless gian maria is in babbiano by morning he forfeits his crown and it passes to me by the voice of the people but if he will relinquish his claim to monna valentina in my favour then i shall journey straight to aquila and i shall trouble babbiano no more if he refuses and insists upon this wedding abhorrent to monna valentina why then my men shall hold him captive behind those walls until it be too late for him to reach his duchy in time to save the crown in the meantime i will ride to babbiano in his stead andreluctant though i be to play the dukei shall accept the throne and silence the peoples importunities he can then endeavour to win your highnesss consent to the union  for perhaps the first time in his life guidobaldo was guilty of an act of positive discourtesy he broke into a laugha boisterous amused laugh that cut into gian marias heart like a knife  why lord count he said i confess that you have us very much in your hands to mould us as you will now you are such a soldier and such a strategist as it would pleasure me to have about my person in urbino what says your highness he continued turning now to the almost speechless gian maria i have yet another niece with whom we might cement the union of the two duchies and she might prove more willing women it seems will insist upon being women do you not think that monna valentina and this your valiant cousin  heed him not screamed gian maria now in a white heat of passion he is a smoothtongued dog that would argue the very devil out of hell make no terms with the hind i have a hundred men and he swung suddenly round let down that drawbridge cowards he bawled at them and sweep me those animals from my tents  gian maria i give you warning cried francesco loudly and firmly i have trained your own guns on to that bridge and at the first attempt to lower it ill blow it into splinters you come not out of roccaleone save at my pleasure and upon my terms and if you lose your duchy by your obstinacy it will be your own work but answer me now that i may take my course  guidobaldo too restrained gian maria and countermanded his order for the lowering of the bridge and now on his other side gonzaga crept up to him and whispered into his ear the suggestion that he should wait until night had fallen  wait until night fool blazed the duke turning on him in a fierce joy at finding one whom he might rend if i wait until then my throne is lost to me this comes of sorting with traitors it is your fault you judas he cried more fiercely still his face distorted but you at least shall pay for what you have done  gonzaga saw a sudden flash of steel before his eyes and a piercing scream broke from him as gian marias dagger buried itself in his breast too late guidobaldo put forward a hand to stay the duke  and so by a strangely avenging justice the magnificent gonzaga sank dead on the very spot on which he had so cravenly and dastardly poniarded aventano  throw me that carrion into the moat growled gian maria still quivering with rage that had prompted his ferocious act  he was obeyed and thus murdered and murderer were united in a common grave  after the first attempt to restrain gian maria guidobaldo had looked on in unconcern deeming the act a very fitting punishment of a man with whose treachery he at least had never been in sympathy  as he saw the body vanish in the torrent below gian maria seemed to realise what he had done his anger fell from him and with bent head he piously crossed himself then turning to an attendant who stood at his elbow  see that a mass is said for his soul tomorrow he solemnly bade him  as if the act had served to pacify him and restore him to his senses gian maria now stepped forward and asked his cousin in calmer tones than he had hitherto employed to make clear the terms on which he would permit him to return to babbiano within the time to which his people limited him  they are no more than that you relinquish your claim to monna valentina and that you find consolationas i think his highness of urbino has himself suggestedin the lord guidobaldos younger niece  before he could reply guidobaldo was urging him in a low voice to accept the terms  what else is there for you montefeltro ended pregnantly  and this other niece of yours quoth gian maria lamely  i have already passed my word answered guidobaldo  and monna valentina the other almost whined  may wed this headstrong condottiero of hers ill not withstand them come i am your friend in this i am even sacrificing valentina to your interests for if you persist he will ruin you the game is his my lord acknowledge your defeat as i acknowledge mine and pay  but what is your defeat to mine cried gian maria who saw through guidobaldos appreciation of the fact that such a nephewinlaw as francesco del falco was far from undesirable in the troublous times that threatened  it is at least as absolute returned guidobaldo with a shrug and in this vein the duke of urbino continued for some moments till in the end gian maria found himself not only deserted by his ally but having this ally now combating on his cousins side and pressing him to accept his cousins terms distasteful though they were thus urged gian maria lamely acknowledged his defeat and his willingness to pay the forfeit with that he asked how soon he might be permitted to leave the castle  why at once now that i have your word answered francesco readily whereat treachery gleamed from gian marias eye to be swiftly quenched by francescos next words but lest your men and mine should come to trouble with one another you will order yours to come forth without arms or armour and you will depose your own his highness guidobaldo is the only man in whose favour i can make an exception to this condition let it be broken and i promise you that you will very bitterly regret it at sight of the first armed man issuing from those gates ill give the word to fire on you and your own guns shall work your destruction  thus was the second siege of roccaleone ended almost as soon as it was begun and thus did gian maria capitulate to the conqueror the duke of babbiano and his men marched out sheepishly and silently and took their way to babbiano no wordnot even so much as a glancepassing between gian maria and the lady who had been the cause of his discomfiture and who blithely looked on at his departure  guidobaldo and his few attendants lingered after his late ally had gone then he bade francesco lead him to his niece in which francesco readily obeyed him  the duke embraced her coldlystill that he embraced her at all after what was passed augured well  you will come with me to urbino lord count he said suddenly to francesco it were best to celebrate the nuptials there everything is in readinessfor all had been prepared for gian maria  a great joy came into valentinas eyes her cheeks flushed and her glance fell but francesco scanned the dukes face with the keen eye of one who is incredulous of so much good fortune  your highness means me well he made bold to ask guidobaldo stiffened and a frown broke the serenity of his lofty brow  you have my princely word he answered solemnly at which with bended knee francesco stooped to kiss his ducal hand  and so they departed on the horses that they kept as the spoils of war they made a goodly show guidobaldo riding at their head with francesco and valentina whilst the rear was brought up by peppe and fra domenico who touched by this epidemic of goodwill were at last fraternising with each other  and as they rode it chanced that presently guidobaldo fell behind so that for a moment francesco and valentina found themselves alone a little ahead of the others she turned to him a shyness in her brown eyes a tremble at the corners of her red lips  you have not yet said that you forgive me francesco she complained in a timerous whisper were it not seemly that you did since we are to be wed so soon
