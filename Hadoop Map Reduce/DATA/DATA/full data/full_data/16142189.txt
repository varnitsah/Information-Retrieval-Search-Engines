the hobo and the fairy  the prodigal father  the first poet  finis  the end of the story     the turtles of tasman     by the turtles of tasman   i  law order and restraint had carved frederick travers face it was the strong firm face of one used to power and who had used power with wisdom and discretion clean living had made the healthy skin and the lines graved in it were honest lines hard and devoted work had left its wholesome handiwork that was all every feature of the man told the same story from the clear blue of the eyes to the full head of hair light brown touched with grey and smoothly parted and drawn straight across above the strongdomed forehead he was a seriously groomed man and the light summer business suit no more than befitted his alert years while it did not shout aloud that its possessor was likewise the possessor of numerous millions of dollars and property  for frederick travers hated ostentation the machine that waited outside for him under the portecoch√®re was sober black it was the most expensive machine in the county yet he did not care to flaunt its price or horsepower in a red flare across the landscape which also was mostly his from the sand dunes and the everlasting beat of the pacific breakers across the fat bottomlands and upland pastures to the far summits clad with redwood forest and wreathed in fog and cloud  a rustle of skirts caused him to look over his shoulder just the faintest hint of irritation showed in his manner not that his daughter was the object however whatever it was it seemed to lie on the desk before him  what is that outlandish name again she asked i know i shall never remember it see ive brought a pad to write it down  her voice was low and cool and she was a tall wellformed clearskinned young woman in her voice and complacence she too showed the drillmarks of order and restraint  frederick travers scanned the signature of one of two letters on the desk bronislawa plaskoweitzkaia travers he read then spelled the difficult first portion letter by letter while his daughter wrote it down  now mary he added remember tom was always harum scarum and you must make allowances for this daughter of his her very name isahdisconcerting i havent seen him for years and as for her a shrug epitomised his apprehension he smiled with an effort at wit just the same theyre as much your family as mine if he is my brother he is your uncle and if shes my niece youre both cousins  mary nodded dont worry father ill be nice to her poor thing what nationality was her motherto get such an awful name  i dont know russian or polish or spanish or something it was just like tom she was an actress or singeri dont remember they met in buenos ayres it was an elopement her husband  then she was already married  marys dismay was unfeigned and spontaneous and her fathers irritation grew more pronounced he had not meant that it had slipped out  there was a divorce afterward of course i never knew the details her mother died out in chinano in tasmania it was in china that tom his lips shut with almost a snap he was not going to make any more slips mary waited then turned to the door where she paused  ive given her the rooms over the rose court she said and im going now to take a last look  frederick travers turned back to the desk as if to put the letters away changed his mind and slowly and ponderingly reread them         dear fred        its been a long time since i was so near to the old home       and id like to take a run up unfortunately i played ducks       and drakes with my

a large builtin safe and methodically put the letters away in a compartment labelled thomas travers  poor tom poor tom he sighed aloud   ii  the big motor car waited at the station and frederick travers thrilled as he always thrilled to the distant locomotive whistle of the train plunging down the valley of isaac travers river first of all westering whitemen had isaac travers gazed on that splendid valley its salmonladen waters its rich bottoms and its virgin forest slopes having seen he had grasped and never let go landpoor they had called him in the midsettler period but that had been in the days when the placers petered out when there were no wagon roads nor tugs to draw in sailing vessels across the perilous bar and when his lonely grist mill had been run under armed guards to keep the marauding klamaths off while wheat was ground like father like son and what isaac travers had grasped frederick travers had held it had been the same tenacity of hold both had been farvisioned both had foreseen the transformation of the utter west the coming of the railroad and the building of the new empire on the pacific shore  frederick travers thrilled too at the locomotive whistle because more than any mans it was his railroad his father had died still striving to bring the railroad in across the mountains that averaged a hundred thousand dollars to the mile he frederick had brought it in he had sat up nights over that railroad bought newspapers entered politics and subsidised party machines and he had made pilgrimages more than once at his own expense to the railroad chiefs of the east while all the county knew how many miles of his land were crossed by the right of way none of the county guessed nor dreamed the number of his dollars which had gone into guaranties and railroad bonds he had done much for his county and the railroad was his last and greatest achievement the capstone of the travers effort the momentous and marvellous thing that had been brought about just yesterday it had been running two years and highest proof of all of his judgment dividends were in sight and farther reaching reward was in sight it was written in the books that the next governor of california was to be spelled frederick a travers  twenty years had passed since he had seen his elder brother and then it had been after a gap of ten years he remembered that night well tom was the only man who dared run the bar in the dark and that last time between nightfall and the dawn with a southeaster breezing up he had sailed his schooner in and out again there had been no warning of his cominga clatter of hoofs at midnight a lathered horse in the stable and tom had appeared the salt of the sea on his face as his mother attested an hour only he remained and on a fresh horse was gone while rain squalls rattled upon the windows and the rising wind moaned through the redwoods the memory of his visit a whiff sharp and strong from the wild outer world a week later seahammered and barbound for that time had arrived the revenue cutter bear and there had been a column of conjecture in the local paper hints of a heavy landing of opium and of a vain quest for the mysterious schooner halcyon only fred and his mother and the several house indians knew of the stiffened horse in the barn and of the devious way it was afterward smuggled back to the fishing village on the beach  despite those twenty years it was the same old tom travers that alighted from the pullman to his brothers eyes he did not look sick older he was of course the panama hat did not hide the grey hair and though indefinably hinting of shrunkenness the broad shoulders were still broad and erect as for the young woman with him frederick travers experienced an immediate shock of distaste he felt it vitally yet vaguely it was a challenge and a mock yet he could not name nor place the source of it it might have been the dress of tailored linen and foreign cut the shirtwaist with its daring stripe the black wilfulness of the hair or the flaunt of poppies on the large straw hat or it might have been the flash and colour of herthe black eyes and brows the flame of rose in the cheeks the white of the even teeth that showed too readily a spoiled child was his thought but he had no time to analyse for his brothers hand was in his and he was making his nieces acquaintance  there it was again she flashed and talked like her colour and she talked with her hands as well he could not avoid noting the smallness of them they were absurdly small and his eyes went to her feet to make the same discovery quite oblivious of the curious crowd on the station platform she had intercepted his attempt to lead to the motor car and had ranged the brothers side by side tom had been laughingly acquiescent but his younger brother was ill at ease too conscious of the many eyes of his townspeople he knew only the old puritan way family displays were for the privacy of the family not for the public he was glad she had not attempted to kiss him it was remarkable she had not already he apprehended anything of her  she embraced them and penetrated them with sunwarm eyes that seemed to see through them and over them and all about them  youre really brothers she cried her hands flashing with her eyes anybody can see it and yet there is a differencei dont know i cant explain  in truth with a tact that exceeded frederick travers farthest disciplined forbearance she did not dare explain her wide artisteyes had seen and sensed the whole trenchant and essential difference alike they looked of the unmistakable same stock their features reminiscent of a common origin and there resemblance ceased tom was three inches taller and wellgreyed was the long viking moustache his was the same eaglelike nose as his brothers save that it was more eaglelike while the blue eyes were pronouncedly so the lines of the face were deeper the cheekbones higher the hollows larger the weatherbeat darker it was a volcanic face there had been fire there and the fire still lingered around the corners of the eyes were more laughterwrinkles and in the eyes themselves a promise of deadlier seriousness than the younger brother possessed frederick was bourgeois in his carriage but in toms was a certain careless ease and distinction it was the same pioneer blood of isaac travers in both men but it had been retorted in widely different crucibles frederick represented the straight and expected line of descent his brother expressed a vast and intangible something that was unknown in the travers stock and it was all this that the blackeyed girl saw and knew on the instant all that had been inexplicable in the two men and their relationship cleared up in the moment she saw them side by side  wake me up tom was saying i cant believe i arrived on a train and the population there were only four thousand thirty years ago  sixty thousand now was the others answer and increasing by leaps and bounds want to spin around for a look at the city theres plenty of time  as they sped along the broad wellpaved streets tom persisted in his rip van winkle pose the waterfront perplexed him where he had once anchored his sloop in a dozen feet of water he found solid land and railroad yards with wharves and shipping still farther out  hold on stop he cried a few blocks on looking up at a solid business block where is this fred  fourth and traversdont you remember  tom stood up and gazed around trying to discern the anciently familiar configuration of the land under its clutter of buildings  i  i think he began hesitantly no by george im sure of it we used to hunt cottontails over that ground and shoot blackbirds in the brush and there where the bank building is was a pond he turned to polly i built my first raft there and got my first taste of the sea  heaven knows how many gallons of it frederick laughed nodding to the chauffeur they rolled you on a barrel i remember  oh more polly cried clapping her hands  theres the park frederick pointed out a little later indicating a mass of virgin redwoods on the first dip of the bigger hills  father shot three grizzlies there one afternoon was toms remark  i presented forty acres of it to the city frederick went on father bought the quarter section for a dollar an acre from leroy  tom nodded and the sparkle and flash in his eyes like that of his daughter were unlike anything that ever appeared in his brothers eyes  yes he affirmed leroy the negro squawman i remember the time he carried you and me on his back to alliance the night the indians burned the ranch father stayed behind and fought  but he couldnt save the grist mill it was a serious setback to him  just the same he nailed four indians  in pollys eyes now appeared the flash and sparkle  an indianfighter she cried tell me about him  tell her about travers ferry tom said  thats a ferry on the klamath river on the way to orleans bar and siskiyou there was great packing into the diggings in those days and among other things father had made a location there there was rich bench farming land too he built a suspension bridgewove the cables on the spot with sailors and materials freighted in from the coast it cost him twenty thousand dollars the first day it was open eight hundred mules crossed at a dollar a head to say nothing of the toll for foot and horse that night the river rose the bridge was one hundred and forty feet above low water mark yet the freshet rose higher than that and swept the bridge away hed have made a fortune there otherwise  that wasnt it at all tom blurted out impatiently it was at travers ferry that father and old jacob vance were caught by a war party of mad river indians old jacob was killed right outside the door of the log cabin father dragged the body inside and stood the indians off for a week father was some shot he buried jacob under the cabin floor  i still run the ferry frederick went on though there isnt so much travel as in the old days i freight by wagonroad to the reservation and then muleback on up the klamath and clear in to the forks of little salmon i have twelve stores on that chain now a stageline to the reservation and a hotel there quite a tourist trade is beginning to pick up  and the girl with curious brooding eyes looked from brother to brother as they so differently voiced themselves and life  ay he was some man father was tom murmured  there was a drowsy note in his speech that drew a quick glance of anxiety from her the machine had turned into the cemetery and now halted before a substantial vault on the crest of the hill  i thought youd like to see it frederick was saying i built that mausoleum myself most of it with my own hands mother wanted it the estate was dreadfully encumbered the best bid i could get out of the contractors was eleven thousand i did it myself for a little over eight  must have worked nights tom murmured admiringly and more sleepily than before  i did tom i did many a night by lanternlight i was so busy i was reconstructing the water works thenthe artesian wells had failedand mothers eyes were troubling her you remembercataracti wrote you she was too weak to travel and i brought the specialists up from san francisco oh my hands were full i was just winding up the disastrous affairs of the steamer line father had established to san francisco and i was keeping up the interest on mortgages to the tune of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars  a soft stertorous breathing interrupted him tom chin on chest was asleep polly with a significant look caught her uncles eye then her father after an uneasy restless movement lifted drowsy lids  deuced warm day he said with a bright apologetic laugh ive been actually asleep arent we near home  frederick nodded to the chauffeur and the car rolled on   iii  the house that frederick travers had built when his prosperity came was large and costly sober and comfortable and with no more pretence than was naturally attendant on the finest country home in the county its atmosphere was just the sort that he and his daughter would create but in the days that followed his brothers homecoming all this was changed gone was the subdued and ordered repose frederick was neither comfortable nor happy there was an unwonted flurry of life and violation of sanctions and traditions meals were irregular and protracted and there were midnight chafingdish suppers and bursts of laughter at the most inappropriate hours  frederick was abstemious a glass of wine at dinner was his wildest excess three cigars a day he permitted himself and these he smoked either on the broad veranda or in the smoking room what else was a smoking room for cigarettes he detested yet his brother was ever rolling thin brownpaper cigarettes and smoking them wherever he might happen to be a litter of tobacco crumbs was always to be found in the big easy chair he frequented and among the cushions of the windowseats then there were the cocktails brought up under the stern tutelage of isaac and eliza travers frederick looked upon liquor in the house as an abomination ancient cities had been smitten by gods wrath for just such practices before lunch and dinner tom aided and abetted by polly mixed an endless variety of drinks she being particularly adept with strange swivelstick concoctions learned at the ends of the earth to frederick at such times it seemed that his butlers pantry and dining room had been turned into barrooms when he suggested this under a facetious show tom proclaimed that when he made his pile he would build a liquor cabinet in every living room of his house  and there were more young men at the house than formerly and they helped in disposing of the cocktails frederick would have liked to account in that manner for their presence but he knew better his brother and his brothers daughter did what he and mary had failed to do they were the magnets youth and joy and laughter drew to them the house was lively with young life ever day and night the motor cars honked up and down the gravelled drives there were picnics and expeditions in the summer weather moonlight sails on the bay starts before dawn or homecomings at midnight and often of nights the many bedrooms were filled as they had never been before tom must cover all his boyhood ramblings catch trout again on bull creek shoot quail over walcotts prairie get a deer on round mountain that deer was a cause of pain and shame to frederick what if it was closed season tom had triumphantly brought home the buck and gleefully called it sidehillsalmon when it was served and eaten at fredericks own table  they had clambakes at the head of the bay and musselbakes down by the roaring surf and tom told shamelessly of the halcyon and of the run of contraband and asked frederick before them all how he had managed to smuggle the horse back to the fishermen without discovery all the young men were in the conspiracy with polly to pamper tom to his hearts desire and frederick heard the true inwardness of the killing of the deer of its purchase from the overstocked golden gate park of its crated carriage by train horseteam and muleback to the fastnesses of round mountain of tom falling asleep beside the deerrun the first time it was driven by of the pursuit by the young men the jaded saddle horses the scrambles and the falls and the roping of it at burnt ranch clearing and finally of the triumphant culmination when it was driven past a second time and tom had dropped it at fifty yards to frederick there was a vague hurt in it all when had such consideration been shown him  there were days when tom could not go out postponements of outdoor frolics when still the centre he sat and drowsed in the big chair waking at times in that unexpected queer bright way of his to roll a cigarette and call for his ukulelea sort of miniature guitar of portuguese invention then with strumming and tumtuming the live cigarette laid aside to the imminent peril of polished wood his full baritone would roll out in south sea hulas and sprightly french and spanish songs  one in particular had pleased frederick at first the favourite song of a tahitian king tom explainedthe last of the pomares who had himself composed it and was wont to lie on his mats by the hour singing it it consisted of the repetition of a few syllables e meu ru ru a vau it ran and that was all of it sung in a stately endless evervarying chant accompanied by solemn chords from the ukelele polly took great joy in teaching it to her uncle but when himself questing for some of this genial flood of life that bathed about his brother frederick essayed the song he noted suppressed glee on the part of his listeners which increased through giggles and snickers to a great outburst of laughter to his disgust and dismay he learned that the simple phrase he had repeated and repeated was nothing else than i am so drunk he had been made a fool of over and over solemnly and gloriously he frederick travers had announced how drunk he was after that he slipped quietly out of the room whenever it was sung nor could pollys later explanation that the last word was happy and not drunk reconcile him for she had been compelled to admit that the old king was a toper and that he was always in his cups when he struck up the chant  frederick was constantly oppressed by the feeling of being out of it all he was a social being and he liked fun even if it were of a more wholesome and dignified brand than that to which his brother was addicted he could not understand why in the past the young people had voted his house a bore and come no more save on state and formal occasions until now when they flocked to it and to his brother but not to him nor could he like the way the young women petted his brother and called him tom while it was intolerable to see them twist and pull his buccaneer moustache in mock punishment when his sometimes toojolly banter sank home to them  such conduct was a profanation to the memory of isaac and eliza travers there was too much an air of revelry in the house the long table was never shortened while there was extra help in the kitchen breakfast extended from four until eleven and the midnight suppers entailing raids on the pantry and complaints from the servants were a vexation to frederick the house had become a restaurant a hotel he sneered bitterly to himself and there were times when he was sorely tempted to put his foot down and reassert the old ways but somehow the ancient sorcery of his masterful brother was too strong upon him and at times he gazed upon him with a sense almost of awe groping to fathom the alchemy of charm baffled by the strange lights and fires in his brothers eyes and by the wisdom of far places and of wild nights and days written in his face what was it what lordly vision had the other glimpsedhe the irresponsible and careless one frederick remembered a line of an old songalong the shining ways he came why did his brother remind him of that line had he who in boyhood had known no law who in manhood had exalted himself above law in truth found the shining ways  there was an unfairness about it that perplexed frederick until he found solace in dwelling upon the failure tom had made of life then it was in quiet intervals that he got some comfort and stiffened his own pride by showing tom over the estate  you have done well fred tom would say you have done very well  he said it often and often he drowsed in the big smoothrunning machine  everything orderly and sanitary and spick and spannot a blade of grass out of place was pollys comment how do you ever manage it i should not like to be a blade of grass on your land she concluded with a little shivery shudder  you have worked hard tom said  yes i have worked hard frederick affirmed it was worth it  he was going to say more but the strange flash in the girls eyes brought him to an uncomfortable pause he felt that she measured him challenged him for the first time his honourable career of building a county commonwealth had been questionedand by a chit of a girl the daughter of a wastrel herself but a flighty flyaway foreign creature  conflict between them was inevitable he had disliked her from the first moment of meeting she did not have to speak her mere presence made him uncomfortable he felt her unspoken disapproval though there were times when she did not stop at that nor did she mince language she spoke forthright like a man and as no man had ever dared to speak to him  i wonder if you ever miss what youve missed she told him did you ever once in your life turn yourself loose and rip things up by the roots did you ever once get drunk or smoke yourself black in the face or dance a hoedown on the ten commandments or stand up on your hind legs and wink like a good fellow at god  isnt she a rare one tom gurgled her mother over again  outwardly smiling and calm there was a chill of horror at fredericks heart it was incredible  i think it is the english she continued who have a saying that a man has not lived until he has kissed his woman and struck his man i wonderconfess up nowif you ever struck a man  have you he countered  she nodded an angry reminiscent flash in her eyes and waited  no i have never had that pleasure he answered slowly i early learned control  later irritated by his selfsatisfied complacence and after listening to a recital of how he had cornered the klamath salmonpacking planted the first oysters on the bay and established that lucrative monopoly and of how after exhausting litigation and a campaign of years he had captured the water front of williamsport and thereby won to control of the lumber combine she returned to the charge  you seem to value life in terms of profit and loss she said i wonder if you have ever known love  the shaft went home he had not kissed his woman his marriage had been one of policy it had saved the estate in the days when he had been almost beaten in the struggle to disencumber the vast holdings isaac travers wide hands had grasped the girl was a witch she had probed an old wound and made it hurt again he had never had time to love he had worked hard he had been president of the chamber of commerce mayor of the city state senator but he had missed love at chance moments he had come upon polly openly and shamelessly in her fathers arms and he had noted the warmth and tenderness in their eyes again he knew that he had missed love wanton as was the display not even in private did he and mary so behave normal formal and colourless she was what was to be expected of a loveless marriage he even puzzled to decide whether the feeling he felt for her was love was he himself loveless as well  in the moment following pollys remark he was aware of a great emptiness it seemed that his hands had grasped ashes until glancing into the other room he saw tom asleep in the big chair very grey and aged and tired he remembered all that he had done all that he possessed well what did tom possess what had tom donesave play ducks and drakes with life and wear it out until all that remained was that dimly flickering spark in a dying body  what bothered frederick in polly was that she attracted him as well as repelled him his own daughter had never interested him in that way mary moved along frictionless grooves and to forecast her actions was so effortless that it was automatic but polly manyhued proteannatured he never knew what she was going to do next  keeps you guessing eh tom chuckled  she was irresistible she had her way with frederick in ways that in mary would have been impossible she took liberties with him cosened him or hurt him and compelled always in him a sharp awareness of her existence  once after one of their clashes she devilled him at the piano playing a mad damned thing that stirred and irritated him and set his pulse pounding wild and undisciplined fancies in the ordered chamber of his brain the worst of it was she saw and knew just what she was doing she was aware before he was and she made him aware her face turned to look at him on her lips a mocking contemplative smile that was almost a superior sneer it was this that shocked him into consciousness of the orgy his imagination had been playing him from the wall above her the stiff portraits of isaac and eliza travers looked down like reproachful spectres infuriated he left the room he had never dreamed such potencies resided in music and then and he remembered it with shame he had stolen back outside to listen and she had known and once more she had devilled him  when mary asked him what he thought of pollys playing an unbidden contrast leaped to his mind marys music reminded him of church it was cold and bare as a methodist meeting house but pollys was like the mad and lawless ceremonial of some heathen temple where incense arose and nautch girls writhed  she plays like a foreigner he answered pleased with the success and oppositeness of his evasion  she is an artist mary affirmed solemnly she is a genius when does she ever practise when did she ever practise you know how i have my best is like a fivefinger exercise compared with the foolishest thing she ripples off her music tells me thingsoh things wonderful and unutterable mine tells me onetwothree onetwothree oh it is maddening i work and work and get nowhere it is unfair why should she be born that way and not i  love was fredericks immediate and secret thought but before he could dwell upon the conclusion the unprecedented had happened and mary was sobbing in a breakdown of tears he would have liked to take her in his arms after toms fashion but he did not know how he tried and found mary as unschooled as himself it resulted only in an embarrassed awkwardness for both of them  the contrasting of the two girls was inevitable like father like daughter mary was no more than a pale campfollower of a gorgeous conquering general fredericks thrift had been sorely educated in the matter of clothes he knew just how expensive marys clothes were yet he could not blind himself to the fact that pollys vagabond makeshifts cheap and apparently haphazard were always all right and far more successful her taste was unerring her ways with a shawl were inimitable with a scarf she performed miracles  she just throws things together mary complained she doesnt even try she can dress in fifteen minutes and when she goes swimming she beats the boys out of the dressing rooms mary was honest and incredulous in her admiration i cant see how she does it no one could dare those colours but they look just right on her  shes always threatened that when i became finally flat broke shed set up dressmaking and take care of both of us tom contributed  frederick looking over the top of a newspaper was witness to an illuminating scene mary to his certain knowledge had been primping for an hour ere she appeared  oh how lovely was pollys ready appreciation her eyes and face glowed with honest pleasure and her hands wove their delight in the air but why not wear that bow so and thus  her hands flashed to the task and in a moment the miracle of taste and difference achieved by her touch was apparent even to frederick  polly was like her father generous to the point of absurdity with her meagre possessions mary admired a spanish fana mexican treasure that had come down from one of the grand ladies of the court of the emperor maximilian pollys delight flamed like wildfire mary found herself the immediate owner of the fan almost labouring under the fictitious impression that she had conferred an obligation by accepting it only a foreign woman could do such things and polly was guilty of similar gifts to all the young women it was her way it might be a lace handkerchief a pink paumotan pearl or a comb of hawksbill turtle it was all the same whatever their eyes rested on in joy was theirs to women as to men she was irresistible  i dont dare admire anything any more was marys plaint if i do she always gives it to me  frederick had never dreamed such a creature could exist the women of his own race and place had never adumbrated such a possibility he knew that whatever she didher quick generosities her hot enthusiasms or angers her birdlike caressing wayswas unbelievably sincere her extravagant moods at the same time shocked and fascinated him her voice was as mercurial as her feelings there were no even tones and she talked with her hands yet in her mouth english was a new and beautiful language softly limpid with an audacity of phrase and tellingness of expression that conveyed subtleties and nuances as unambiguous and direct as they were unexpected from one of such childlikeness and simplicity he woke up of nights and on his darkened eyelids saw bright memorypictures of the backward turn of her vivid laughing face   iv  like daughter like father tom too had been irresistible all the world still called to him and strange men came from time to time with its messages never had there been such visitors to the travers home some came with the reminiscent roll of the sea in their gait others were blackbrowed ruffians still others were feverburnt and sallow and about all of them was something bizarre and outlandish their talk was likewise bizarre and outlandish of things to frederick unguessed and undreamed though he recognised the men for what they weresoldiers of fortune adventurers free lances of the world but the big patent thing was the love and loyalty they bore their leader they named him variouslyblack tom blondine husky travers malemute tom swiftwater tombut most of all he was captain tom their projects and propositions were equally various from the south sea trader with the discovery of a new guano island and the latinamerican with a nascent revolution on his hands on through siberian gold chases and the prospecting of the placer benches of the upper kuskokeem to darker things that were mentioned only in whispers and captain tom regretted the temporary indisposition that prevented immediate departure with them and continued to sit and drowse more and more in the big chair it was polly with a camaraderie distasteful to her uncle who got these men aside and broke the news that captain tom would never go out on the shining ways again but not all of them came with projects many made lovecalls on their leader of old and unforgetable days and frederick sometimes was a witness to their meeting and he marvelled anew at the mysterious charm in his brother that drew all men to him  by the turtles of tasman cried one when i heard you was in california captain tom i just had to come and shake hands i reckon you aint forgot tasman ehnor the scrap at thursday island sayold tasman was killed by his niggers only last year up german new guinea way remember his cookboynganingani he was the ringleader tasman swore by him but nganingani hatcheted him just the same  shake hands with captain carlsen fred was toms introduction of his brother to another visitor he pulled me out of a tight place on the west coast once id have cashed in carlsen if you hadnt happened along  captain carlsen was a giant hulk of a man with gimlet eyes of palest blue a slashscarred mouth that a blazing red beard could not quite hide and a grip in his hand that made frederick squirm  a few minutes later tom had his brother aside  say fred do you think it will bother to advance me a thousand  of course frederick answered splendidly you know half of that i have is yours tom  and when captain carlsen departed frederick was morally certain that the thousand dollars departed with him  small wonder tom had made a failure of lifeand come home to die frederick sat at his own orderly desk taking stock of the difference between him and his brother yes and if it hadnt been for him there would have been no home for tom to die in  frederick cast back for solace through their joint history it was he who had always been the mainstay the dependable one tom had laughed and rollicked played hooky from school disobeyed isaacs commandments to the mountains or the sea or in hot water with the neighbours and the town authoritiesit was all the same he was everywhere save where the dull plod of work obtained and work was work in those backwoods days and he frederick had done the work early and late and all days he had been at it he remembered the season when isaacs wide plans had taken one of their smashes when food had been scarce on the table of a man who owned a hundred thousand acres when there had been no money to hire harvesters for the hay and when isaac would not let go his grip on a single one of his acres he frederick had pitched the hay while isaac mowed and raked tom had lain in bed and run up a doctor bill with a broken leg gained by falling off the ridgepole of the barnwhich place was the last in the world to which any one would expect to go to pitch hay about the only work tom had ever done it seemed to him was to fetch in venison and bearoil to break colts and to raise a din in the valley pastures and wooded canyons with his bearhounds  tom was the elder yet when isaac died the estate with all its vast possibilities would have gone to ruin had not he frederick buckled down to it and put the burden on his back work he remembered the enlargement of the town watersystemhow he had manoeuvred and financed persuaded small loans at ruinous interest and laid pipe and made joints by lantern light while the workmen slept and then been up ahead of them to outline and direct and rack his brains over the raising of the next weekend wages for he had carried on old isaacs policy he would not let go the future would vindicate  and tomwith a bigger pack of bear dogs ranging the mountains and sleeping out a week at a time frederick remembered the final conference in the kitchentom and he and eliza travers who still cooked and baked and washed dishes on an estate that carried a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in mortgages   dont divide eliza travers had pleaded resting her soapflecked parboiled arms isaac was right it will be worth millions the country is opening up we must all pull together  i dont want the estate tom cried let frederick have it what i want  he never completed the sentence but all the vision of the world burned in his eyes  i cant wait he went on you can have the millions when they come in the meantime let me have ten thousand ill sign off quitclaim to everything and give me the old schooner and some day ill be back with a pot of money to help you out  frederick could see himself in that far past day throwing up his arms in horror and crying  ten thousandwhen im strained to the breaking point to raise this quarters interest  theres the block of land next to the court house tom had urged i know the bank has a standing offer for ten thousand  but it will be worth a hundred thousand in ten years frederick had objected  call it so say i quitclaim everything for a hundred thousand sell it for ten and let me have it its all i want and i want it now you can have the rest  and tom had had his will as usual the block had been mortgaged instead of sold and sailed away in the old schooner the benediction of the town upon his head for he had carried away in his crew half the riffraff of the beach  the bones of the schooner had been left on the coast of java that had been when eliza travers was being operated on for her eyes and frederick had kept it from her until indubitable proof came that tom was still alive  frederick went over to his files and drew out a drawer labelled thomas travers in it were packets methodically arranged he went over the letters they were from everywherechina rangoon australia south africa the gold coast patagonia armenia alaska briefly and infrequently written they epitomised the wanderers life frederick ran over in his mind a few of the glimpsed highlights of toms career he had fought in some sort of foreign troubles in armenia he had been an officer in the chinese army and it was a certainty that the trade he later drove in the china seas was illicit he had been caught running arms into cuba it seemed he had always been running something somewhere that it ought not to have been run and he had never outgrown it one letter on crinkly tissue paper showed that as late as the japaneserussian war he had been caught running coal into port arthur and been taken to the prize court at sasebo where his steamer was confiscated and he remained a prisoner until the end of the war  frederick smiled as he read a paragraph how do you prosper let me know any time a few thousands will help you he looked at the date april 18 1883 and opened another packet may 5th 1883 was the dated sheet he drew out five thousand will put me on my feet again if you can and love me send it along prontothats spanish for rush  he glanced again at the two dates it was evident that somewhere between april 18th and may 5th tom had come a cropper with a smile half bitter frederick skimmed on through the correspondence theres a wreck on midway island a fortune in it salvage you know auction in two days cable me four thousand the last he examined ran a deal i can swing with a little cash its big i tell you its so big i dont dare tell you he remembered that deala latinamerican revolution he had sent the cash and tom had swung it and himself as well into a prison cell and a death sentence  tom had meant well there was no denying that and he had always religiously forwarded his i o us frederick musingly weighed the packet of them in his hand as though to determine if any relation existed between the weight of paper and the sums of money represented on it  he put the drawer back in the cabinet and passed out glancing in at the big chair he saw polly just tiptoeing from the room toms head lay back and his breathing was softly heavy the sickness pronouncedly apparent on his relaxed face   v  i have worked hard frederick explained to polly that evening on the veranda unaware that when a man explains it is a sign his situation is growing parlous i have done what came to my handhow creditably it is for others to say and i have been paid for it i have taken care of others and taken care of myself the doctors say they have never seen such a constitution in a man of my years why almost half my life is yet before me and we travers are a longlived stock i took care of myself you see and i have myself to show for it i was not a waster i conserved my heart and my arteries and yet there are few men who can boast having done as much work as i have done look at that hand steady eh it will be as steady twenty years from now there is nothing in playing fast and loose with oneself  and all the while polly had been following the invidious comparison that lurked behind his words  you can write honourable before your name she flashed up proudly but my father has been a king he has lived have you lived what have you got to show for it stocks and bonds and houses and servantspouf heart and arteries and a steady handis that all have you lived merely to live were you afraid to die id rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet when you are dust my father will be ashes that is the difference  but my dear child he began  what have you got to show for it she flamed on listen  from within through the open window came the tinkling of toms ukulele and the rollicking lilt of his voice in an hawaiian hula it ended in a throbbing primitive lovecall from the sensuous tropic night that no one could mistake there was a burst of young voices and a clamour for more frederick did not speak he had sensed something vague and significant  turning he glanced through the window at tom flushed and royal surrounded by the young men and women under his viking moustache lighting a cigarette from a match held to him by one of the girls it abruptly struck frederick that never had he lighted a cigar at a match held in a womans hand  doctor tyler says he oughtnt to smokeit only aggravates he said and it was all he could say  as the fall of the year came on a new type of men began to frequent the house they proudly called themselves sourdoughs and they were arriving in san francisco on the winters furlough from the golddiggings of alaska more and more of them came and they preempted a large portion of one of the downtown hotels captain tom was fading with the season and almost lived in the big chair he drowsed oftener and longer but whenever he awoke he was surrounded by his court of young people or there was some comrade waiting to sit and yarn about the old gold days and plan for the new gold days  for tomhusky travers the yukoners named himnever thought that the end approached a temporary illness he called it the natural enfeeblement following upon a prolonged bout with yucatan fever in the spring he would be right and fit again cold weather was what he needed his blood had been cooked in the meantime it was a case of take it easy and make the most of the rest  and no one undeceived himnot even the yukoners who smoked pipes and black cigars and chewed tobacco on fredericks broad verandas until he felt like an intruder in his own house there was no touch with them they regarded him as a stranger to be tolerated they came to see tom and their manner of seeing him was provocative of innocent envy pangs to frederick day after day he watched them he would see the yukoners meet perhaps one just leaving the sick room and one just going in they would clasp hands solemnly and silently outside the door the newcomer would question with his eyes and the other would shake his head and more than once frederick noted the moisture in their eyes then the newcomer would enter and draw his chair up to toms and with jovial voice proceed to plan the outfitting for the exploration of the upper kuskokeem for it was there tom was bound in the spring dogs could be had at larabeesa clean breed too with no taint of the soft southland strains it was rough country it was reported but if sourdoughs couldnt make the traverse from larabees in forty days theyd like to see a chechako do it in sixty  and so it went until frederick wondered when he came to die if there was one man in the county much less in the adjoining county who would come to him at his bedside  seated at his desk through the open windows would drift whiffs of strong tobacco and rumbling voices and he could not help catching snatches of what the yukoners talked  dye recollect that koyokuk rush in the early nineties he would hear one say well him an me was pardners then tradin an such we had a dinky little steamboat the blatterbat he named her that an it stuck he was a caution well sir as i was sayin him an me loaded the little blatterbat to the guards an started up the koyokuk me firin an engineerin an him steerin an both of us deckhandin once in a while wed tie to the bank an cut firewood it was the fall an mushice was comin down an everything gettin ready for the freeze up you see we was north of the arctic circle then an still headin north but they was two hundred miners in there needin grub if they wintered an we had the grub  well sir pretty soon they begun to pass us driftin down the river in canoes an rafts they was pullin out we kept track of them when a hundred an ninetyfour had passed we didnt see no reason for keepin on so we turned tail and

says i just as we was pullin out in a canoe lets stay an eat it says he an dang me if we didnt we wintered right there on the blatterbat huntin and tradin with the indians an when the river broke next year we brung down eight thousand dollars worth of skins now a whole winter just two of us is goin some but never a cross word out of him besttempered pardner i ever seen but fight  huh came the other voice i remember the winter oily jones allowed hed clean out forty mile only he didnt for about the second yap he let off he ran afoul of husky travers it was in the white caribou im a wolf yaps jones you know his style a gun in his belt fringes on his moccasins and long hair down his back im a wolf he yaps an this is my night to howl hear me you long lean makeshift of a human critteran this to husky travers  well the other voice queried after a pause  in about a second an a half oily jones was on the floor an husky on top askin somebody kindly to pass him a butcher knife whats he do but plumb hack off all of oily jones long hair now howl damn you howl says husky gettin up  he was a cool one for a wild one the first voice took up i seen him buck roulette in the little wolverine drop nine thousand in two hours borrow some more win it back in fifteen minutes buy the drinks an cash indang me all in fifteen minutes  one evening tom was unusually brightly awake and frederick joining the rapt young circle sat and listened to his brothers seriocomic narrative of the night of wreck on the island of blang of the swim through the sharks where half the crew was lost of the great pearl which desay brought ashore with him of the headdecorated palisade that surrounded the grass palace wherein dwelt the malay queen with her royal consort a shipwrecked chinese eurasian of the intrigue for the pearl of desay of mad feasts and dances in the barbaric night and quick dangers and sudden deaths of the queens lovemaking to desay of desays lovemaking to the queens daughter and of desay every joint crushed still alive staked out on the reef at low tide to be eaten by the sharks of the coming of the plague of the beating of tomtoms and the exorcising of the devildevil doctors of the flight over the mantrapped wildpig runs of the mountain bushmen and of the final rescue by tasman he who was hatcheted only last year and whose head reposed in some melanesian strongholdand all breathing of the warmth and abandon and savagery of the burning islands of the sun  and despite himself frederick sat entranced and when all the tale was told he was aware of a queer emptiness he remembered back to his boyhood when he had pored over the illustrations in the oldfashioned geography he too had dreamed of amazing adventure in far places and desired to go out on the shining ways and he had planned to go yet he had known only work and duty perhaps that was the difference perhaps that was the secret of the strange wisdom in his brothers eyes for the moment faint and far vicariously he glimpsed the lordly vision his brother had seen he remembered a sharp saying of pollys you have missed romance you traded it for dividends she was right and yet not fair he had wanted romance but the work had been placed ready to his hand he had toiled and moiled day and night and been faithful to his trust yet he had missed love and the worldliving that was forever awhisper in his brother and what had tom done to deserve ita wastrel and an idle singer of songs  his place was high he was going to be the next governor of california but what man would come to him and lie to him out of love the thought of all his property seemed to put a dry and gritty taste in his mouth property now that he looked at it one thousand dollars was like any other thousand dollars and one day of his days was like any other day he had never made the pictures in the geography come true he had not struck his man nor lighted his cigar at a match held in a womans hand a man could sleep in only one bed at a timetom had said that he shuddered as he strove to estimate how many beds he owned how many blankets he had bought and all the beds and blankets would not buy one man to come from the end of the earth and grip his hand and cry by the turtles of tasman  something of all this he told polly an undercurrent of complaint at the unfairness of things in his tale and she had answered  it couldnt have been otherwise father bought it he never drove bargains it was a royal thing and he paid for it royally you grudged the price dont you see you saved your arteries and your money and kept your feet dry   vi  on an afternoon in the late fall all were gathered about the big chair and captain tom though he did not know it he had drowsed the whole day through and only just awakened to call for his ukulele and light a cigarette at pollys hand but the ukulele lay idle on his arm and though the pine logs crackled in the huge fireplace he shivered and took note of the cold  its a good sign he said unaware that the faintness of his voice drew the heads of his listeners closer the cold weather will be a tonic its a hard job to work the tropics out of ones blood but im beginning to shape up now for the kuskokeem in the spring polly we start with the dogs and youll see the midnight sun how your mother would have liked the trip she was a game one forty sleeps with the dogs and well be shaking out yellow nuggets from the mossroots larabee has some fine animals i know the breed theyre timber wolves thats what they are big grey timber wolves though they sport brown about one in a litterisnt that right bennington  one in a litter thats just about the average bennington the yukoner replied promptly but in a voice hoarsely unrecognisable  and you must never travel alone with them captain tom went on for if you fall down theyll jump you larabees brutes only respect a man when he stands upright on his legs when he goes down hes meat i remember coming over the divide from tanana to circle city that was before the klondike strike it was in 94  no 95 and the bottom had dropped out of the thermometer there was a young canadian with the outfit his name was it was  a peculiar one  wait a minute it will come to me  his voice ceased utterly though his lips still moved a look of unbelief and vast surprise dawned on his face followed a sharp convulsive shudder and in that moment without warning he saw death he looked cleareyed and steady as if pondering then turned to polly his hand moved impotently as if to reach hers and when he found it his fingers could not close he gazed at her with a great smile that slowly faded the eyes drooped as the life went out and remained a face of quietude and repose the ukulele clattered to the floor one by one they went softly from the room leaving polly alone  from the veranda frederick watched a man coming up the driveway by the roll of the sea in his walk frederick could guess for whom the stranger came the face was swarthy with sun and wrinkled with age that was given the lie by the briskness of his movements and the alertness in the keen black eyes in the lobe of each ear was a tiny circlet of gold  how do you do sir the man said and it was patent that english was not the tongue he had learned at his mothers knee hows captain tom they told me in the town that he was sick  my brother is dead frederick answered  the stranger turned his head and gazed out over the parklike grounds and up to the distant redwood peaks and frederick noted that he swallowed with an effort  by the turtles of tasman he was a man he said in a deep changed voice  by the turtles of tasman he was a man frederick repeated nor did he stumble over the unaccustomed oath     the eternity of forms   a strange life has come to an end in the death of mr sedley crayden of crayden hill  mild harmless he was the victim of a strange delusion that kept him pinned night and day in his chair for the last two years of his life the mysterious death or rather disappearance of his elder brother james crayden seems to have preyed upon his mind for it was shortly after that event that his delusion began to manifest itself  mr crayden never vouchsafed any explanation of his strange conduct there was nothing the matter with him physically and mentally the alienists found him normal in every way save for his one remarkable idiosyncrasy his remaining in his chair was purely voluntary an act of his own will and now he is dead and the mystery remains unsolved  extract from the newton couriertimes   briefly i was mr sedley craydens confidential servant and valet for the last eight months of his life during that time he wrote a great deal in a manuscript that he kept always beside him except when he drowsed or slept at which times he invariably locked it in a desk drawer close to his hand  i was curious to read what the old gentleman wrote but he was too cautious and cunning i never got a peep at the manuscript if he were engaged upon it when i attended on him he covered the top sheet with a large blotter it was i who found him dead in his chair and it was then that i took the liberty of abstracting the manuscript i was very curious to read it and i have no excuses to offer  after retaining it in my secret possession for several years and after ascertaining that mr crayden left no surviving relatives i have decided to make the nature of the manuscript known it is very long and i have omitted nearly all of it giving only the more lucid fragments it bears all the earmarks of a disordered mind and various experiences are repeated over and over while much is so vague and incoherent as to defy comprehension nevertheless from reading it myself i venture to predict that if an excavation is made in the main basement somewhere in the vicinity of the foundation of the great chimney a collection of bones will be found which should very closely resemble those which james crayden once clothed in mortal flesh  statement of rudolph heckler   here follows the excerpts from the manuscript made and arranged by rudolph heckler   i never killed my brother let this be my first word and my last why should i kill him we lived together in unbroken harmony for twenty years we were old men and the fires and tempers of youth had long since burned out we never disagreed even over the most trivial things never was there such amity as ours we were scholars we cared nothing for the outside world our companionship and our books were allsatisfying never were there such talks as we held many a night we have sat up till two and three in the morning conversing weighing opinions and judgments referring to authoritiesin short we lived at high and friendly intellectual altitudes                                       he disappeared i suffered a great shock why should he have disappeared where could he have gone it was very strange i was stunned they say i was very sick for weeks it was brain fever this was caused by his inexplicable disappearance it was at the beginning of the experience i hope here to relate that he disappeared  how i have endeavoured to find him i am not an excessively rich man yet have i offered continually increasing rewards i have advertised in all the papers and sought the aid of all the detective bureaus at the present moment the rewards i have out aggregate over fifty thousand dollars                                       they say he was murdered they also say murder will out then i say why does not his murder come out who did it where is he where is jim my jim                                       we were so happy together he had a remarkable mind a most remarkable mind so firmly founded so widely informed so rigidly logical that it was not at all strange that we agreed in all things dissension was unknown between us jim was the most truthful man i have ever met in this too we were similar as we were similar in our intellectual honesty we never sacrificed truth to make a point we had no points to make we so thoroughly agreed it is absurd to think that we could disagree on anything under the sun                                       i wish he would come back why did he go who can ever explain it i am lonely now and depressed with grave forebodingsfrightened by terrors that are of the mind and that put at naught all that my mind has ever conceived form is mutable this is the last word of positive science the dead do not come back this is incontrovertible the dead are dead and that is the end of it and of them and yet i have had experiences herehere in this very room at this very desk thatbut wait let me put it down in black and white in words simple and unmistakable let me ask some questions who mislays my pen that is what i desire to know who uses up my ink so rapidly not i and yet the ink goes  the answer to these questions would settle all the enigmas of the universe i know the answer i am not a fool and some day if i am plagued too desperately i shall give the answer myself i shall give the name of him who mislays my pen and uses up my ink it is so silly to think that i could use such a quantity of ink the servant lies i know                                       i have got me a fountain pen i have always disliked the device but my old stub had to go i burned it in the fireplace the ink i keep under lock and key i shall see if i cannot put a stop to these lies that are being written about me and i have other plans it is not true that i have recanted i still believe that i live in a mechanical universe it has not been proved otherwise to me for all that i have peered over his shoulder and read his malicious statement to the contrary he gives me credit for no less than average stupidity he thinks i think he is real how silly i know he is a brainfigment nothing more  there are such things as hallucinations even as i looked over his shoulder and read i knew that this was such a thing if i were only well it would be interesting all my life i have wanted to experience such phenomena and now it has come to me i shall make the most of it what is imagination it can make something where there is nothing how can anything be something where there is nothing how can anything be something and nothing at the same time i leave it for the metaphysicians to ponder i know better no scholastics for me this is a real world and everything in it is real what is not real is not therefore he is not yet he tries to fool me into believing that he is  when all the time i know he has no existence outside of my own brain cells                                       i saw him today seated at the desk writing it gave me quite a shock because i had thought he was quite dispelled nevertheless on looking steadily i found that he was not therethe old familiar trick of the brain i have dwelt too long on what has happened i am becoming morbid and my old indigestion is hinting and muttering i shall take exercise each day i shall walk for two hours                                       it is impossible i cannot exercise each time i return from my walk he is sitting in my chair at the desk it grows more difficult to drive him away it is my chair upon this i insist it was his but he is dead and it is no longer his how one can be befooled by the phantoms of his own imagining there is nothing real in this apparition i know it i am firmly grounded with my fifty years of study the dead are dead                                       and yet explain one thing today before going for my walk i carefully put the fountain pen in my pocket before leaving the room i remember it distinctly i looked at the clock at the time it was twenty minutes past ten yet on my return there was the pen lying on the desk some one had been using it there was very little ink left i wish he would not write so much it is disconcerting                                       there was one thing upon which jim and i were not quite agreed he believed in the eternity of the forms of things therefore entered in immediately the consequent belief in immortality and all the other notions of the metaphysical philosophers i had little patience with him in this painstakingly i have traced to him the evolution of his belief in the eternity of forms showing him how it has arisen out of his early infatuation with logic and mathematics of course from that warped squinting abstract viewpoint it is very easy to believe in the eternity of forms  i laughed at the unseen world only the real was real i contended and what one did not perceive was not could not be i believed in a mechanical universe chemistry and physics explained everything can no being be he demanded in reply i said that his question was but the major promise of a fallacious christian science syllogism oh believe me i know my logic too but he was very stubborn i never had any patience with philosophic idealists                                       once i made to him my confession of faith it was simple brief unanswerable even as i write it now i know that it is unanswerable here it is i told him i assert with hobbes that it is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks i assert with bacon that all human understanding arises from the world of sensations i assert with locke that all human ideas are due to the functions of the senses i assert with kant the mechanical origin of the universe and that creation is a natural and historical process i assert with laplace that there is no need of the hypothesis of a creator and finally i assert because of all the foregoing that form is ephemeral form passes therefore we pass  i repeat it was unanswerable yet did he answer with paleys notorious fallacy of the watch also he talked about radium and all but asserted that the very existence of matter had been exploded by these laterday laboratory researches it was childish i had not dreamed he could be so immature  how could one argue with such a man i then asserted the reasonableness of all that is to this he agreed reserving however one exception he looked at me as he said it in a way i could not mistake the inference was obvious that he should be guilty of so cheap a quip in the midst of a serious discussion astounded me                                       the eternity of forms it is ridiculous yet is there a strange magic in the words if it be true then has he not ceased to exist then does he exist this is impossible                                       i have ceased exercising as long as i remain in the room the hallucination does not bother me but when i return to the room after an absence he is always there sitting at the desk writing yet i dare not confide in a physician i must fight this out by myself                                       he grows more importunate today consulting a book on the shelf i turned and found him again in the chair this is the first time he has dared do this in my presence nevertheless by looking at him steadily and sternly for several minutes i compelled him to vanish this proves my contention he does not exist if he were an eternal form i could not make him vanish by a mere effort of my will                                       this is getting damnable today i gazed at him for an entire hour before i could make him leave yet it is so simple what i see is a memory picture for twenty years i was accustomed to seeing him there at the desk the present phenomenon is merely a recrudescence of that memory picturea picture which was impressed countless times on my consciousness                                       i gave up today he exhausted me and still he would not go i sat and watched him hour after hour he takes no notice of me but continually writes i know what he writes for i read it over his shoulder it is not true he is taking an unfair advantage                                       query he is a product of my consciousness is it possible then that entities may be created by consciousness                                       we did not quarrel to this day i do not know how it happened let me tell you then you will see we sat up late that nevertobeforgotten last night of his existence it was the old old discussionthe eternity of forms how many hours and how many nights we had consumed over it  on this night he had been particularly irritating and all my nerves were screaming he had been maintaining that the human soul was itself a form an eternal form and that the light within his brain would go on forever and always i took up the poker  suppose i said i should strike you dead with this  i would go on he answered  as a conscious entity i demanded  yes as a conscious entity was his reply i should go on from plane to plane of higher existence remembering my earthlife you this very argumentay and continuing the argument with you  it was only argument1 i swear it was only argument i never lifted a hand how could i he was my brother my elder brother jim  i cannot remember i was very exasperated he had always been so obstinate in this metaphysical belief of his the next i knew he was lying on the hearth blood was running it was terrible he did not speak he did not move he must have fallen in a fit and struck his head i noticed there was blood on the poker in falling he must have struck upon it with his head and yet i fail to see how this can be for i held it in my hand all the time i was still holding it in my hand as i looked at it  footnote 1 forcibleha hacomment of rudolph heckler on margin                                       it is an hallucination that is a conclusion of common sense i have watched the growth of it at first it was only in the dimmest light that i could see him sitting in the chair but as the time passed and the hallucination by repetition strengthened he was able to appear in the chair under the strongest lights that is the explanation it is quite satisfactory                                       i shall never forget the first time i saw it i had dined alone downstairs i never drink wine so that what happened was eminently normal it was in the summer twilight that i returned to the study i glanced at the desk there he was sitting so natural was it that before i knew i cried out jim then i remembered all that had happened of course it was an hallucination i knew that i took the poker and went over to it he did not move nor vanish the poker cleaved through the nonexistent substance of the thing and struck the back of the chair fabric of fancy that is all it was the mark is there on the chair now where the poker struck i pause from my writing and turn and look at itpress the tips of my fingers into the indentation                                       he did continue the argument i stole up today and looked over his shoulder he was writing the history of our discussion it was the same old nonsense about the eternity of forms but as i continued to read he wrote down the practical test i had made with the poker now this is unfair and untrue i made no test in falling he struck his head on the poker                                       some day somebody will find and read what he writes this will be terrible i am suspicious of the servant who is always peeping and peering trying to see what i write i must do something every servant i have had is curious about what i write                                       fabric of fancy that is all it is there is no jim who sits in the chair i know that last night when the house was asleep i went down into the cellar and looked carefully at the soil around the chimney it was untampered with the dead do not rise up                                       yesterday morning when i entered the study there he was in the chair when i had dispelled him i sat in the chair myself all day i had my meals brought to me and thus i escaped the sight of him for many hours for he appears only in the chair i was weary but i sat late until eleven oclock yet when i stood up to go to bed i looked around and there he was he had slipped into the chair on the instant being only fabric of fancy all day he had resided in my brain the moment it was unoccupied he took up his residence in the chair are these his boasted higher planes of existencehis brothers brain and a chair after all was he not right has his eternal form become so attenuated as to be an hallucination are hallucinations real entities why not there is food for thought here some day i shall come to a conclusion upon it                                       he was very much disturbed today he could not write for i had made the servant carry the pen out of the room in his pocket but neither could i write                                       the servant never sees him this is strange have i developed a keener sight for the unseen or rather does it not prove the phantom to be what it isa product of my own morbid consciousness                                       he has stolen my pen again hallucinations cannot steal pens this is unanswerable and yet i cannot keep the pen always out of the room i want to write myself                                       i have had three different servants since my trouble came upon me and not one has seen him is the verdict of their senses right and is that of mine wrong nevertheless the ink goes too rapidly i fill my pen more often than is necessary and furthermore only today i found my pen out of order i did not break it                                       i have spoken to him many times but he never answers i sat and watched him all morning frequently he looked at me and it was patent that he knew me                                       by striking the side of my head violently with the heel of my hand i can shake the vision of him out of my eyes then i can get into the chair but i have learned that i must move very quickly in order to accomplish this often he fools me and is back again before i can sit down                                       it is getting unbearable he is a jackinthebox the way he pops into the chair he does not assume form slowly he pops that is the only way to describe it i cannot stand looking at him much more that way lies madness for it compels me almost to believe in the reality of what i know is not besides hallucinations do not pop                                       thank god he only manifests himself in the chair as long as i occupy the chair i am quit of him                                       my device for dislodging him from the chair by striking my head is failing i have to hit much more violently and i do not succeed perhaps more than once in a dozen trials my head is quite sore where i have so repeatedly struck it i must use the other hand                                       my brother was right there is an unseen world do i not see it am i not cursed with the seeing of it all the time call it a thought an idea anything you will still it is there it is unescapable thoughts are entities we create with every act of thinking i have created this phantom that sits in my chair and uses my ink because i have created him is no reason that he is any the less real he is an idea he is an entity ergo ideas are entities and an entity is a reality                                       query if a man with the whole historical process behind him can create an entity a real thing then is not the hypothesis of a creator made substantial if the stuff of life can create then it is fair to assume that there can be a he who created the stuff of life it is merely a difference of degree i have not yet made a mountain nor a solar system but i have made a something that sits in my chair this being so may i not some day be able to make a mountain or a solar system                                       all his days down to today man has lived in a maze he has never seen the light i am convinced that i am beginning to see the lightnot as my brother saw it by stumbling upon it accidentally but deliberately and rationally my brother is dead he has ceased there is no doubt about it for i have made another journey down into the cellar to see the ground was untouched i broke it myself to make sure and i saw what made me sure my brother has ceased yet have i recreated him this is not my old brother yet it is something as nearly resembling him as i could fashion it i am unlike other men i am a god i have created                                       whenever i leave the room to go to bed i look back and there is my brother sitting in the chair and then i cannot sleep because of thinking of him sitting through all the long nighthours and in the morning when i open the study door there he is and i know he has sat there the night long                                       i am becoming desperate from lack of sleep i wish i could confide in a physician                                       blessed sleep i have won to it at last let me tell you last night i was so worn that i found myself dozing in my chair i rang for the servant and ordered him to bring blankets i slept all night was he banished from my thoughts as he was banished from my chair i shall remain in it all day it is a wonderful relief                                       it is uncomfortable to sleep in a chair but it is more uncomfortable to lie in bed hour after hour and not sleep and to know that he is sitting there in the cold darkness                                       it is no use i shall never be able to sleep in a bed again i have tried it now numerous times and every such night is a horror if i could but only persuade him to go to bed but no he sits there and sits therei know he doeswhile i stare and stare up into the blackness and think and think continually think of him sitting there i wish i had never heard of the eternity of forms                                       the servants think i am crazy that is but to be expected and it is why i have never called in a physician                                       i am resolved henceforth this hallucination ceases from now on i shall remain in the chair i shall never leave it i shall remain in it night and day and always                                       i have succeeded for two weeks i have not seen him nor shall i ever see him again i have at last attained the equanimity of mind necessary for philosophic thought i wrote a complete chapter today                                       it is very wearisome sitting in a chair the weeks pass the months come and go the seasons change the servants replace each other while i remain i only remain it is a strange life i lead but at least i am at peace                                       he comes no more there is no eternity of forms i have proved it for nearly two years now i have remained in this chair and i have not seen him once true i was severely tried for a time but it is clear that what i thought i saw was merely hallucination he never was yet i do not leave the chair i am afraid to leave the chair     told in the drooling ward   me im not a drooler im the assistant i dont know what miss jones or miss kelsey could do without me there are fiftyfive lowgrade droolers in this ward and how could they ever all be fed if i wasnt around i like to feed droolers they dont make trouble they cant somethings wrong with most of their legs and arms and they cant talk theyre very lowgrade i can walk and talk and do things you must be careful with the droolers and not feed them too fast then they choke miss jones says im an expert when a new nurse comes i show her how to do it its funny watching a new nurse try to feed them she goes at it so slow and careful that supper time would be around before she finished shoving down their breakfast then i show her because im an expert dr dalrymple says i am and he ought to know a drooler can eat twice as fast if you know how to make him  my names tom im twentyeight years old everybody knows me in the institution this is an institution you know it belongs to the state of california and is run by politics i know ive been here a long time everybody trusts me i run errands all over the place when im not busy with the droolers i like droolers it makes me think how lucky i am that i aint a drooler  i like it here in the home i dont like the outside i know ive been around a bit and run away and adopted me for the home and for the drooling ward best of all i dont look like a drooler do i you can tell the difference soon as you look at me im an assistant expert assistant thats going some for a feeb feeb oh thats feebleminded i thought you knew were all feebs in here  but im a highgrade feeb dr dalrymple says im too smart to be in the home but i never let on its a pretty good place and i dont throw fits like lots of the feebs you see that house up there through the trees the highgrade epilecs all live in it by themselves theyre stuck up because they aint just ordinary feebs they call it the club house and they say theyre just as good as anybody outside only theyre sick i dont like them much they laugh at me when they aint busy throwing fits but i dont care i never have to be scared about falling down and busting my head sometimes they run around in circles trying to find a place to sit down quick only they dont lowgrade epilecs are disgusting and highgrade epilecs put on airs im glad i aint an epilec there aint anything to them they just talk big thats all  miss kelsey says i talk too much but i talk sense and thats more than the other feebs do dr dalrymple says i have the gift of language i know it you ought to hear me talk when im by myself or when ive got a drooler to listen sometimes i think id like to be a politician only its too much trouble theyre all great talkers thats how they hold their jobs  nobodys crazy in this institution theyre just feeble in their minds let me tell you something funny theres about a dozen highgrade girls that set the tables in the big dining room sometimes when theyre done ahead of time they all sit down in chairs in a circle and talk i sneak up to the door and listen and i nearly die to keep from laughing do you want to know what they talk its like this they dont say a word for a long time and then one says thank god im not feebleminded and all the rest nod their heads and look pleased and then nobody says anything for a time after which the next girl in the circle says thank god im not feebleminded and they nod their heads all over again and it goes on around the circle and they never say anything else now theyre real feebs aint they i leave it to you im not that kind of a feeb thank god  sometimes i dont think im a feeb at all i play in the band and read music were all supposed to be feebs in the band except the leader hes crazy we know it but we never talk about it except amongst ourselves his job is politics too and we dont want him to lose it i play the drum they cant get along without me in this institution i was sick once so i know its a wonder the drooling ward didnt break down while i was in hospital  i could get out of here if i wanted to im not so feeble as some might think but i dont let on i have too good a time besides everything would run down if i went away im afraid some time theyll find out im not a feeb and send me out into the world to earn my own living i know the world and i dont like it the home is fine enough for me  you see how i grin sometimes i cant help that but i can put it on a lot im not bad though i look at myself in the glass my mouth is funny i know that and it lops down and my teeth are bad you can tell a feeb anywhere by looking at his mouth and teeth but that doesnt prove im a feeb its just because im lucky that i look like one  i know a lot if i told you all i know youd be surprised but when i dont want to know or when they want me to do something i dont want to do i just let my mouth lop down and laugh and make foolish noises i watch the foolish noises made by the lowgrades and i can fool anybody and i know a lot of foolish noises miss kelsey called me a fool the other day she was very angry and that was where i fooled her  miss kelsey asked me once why i dont write a book about feebs i was telling her what was the matter with little albert hes a drooler you know and i can always tell the way he twists his left eye whats the matter with him so i was explaining it to miss kelsey and because she didnt know it made her mad but some day mebbe ill write that book only its so much trouble besides id sooner talk  do you know what a micro is its the kind with the little heads no bigger than your fist theyre usually droolers and they live a long time the hydros dont drool they have the big heads and theyre smarter but they never grow up they always die i never look at one without thinking hes going to die sometimes when im feeling lazy or the nurse is mad at me i wish i was a drooler with nothing to do and somebody to feed me but i guess id sooner talk and be what i am  only yesterday doctor dalrymple said to me tom he said i just dont know what id do without you and he ought to know seeing as hes had the bossing of a thousand feebs for going on two years dr whatcomb was before him they get appointed you know its politics ive seen a whole lot of doctors here in my time i was here before any of them ive been in this institution twentyfive years no ive got no complaints the institution couldnt be run better  its a snap to be a highgrade feeb just look at doctor dalrymple he has troubles he holds his job by politics you bet we highgraders talk politics we know all about it and its bad an institution like this oughtnt to be run on politics look at doctor dalrymple hes been here two years and learned a lot then politics will come along and throw him out and send a new doctor who dont know anything about feebs  ive been acquainted with just thousands of nurses in my time some of them are nice but they come and go most of the women get married sometimes i think id like to get married i spoke to dr whatcomb about it once but he told me he was very sorry because feebs aint allowed to get married ive been in love she was a nurse i wont tell you her name she had blue eyes and yellow hair and a kind voice and she liked me she told me so and she always told me to be a good boy and i was too until afterward and then i ran away you see she went off and got married and she didnt tell me about it  i guess being married aint what its cracked up to be dr anglin and his wife used to fight ive seen them and once i heard her call him a feeb now nobody has a right to call anybody a feeb that aint dr anglin got awful mad when she called him that but he didnt last long politics drove him out and doctor mandeville came he didnt have a wife i heard him talking one time with the engineer the engineer and his wife fought like cats and dogs and that day doctor mandeville told him he was damn glad he wasnt tied to no petticoats a petticoat is a skirt i knew what he meant if i was a feeb but i never let on you hear lots when you dont let on  ive seen a lot in my time once i was adopted and went away on the railroad over forty miles to live with a man named peter bopp and his wife they had a ranch doctor anglin said i was strong and bright and i said i was too that was because i wanted to be adopted and peter bopp said hed give me a good home and the lawyers fixed up the papers  but i soon made up my mind that a ranch was no place for me mrs bopp was scared to death of me and wouldnt let me sleep in the house they fixed up the woodshed and made me sleep there i had to get up at four oclock and feed the horses and milk cows and carry the milk to the neighbours they called it chores but it kept me going all day i chopped wood and cleaned chicken houses and weeded vegetables and did most everything on the place i never had any fun i hadnt no time  let me tell you one thing id sooner feed mush and milk to feebs than milk cows with the frost on the ground mrs bopp was scared to let me play with her children and i was scared too they used to make faces at me when nobody was looking and call me looney everybody called me looney tom and the other boys in the neighbourhood threw rocks at me you never see anything like that in the home here the feebs are better behaved  mrs bopp used to pinch me and pull my hair when she thought i was too slow and i only made foolish noises and went slower she said id be the death of her some day i left the boards off the old well in the pasture and the pretty new calf fell in and got drowned then peter bopp said he was going to give me a licking he did too he took a strap halter and went at me it was awful id never had a licking in my life they dont do such things in the home which is why i say the home is the place for me  i know the law and i knew he had no right to lick me with a strap halter that was being cruel and the guardianship papers said he mustnt be cruel i didnt say anything i just waited which shows you what kind of a feeb i am i waited a long time and got slower and made more foolish noises but he wouldnt send me back to the home which was what i wanted but one day it was the first of the month mrs brown gave me three dollars which was for her milk bill with peter bopp that was in the morning when i brought the milk in the evening i was to bring back the receipt but i didnt i just walked down to the station bought a ticket like any one and rode on the train back to the home thats the kind of a feeb i am  doctor anglin was gone then and doctor mandeville had his place i walked right into his office he didnt know me hello he said this aint visiting day i aint a visitor i said im tom i belong here then he whistled and showed he was surprised i told him all about it and showed him the marks of the strap halter and he got madder and madder all the time and said hed attend to mr peter bopps case  and mebbe you think some of them little droolers werent glad to see me  i walked right into the ward there was a new nurse feeding little albert hold on i said that aint the way dont you see how hes twisting that left eye let me show you mebbe she thought i was a new doctor for she just gave me the spoon and i guess i filled little albert up with the most comfortable meal hed had since i went away droolers aint bad when you understand them i heard miss jones tell miss kelsey once that i had an amazing gift in handling droolers  some day mebbe im going to talk with doctor dalrymple and get him to give me a declaration that i aint a feeb then ill get him to make me a real assistant in the drooling ward with forty dollars a month and my board and then ill marry miss jones and live right on here and if she wont have me ill marry miss kelsey or some other nurse theres lots of them that want to get married and i wont care if my wife gets mad and calls me a feeb whats the good and i guess when ones learned to put up with droolers a wife wont be much worse  i didnt tell you about when i ran away i hadnt no idea of such a thing and it was charley and joe who put me up to it theyre highgrade epilecs you know id been up to doctor wilsons office with a message and was going back to the drooling ward when i saw charley and joe hiding around the corner of the gymnasium and making motions to me i went over to them  hello joe said hows droolers  fine i said had any fits lately  that made them mad and i was going on when joe said were running away come on  what for i said  were going up over the top of the mountain joe said  and find a gold mine said charley we dont have fits any more were cured  all right i said and we sneaked around back of the gymnasium and in among the trees mebbe we walked along about ten minutes when i stopped  whats the matter said joe  wait i said i got to go back  what for said joe  and i said to get little albert  and they said i couldnt and got mad but i didnt care i knew theyd wait you see ive been here twentyfive years and i know the back trails that lead up the mountain and charley and joe didnt know those trails thats why they wanted me to come  so i went back and got little albert he cant walk or talk or do anything except drool and i had to carry him in my arms we went on past the last hayfield which was as far as id ever gone then the woods and brush got so thick and me not finding any more trail we followed the cowpath down to a big creek and crawled through the fence which showed where the home land stopped  we climbed up the big hill on the other side of the creek it was all big trees and no brush but it was so steep and slippery with dead leaves we could hardly walk by and by we came to a real bad place it was forty feet across and if you slipped youd fall a thousand feet or mebbe a hundred anyway you wouldnt falljust slide i went across first carrying little albert joe came next but charley got scared right in the middle and sat down  im going to have a fit he said  no youre not said joe because if you was you wouldnt a sat down you take all your fits standing  this is a different kind of a fit said charley beginning to cry  he shook and shook but just because he wanted to he couldnt scare up the least kind of a fit  joe got mad and used awful language but that didnt help none so i talked soft and kind to charley thats the way to handle feebs if you get mad they get worse i know im that way myself thats why i was almost the death of mrs bopp she got mad  it was getting along in the afternoon and i knew we had to be on our way so i said to joe  here stop your cussing and hold albert ill go back and get him  and i did too but he was so scared and dizzy he crawled along on hands and knees while i helped him when i got him across and took albert back in my arms i heard somebody laugh and looked down and there was a man and woman on horseback looking up at us he had a gun on his saddle and it was her who was laughing  who in hells that said joe getting scared somebody to catch us  shut up your cussing i said to him that is the man who owns this ranch and writes books  how do you do mr endicott i said down to him  hello he said what are you doing here  were running away i said  and he said good luck but be sure and get back before dark  but this is a real running away i said  and then both he and his wife laughed  all right he said good luck just the same but watch out the bears and mountain lions dont get you when it gets dark  then they rode away laughing pleasant like but i wished he hadnt said that about the bears and mountain lions  after we got around the hill i found a trail and we went much faster charley didnt have any more signs of fits and began laughing and talking about gold mines the trouble was with little albert he was almost as big as me you see all the time id been calling him little albert hed been growing up he was so heavy i couldnt keep up with joe and charley i was all out of breath so i told them theyd have to take turns in carrying him which they said they wouldnt then i said id leave them and theyd get lost and the mountain lions and bears would eat them charley looked like he was going to have a fit right there and joe said give him to me and after that we carried him in turn  we kept right on up that mountain i dont think there was any gold mine but we might a got to the top and found it if we hadnt lost the trail and if it hadnt got dark and if little albert hadnt tired us all out carrying him lots of feebs are scared of the dark and joe said he was going to have a fit right there only he didnt i never saw such an unlucky boy he never could throw a fit when he wanted to some of the feebs can throw fits as quick as a wink  by and by it got real black and we were hungry and we didnt have no fire you see they dont let feebs carry matches and all we could do was just shiver and wed never thought about being hungry you see feebs always have their food ready for them and thats why its better to be a feeb than earning your living in the world  and worse than everything was the quiet there was only one thing worse and it was the noises there was all kinds of noises every once in a while with quiet spells in between i reckon they were rabbits but they made noises in the brush like wild animalsyou know rustle rustle thump bump crackle crackle just like that first charley got a fit a real one and joe threw a terrible one i dont mind fits in the home with everybody around but out in the woods on a dark night is different you listen to me and never go hunting gold mines with epilecs even if they are highgrade  i never had such an awful night when joe and charley werent throwing fits they were making believe and in the darkness the shivers from the cold which i couldnt see seemed like fits too and i shivered so hard i thought i was getting fits myself and little albert with nothing to eat just drooled and drooled i never seen him as bad as that before why he twisted that left eye of his until it ought to have dropped out i couldnt see it but i could tell from the movements he made and joe just lay and cussed and cussed and charley cried and wished he was back in the home  we didnt die and next morning we went right back the way wed come and little albert got awful heavy doctor wilson was mad as could be and said i was the worst feeb in the institution along with joe and charley but miss striker who was a nurse in the drooling ward then just put her arms around me and cried she was that happy id got back i thought right there that mebbe id marry her but only a month afterward she got married to the plumber that came up from the city to fix the gutterpipes of the new hospital and little albert never twisted his eye for two days it was that tired  next time i run away im going right over that mountain but i aint going to take epilecs along they aint never cured and when they get scared or excited they throw fits to beat the band but ill take little albert somehow i cant get along without him and anyway i aint going to run away the drooling wards a better snap than gold mines and i hear theres a new nurse coming besides little alberts bigger than i am now and i could never carry him over a mountain and hes growing bigger every day its astonishing     the hobo and the fairy   he lay on his back so heavy was his sleep that the stamp of hoofs and cries of the drivers from the bridge that crossed the creek did not rouse him wagon after wagon loaded high with grapes passed the bridge on the way up the valley to the winery and the coming of each wagon was like an explosion of sound and commotion in the lazy quiet of the afternoon  but the man was undisturbed his head had slipped from the folded newspaper and the straggling unkempt hair was matted with the foxtails and burrs of the dry grass on which it lay he was not a pretty sight his mouth was open disclosing a gap in the upper row where several teeth at some time had been knocked out he breathed stertorously at times grunting and moaning with the pain of his sleep also he was very restless tossing his arms about making jerky halfconvulsive movements and at times rolling his head from side to side in the burrs this restlessness seemed occasioned partly by some internal discomfort and partly by the sun that streamed down on his face and by the flies that buzzed and lighted and crawled upon the nose and cheeks and eyelids there was no other place for them to crawl for the rest of the face was covered with matted beard slightly grizzled but greatly dirtstained and weatherdiscoloured  the cheekbones were blotched with the blood congested by the debauch that was evidently being slept off this too accounted for the persistence with which the flies clustered around the mouth lured by the alcoholladen exhalations he was a powerfully built man thicknecked broadshouldered with sinewy wrists and toildistorted hands yet the distortion was not due to recent toil nor were the callouses other than ancient that showed under the dirt of the one palm upturned from time to time this hand clenched tightly and spasmodically into a fist large heavyboned and wickedlooking  the man lay in the dry grass of a tiny glade that ran down to the treefringed bank of the stream on either side of the glade was a fence of the old stakeandrider type though little of it was to be seen so thickly was it overgrown by wild blackberry bushes scrubby oaks and young madrono trees in the rear a gate through a low paling fence led to a snug squat bungalow built in the california spanish style and seeming to have been compounded directly from the landscape of which it was so justly a part neat and trim and modestly sweet was the bungalow redolent of comfort and repose telling with quiet certitude of some one that knew and that had sought and found  through the gate and into the glade came as dainty a little maiden as ever stepped out of an illustration made especially to show how dainty little maidens may be eight years she might have been and possibly a trifle more or less her little waist and little blackstockinged calves showed how delicately fragile she was but the fragility was of mould only there was no hint of an√¶mia in the clear healthy complexion nor in the quick tripping step she was a little delicious blond with hair spun of gossamer gold and wide blue eyes that were but slightly veiled by the long lashes her expression was of sweetness and happiness it belonged by right to any face that sheltered in the bungalow  she carried a childs parasol which she was careful not to tear against the scrubby branches and bramble bushes as she sought for wild poppies along the edge of the fence they were late poppies a third generation which had been unable to resist the call of the warm october sun  having gathered along one fence she turned to cross to the opposite fence midway in the glade she came upon the tramp her startle was merely a startle there was no fear in it she stood and looked long and curiously at the forbidding spectacle and was about to turn back when the sleeper moved restlessly and rolled his hand among the burrs she noted the sun on his face and the buzzing flies her face grew solicitous and for a moment she debated with herself then she tiptoed to his side interposed the parasol between him and the sun and brushed away the flies after a time for greater ease she sat down beside him  an hour passed during which she occasionally shifted the parasol from one tired hand to the other at first the sleeper had been restless but shielded from the flies and the sun his breathing became gentler and his movements ceased several times however he really frightened her the first was the worst coming abruptly and without warning christ how deep how deep the man murmured from some profound of dream the parasol was agitated but the little girl controlled herself and continued her selfappointed ministrations  another time it was a gritting of teeth as of some intolerable agony so terribly did the teeth crunch and grind together that it seemed they must crash into fragments a little later he suddenly stiffened out the hands clenched and the face set with the savage resolution of the dream the eyelids trembled from the shock of the fantasy seemed about to open but did not instead the lips muttered  no by god no and once more no i wont peach the lips paused then went on you might as well tie me up warden and cut me to pieces thats all you can get outa meblood thats all any of youuns has ever got outa me in this hole  after this outburst the man slept gently on while the little girl still held the parasol aloft and looked down with a great wonder at the frowsy unkempt creature trying to reconcile it with the little part of life that she knew to her ears came the cries of men the stamp of hoofs on the bridge and the creak and groan of wagons heavyladen it was a breathless california indian summer day light fleeces of cloud drifted in the azure sky but to the west heavy cloud banks threatened with rain a bee droned lazily by from farther thickets came the calls of quail and from the fields the songs of meadow larks and oblivious to it all slept ross shanklinross shanklin the tramp and outcast exconvict 4379 the bitter and unbreakable one who had defied all keepers and survived all brutalities  texasborn of the old pioneer stock that was always tough and stubborn he had been unfortunate at seventeen years of age he had been apprehended for horsestealing also he had been convicted of stealing seven horses which he had not stolen and he had been sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment this was severe under any circumstances but with him it had been especially severe because there had been no prior convictions against him the sentiment of the people who believed him guilty had been that two years was adequate punishment for the youth but the county attorney paid according to the convictions he secured had made seven charges against him and earned seven fees which goes to show that the county attorney valued twelve years of ross shanklins life at less than a few dollars  young ross shanklin had toiled in hell he had escaped more than once and he had been caught and sent back to toil in other and various hells he had been triced up and lashed till he fainted had been revived and lashed again he had been in the dungeon ninety days at a time he had experienced the torment of the straightjacket he knew what the humming bird was he had been farmed out as a chattel by the state to the contractors he had been trailed through swamps by blood hounds twice he had been shot for six years on end he had cut a cord and a half of wood each day in a convict lumber camp sick or well he had cut that cord and a half or paid for it under a whiplash knotted and pickled  and ross shanklin had not sweetened under the treatment he had sneered and cursed and defied he had seen convicts after the guards had manhandled them crippled in body for life or left to maunder in mind to the end of their days he had seen convicts even his own cellmate goaded to murder by their keepers go to the gallows cursing god he had been in a break in which eleven of his kind were shot down he had been through a mutiny where in the prison yard with gatling guns trained upon them three hundred convicts had been disciplined with pickhandles wielded by brawny guards  he had known every infamy of human cruelty and through it all he had never been broken he had resented and fought to the last until embittered and bestial the day came when he was discharged five dollars were given him in payment for the years of his labour and the flower of his manhood and he had worked little in the years that followed work he hated and despised he tramped begged and stole lied or threatened as the case might warrant and drank to besottedness whenever he got the chance  the little girl was looking at him when he awoke like a wild animal all of him was awake the instant he opened his eyes the first he saw was the parasol strangely obtruded between him and the sky he did not start nor move though his whole body seemed slightly to tense his eyes followed down the parasol handle to the tightclutched little fingers and along the arm to the childs face straight and unblinking he looked into her eyes and she returning the look was chilled and frightened by his glittering eyes cold and harsh withal bloodshot and with no hint in them of the warm humanness she had been accustomed to see and feel in human eyes they were the true prison eyesthe eyes of a man who had learned to talk little who had forgotten almost how to talk  hello he said finally making no effort to change his position what game are you up to  his voice was gruff and husky and at first it had been harsh but it had softened queerly in a feeble attempt at forgotten kindliness  how do you do she said im not playing the sun was on your face and mamma says one oughtnt to sleep in the sun  the sweet clearness of her childs voice was pleasant to him and he wondered why he had never noticed it in childrens voices before he sat up slowly and stared at her he felt that he ought to say something but speech with him was a reluctant thing  i hope you slept well she said gravely  i sure did he answered never taking his eyes from her amazed at the fairness and delicacy of her how long was you holdin that contraption up over me  ooh she debated with herself a long long time i thought you would never wake up  and i thought you was a fairy when i first seen you  he felt elated at his contribution to the conversation  no not a fairy she smiled  he thrilled in a strange numb way at the immaculate whiteness of her small even teeth  i was just the good samaritan she added  i reckon i never heard of that party  he was cudgelling his brains to keep the conversation going never having been at close quarters with a child since he was mangrown he found it difficult  what a funny man not to know about the good samaritan dont you remember a certain man went down to jericho  i reckon ive been there he interrupted  i knew you were a traveller she cried clapping her hands maybe you saw the exact spot  what spot  why where he fell among thieves and was left half dead and then the good samaritan went to him and bound up his wounds and poured in oil and winewas that olive oil do you think  he shook his head slowly  i reckon you got me there olive oil is something the dagoes cooks with i never heard of it for busted heads  she considered his statement for a moment  well she announced we use olive oil in our cooking so we must be dagoes i never knew what they were before i thought it was slang  and the samaritan dumped oil on his head the tramp muttered reminiscently seems to me i recollect a sky pilot sayin something about that old gent dye know ive been looking for him offn on all my life and never scared up hide or hair of him they aint no more samaritans  wasnt i one she asked quickly  he looked at her steadily with a great curiosity and wonder her ear by a movement exposed to the sun was transparent it seemed he could almost see through it he was amazed at the delicacy of her colouring at the blue of her eyes at the dazzle of the suntouched golden hair and he was astounded by her fragility it came to him that she was easily broken his eye went quickly from his huge gnarled paw to her tiny hand in which it seemed to him he could almost see the blood circulate he knew the power in his muscles and he knew the tricks and turns by which men use their bodies to illtreat men in fact he knew little else and his mind for the time ran in its customary channel it was his way of measuring the beautiful strangeness of her he calculated a grip and not a strong one that could grind her little fingers to pulp he thought of fistblows he had given to mens heads and received on his own head and felt that the least of them could shatter hers like an eggshell he scanned her little shoulders and slim waist and knew in all certitude that with his two hands he could rend her to pieces  wasnt i one she insisted again  he came back to himself with a shockor away from himself as the case happened he was loth that the conversation should cease  what he answered oh yes you bet you was a samaritan even if you didnt have no olive oil he remembered what his mind had been dwelling on and asked but aint you afraid  she looked at him uncomprehendingly  of  of me he added lamely  she laughed merrily  mamma says never to be afraid of anything she says that if youre good and you think good of other people theyll be good too  and you was thinkin good of me when you kept the sun off he marvelled  but its hard to think good of bees and nasty crawly things she confessed  but theres men that is nasty and crawly things he argued  mamma says no she says theres good in every one  i bet you she locks the house up tight at night just the same he proclaimed triumphantly  but she doesnt mamma isnt afraid of anything thats why she lets me play out here alone when i want why we had a robber once mamma got right up and found him and what do you think he was only a poor hungry man and she got him plenty to eat from the pantry and afterward she got him work to do  ross shanklin was stunned the vista shown him of human nature was unthinkable it had been his lot to live in a world of suspicion and hatred of evilbelieving and evildoing it had been his experience slouching along village streets at nightfall to see little children screaming with fear run from him to their mothers he had even seen grown women shrink aside from him as he passed along the sidewalk  he was aroused by the girl clapping her hands as she cried out  i know what you are youre an open air crank thats why you were sleeping here in the grass  he felt a grim desire to laugh but repressed it  and thats what tramps areopen air cranks she continued i often wondered mamma believes in the open air i sleep on the porch at night so does she this is our land you must have climbed the fence mamma lets me when i put on my climberstheyre bloomers you know but you ought to be told something a person doesnt know when they snore because theyre asleep but you do worse than that you grit your teeth thats bad whenever you are going to sleep you must think to yourself i wont grit my teeth i wont grit my teeth over and over just like that and by and by youll get out of the habit  all bad things are habits and so are all good things and it depends on us what kind our habits are going to be i used to pucker my eyebrowswrinkle them all up but mamma said i must overcome that habit she said that when my eyebrows were wrinkled it was an advertisement that my brain was wrinkled inside and that it wasnt good to have wrinkles in the brain and then she smoothed my eyebrows with her hand and said i must always think smoothsmooth inside and smooth outside and do you know it was easy i havent wrinkled my brows for ever so long ive heard about filling teeth by thinking but i dont believe that neither does mamma  she paused rather out of breath nor did he speak her flow of talk had been too much for him also sleeping drunkenly with open mouth had made him very thirsty but rather than lose one precious moment he endured the torment of his scorching throat and mouth he licked his dry lips and struggled for speech  what is your name he managed at last  joan  she looked her own question at him and it was not necessary to voice it  mine is ross shanklin he volunteered for the first time in forgotten years giving his real name  i suppose youve travelled a lot  i sure have but not as much as i might have wanted to  papa always wanted to travel but he was too busy at the office he never could get much time he went to europe once with mamma that was before i was born it takes money to travel  ross shanklin did not know whether to agree with this statement or not  but it doesnt cost tramps much for expenses she took the thought away from him is that why you tramp  he nodded and licked his lips  mamma says its too bad that men must tramp to look for work but theres lots of work now in the country all the farmers in the valley are trying to get men have you been working  he shook his head angry with himself that he should feel shame at the confession when his savage reasoning told him he was right in despising work but this was followed by another thought this beautiful little creature was some mans child she was one of the rewards of work  i wish i had a little girl like you he blurted out stirred by a sudden consciousness of passion for paternity id work my hands off i  id do anything  she considered his case with fitting gravity  then you arent married  nobody would have me  yes they would if  she did not turn up her nose but she favoured his dirt and rags with a look of disapprobation he could not mistake  go on he halfshouted shoot it into me if i was washedif i wore good clothesif i was respectableif i had a job and worked regularif i wasnt what i am  to each statement she nodded  well i aint that kind he rushed on  im no good im a tramp i dont want to work thats what and i like dirt  her face was eloquent with reproach as she said then you were only making believe when you wished you had a little girl like me  this left him speechless for he knew in all the deeps of his newfound passion that that was just what he did want  with ready tact noting his discomfort she sought to change the subject  what do you think of god she asked  i aint never met him what do you think about him  his reply was evidently angry and she was frank in her disapproval  you are very strange she said you get angry so easily i never saw anybody before that got angry about god or work or being clean  he never done anything for me he muttered resentfully he cast back in quick review of the long years of toil in the convict camps and mines and work never done anything for me neither  an embarrassing silence fell  he looked at her numb and hungry with the stir of the fatherlove sorry for his ill temper puzzling his brain for something to say she was looking off and away at the clouds and he devoured her with his eyes he reached out stealthily and rested one grimy hand on the very edge of her little dress it seemed to him that she was the most wonderful thing in the world the quail still called from the coverts and the harvest sounds seemed abruptly to become very loud a great loneliness oppressed him  im  im no good he murmured huskily and repentantly  but beyond a glance from her blue eyes she took no notice the silence was more embarrassing than ever he felt that he could give the world just to touch with his lips that hem of her dress where his hand rested but he was afraid of frightening her he fought to find something to say licking his parched lips and vainly attempting to articulate something anything  this aint sonoma valley he declared finally this is fairy land and youre a fairy mebbe im asleep and dreaming i dont know you and me dont know how to talk together because you see youre a fairy and dont know nothing but good things and im a man from the bad wicked world  having achieved this much he was left gasping for ideas like a stranded fish  and youre going to tell me about the bad wicked world she cried clapping her hands im just dying to know  he looked at her startled remembering the wreckage of womanhood he had encountered on the sunken ways of life she was no fairy she was flesh and blood and the possibilities of wreckage were in her as they had been in him even when he lay at his mothers breast and there was in her eagerness to know  nope he said lightly this man from the bad wicked world aint going to tell you nothing of the kind hes going to tell you of the good things in that world hes going to tell you how he loved hosses when he was a shaver and about the first hoss he straddled and the first hoss he owned hosses aint like men theyre better theyre cleanclean all the way through and back again and little fairy i want to tell you one thingthere sure aint nothing in the world like when youre settin a tired hoss at the end of a long day and when you just speak and that tired animal lifts under you willing and hustles along hosses theyre my long suit i sure dote on hosses yep i used to be a cowboy once  she clapped her hands in the way that tore so delightfully to his heart and her eyes were dancing as she exclaimed  a texas cowboy i always wanted to see one i heard papa say once that cowboys are bowlegged are you  i sure was a texas cowboy he answered but it was a long time ago and im sure bowlegged you see you cant ride much when youre young and soft without getting the legs bent some why i was only a threeyearold when i begun he was a threeyearold too freshbroken i led him up alongside the fence clumb to the top rail and dropped on he was a pinto and a real devil at bucking but i could do anything with him i reckon he knowed i was only a little shaver some hosses knows lots more n you think  for half an hour ross shanklin rambled on with his horse reminiscences never unconscious for a moment of the supreme joy that was his through the touch of his hand on the hem of her dress the sun dropped slowly into the cloud bank the quail called more insistently and empty wagon after empty wagon rumbled back across the bridge then came a womans voice  joan joan it called where are you dear  the little girl answered and ross shanklin saw a woman clad in a soft clinging gown come through the gate from the bungalow she was a slender graceful woman and to his charmed eyes she seemed rather to float along than walk like ordinary flesh and blood  what have you been doing all afternoon the woman asked as she came up  talking mamma the little girl replied ive had a very interesting time  ross shanklin scrambled to his feet and stood watchfully and awkwardly the little girl took the mothers hand and she in turn looked at him frankly and pleasantly with a recognition of his humanness that was a new thing to him in his mind ran the thought the woman who aint afraid not a hint was there of the timidity he was accustomed to seeing in womens eyes and he was quite aware and never more so of his blearyeyed forbidding appearance  how do you do she greeted him sweetly and naturally  how do you do maam he responded unpleasantly conscious of the huskiness and rawness of his voice  and did you have an interesting time too she smiled  yes maam i sure did i was just telling your little girl about hosses  he was a cowboy once mamma she cried  the mother smiled her acknowledgment to him and looked fondly down at the little girl the thought that came into ross shanklins mind was the awfulness of the crime if any one should harm either of the wonderful pair this was followed by the wish that some terrible danger should threaten so that he could fight as he well knew how with all his strength and life to defend them  youll have to come along dear the mother said its growing late she looked at ross shanklin hesitantly would you care to have something to eat  no maam thanking you kindly just the same i  i aint hungry  then say goodbye joan she counselled  goodbye the little girl held out her hand and her eyes lighted roguishly goodbye mr man from the bad wicked world  to him the touch of her hand as he pressed it in his was the capstone of the whole adventure  goodbye little fairy he mumbled i reckon i got to be pullin along  but he did not pull along he stood staring after his vision until it vanished through the gate the day seemed suddenly empty he looked about him irresolutely then climbed the fence crossed the bridge and slouched along the road he was in a dream he did not note his feet nor the way they led him at times he stumbled in the dustfilled ruts  a mile farther on he aroused at the crossroads before him stood the saloon he came to a stop and stared at it licking his lips he sank his hand into his pants pocket and fumbled a solitary dime god he muttered god then with dragging reluctant feet went on along the road  he came to a big farm he knew it must be big because of the bigness of the house and the size and number of the barns and outbuildings on the porch in shirt sleeves smoking a cigar keeneyed and middleaged was the farmer  whats the chance for a job ross shanklin asked  the keen eyes scarcely glanced at him  a dollar a day and grub was the answer  ross shanklin swallowed and braced himself  ill pick grapes all right or anything but whats the chance for a steady job youve got a big ranch here i know hosses i was born on one i can drive team ride plough break do anything that anybody ever done with hosses  the other looked him over with an appraising incredulous eye  you dont look it was the judgment  i know i dont give me a chance thats all ill prove it  the farmer considered casting an anxious glance at the cloud bank into which the sun had sunk  im short a teamster and ill give you the chance to make good go and get supper with the hands  ross shanklins voice was very husky and be spoke with an effort  all right ill make good where can i get a drink of water and wash up     the prodigal father  i   josiah childs was ordinarily an ordinaryappearing prosperous business man he wore a sixtydollar businessmans suit his shoes were comfortable and seemly and made from the current last his tie collars and cuffs were just what all prosperous business men wore and an uptodate businessmans derby was his wildest adventure in headgear oakland california is no sleepy country town and josiah childs as the leading grocer of a rushing western metropolis of three hundred thousand appropriately lived acted and dressed the part  but on this morning before the rush of custom began his appearance at the store while it did not cause a riot was sufficiently startling to impair for half an hour the staffs working efficiency he nodded pleasantly to the two delivery drivers loading their wagons for the first trip of the morning and cast upward the inevitable complacent glance at the sign that ran across the front of the buildingchilds cash store the lettering not too large was of dignified black and gold suggestive of noble spices aristocratic condiments and everything of the best which was no more than to be expected of a scale of prices ten per cent higher than any other grocery in town but what josiah childs did not see as he turned his back on the drivers and entered was the helpless and mutual fall of surprise those two worthies perpetrated on each others necks they clung together for support  did you catch the kicks bill one moaned  did you pipe the headpiece bill moaned back  now if he was goin to a masquerade ball  or attendin a reunion of the rough riders  or goin huntin bear  or swearin off his taxes  instead of goin all the way to the effete eastmonkton says hes going clear to boston  the two drivers held each other apart at arms length and fell limply together again  for josiah childs outfit was all their actions connotated his hat was a light fawn stiffrimmed john b stetson circled by a band of mexican stamped leather over a blue flannel shirt set off by a drooping windsor tie was a roughandready coat of largeribbed corduroy pants of the same material were thrust into highlaced shoes of the sort worn by surveyors explorers and linemen  a clerk at a near counter almost petrified at sight of his employers bizarre rig monkton recently elevated to the managership gasped swallowed and maintained his imperturbable attentiveness the lady bookkeeper glancing down from her glass eyrie on the inside balcony took one look and buried her giggles in the day book josiah childs saw most of all this but he did not mind he was starting on his vacation and his head and heart were buzzing with plans and anticipations of the most adventurous vacation he had taken in ten years under his eyelids burned visions of east falls connecticut and of all the home scenes he had been born to and brought up in oakland he was thoroughly aware was more modern than east falls and the excitement caused by his garb was only to be expected undisturbed by the sensation he knew he was creating among his employ√©s he moved about accompanied by his manager making last suggestions giving final instructions and radiating fond farewell glances at all the loved details of the business he had built out of nothing  he had a right to be proud of childs cash store twelve years before he had landed in oakland with fourteen dollars and fortythree cents cents did not circulate so far west and after the fourteen dollars were gone he continued to carry the three pennies in his pocket for a weary while later when he had got a job clerking in a small grocery for eleven dollars a week and had begun sending a small monthly postal order to one agatha childs east falls connecticut he invested the three coppers in postage stamps uncle sam could not reject his own lawful coin of the realm  having spent all his life in cramped new england where sharpness and shrewdness had been whetted to razoredge on the harsh stone of meagre circumstance he had found himself abruptly in the loose and freeandeasy west where men thought in thousanddollar bills and newsboys dropped dead at sight of copper cents josiah childs bit like fresh acid into the new industrial and business conditions he had vision he saw so many ways of making money all at once that at first his brain was in a whirl  at the same time being sane and conservative he had resolutely avoided speculation the solid and substantial called to him clerking at eleven dollars a week he took note of the lost opportunities of the openings for safe enterprise of the countless leaks in the business if despite all this the boss could make a good living what couldnt he josiah childs do with his connecticut training it was like a bottle of wine to a thirsty hermit this coming to the active generousspending west after thirtyfive years in east falls the last fifteen of which had been spent in humdrum clerking in the humdrum east falls general store josiah childs head buzzed with the easy possibilities he saw but he did not lose his head no detail was overlooked he spent his spare hours in studying oakland its people how they made their money and why they spent it and where he walked the central streets watching the drift of the buying crowds even counting them and compiling the statistics in various notebooks he studied the general credit system of the trade and the particular credit systems of the different districts he could tell to a dot the average wage or salary earned by the householders of any locality and he made it a point of thoroughness to know every locality from the waterfront slums to the aristocratic lake merritt and piedmont sections from west oakland where dwelt the railroad employ√©s to the semifarmers of fruitvale at the opposite end of the city  broadway on the main street and in the very heart of the shopping district where no grocer had ever been insane enough to dream of establishing a business was his ultimate selection but that required money while he had to start from the smallest of beginnings his first store was on lower filbert where lived the nailworkers in half a year three other little corner groceries went out of business while he was compelled to enlarge his premises he understood the principle of large sales at small profits of stable qualities of goods and of a square deal he had glimpsed also the secret of advertising each week he set forth one article that sold at a loss to him this was not an advertised loss but an absolute loss his one clerk prophesied impending bankruptcy when butter that cost childs thirty cents was sold for twentyfive cents when twentytwocent coffee was passed across the counter at eighteen cents the neighbourhood housewives came for these bargains and remained to buy other articles that sold at a profit moreover the whole neighbourhood came quickly to know josiah childs and the busy crowd of buyers in his store was an attraction in itself  but josiah childs made no mistake he knew the ultimate foundation on which his prosperity rested he studied the nail works until he came to know as much about them as the managing directors before the first whisper had stirred abroad he sold his store and with a modest sum of ready cash went in search of a new location six months later the nail works closed down and closed down forever  his next store was established on adeline street where lived a comfortable salaried class here his shelves carried a highergrade and a more diversified stock by the same old method he drew his crowd he established a delicatessen counter he dealt directly with the farmers so that his butter and eggs were not only always dependable but were a shade better than those sold by the finest groceries in the city one of his specialties was boston baked beans and so popular did it become that the twin cabin bakery paid him better than handsomely for the privilege of taking it over he made time to study the farmers the very apples they grew and certain farmers he taught how properly to make cider as a sideline his new england apple cider proved his greatest success and before long after he had invaded san francisco berkeley and alameda he ran it as an independent business  but always his eyes were fixed on broadway only one other intermediate move did he make which was to as near as he could get to the ashland park tract where every purchaser of land was legally pledged to put up no home that should cost less than four thousand dollars after that came broadway a strange swirl had come in the tide of the crowd the drift was to washington street where real estate promptly soared while on broadway it was as if the bottom had fallen out one big store after another as the leases expired moved to washington  the crowd will come back josiah childs said but he said it to himself he knew the crowd oakland was growing and he knew why it was growing washington street was too narrow to carry the increasing traffic along broadway in the physical nature of things the electric cars ever in greater numbers would have to run the realty dealers said that the crowd would never come back while the leading merchants followed the crowd and then it was at a ridiculously low figure that josiah childs got a long lease on a modern class a building on broadway with a buying option at a fixed price it was the beginning of the end for broadway said the realty dealers when a grocery was established in its erstwhile sacred midst later when the crowd did come back they said josiah childs was lucky also they whispered among themselves that he had cleared at least fifty thousand on the transaction  it was an entirely different store from his previous ones there were no more bargains everything was of the superlative best and superlative best prices were charged he catered to the most expensive trade in town only those who could carelessly afford to pay ten per cent more than anywhere else patronised him and so excellent was his service that they could not afford to go elsewhere his horses and delivery wagons were more expensive and finer than any one elses in town he paid his drivers and clerks and bookkeepers higher wages than any other store could dream of paying as a result he got more efficient men and they rendered him and his patrons a more satisfying service in short to deal at childs cash store became almost the infallible index of social status  to cap everything came the great san francisco earthquake and fire which caused one hundred thousand people abruptly to come across the bay and live in oakland not least to profit from so extraordinary a boom was josiah childs and now after twelve years absence he was departing on a visit to east falls connecticut in the twelve years he had not received a letter from agatha nor had he seen even a photograph of his and agathas boy  agatha and he had never got along together agatha was masterful agatha had a tongue she was strong on oldfashioned morality she was unlovely in her rectitude josiah never could quite make out how he had happened to marry her she was two years his senior and had long ranked as an old maid she had taught school and was known by the young generation as the sternest disciplinarian in its experience she had become set in her ways and when she married it was merely an exchange of a number of pupils for one josiah had to stand the hectoring and nagging that thitherto had been distributed among many as to how the marriage came about his uncle isaac nearly hit it off one day when he said in confidence josiah when agatha married you it was a case of marrying a struggling young man i reckon you was overpowered or maybe you broke your leg and couldnt get away  uncle isaac josiah answered i didnt break my leg i ran my dangdest but she just plum run me down and out of breath  strong in the wind eh uncle isaac chuckled  weve ben married five years now josiah agreed and ive never known her to lose it  and never will uncle isaac added  this conversation had taken place in the last days and so dismal an outlook proved too much for josiah childs meek he was under agathas firm tuition but he was very healthy and his promise of life was too long for his patience he was only thirtythree and he came of a longlived stock thirtythree more years with agatha and agathas nagging was too hideous to contemplate so between a sunset and a rising josiah childs disappeared from east falls and from that day for twelve years he had received no letter from her not that it was her fault he had carefully avoided letting her have his address his first postal money orders were sent to her from oakland but in the years that followed he had arranged his remittances so that they bore the scattered postmarks of most of the states west of the rockies  but twelve years and the confidence born of deserved success had softened his memories after all she was the mother of his boy and it was incontestable that she had always meant well besides he was not working so hard now and he had more time to think of things besides his business he wanted to see the boy whom he had never seen and who had turned three before his father ever learned he was a father then too homesickness had begun to crawl in him in a dozen years he had not seen snow and he was always wondering if new england fruits and berries had not a finer tang than those of california through hazy vistas he saw the old new england life and he wanted to see it again in the flesh before he died  and finally there was duty agatha was his wife he would bring her back with him to the west he felt that he could stand it he was a man now in the world of men he ran things instead of being run and agatha would quickly find it out nevertheless he wanted agatha to come to him for his own sake so it was that he had put on his frontier rig he would be the prodigal father returning as penniless as when he left and it would be up to her whether or not she killed the fatted calf empty of hand and looking it he would come back wondering if he could get his old job in the general store whatever followed would be agathas affair  by the time he said goodbye to his staff and emerged on the sidewalk five more of his delivery wagons were backed up and loading  he ran his eye proudly over them took a last fond glance at the blackandgold letters and signalled the electric car at the corner   ii  he ran up to east falls from new york in the pullman smoker he became acquainted with several business men the conversation turning on the west was quickly led by him as president of the oakland chamber of commerce he was an authority his words carried weight and he knew what he was talking about whether it was asiatic trade the panama canal or the japanese coolie question it was very exhilarating this stimulus of respectful attention accorded him by these prosperous eastern men and before he knew it he was at east falls  he was the only person who alighted and the station was deserted nobody was there expecting anybody the long twilight of a january evening was beginning and the bite of the keen air made him suddenly conscious that his clothing was saturated with tobacco smoke he shuddered involuntarily agatha did not tolerate tobacco he halfmoved to toss the freshlighted cigar away then it was borne in upon him that this was the old east falls atmosphere overpowering him and he resolved to combat it thrusting the cigar between his teeth and gripping it with the firmness of a dozen years of western resolution  a few steps brought him into the little main street the chilly stilted aspect of it shocked him everything seemed frosty and pinched just as the cutting air did after the warm balminess of california only several persons strangers to his recollection were abroad and they favoured him with incurious glances they were wrapped in an uncongenial and frosty imperviousness his first impression was surprise at his surprise through the wide perspective of twelve years of western life he had consistently and steadily discounted the size and importance of east falls but this was worse than all discounting things were more meagre than he had dreamed the general store took his breath away countless myriads of times he had contrasted it with his own spacious emporium but now he saw that in justice he had overdone it he felt certain that it could not accommodate two of his delicatessen counters and he knew that he could lose all of it in one of his storerooms  he took the familiar turning to the right at the head of the street and as he plodded along the slippery walk he decided that one of the first things he must do was to buy sealskin cap and gloves the thought of sleighing cheered him for a moment until now on the outskirts of the village he was sanitarily perturbed by the adjacency of dwelling houses and barns some were even connected cruel memories of bitter morning chores oppressed him the thought of chapped hands and chilblains was almost terrifying and his heart sank at sight of the double stormwindows which he knew were solidly fastened and unraisable while the small ventilating panes the size of ladies handkerchiefs smote him with sensations of suffocation agathall like california he thought calling to his mind visions of roses in dazzling sunshine and the wealth of flowers that bloomed the twelve months round  and then quite illogically the years were bridged and the whole leaden weight of east falls descended upon him like a damp sea fog he fought it from him thrusting it off and aside by sentimental thoughts on the honest snow the fine elms the sturdy new england spirit and the great homecoming but at sight of agathas house he wilted before he knew it with a recrudescent guilty pang he had tossed the halfsmoked cigar away and slackened his pace until his feet dragged in the old lifeless east falls manner he tried to remember that he was the owner of childs cash store accustomed to command whose words were listened to with respect in the employers association and who wielded the gavel at the meetings of the chamber of commerce he strove to conjure visions of the letters in black and gold and of the string of delivery wagons backed up to the sidewalk but agathas new england spirit was as sharp as the frost and it travelled to him through solid housewalls and across the intervening hundred yards  then he became aware that despite his will he had thrown the cigar away this brought him an awful vision he saw himself going out in the frost to the woodshed to smoke his memory of agatha he found less softened by the lapse of years than it had been when three thousand miles intervened it was unthinkable no he couldnt do it he was too old too used to smoking all over the house to do the woodshed stunt now and everything depended on how he began he would put his foot down he would smoke in the house that very night  in the kitchen he feebly amended no by george he would smoke now he would arrive smoking mentally imprecating the cold he exposed his bare hands and lighted another cigar his manhood seemed to flare up with the match he would show her who was boss right from the drop of the hat he would show her  josiah childs had been born in this house and it was long before he was born that his father had built it across the low stone fence josiah could see the kitchen porch and door the connected woodshed and the several outbuildings fresh from the west where everything was new and in constant flux he was astonished at the lack of change everything was as it had always been he could almost see himself a boy doing the chores there in the woodshed how many cords of wood had he bucksawed and split well thank the lord that was past  the walk to the kitchen showed signs of recent snowshovelling that had been one of his tasks he wondered who did it now and suddenly remembered that his own son must be twelve in another moment he would have knocked at the kitchen door but the skreek of a bucksaw from the woodshed led him aside he looked in and saw a boy hard at work evidently this was his son impelled by the wave of warm emotion that swept over him he all but rushed in upon the lad he controlled himself with an effort  father here he asked curtly though from under the stiff brim of his john b stetson he studied the boy closely  sizable for his age he thought a mite spare in the ribs maybe and that possibly due to rapid growth but the face strong and pleasing and the eyes like uncle isaacs when all was said a darn good sample  no sir the boy answered resting on the sawbuck  where is he  at sea was the answer  josiah childs felt a something very akin to relief and joy tingle through him agatha had married againevidently a seafaring man next came an ominous creepy sensation agatha had committed bigamy he remembered enoch arden read aloud to the class by the teacher in the old schoolhouse and began to think of himself as a hero he would do the heroic by george he would he would sneak away and get the first train for california she would never know  but there was agathas new england morality and her new england conscience she received a regular remittance she knew he was alive it was impossible that she could have done this thing he groped wildly for a solution perhaps she had sold the old home and this boy was somebody elses boy  what is your name josiah asked  johnnie came the reply  last name i mean  childs johnnie childs  and your fathers namefirst name  josiah childs  and hes away at sea you say  yes sir  this set josiah wondering again  what kind of a man is he  oh hes all righta good provider mom says and he is he always sends his money home and he works hard for it too mom says she says he always was a good worker and hes bettern other men she ever saw he dont smoke or drink or swear or do anything he oughtnt and he never did he was always that way mom says and she knew him all her life before ever they got married hes a very kind man and never hurts anybodys feelings mom says hes the most considerate man she ever knew  josiahs heart went weak agatha had done it after allhad taken a second husband when she knew her first was still alive well he had learned charity in the west and he could be charitable he would go quietly away nobody would ever know though it was rather mean of her the thought flashed through him that she should go on cashing his remittances when she was married to so model and steadyworking a seafaring husband who brought his wages home he cudgelled his brains in an effort to remember such a man out of all the east falls men he had known  whats he look like  dont know never saw him hes at sea all the time but i know how tall he is mom says im goin to be biggern him and he was five feet eleven theres a picture of him in the album his face is thin and he has whiskers  a great illumination came to josiah he was himself five feet eleven he had worn whiskers and his face had been thin in those days and johnnie had said his fathers name was josiah childs he josiah was this model husband who neither smoked swore nor drank he was this seafaring man whose memory had been so carefully shielded by agathas forgiving fiction he warmed toward her she must have changed mightily since he left he glowed with penitence then his heart sank as he thought of trying to live up to this reputation agatha had made for him this boy with the trusting blue eyes would expect it of him well hed have to do it agatha had been almighty square with him he hadnt thought she had it in her  the resolve he might there and then have taken was doomed never to be for he heard the kitchen door open to give vent to a womans nagging irritable voice  johnnieyou it cried  how often had he heard it in the old days josiahyou a shiver went through him involuntarily automatically with a guilty start he turned his hand back upward so that the cigar was hidden he felt himself shrinking and shrivelling as she stepped out on the stoop it was his unchanged wife the same shrew wrinkles with the same sourdrooping corners to the thinlipped mouth but there was more sourness an added droop the lips were thinner and the shrew wrinkles were deeper she swept josiah with a hostile withering stare  do you think your father would stop work to talk to tramps she demanded of the boy who visibly quailed even as josiah  i was only answering his questions johnnie pleaded doggedly but hopelessly he wanted to know  and i suppose you told him she snapped what business is it of his prying around no and he gets nothing to eat as for you get to work at once ill teach you idling at your chores your father want like that cant i ever make you like him  johnnie bent his back and the bucksaw resumed its protesting skreek agatha surveyed josiah sourly it was patent she did not recognise him  you be off she commanded harshly none of your snooping around here  josiah felt the numbness of paralysis creeping over him he moistened his lips and tried to say something but found himself bereft of speech  you be off i say she rasped in her highkeyed voice or ill put the constable after you  josiah turned obediently he heard the door slam as he went down the walk as in a nightmare he opened the gate he had opened ten thousand times and stepped out on the sidewalk he felt dazed surely it was a dream very soon he would wake up with a sigh of relief he rubbed his forehead and paused indecisively the monotonous complaint of the bucksaw came to his ears if that boy had any of the old childs spirit in him sooner or later hed run away agatha was beyond the endurance of human flesh she had not changed unless for the worse if such a thing were possible that boy would surely run for it maybe soon maybe now  josiah childs straightened up and threw his shoulders back the greatspirited west with its daring and its carelessness of consequences when mere obstacles stand in the way of its desire flamed up in him he looked at his watch remembered the time table and spoke to himself solemnly aloud it was an affirmation of faith  i dont care a hang about the law that boy cant be crucified ill give her a double allowance four times anything but he goes with me she can follow on to california if she wants but ill draw up an agreement in which whats what and shell sign it and live up to it by george if she wants to stay and she will he added grimly shes got to have somebody to nag  he opened the gate and strode back to the woodshed door johnnie looked up but kept on sawing  whatd you like to do most of anything in the world josiah demanded in a tense low voice  johnnie hesitated and almost stopped sawing josiah made signs for him to keep it up  go to sea johnnie answered along with my father  josiah felt himself trembling  would you he asked eagerly  would i  the look of joy on johnnies face decided everything  come here then listen im your father im josiah childs did you ever want to run away  johnnie nodded emphatically  thats what i did josiah went on i ran away he fumbled for his watch hurriedly weve just time to catch the train for california i live there now maybe agatha your mother will come along afterward ill tell you all about it on the train come on  he gathered the halffrightened halftrusting boy into his arms for a moment then hand in hand they fled across the yard out of the gate and down the street they heard the kitchen door open and the last they heard was  johnnieyou why aint you sawing ill attend to your case directly     the first poet   scene a summer plain the eastern side of which is bounded by grassy hills of limestone the other sides by a forest the hill nearest to the plain terminates in a cliff in the face of which nearly at the level of the ground are four caves with low narrow entrances before the caves and distant from them less than one hundred feet is a broad flat rock on which are laid several sharp slivers of flint which like the rock are bloodstained between the rock and the caveentrances on a low pile of stones is squatted a man stout and hairy across his knees is a thick club and behind him crouches a woman at his right and left are two men somewhat resembling him and like him bearing wooden clubs these four face the west and between them and the bloody rock squat some threescore of cavefolk talking loudly among themselves it is late afternoon the name of him on the pile of stones is uk the name of his mate ala and of those at his right and left ok and un  uk  be still  turning to the woman behind him  thou seest that they become still none save me can make his kind be still except perhaps the chief of the apes when in the night he deems he hears a serpent at whom dost thou stare so long at oan oan come to me  oan  i am thy cub  uk  oan thou art a fool  ok and un  ho ho oan is a fool  all the tribe  ho ho oan is a fool  oan  why am i a fool  uk  dost thou not chant strange words last night i heard thee chant strange words at the mouth of thy cave  oan  ay they are marvellous words they were born within me in the dark  uk  art thou a woman that thou shouldst bring forth why dost thou not sleep when it is dark  oan  i did half sleep perhaps i dreamed  uk  and why shouldst thou dream not having had more than thy portion of flesh hast thou slain a deer in the forest and brought it not to the stone  all the tribe  wa wa he hath slain in the forest and brought not the meat to the stone  uk  be still ye  to ala  thou seest that they become still oan hast thou slain and kept to thyself  oan  nay thou knowest that i am not apt at the chase also it irks me to squat on a branch all day above a path bearing a rock upon my thighs those words did but awaken within me when i was peaceless in the night  uk  and why wast thou peaceless in the night  oan  thy mate wept for that thou didst heat her  uk  ay she lamented loudly but thou shalt make thy halfsleep henceforth at the mouth of the cave so that when gurr the tiger cometh thou shalt hear him sniff between the boulders and shalt strike the flints whose stare he hatest gurr cometh nightly to the caves  one of the tribe  ay gurr smelleth the stone  uk  be still  to ala  had he not become still ok and un would have beaten him with their clubs but oan tell us those words that were born to thee when ala did weep  oan arising  they are wonderful words they are such      the bright day is gone  uk  now i see thou art liar as well as fool behold the day is not gone  oan  but the day was gone in that hour when my song was born to me  uk  then shouldst thou have sung it only at that time and not when it is yet day but beware lest thou awaken me in the night make thou many stars that they fly in the whiskers of gurr  oan  my song is even of stars  uk  it was ul thy fathers wont ere i slew him with four great stones to climb to the tops of the tallest trees and reach forth his hand to see if he might not pluck a star but i said perhaps they be as chestnutburs and all the tribe did laugh ul was also a fool but what dost thou sing of stars  oan  i will begin again      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sad sad sad  uk  nay the night maketh thee sad not sad sad sad for when i say to ala gather thou dried leaves i say not gather thou dried leaves leaves leaves thou art a fool  ok and un  thou art a fool  all the tribe  thou art a fool  uk  yea he is a fool but say on oan and tell us of thy chestnutburs  oan  i will begin again      the bright day is gone  uk  thou dost not say gone gone gone  oan  i am thy cub suffer that i speak so shall the tribe admire greatly  uk  speak on  oan  i will begin once more      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sad sad  uk  said i not that sad should be spoken but once shall i set ok and un upon thee with their branches  oan  but it was so born within meeven sad sad  uk  if again thou twice or thrice say sad thou shalt be dragged to the stone  oan  owl ow i am thy cub yet listen      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sad  ow ow thou makest me more sad than the night doth the song  uk  ok un be prepared  oan hastily  nay have mercy i will begin afresh      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sad     thethethe  uk  thou hast forgotten and art a fool see ala he is a fool  ok and un  he is a fool  all the tribe  he is a fool  oan  i am not a fool this is a new thing in the past when ye did chant o men ye did leap about the stone beating your breasts and crying hai hai hai or if the moon was great hai hai hai hai hai but this song is made even with such words as ye do speak and is a great wonder one may sit at the caves mouth and moan it many times as the light goeth out of the sky  one of the tribe  ay even thus doth he sit at the mouth of our cave making us marvel and more especially the women  uk  be still when i would make women marvel i do show them a wolfs brains upon my club or the great stone that i cast or perhaps do whirl my arms mightily or bring home much meat how should a man do otherwise i will have no songs in this place  oan  yet suffer that i sing my song unto the tribe such things have not been before it may be that they shall praise thee seeing that i who do make this song am thy cub  uk  well let us have the song  oan facing the tribe      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sasad     but the stars are very white     they whisper that the day shall return     o stars little pieces of the day  uk  this is indeed madness hast thou heard a star whisper did ul thy father tell thee that he heard the stars whisper when he was in the treetop and of what moment is it that a star be a piece of the day seeing that its light is of no value thou art a fool  ok and un  thou art a fool  all the tribe  thou art a fool  oan  but it was so born unto me and at that birth it was as though i would weep yet had not been stricken i was moreover glad yet none had given me a gift of meat  uk  it is a madness how shall the stars profit us will they lead us to a bears den or where the deer foregather or break for us great bones that we come at their marrow will they tell us anything at all wait thou until the night and we shall peer forth from between the boulders and all men shall take note that the stars cannot whisper yet it may be that they are pieces of the day this is a deep matter  oan  ay they are pieces of the moon  uk  what further madness is this how shall they be pieces of two things that are not the same also it was not thus in the song  oan  i will make me a new song we do change the shape of wood and stone but a song is made out of nothing ho ho i can fashion things from nothing also i say that the stars come down at morning and become the dew  uk  let us have no more of these stars it may be that a song is a good thing if it be of what a man knoweth thus if thou singest of my club or of the bear that i slew of the stain on the stone or the cave and the warm leaves in the cave it might be well  oan  i will make thee a song of ala  uk furiously  thou shalt make me no such song thou shalt make me a song of the deerliver that thou hast eaten did i not give to thee of the liver of the shedeer because thou didst bring me crawfish  oan  truly i did eat of the liver of the shedeer but to sing thereof is another matter  uk  it was no labour for thee to sing of the stars see now our clubs and castingstones with which we slay flesh to eat also the caves in which we dwell and the stone whereon we make sacrifice wilt thou sing no song of those  oan  it may be that i shall sing thee songs of them but now as i strive here to sing of the does liver no words are born unto me i can but sing o liver o red liver  uk  that is a good song thou seest that the liver is red it is red as blood  oan  but i love not the liver save to eat of it  uk  yet the song of it is good when the moon is full we shall sing it about the stone we shall beat upon our breasts and sing o liver o red liver and all the women in the caves shall be affrightened  oan  i will not have that song of the liver it shall be oks song the tribe must say ok hath made the song  ok  ay i shall be a great singer i shall sing of a wolfs heart and say behold it is red  uk  thou art a fool and shalt sing only hai hai as thy father before thee but oan shall make me a song of my club for the women listen to his songs  oan  i will make thee no songs neither of thy club nor thy cave nor thy doesliver yea though thou give me no more flesh yet will i live alone in the forest and eat the seed of grasses and likewise rabbits that are easily snared and i will sleep in a treetop and i will sing nightly      the bright day is gone     the night maketh me sad sad sad                      sad sad sad  uk  ok and un arise and slay  ok and un rush upon oan who stoops and picks up two castingstones with one of which he strikes ok between the eyes and with the other mashes the hand of un so that he drops his club uk arises  uk  behold gurr cometh he cometh swiftly from the wood  the tribe including oan and ala rush for the cavemouths as oan passes uk the latter runs behind oan and crushes his skull with a blow of his club  uk  o men o men with the heart of hyenas behold gurr cometh not i did but strive to deceive you that i might the more easily slay this singer who is very swift of foot gather ye before me for i would speak wisdom it is not well that there be any song among us other than what our fathers sang in the past or if there be songs let them be of such matters as are of common understanding if a man sing of a deer so shall he be drawn it may be to go forth and slay a deer or even a moose and if he sing of his castingstones it may be that he become more apt in the use thereof and if he sing of his cave it may be that he shall defend it more stoutly when gurr teareth at the boulders but it is a vain thing to make songs of the stars that seem scornful even of me or of the moon which is never two nights the same or of the day which goeth about its business and will not linger though one pierce a shebabe with a flint but as for me i would have none of these songs for if i sing of such in the council how shall i keep my wits and if i think thereof when at the chase it may be that i babble it forth and the meat hear and escape and ere it be time to eat i do give my mind solely to the care of my huntinggear and if one sing when eating he may fall short of his just portion and when one hath eaten doth not he go straightway to sleep so where shall men find a space for singing but do ye as ye will as for me i will have none of these songs and stars  be it also known to all the women that if remembering these wild words of oan they do sing them to themselves or teach them to the young ones they shall be beaten with brambles cause swiftly that the wife of ok cease from her wailing and bring hither the horses that were slain yesterday that i may apportion them had oan wisdom he might have eaten thereof and had a mammoth fallen into our pit he might have feasted many days but oan was a fool  un  oan was a fool  all the tribe  oan was a fool     finis   it was the last of morgansons bacon in all his life he had never pampered his stomach in fact his stomach had been a sort of negligible quantity that bothered him little and about which he thought less but now in the long absence of wonted delights the keen yearning of his stomach was tickled hugely by the sharp salty bacon  his face had a wistful hungry expression the cheeks were hollow and the skin seemed stretched a trifle tightly across the cheekbones his pale blue eyes were troubled there was that in them that showed the haunting imminence of something terrible doubt was in them and anxiety and foreboding the thin lips were thinner than they were made to be and they seemed to hunger towards the polished fryingpan  he sat back and drew forth a pipe he looked into it with sharp scrutiny and tapped it emptily on his open palm he turned the hairseal tobacco pouch inside out and dusted the lining treasuring carefully each flake and mite of tobacco that his efforts gleaned the result was scarce a thimbleful he searched in his pockets and brought forward between thumb and forefinger tiny pinches of rubbish here and there in this rubbish were crumbs of tobacco these he segregated with microscopic care though he occasionally permitted small particles of foreign substance to accompany the crumbs to the hoard in his palm he even deliberately added small semihard woolly fluffs that had come originally from the coat lining and that had lain for long months in the bottoms of the pockets  at the end of fifteen minutes he had the pipe part filled he lighted it from the camp fire and sat forward on the blankets toasting his moccasined feet and smoking parsimoniously when the pipe was finished he sat on brooding into the dying flame of the fire slowly the worry went out of his eyes and resolve came in out of the chaos of his fortunes he had finally achieved a way but it was not a pretty way his face had become stern and wolfish and the thin lips were drawn very tightly  with resolve came action he pulled himself stiffly to his feet and proceeded to break camp he packed the rolled blankets the fryingpan rifle and axe on the sled and passed a lashing around the load then he warmed his hands at the fire and pulled on his mittens he was footsore and limped noticeably as he took his place at the head of the sled when he put the looped haulrope over his shoulder and leant his weight against it to start the sled he winced his flesh was galled by many days of contact with the haulrope  the trail led along the frozen breast of the yukon at the end of four hours he came around a bend and entered the town of minto it was perched on top of a high earth bank in the midst of a clearing and consisted of a road house a saloon and several cabins he left his sled at the door and entered the saloon  enough for a drink he asked laying an apparently empty gold sack upon the bar  the barkeeper looked sharply at it and him then set out a bottle and a glass  never mind the dust he said  go on and take it morganson insisted  the barkeeper held the sack mouth downward over the scales and shook it and a few flakes of gold dust fell out morganson took the sack from him turned it inside out and dusted it carefully  i thought there was halfadollar in it he said  not quite answered the other but near enough ill get it back with the down weight on the next comer  morganson shyly poured the whisky into the glass partly filling it  go on make it a mans drink the barkeeper encouraged  morganson tilted the bottle and filled the glass to the brim he drank the liquor slowly pleasuring in the fire of it that bit his tongue sank hotly down his throat and with warm gentle caresses permeated his stomach  scurvy eh the barkeeper asked  a touch of it he answered but i havent begun to swell yet maybe i can get to dyea and fresh vegetables and beat it out  kind of all in id say the other laughed sympathetically no dogs no money and the scurvy id try spruce tea if i was you  at the end of halfanhour morganson said goodbye and left the saloon he put his galled shoulder to the haulrope and took the rivertrail south an hour later he halted an inviting swale left the river and led off to the right at an acute angle he left his sled and limped up the swale for half a mile between him and the river was three hundred yards of flat ground covered with cottonwoods he crossed the cottonwoods to the bank of the yukon the trail went by just beneath but he did not descend to it south toward selkirk he could see the trail widen its sunken length through the snow for over a mile but to the north in the direction of minto a treecovered outjut in the bank a quarter of a mile away screened the trail from him  he seemed satisfied with the view and returned to the sled the way he had come he put the haulrope over his shoulder and dragged the sled up the swale the snow was unpacked and soft and it was hard work the runners clogged and stuck and he was panting severely ere he had covered the halfmile night had come on by the time he had pitched his small tent set up the sheetiron stove and chopped a supply of firewood he had no candles and contented himself with a pot of tea before crawling into his blankets  in the morning as soon as he got up he drew on his mittens pulled the flaps of his cap down over his ears and crossed through the cottonwoods to the yukon he took his rifle with him as before he did not descend the bank he watched the empty trail for an hour beating his hands and stamping his feet to keep up the circulation then returned to the tent for breakfast there was little tea left in the canisterhalf a dozen drawings at most but so meagre a pinch did he put in the teapot that he bade fair to extend the lifetime of the tea indefinitely his entire food supply consisted of halfasack of flour and a partfull can of baking powder he made biscuits and ate them slowly chewing each mouthful with infinite relish when he had had three he called a halt he debated a while reached for another biscuit then hesitated he turned to the part sack of flour lifted it and judged its weight  im good for a couple of weeks he spoke aloud  maybe three he added as he put the biscuits away  again he drew on his mittens pulled down his earflaps took the rifle and went out to his station on the river bank he crouched in the snow himself unseen and watched after a few minutes of inaction the frost began to bite in and he rested the rifle across his knees and beat his hands back and forth then the sting in his feet became intolerable and he stepped back from the bank and tramped heavily up and down among the trees but he did not tramp long at a time every several minutes he came to the edge of the bank and peered up and down the trail as though by sheer will he could materialise the form of a man upon it the short morning passed though it had seemed centurylong to him and the trail remained empty  it was easier in the afternoon watching by the bank the temperature rose and soon the snow began to falldry and fine and crystalline there was no wind and it fell straight down in quiet monotony he crouched with eyes closed his head upon his knees keeping his watch upon the trail with his ears but no whining of dogs churning of sleds nor cries of drivers broke the silence with twilight he returned to the tent cut a supply of firewood ate two biscuits and crawled into his blankets he slept restlessly tossing about and groaning and at midnight he got up and ate another biscuit  each day grew colder four biscuits could not keep up the heat of his body despite the quantities of hot spruce tea he drank and he increased his allowance morning and evening to three biscuits in the middle of the day he ate nothing contenting himself with several cups of excessively weak real tea this programme became routine in the morning three biscuits at noon real tea and at night three biscuits in between he drank spruce tea for his scurvy he caught himself making larger biscuits and after a severe struggle with himself went back to the old size  on the fifth day the trail returned to life to the south a dark object appeared and grew larger morganson became alert he worked his rifle ejecting a loaded cartridge from the chamber by the same action replacing it with another and returning the ejected cartridge into the magazine he lowered the trigger to halfcock and drew on his mitten to keep the triggerhand warm as the dark object came nearer he made it out to be a man without dogs or sled travelling light he grew nervous cocked the trigger then put it back to halfcock again the man developed into an indian and morganson with a sigh of disappointment dropped the rifle across his knees the indian went on past and disappeared towards minto behind the outjutting clump of trees  but morganson conceived an idea he changed his crouching spot to a place where cottonwood limbs projected on either side of him into these with his axe he chopped two broad notches then in one of the notches he rested the barrel of his rifle and glanced along the sights he covered the trail thoroughly in that direction he turned about rested the rifle in the other notch and looking along the sights swept the trail to the clump of trees behind which it disappeared  he never descended to the trail a man travelling the trail could have no knowledge of his lurking presence on the bank above the snow surface was unbroken there was no place where his tracks left the main trail  as the nights grew longer his periods of daylight watching of the trail grew shorter once a sled went by with jingling bells in the darkness and with sullen resentment he chewed his biscuits and listened to the sounds chance conspired against him faithfully he had watched the trail for ten days suffering from the cold all the prolonged torment of the damned and nothing had happened only an indian travelling light had passed in now in the night when it was impossible for him to watch men and dogs and a sled loaded with life passed out bound south to the sea and the sun and civilisation  so it was that he conceived of the sled for which he waited it was loaded with life his life his life was fading fainting gasping away in the tent in the snow he was weak from lack of food and could not travel of himself but on the sled for which he waited were dogs that would drag him food that would fan up the flame of his life money that would furnish sea and sun and civilisation sea and sun and civilisation became terms interchangeable with life his life and they were loaded there on the sled for which he waited the idea became an obsession and he grew to think of himself as the rightful and deprived owner of the sledload of life  his flour was running short and he went back to two biscuits in the morning and two biscuits at night because of this his weakness increased and the cold bit in more savagely and day by day he watched by the dead trail that would not live for him at last the scurvy entered upon its next stage the skin was unable longer to cast off the impurity of the blood and the result was that the body began to swell his ankles grew puffy and the ache in them kept him awake long hours at night next the swelling jumped to his knees and the sum of his pain was more than doubled  then there came a cold snap the temperature went down and downforty fifty sixty degrees below zero he had no thermometer but this he knew by the signs and natural phenomena understood by all men in that countrythe crackling of water thrown on the snow the swift sharpness of the bite of the frost and the rapidity with which his breath froze and coated the canvas walls and roof of the tent vainly he fought the cold and strove to maintain his watch on the bank in his weak condition he was an easy prey and the frost sank its teeth deep into him before he fled away to the tent and crouched by the fire his nose and cheeks were frozen and turned black and his left thumb had frozen inside the mitten he concluded that he would escape with the loss of the first joint  then it was beaten into the tent by the frost that the trail with monstrous irony suddenly teemed with life three sleds went by the first day and two the second once during each day he fought his way out to the bank only to succumb and retreat and each of the two times within halfanhour after he retreated a sled went by  the cold snap broke and he was able to remain by the bank once more and the trail died again for a week he crouched and watched and never life stirred along it not a soul passed in or out he had cut down to one biscuit night and morning and somehow he did not seem to notice it sometimes he marvelled at the way life remained in him he never would have thought it possible to endure so much  when the trail fluttered anew with life it was life with which he could not cope a detachment of the northwest police went by a score of them with many sleds and dogs and he cowered down on the bank above and they were unaware of the menace of death that lurked in the form of a dying man beside the trail  his frozen thumb gave him a great deal of trouble while watching by the bank he got into the habit of taking his mitten off and thrusting the hand inside his shirt so as to rest the thumb in the warmth of his armpit a mail carrier came over the trail and morganson let him pass a mail carrier was an important person and was sure to be missed immediately  on the first day after his last flour had gone it snowed it was always warm when the snow fell and he sat out the whole eight hours of daylight on the bank without movement terribly hungry and terribly patient for all the world like a monstrous spider waiting for its prey but the prey did not come and he hobbled back to the tent through the darkness drank quarts of spruce tea and hot water and went to bed  the next morning circumstance eased its grip on him as he started to come out of the tent he saw a huge bullmoose crossing the swale some four hundred yards away morganson felt a surge and bound of the blood in him and then went unaccountably weak a nausea overpowered him and he was compelled to sit down a moment to recover then he reached for his rifle and took careful aim the first shot was a hit he knew it but the moose turned and broke for the wooded hillside that came down to the swale morganson pumped bullets wildly among the trees and brush at the fleeing animal until it dawned upon him that he was exhausting the ammunition he needed for the sledload of life for which he waited  he stopped shooting and watched he noted the direction of the animals flight and high up on the hillside in an opening among the trees saw the trunk of a fallen pine continuing the mooses flight in his mind he saw that it must pass the trunk he resolved on one more shot and in the empty air above the trunk he aimed and steadied his wavering rifle the animal sprang into his field of vision with lifted forelegs as it took the leap he pulled the trigger with the explosion the moose seemed to somersault in the air it crashed down to earth in the snow beyond and flurried the snow into dust  morganson dashed up the hillsideat least he started to dash up the next he knew he was coming out of a faint and dragging himself to his feet he went up more slowly pausing from time to time to breathe and to steady his reeling senses at last he crawled over the trunk the moose lay before him he sat down heavily upon the carcase and laughed he buried his face in his mittened hands and laughed some more  he shook the hysteria from him he drew his hunting knife and worked as rapidly as his injured thumb and weakness would permit him he did not stop to skin the moose but quartered it with its hide on it was a klondike of meat  when he had finished he selected a piece of meat weighing a hundred pounds and started to drag it down to the tent but the snow was soft and it was too much for him he exchanged it for a twentypound piece and with many pauses to rest succeeded in getting it to the tent he fried some of the meat but ate sparingly then and automatically he went out to his crouching place on the bank there were sledtracks in the fresh snow on the trail the sledload of life had passed by while he had been cutting up the moose  but he did not mind he was glad that the sled had not passed before the coming of the moose the moose had changed his plans its meat was worth fifty cents a pound and he was but little more than three miles from minto he need no longer wait for the sledload of life the moose was the sledload of life he would sell it he would buy a couple of dogs at minto some food and some tobacco and the dogs would haul him south along the trail to the sea the sun and civilisation  he felt hungry the dull monotonous ache of hunger had now become a sharp and insistent pang he hobbled back to the tent and fried a slice of meat after that he smoked two whole pipefuls of dried tea leaves then he fried another slice of moose he was aware of an unwonted glow of strength and went out and chopped some firewood he followed that up with a slice of meat teased on by the food his hunger grew into an inflammation it became imperative every little while to fry a slice of meat he tried smaller slices and found himself frying oftener  in the middle of the day he thought of the wild animals that might eat his meat and he climbed the hill carrying along his axe the haul rope and a sled lashing in his weak state the making of the cache and storing of the meat was an allafternoon task he cut young saplings trimmed them and tied them together into a tall scaffold it was not so strong a cache as he would have desired to make but he had done his best to hoist the meat to the top was heartbreaking the larger pieces defied him until he passed the rope over a limb above and with one end fast to a piece of meat put all his weight on the other end  once in the tent he proceeded to indulge in a prolonged and solitary orgy he did not need friends his stomach and he were company slice after slice and many slices of meat he fried and ate he ate pounds of the meat he brewed real tea and brewed it strong he brewed the last he had it did not matter on the morrow he would be buying tea in minto when it seemed he could eat no more he smoked he smoked all his stock of dried tea leaves what of it on the morrow he would be smoking tobacco he knocked out his pipe fried a final slice and went to bed he had eaten so much he seemed bursting yet he got out of his blankets and had just one more mouthful of meat  in the morning he awoke as from the sleep of death in his ears were strange sounds he did not know where he was and looked about him stupidly until he caught sight of the fryingpan with the last piece of meat in it partly eaten then he remembered all and with a quick start turned his attention to the strange sounds he sprang from the blankets with an oath his scurvyravaged legs gave under him and he winced with the pain he proceeded more slowly to put on his moccasins and leave the tent  from the cache up the hillside arose a confused noise of snapping and snarling punctuated by occasional short sharp yelps he increased his speed at much expense of pain and cried loudly and threateningly he saw the wolves hurrying away through the snow and underbrush many of them and he saw the scaffold down on the ground the animals were heavy with the meat they had eaten and they were content to slink away and leave the wreckage  the way of the disaster was clear to him the wolves had scented his cache one of them had leapt from the trunk of the fallen tree to the top of the cache he could see marks of the brutes paws in the snow that covered the trunk he had not dreamt a wolf could leap so far a second had followed the first and a third and fourth until the flimsy scaffold had gone down under their weight and movement  his eyes were hard and savage for a moment as he contemplated the extent of the calamity then the old look of patience returned into them and he began to gather together the bones well picked and gnawed there was marrow in them he knew and also here and there as he sifted the snow he found scraps of meat that had escaped the maws of the brutes made careless by plenty  he spent the rest of the morning dragging the wreckage of the moose down the hillside in addition he had at least ten pounds left of the chunk of meat he had dragged down the previous day  im good for weeks yet was his comment as he surveyed the heap  he had learnt how to starve and live he cleaned his rifle and counted the cartridges that remained to him there were seven he loaded the weapon and hobbled out to his crouchingplace on the bank all day he watched the dead trail he watched all the week but no life passed over it  thanks to the meat he felt stronger though his scurvy was worse and more painful he now lived upon soup drinking endless gallons of the thin product of the boiling of the moose bones the soup grew thinner and thinner as he cracked the bones and boiled them over and over but the hot water with the essence of the meat in it was good for him and he was more vigorous than he had been previous to the shooting of the moose  it was in the next week that a new factor entered into morgansons life he wanted to know the date it became an obsession he pondered and calculated but his conclusions were rarely twice the same the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night and all day as well watching by the trail he worried about it he awoke at night and lay awake for hours over the problem to have known the date would have been of no value to him but his curiosity grew until it equalled his hunger and his desire to live finally it mastered him and he resolved to go to minto and find out  it was dark when he arrived at minto but this served him no one saw him arrive besides he knew he would have moonlight by which to return he climbed the bank and pushed open the saloon door the light dazzled him the source of it was several candles but he had been living for long in an unlighted tent as his eyes adjusted themselves he saw three men sitting around the stove they were trailtravellershe knew it at once and since they had not passed in they were evidently bound out they would go by his tent next morning  the barkeeper emitted a long and marvelling whistle  i thought you was dead he said  why morganson asked in a faltering voice  he had become unused to talking and he was not acquainted with the sound of his own voice it seemed hoarse and strange  youve been dead for moren two months now the barkeeper explained you left here going south and you never arrived at selkirk where have you been  chopping wood for the steamboat company morganson lied unsteadily  he was still trying to become acquainted with his own voice he hobbled across the floor and leant against the bar he knew he must lie consistently and while he maintained an appearance of careless indifference his heart was beating and pounding furiously and irregularly and he could not help looking hungrily at the three men by the stove they were the possessors of lifehis life  but where in hell you been keeping yourself all this time the barkeeper demanded  i located across the river he answered ive got a mighty big stack of wood chopped  the barkeeper nodded his face beamed with understanding  i heard sounds of chopping several times he said so that was you eh have a drink  morganson clutched the bar tightly a drink he could have thrown his arms around the mans legs and kissed his feet he tried vainly to utter his acceptance but the barkeeper had not waited and was already passing out the bottle  but what did you do for grub the latter asked you dont look as if you could chop wood to keep yourself warm you look terribly bad friend  morganson yearned towards the delayed bottle and gulped dryly  i did the chopping before the scurvy got bad he said then i got a moose right at the start ive been living high all right its the scurvy thats run me down  he filled the glass and added but the spruce teas knocking it i think  have another the barkeeper said  the action of the two glasses of whisky on morgansons empty stomach and weak condition was rapid the next he knew he was sitting by the stove on a box and it seemed as though ages had passed a tall broadshouldered blackwhiskered man was paying for drinks morgansons swimming eyes saw him drawing a greenback from a fat roll and morgansons swimming eyes cleared on the instant they were hundreddollar bills it was life his life he felt an almost irresistible impulse to snatch the money and dash madly out into the night  the blackwhiskered man and one of his companions arose  come on oleson the former said to the third one of the party a fairhaired ruddyfaced giant  oleson came to his feet yawning and stretching  what are you going to bed so soon for the barkeeper asked plaintively its early yet  got to make selkirk tomorrow said he of the black whiskers  on christmas day the barkeeper cried  the better the day the better the deed the other laughed  as the three men passed out of the door it came dimly to morganson that it was christmas eve that was the date that was what he had come to minto for but it was overshadowed now by the three men themselves and the fat roll of hundreddollar bills  the door slammed  thats jack thompson the barkeeper said made two millions on bonanza and sulphur and got more coming im going to bed have another drink first  morganson hesitated  a christmas drink the other urged its all right ill get it back when you sell your wood  morganson mastered his drunkenness long enough to swallow the whisky say good night and get out on the trail it was moonlight and he hobbled along through the bright silvery quiet with a vision of life before him that took the form of a roll of hundreddollar bills  he awoke it was dark and he was in his blankets he had gone to bed in his moccasins and mittens with the flaps of his cap pulled down over his ears he got up as quickly as his crippled condition would permit and built the fire and boiled some water as he put the sprucetwigs into the teapot he noted the first glimmer of the pale morning light he caught up his rifle and hobbled in a panic out to the bank as he crouched and waited it came to him that he had forgotten to drink his spruce tea the only other thought in his mind was the possibility of john thompson changing his mind and not travelling christmas day  dawn broke and merged into day it was cold and clear sixty below zero was morgansons estimate of the frost not a breath stirred the chill arctic quiet he sat up suddenly his muscular tensity increasing the hurt of the scurvy he had heard the far sound of a mans voice and the faint whining of dogs he began beating his hands back and forth against his sides it was a serious matter to bare the trigger hand to sixty degrees below zero and against that time he needed to develop all the warmth of which his flesh was capable  they came into view around the outjutting clump of trees to the fore was the third man whose name he had not learnt then came eight dogs drawing the sled at the front of the sled guiding it by the geepole walked john thompson the rear was brought up by oleson the swede he was certainly a fine man morganson thought as he looked at the bulk of him in his squirrelskin parka the men and dogs were silhouetted sharply against the white of the landscape they had the seeming of two dimension cardboard figures that worked mechanically  morganson rested his cocked rifle in the notch in the tree he became abruptly aware that his fingers were cold and discovered that his right hand was bare he did not know that he had taken off the mitten he slipped it on again hastily the men and dogs drew closer and he could see their breaths spouting into visibility in the cold air when the first man was fifty yards away morganson slipped the mitten from his right hand he placed the first finger on the trigger and aimed low when he fired the first man whirled half around and went down on the trail  in the instant of surprise morganson pulled the trigger on john thompsontoo low for the latter staggered and sat down suddenly on the sled morganson raised his aim and fired again john thompson sank down backward along the top of the loaded sled  morganson turned his attention to oleson at the same time that he noted the latter running away towards minto he noted that the dogs coming to where the first mans body blocked the trail had halted morganson fired at the fleeing man and missed and oleson swerved he continued to swerve back and forth while morganson fired twice in rapid succession and missed both shots morganson stopped himself just as he was pulling the trigger again he had fired six shots only one more cartridge remained and it was in the chamber it was imperative that he should not miss his last shot  he held his fire and desperately studied olesons flight the giant was grotesquely curving and twisting and running at top speed along the trail the tail of his parka flapping smartly behind morganson trained his rifle on the man and with a swaying action followed his erratic flight morgansons finger was getting numb he could scarcely feel the trigger god help me he breathed a prayer aloud and pulled the trigger the running man pitched forward on his face rebounded from the hard trail and slid along rolling over and over he threshed for a moment with his arms and then lay quiet  morganson dropped his rifle worthless now that the last cartridge was gone and slid down the bank through the soft snow now that he had sprung the trap concealment of his lurkingplace was no longer necessary he hobbled along the trail to the sled his fingers making involuntary gripping and clutching movements inside the mittens  the snarling of the dogs halted him the leader a heavy dog half newfoundland and half hudson bay stood over the body of the man that lay on the trail and menaced morganson with bristling hair and bared fangs the other seven dogs of the team were likewise bristling and snarling morganson approached tentatively and the team surged towards him he stopped again and talked to the animals threatening and cajoling by turns he noticed the face of the man under the leaders feet and was surprised at how quickly it had turned white with the ebb of life and the entrance of the frost john thompson lay back along the top of the loaded sled his head sunk in a space between two sacks and his chin tilted upwards so that all morganson could see was the black beard pointing skyward  finding it impossible to face the dogs morganson stepped off the trail into the deep snow and floundered in a wide circle to the rear of the sled under the initiative of the leader the team swung around in its tangled harness because of his crippled condition morganson could move only slowly he saw the animals circling around on him and tried to retreat he almost made it but the big leader with a savage lunge sank its teeth into the calf of his leg the flesh was slashed and torn but morganson managed to drag himself clear  he cursed the brutes fiercely but could not cow them they replied with neckbristling and snarling and with quick lunges against their breastbands he remembered oleson and turned his back upon them and went along the trail he scarcely took notice of his lacerated leg it was bleeding freely the main artery had been torn but he did not know it  especially remarkable to morganson was the extreme pallor of the swede who the preceding night had been so ruddyfaced now his face was like white marble what with his fair hair and lashes he looked like a carved statue rather than something that had been a man a few minutes before morganson pulled off his mittens and searched the body there was no moneybelt around the waist next to the skin nor did he find a goldsack in a breast pocket he lit on a small wallet with fingers that swiftly went numb with the frost he hurried through the contents of the wallet there were letters with foreign stamps and postmarks on them and several receipts and memorandum accounts and a letter of credit for eight hundred dollars that was all there was no money  he made a movement to start back toward the sled but found his foot rooted to the trail he glanced down and saw that he stood in a fresh deposit of frozen red there was red ice on his torn pants leg and on the moccasin beneath with a quick effort he broke the frozen clutch of his blood and hobbled along the trail to the sled the big leader that had bitten him began snarling and lunging and was followed in this conduct by the whole team  morganson wept weakly for a space and weakly swayed from one side to the other then he brushed away the frozen tears that gemmed his lashes it was a joke malicious chance was having its laugh at him even john thompson with his heavenaspiring whiskers was laughing at him  he prowled around the sled demented at times weeping and pleading with the brutes for his life there on the sled at other times raging impotently against them then calmness came upon him he had been making a fool of himself all he had to do was to go to the tent get the axe and return and brain the dogs hed show them  in order to get to the tent he had to go wide of the sled and the savage animals he stepped off the trail into the soft snow then he felt suddenly giddy and stood still he was afraid to go on for fear he would fall down he stood still for a long time balancing himself on his crippled legs that were trembling violently from weakness he looked down and saw the snow reddening at his feet the blood flowed freely as ever he had not thought the bite was so severe he controlled his giddiness and stooped to examine the wound the snow seemed rushing up to meet him and he recoiled from it as from a blow he had a panic fear that he might fall down and after a struggle he managed to stand upright again he was afraid of that snow that had rushed up to him  then the white glimmer turned black and the next he knew he was awakening in the snow where he had fallen he was no longer giddy the cobwebs were gone but he could not get up there was no strength in his limbs his body seemed lifeless by a desperate effort he managed to roll over on his side in this position he caught a glimpse of the sled and of john thompsons black beard pointing skyward also he saw the lead dog licking the face of the man who lay on the trail morganson watched curiously the dog was nervous and eager sometimes it uttered short sharp yelps as though to arouse the man and surveyed him with ears cocked forward and wagging tail at last it sat down pointed its nose upward and began to howl soon all the team was howling  now that he was down morganson was no longer afraid he had a vision of himself being found dead in the snow and for a while he wept in selfpity but he was not afraid the struggle had gone out of him when he tried to open his eyes he found that the wet tears had frozen them shut he did not try to brush the ice away it did not matter he had not dreamed death was so easy he was even angry that he had struggled and suffered through so many weary weeks he had been bullied and cheated by the fear of death death did not hurt every torment he had endured had been a torment of life life had defamed death it was a cruel thing  but his anger passed the lies and frauds of life were of no consequence now that he was coming to his own he became aware of drowsiness and felt a sweet sleep stealing upon him balmy with promises of easement and rest he heard faintly the howling of the dogs and had a fleeting thought that in the mastering of his flesh the frost no longer bit then the light and the thought ceased to pulse beneath the teargemmed eyelids and with a tired sigh of comfort he sank into sleep     the end of the story   i  the table was of handhewn spruce boards and the men who played whist had frequent difficulties in drawing home their tricks across the uneven surface though they sat in their undershirts the sweat noduled and oozed on their faces yet their feet heavily moccasined and woollensocked tingled with the bite of the frost such was the difference of temperature in the small cabin between the floor level and a yard or more above it the sheetiron yukon stove roared redhot yet eight feet away on the meatshelf placed low and beside the door lay chunks of solidly frozen moose and bacon the door a third of the way up from the bottom was a thick rime in the chinking between the logs at the back of the bunks the frost showed white and glistening a window of oiled paper furnished light the lower portion of the paper on the inside was coated an inch deep with the frozen moisture of the mens breath  they played a momentous rubber of whist for the pair that lost was to dig a fishing hole through the seven feet of ice and snow that covered the yukon  its mighty unusual a cold snap like this in march remarked the man who shuffled what would you call it bob  oh fiftyfive or sixty belowall of that what do you make it doc  doc turned his head and glanced at the lower part of the door with a measuring eye  not a bit worse than fifty if anything slightly undersay fortynine see the ice on the door its just about the fifty mark but youll notice the upper edge is ragged the time she went seventy the ice climbed a full four inches higher he picked up his hand and without ceasing from sorting called come in to a knock on the door  the man who entered was a big broadshouldered swede though his nationality was not discernible until he had removed his earflapped cap and thawed away the ice which had formed on beard and moustache and which served to mask his face while engaged in this the men at the table played out the hand  i hear one doctor faller stop this camp the swede said inquiringly looking anxiously from face to face his own face haggard and drawn from severe and long endured pain i come long way north fork of the whyo  im the doctor whats the matter  in response the man held up his left hand the second finger of which was monstrously swollen at the same time he began a rambling disjointed history of the coming and growth of his affliction  let me look at it the doctor broke in impatiently lay it on the table there like that  tenderly as if it were a great boil the man obeyed  humph the doctor grumbled a weeping sinew and travelled a hundred miles to have it fixed ill fix it in a jiffy you watch me and next time you can do it yourself  without warning squarely and at right angles and savagely the doctor brought the edge of his hand down on the swollen crooked finger the man yelled with consternation and agony it was more like the cry of a wild beast and his face was a wild beasts as he was about to spring on the man who had perpetrated the joke  thats all right the doctor placated sharply and authoritatively how do you feel better eh of course next time you can do it yourselfgo on and deal strothers i think weve got you  slow and oxlike on the face of the swede dawned relief and comprehension the pang over the finger felt better the pain was gone he examined the finger curiously with wondering eyes slowly crooking it back and forth he reached into his pocket and pulled out a goldsack  how much  the doctor shook his head impatiently nothing im not practisingyour play bob  the swede moved heavily on his feet reexamined the finger then turned an admiring gaze on the doctor  you are good man what your name  linday doctor linday strothers answered as if solicitous to save his opponent from further irritation  the days half done linday said to the swede at the end of the hand while he shuffled better rest over tonight its too cold for travelling theres a spare bunk  he was a slender brunette of a man leancheeked thinlipped and strong the smoothshaven face was a healthy sallow all his movements were quick and precise he did not fumble his cards the eyes were black direct and piercing with the trick of seeming to look beneath the surfaces of things his hands slender fine and nervous appeared made for delicate work and to the most casual eye they conveyed an impression of strength  our game he announced drawing in the last trick now for the rub and who digs the fishing hole  a knock at the door brought a quick exclamation from him  seems we just cant finish this rubber he complained as the door opened whats the matter with youthis last to the stranger who entered  the newcomer vainly strove to move his icebound jaws and jowls that he had been on trail for long hours and days was patent the skin across the cheekbones was black with repeated frostbite from nose to chin was a mass of solid ice perforated by the hole through which he breathed through this he had also spat tobacco juice which had frozen as it trickled into an ambercoloured icicle pointed like a van dyke beard  he shook his head dumbly grinned with his eyes and drew near to the stove to thaw his mouth to speech he assisted the process with his fingers clawing off fragments of melting ice which rattled and sizzled on the stove  nothing the matter with me he finally announced but if theys a doctor in the outfit hes sure needed theys a man up the little peco thats had a ruction with a panther an the way hes clawed is something scandlous  how far up doctor linday demanded  a matter of a hundred miles  how long since  ive ben three days comin down  bad  shoulder dislocated some ribs broke for sure right arm broke an clawed clean to the bone most all over but the face we sewed up two or three bad places temporary and tied arteries with twine  that settles it linday sneered where were they  stomach  hes a sight

angrily fingered the cards  nope that man aint goin to die he knows ive come for a doctor an hell make out to live until you get there he wont let himself die i know him  christian science and gangrene eh came the sneer well im not practising nor can i see myself travelling a hundred miles at fifty below for a dead man  i can see you an for a man a long ways from dead  linday shook his head sorry you had your trip for nothing better stop over for the night  nope well be pullin out in ten minutes  what makes you so cocksure linday demanded testily  then it was that tom daw made the speech

days because the trails broke im goin down to the dawgs now an ill look for you in ten minutes  tom daw pulled down his earflaps drew on his mittens and passed out  damn him linday cried glaring vindictively at the closed door   ii  that night long after dark with twentyfive miles behind them linday and tom daw went into camp it was a simple but adequate affair a fire built in the snow alongside their sleepingfurs spread in a single bed on a mat of spruce boughs behind the bed an oblong of canvas stretched to refract the heat daw fed the dogs and chopped ice and firewood lindays cheeks burned with frostbite as he squatted over the cooking they ate heavily smoked a pipe and talked while they dried their moccasins before the fire and turned in to sleep the dead sleep of fatigue and health  morning found the unprecedented cold snap broken linday estimated the temperature at fifteen below and rising daw was worried that day would see them in the canyon he explained and if the spring thaw set in the canyon would run open water the walls of the canyon were hundreds to thousands of feet high they could be climbed but the going would be slow  camped well in the dark and forbidding gorge over their pipe that evening they complained of the heat and both agreed that the thermometer must be above zerothe first time in six months  nobody ever heard tell of a panther this far north daw was saying rocky called it a cougar but i shot amany of em down in curry county oregon where i come from an we called em panther anyway it was a bigger cat than ever i seen it was sure a monster cat now howd it ever stray to such out of the way huntin rangethats the question  linday made no comment he was nodding propped on sticks his moccasins steamed unheeded and unturned the dogs curled in furry balls slept in the snow the crackle of an ember accentuated the profound of silence that reigned he awoke with a start and gazed at daw who nodded and returned the gaze both listened from far off came a vague disturbance that increased to a vast and sombre roaring as it neared everincreasing riding the mountain tops as well as the canyon depths bowing the forest before it bending the meagre crevicerooted pines on the walls of the gorge they knew it for what it was a wind strong and warm a balmy gale drove past them flinging a rocketshower of sparks from the fire the dogs aroused sat on their haunches bleak noses pointed upward and raised the long wolf howl  its the chinook daw said  it means the river trail i suppose  sure thing and ten miles of it is easier than one over the tops daw surveyed linday for a long considering minute weve just had fifteen hours of trail he shouted above the wind tentatively and again waited doc he said finally are you game  for answer linday knocked out his pipe and began to pull on his damp moccasins between them and in few minutes bending to the force of the wind the dogs were harnessed camp broken and the cooking outfit and unused sleeping furs lashed on the sled then through the darkness for a night of travel they churned out on the trail daw had broken nearly a week before and all through the night the chinook roared and they urged the weary dogs and spurred their own jaded muscles twelve hours of it they made and stopped for breakfast after twentyseven hours on trail  an hours sleep said daw when they had wolfed pounds of straight moosemeat fried with bacon  two hours he let his companion sleep afraid himself to close his eyes he occupied himself with making marks upon the softsurfaced shrinking snow visibly it shrank in two hours the snow level sank three inches from every side faintly heard and near under the voice of the spring wind came the trickling of hidden waters the little peco strengthened by the multitudinous streamlets rose against the manacles of winter riving the ice with crashings and snappings  daw touched linday on the shoulder touched him again shook and shook violently  doc he murmured admiringly you can sure go some  the weary black eyes under heavy lids acknowledged the compliment  but that aint the question rocky is clawed something scandlous as i said before i helped sew up his inards doc he shook the man whose eyes had again closed i say doc the question is can you go some morehear me i say can you go some more  the weary dogs snapped and whimpered when kicked from their sleep the going was slow not more than two miles an hour and the animals took every opportunity to lie down in the wet snow  twenty miles of it and well be through the gorge daw encouraged after that the ice can go to blazes for we can take to the bank and its only ten more miles to camp why doc were almost there and when you get rocky fixed up you can come down in a canoe in one day  but the ice grew more uneasy under them breaking loose from the shoreline and rising steadily inch by inch in places where it still held to the shore the water overran and they waded and slushed across the little peco growled and muttered cracks and fissures were forming everywhere as they battled on for the miles that each one of which meant ten along the tops  get on the sled doc an take a snooze daw invited  the glare from the black eyes prevented him from repeating the suggestion  as early as midday they received definite warning of the beginning of the end cakes of ice borne downward in the rapid current began to thunder beneath the ice on which they stood the dogs whimpered anxiously and yearned for the bank  that means open water above daw explained pretty soon shell jam somewheres an the riverll raise a hundred feet in a hundred minutes its us for the tops if we can find a way to climb out come on hit her up i an just to think the yukonll stick solid for weeks  unusually narrow at this point the great walls of the canyon were too precipitous to scale daw and linday had to keep on and they kept on till the disaster happened with a loud explosion the ice broke asunder midway under the team the two animals in the middle of the string went into the fissure and the grip of the current on their bodies dragged the leaddog backward and in swept downstream under the ice these three bodies began to drag to the edge the two whining dogs that remained the men held back frantically on the sled but were slowly drawn along with it it was all over in the space of seconds daw slashed the wheeldogs traces with his sheathknife and the animal whipped over the iceedge and was gone the ice on which they stood broke into a large and pivoting cake that ground and splintered against the shore ice and rocks between them they got the sled ashore and up into a crevice in time to see the icecake upedge sink and downshelve from view  meat and sleeping furs were made into packs and the sled was abandoned linday resented daws taking the heavier pack but daw had his will  you got to work as soon as you get there come on  it was one in the afternoon when they started to climb at eight that evening they cleared the rim and for half an hour lay where they had fallen then came the fire a pot of coffee and an enormous feed of moosemeat but first linday hefted the two

 it was at the next camp that linday heard how rocky had come to be injured  id ben up the draw about a mile from the cabin lookin for a piece of birch likely enough for an axehandle comin back i heard the darndest goingson where we had a bear trap set some trapper had left the trap in an old cache an rockyd fixed it up but the goingson it was rocky an his brother harry first id hear one yell and laugh an then the other like it was some game an what do you think the fool game was ive saw some pretty nervy cusses down in curry county but they beat all theyd got a whoppin big panther in the

they aint enough grub to turn back an well be there tomorrow just got to cross that last divide an drop down to the cabin an theys a better reason youre too far from home an i just naturally wouldnt let you turn back  exhausted as linday was the flash in his black eyes warned daw that he had overreached himself his hand went out  my mistake doc forget it i reckon im gettin some cranky what of losin them dawgs   iii  not one day but three days later the two men after being snowed in on the summit by a spring blizzard staggered up to a cabin that stood in a fat bottom beside the roaring little peco coming in from the bright sunshine to the dark cabin linday observed little of its occupants he was no more than aware of two men and a woman but he was not interested in them he went directly to the bunk where lay the injured man the latter was lying on his back with eyes closed and linday noted the slender stencilling of the brows and the kinky silkiness of the brown hair thin and wan the face seemed too small for the muscular neck yet the delicate features despite their waste were firmly moulded  what dressings have you been using linday asked of the woman  corrosive sublimate regular solution came the answer  he glanced quickly at her shot an even quicker glance at the face of the injured man and stood erect she breathed sharply abruptly biting off the respiration with an effort of will linday turned to the men  you clear outchop wood or something clear out  one of them demurred  this is a serious case linday went on i want to talk to his wife  im his brother said the other  to him the woman looked praying him with her eyes he nodded reluctantly and turned toward the door  me too daw queried from the bench where he had flung himself down  you too  linday busied himself with a superficial examination of the patient while the cabin was emptying  so he said so thats your rex strang  she dropped her eyes to the man in the bunk as if to reassure herself of his identity and then in silence returned lindays gaze  why dont you speak  she shrugged her shoulders what is the use you know it is rex strang  thank you though i might remind you that it is the first time i have ever seen him sit down he waved her to a stool himself taking the bench im really about all in you know theres no turnpike from the yukon here  he drew a penknife and began extracting a thorn from his thumb  what are you going to do she asked after a minutes wait  eat and rest up before i start back  what are you going to do about she inclined her head toward the unconscious man  nothing  she went over to the bunk and rested her fingers lightly on the tightcurled hair  you mean you will kill him she said slowly kill him by doing nothing for you can save him if you will  take it that way he considered a moment and stated his thought with a harsh little laugh from time immemorial in this weary old world it has been a not uncommon custom so to dispose of wifestealers  you are unfair grant she answered gently you forget that i was willing and that i desired i was a free agent rex never stole me it was you who lost me i went with him willing and eager with song on my lips as well accuse me of stealing him we went together  a good way of looking at it linday conceded i see you are as keen a thinker as ever madge that must have bothered him  a keen thinker can be a good lover  and not so foolish he broke in  then you admit the wisdom of my course  he threw up his hands thats the devil of it talking with clever women a man always forgets and traps himself i wouldnt wonder if you won him with a syllogism  her reply was the hint of a smile in her straightlooking blue eyes and a seeming emanation of sex pride from all the physical being of her  no i take that back madge if youd been a numbskull youd have won him or any one else on your looks and form and carriage i ought to know ive been through that particular mill and the devil take me im not through it yet  his speech was quick and nervous and irritable as it always was and as she knew it was always candid she took her cue from his last remark  do you remember lake geneva  i ought to i was rather absurdly happy  she nodded and her eyes were luminous there is such a thing as old sake wont you grant please just remember back  a little  oh so little  of what we were to each other  then  now youre taking advantage he smiled and returned to the attack on his thumb he drew the thorn out inspected it critically then concluded no thank you im not playing the good samaritan  yet you made this hard journey for an unknown man she urged  his impatience was sharply manifest do you fancy id have moved a step had i known he was my wifes lover  but you are here  now and there he lies what are you going to do  nothing why should i i am not at the mans service he pilfered me  she was about to speak when a knock came on the door  get out he shouted  if you want any assistance  get out get a bucket of water set it down outside  you are going to she began tremulously  wash up  she recoiled from the brutality and her lips tightened  listen grant she said steadily i shall tell his brother i know the strang breed if you can forget old sake so can i if you dont do something hell kill you why even tom daw would if i asked  you should know me better than to threaten he reproved gravely then added with a sneer besides i dont see how killing me will help your rex strang  she gave a low gasp closed her lips tightly and watched his quick eyes take note of the trembling that had beset her  its not hysteria grant she cried hastily and anxiously with clicking teeth you never saw me with hysteria ive never had it i dont know what it is but ill control it i am merely beside myself its partly angerwith you and its apprehension and fear i dont want to lose him i do love him grant he is my king my lover and i have sat here beside him so many dreadful days now oh grant please please  just nerves he commented drily stay with it you can best it if you were a man id say take a smoke  she went unsteadily back to the stool where she watched him and fought for control from the rough fireplace came the singing of a cricket outside two wolfdogs bickered the injured mans chest rose and fell perceptibly under the fur robes she saw a smile not altogether pleasant form on lindays lips  how much do you love him he asked  her breast filled and rose and her eyes shone with a light unashamed and proud he nodded in token that he was answered  do you mind if i take a little time he stopped casting about for the way to begin i remember reading a storyherbert shaw wrote it i think i want to tell you about it there was a woman young and beautiful a man magnificent a lover of beauty and a wanderer i dont know how much like your rex strang he was but i fancy a sort of resemblance well this man was a painter a bohemian a vagabond he kissedoh several times and for several weeksand rode away she possessed for him what i thought you possessed for me  at lake geneva in ten years she wept the beauty out of her face some women turn yellow you know when grief upsets their natural juices  now it happened that the man went blind and ten years afterward led as a child by the hand he stumbled back to her there was nothing left he could no longer paint and she was very happy and glad he could not see her face remember he worshipped beauty and he continued to hold her in his arms and believe in her beauty the memory of it was vivid in him he never ceased to talk about it and to lament that he could not behold it  one day he told her of five great pictures he wished to paint if only his sight could be restored to paint them he could write finis and be content and then no matter how there came into her hands an elixir anointed on his eyes the sight would surely and fully return  linday shrugged his shoulders  you see her struggle with sight he could paint his five pictures also he would leave her beauty was his religion it was impossible that he could abide her ruined face five days she struggled then she anointed his eyes  linday broke off and searched her with his eyes the high lights focused sharply in the brilliant black  the question is do you love rex strang as much as that  and if i do she countered  do you  yes  you can sacrifice you can give him up  slow and reluctant was her yes  and you will come with me  yes this time her voice was a whisper when he is wellyes  you understand it must be lake geneva over again you will be my wife  she seemed to shrink and droop but her head nodded  very well he stood up briskly went to his pack and began unstrapping i shall need help bring his brother in bring them all in boiling waterlet there be lots of it ive brought bandages but let me see what you have in that linehere daw build up that fire and start boiling all the water you canhere you to the other man get that table out and under the window there clean it scrub it scald it clean man clean as you never cleaned a thing before you mrs strang will be my helper no sheets i suppose well well manage somehowyoure his brother sir ill give the an√¶sthetic but you must keep it going afterward now listen while i instruct you in the first placebut before that can you take a pulse   iv  noted for his daring and success as a surgeon through the days and weeks that followed linday exceeded himself in daring and success never because of the frightful mangling and breakage and because of the long delay had he encountered so terrible a case but he had never had a healthier specimen of human wreck to work upon even then he would have failed had it not been for the patients catlike vitality and almost uncanny physical and mental grip on life  there were days of high temperature and delirium days of heartsinking when strangs pulse was barely perceptible days when he lay conscious eyes weary and drawn the sweat of pain on his face linday was indefatigable cruelly efficient audacious and fortunate daring hazard after hazard and winning he was not content to make the man live he devoted himself to the intricate and perilous problem of making him whole and strong again  he will be a cripple madge queried  he will not merely walk and talk and be a limping caricature of his former self linday told her he shall run and leap swim riffles ride bears fight panthers and do all things to the top of his fool desire and i warn you he will fascinate women just as of old will you like that are you content remember you will not be with him  go on go on she breathed make him whole make him what he was  more than once whenever strangs recuperation permitted linday put him under the an√¶sthetic and did terrible things cutting and sewing rewiring and connecting up the disrupted organism later developed a hitch in the left arm strang could lift it so far and no farther linday applied himself to the problem it was a case of more wires shrunken twisted disconnected again it was cut and switch and ease and disentangle and all that saved strang was his tremendous vitality and the health of his flesh  you will kill him his brother complained let him be for gods sake let him be a live and crippled man is better than a whole and dead one  linday flamed in wrath you get out out of this cabin with you till you can come back and say that i make him live pullby god man youve got to pull with me with all your soul your brothers travelling a hairline razoredge do you understand a thought can topple him off now get out and come back sweet and wholesome convinced beyond all absoluteness that he will live and be what he was before you and he played the fool together get out i say  the brother with clenched hands and threatening eyes looked to madge for counsel  go go please she begged he is right i know he is right  another time when strangs condition seemed more promising the brother said  doc youre a wonder and all this time ive forgotten to ask your name  none of your damn business dont bother me get out  the mangled right arm ceased from its healing burst open again in a frightful wound  necrosis said linday  that does settle it groaned the brother  shut up linday snarled get out take daw with you take bill too get rabbitsalivehealthy ones trap them trap everywhere  how many the brother asked  forty of themfour thousandforty thousandall you can get youll help me mrs strang im going to dig into that arm and size up the damage get out you fellows you for the rabbits  and he dug in swiftly unerringly scraping away disintegrating bone ascertaining the extent of the active decay  it never would have happened he told madge if he hadnt had so many other things needing vitality first even he didnt have vitality enough to go around i was watching it but i had to wait and chance it that piece must go he could manage without it but rabbitbone will make it what it was  from the hundreds of rabbits brought in he weeded out rejected selected tested selected and tested again until he made his final choice he used the last of his chloroform and achieved the bonegraftliving bone to living bone living man and living rabbit immovable and indissolubly bandaged and bound together their mutual processes uniting and reconstructing a perfect arm  and through the whole trying period especially as strang mended occurred passages of talk between linday and madge nor was he kind nor she rebellious  its a nuisance he told her but the law is the law and youll need a divorce before we can marry again what do you say shall we go to lake geneva  as you will she said  and he another time what the deuce did you see in him anyway i know he had money but you and i were managing to get along with some sort of comfort my practice was averaging around forty thousand a year theni went over the books afterward palaces and steam yachts were about all that was denied you  perhaps youve explained it she answered perhaps you were too interested in your practice maybe you forgot me  humph he sneered and may not your rex be too interested in panthers and short sticks  he continually girded her to explain what he chose to call her infatuation for the other man  there is no explanation she replied and finally she retorted no one can explain love i least of all i only knew love the divine and irrefragable fact that is all there was once at fort vancouver a baron of the hudson bay company who chided the resident church of england parson the dominie had written home to england complaining that the company folk from the head factor down were addicted to indian wives why didnt you explain the extenuating circumstances demanded the baron replied the dominie a cows tail grows downward i do not attempt to explain why the cows tail grows downward i merely cite the fact  damn clever women cried linday his eyes flashing his irritation  what brought you of all places into the klondike she asked once  too much money no wife to spend it wanted a rest possibly overwork i tried colorado but their telegrams followed me and some of them did themselves i went on to seattle same thing ransom ran his wife out to me in a special train there was no escaping it operation successful local newspapers got wind of it you can imagine the rest i had to hide so i ran away to klondike andwell tom daw found me playing whist in a cabin down on the yukon  came the day when strangs bed was carried out of doors and into the sunshine  let me tell him now she said to linday  no wait he answered  later strang was able to sit up on the edge of the bed able to walk his first giddy steps supported on either side  let me tell him now she said  no im making a complete job of this i want no setbacks theres a slight hitch still in that left arm its a little thing but i am going to remake him as god made him tomorrow ive planned to get into that arm and take out the kink it will mean a couple of days on his back im sorry theres no more chloroform hell just have to bite his teeth on a spike and hang on he can do it hes got grit for a dozen men  summer came on the snow disappeared save on the far peaks of the rockies to the east the days lengthened till there was no darkness the sun dipping at midnight due north for a few minutes beneath the horizon linday never let up on strang he studied his walk his body movements stripped him again and again and for the thousandth time made him flex all his muscles massage was given him without end until linday declared that tom daw bill and the brother were properly qualified for turkish bath and osteopathic hospital attendants but linday was not yet satisfied he put strang through his whole repertoire of physical feats searching him the while for hidden weaknesses he put him on his back again for a week opened up his leg played a deft trick or two with the smaller veins scraped a spot of bone no larger than a coffee grain till naught but a surface of healthy pink remained to be sewed over with the living flesh  let me tell him madge begged  not yet was the answer you will tell him only when i am ready  july passed and august neared its end when he ordered strang out on trail to get a moose linday kept at his heels watching him studying him he was slender a cat in the strength of his muscles and he walked as linday had seen no man walk effortlessly with all his body seeming to lift the legs with supple muscles clear to the shoulders but it was without heaviness so easy that it invested him with a peculiar grace so easy that to the eye the speed was deceptive it was the killing pace of which tom daw had complained linday toiled behind sweating and panting from time to time when the ground favoured making short runs to keep up at the end of ten miles he called a halt and threw himself down on the moss  enough he cried i cant keep up with you  he mopped his heated face and strang sat down on a spruce log smiling at the doctor and with the camaraderie of a pantheist at all the landscape  any twinges or hurts or aches or hints of aches linday demanded  strang shook his curly head and stretched his lithe body living and joying in every fibre of it  youll do strang for a winter or two you may expect to feel the cold and damp in the old wounds but that will pass and perhaps you may escape it altogether  god doctor you have performed miracles with me i dont know how to thank you i dont even know your name  which doesnt matter ive pulled you through and thats the main thing  but its a name men must know out in the world strang persisted ill wager id recognise it if i heard it  i think you would was lindays answer but its beside the matter i want one final test and then im done with you over the divide at the head of this creek is a tributary of the big windy daw tells me that last year you went over down to the middle fork and back again in three days he said you nearly killed him too you are to wait here and camp tonight ill send daw along with the camp outfit then its up to you to go to the middle fork and back in the same time as last year   v  now linday said to madge you have an hour in which to pack ill go and get the canoe ready bills bringing in the moose and wont get back till dark well make my cabin today and in a week well be in dawson  i was in hope she broke off proudly  that id forego the fee  oh a compact is a compact but you neednt have been so hateful in the collecting you have not been fair you have sent him away for three days and robbed me of my last words to him  leave a letter  i shall tell him all  anything less than all would be unfair to the three of us was lindays answer  when he returned from the canoe her outfit was packed the letter written  let me read it he said if you dont mind  her hesitation was momentary then she passed it over  pretty straight he said when he had finished it now are you ready  he carried her pack down to the bank and kneeling steadied the canoe with one hand while he extended the other to help her in he watched her closely but without a tremor she held out her hand to his and prepared to step on board  wait he said one moment you remember the story i told you of the elixir i failed to tell you the end and when she had anointed his eyes and was about to depart it chanced she saw in the mirror that her beauty had been restored to her and he opened his eyes and cried out with joy at the sight of her beauty and folded her in his arms  she waited tense but controlled for him to continue a dawn of wonder faintly beginning to show in her face and eyes  you are very beautiful madge he paused then added drily the rest is obvious i fancy rex strangs arms wont remain long empty goodbye  grant she said almost whispered and in her voice was all the speech that needs not words for understanding  he gave a nasty little laugh i just wanted to show you i wasnt such a bad sort coals of fire you know  grant  he stepped into the canoe and put out a slender nervous hand  goodbye he said  she folded both her own hands about his  dear strong hand she murmured and bent and kissed it  he jerked it away thrust the canoe out from the bank dipped the paddle in the swift rush of the current and entered the head of the riffle where the water poured glassily ere it burst into a white madness of foam
