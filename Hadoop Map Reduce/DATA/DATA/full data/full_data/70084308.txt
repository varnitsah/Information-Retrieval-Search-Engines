70084308	deep waters  by ww jacobs     striking hard  youve what demanded mrs porter placing the hot iron carefully on its stand and turning a heated face on the head of the family  struck repeated mr porter and the only wonder to me is weve stood it so long as we have  if i was to tell you all weve ad to put up with i dont suppose youd believe me  very likely was the reply  you can keep your fairytales for them that like em  theyre no good to me  we stood it till flesh and blood could stand it no longer declared her husband and at last we came out shoulder to shoulder singing  the people cheered us and one of our leaders made em a speech  i should have liked to ave heard the singing remarked his wife  if they all sang like you it must ha been as good as a pantermime  do you remember the last time you went on strike  this is different said mr porter with dignity  all our things went bit by bit pursued his wife all the money we had put by for a rainy day and we ad to begin all over again  what are we going to live on  o course you might earn something by singing in the street people who like funny faces might give you something  why not go upstairs and put your ead under the bedclothes and practise a bit  mr porter coughed  itll be all right he said confidently  our committee knows what its about bert robinson is one of the best speakers ive ever eard  if we dont all get five bob a week more ill eat my ead  its the best thing you could do with it snapped his wife  she took up her iron again and turning an obstinate back to his remarks resumed her work  mr porter lay long next morning and dressing with comfortable slowness noticed with pleasure that the sun was shining  visions of a good breakfast and a digestive pipe followed by a walk in the fresh air passed before his eyes as he laced his boots  whistling cheerfully he went briskly downstairs  it was an october morning but despite the invigorating chill in the air the kitchengrate was cold and dull  herringbones and a disorderly collection of dirty cups and platters graced the table  perplexed and angry he looked around for his wife and then opening the backdoor stood gaping with astonishment  the wife of his bosom who should have had a bright fire and a good breakfast waiting for him was sitting on a box in the sunshine elbows on knees and puffing laboriously at a cigarette  susan he exclaimed  mrs porter turned and puffing out her lips blew an immense volume of smoke  halloa she said carelessly  wotwot does this mean demanded her husband  mrs porter smiled with conscious pride  i made it come out of my nose just now she replied  at least some of it did and i swallowed the rest  will it hurt me  wheres my breakfast inquired the other hotly  why aint the kitchenfire alight  wot do you think youre doing of  im not doing anything said his wife with an aggrieved air  im on strike  mr porter reeled against the doorpost  wot he stammered  on strike  nonsense  you cant be  o yes i can retorted mrs porter closing one eye and ministering to it hastily with the corner of her apron  not aving no bert robinson to do it for me i made a little speech all to myself and here i am  she dropped her apron replaced the cigarette and with her hands on her plump knees eyes him steadily  butbut this aint a factory objected the dismayed man and besides i wont ave it  mrs porter laugheda fat comfortable laugh but with a touch of hardness in it  all right mate she said comfortably  what are you out on strike for  shorter hours and more money said mr porter glaring at her  his wife nodded  so am i she said  i wonder who gets it first  she smiled agreeably at the bewildered mr porter and extracting a paper packet of cigarettes from her pocket lit a fresh one at the stub of the first  thats the worst of a woman said her husband avoiding her eye and addressing a sanitary dustbin of severe aspect they do things without thinking first  thats why men are superior before they do a thing they look at it all round and upside down andandmake sure it can be done  now you get up in a temper this morning and the first thing you donot even waiting to get my breakfast ready firstis to go on strike if youd thought for two minutes youd see as ow its impossible for you to go on strike for more than a couple of hours or so  why inquired mrs porter  kids replied her husband triumphantly  theyll be coming ome from school soon wont they  and theyll be wanting their dinner wont they  thats all right murmured the other vaguely  after which when night comes pursued mr porter theyll ave to be put to bed  in the morning theyll ave to be got up and washed and dressed and given their breakfast and sent off to school  then theres shopping wot must be done and beds wot must be made  ill make ours said his wife decidedly  for my own sake  and wot about the others  inquired mr porter  the othersll be made by the same party as washes the children and cooks their dinner for em and puts em to bed and cleans the ouse was the reply  im not going to have your mother ere exclaimed mr porter with sudden heat  mind that  i dont want her said mrs porter  its a job for a strong healthy man not a pore old thing with swelled legs and short in the breath  strongealthyman  repeated her husband in a dazed voice strongeal  wot are you talking about  mrs porter beamed on him  you she said sweetly  there was a long silence broken at last by a firework display of expletives  mrs porter still smiling sat unmoved  you may smile  raved the indignant mr porter  you may sit there smiling and smoking like alike a man but if you think that im going to get the meals ready and soil my ands with making beds and washingup youre mistook  theres some usbands i know as would set about you  mrs porter rose  well i cant sit here gossiping with you all day she said entering the house  wot are you going to do  demanded her husband following her  going to see aunt jane and ave a bit o dinner with her was the reply  and after that i think i shall go to the pictures if you ave bloaters for dinner be very careful with little jemmy and the bones  i forbid you to leave this ouse  said mr porter in a thrilling voice  if you do you wont find nothing done when you come home and all the kids dirty and starving  cheerio said mrs porter  arrayed in her sunday best she left the house half an hour later  a glance over her shoulder revealed her husband huddled up in a chair in the dirty kitchen gazing straight before him at the empty grate  he made a hearty breakfast at a neighbouring coffeeshop and returning home lit the fire and sat before it smoking  the return of the four children from school soon after midday found him still wrestling with the difficulties of the situation  his announcement that their mother was out and that there would be no dinner was received at first in stupefied silence  then jemmy opening his mouth to its widest extent acted as conductor to an alltoowilling chorus  the noise was unbearable and mr porter said so  pleased with the tribute the choir redoubled its efforts and mr porter vociferating orders for silence saw only too clearly the base advantage his wife had taken of his affection for his children  he took some money from his pocket and sent the leading treble out marketing after which with the assistance of a soprano aged eight he washed up the breakfast things and placed one of them in the dustbin  the entire family stood at his elbow as he cooked the dinner and watched with bated breath his frantic efforts to recover a sausage which had fallen out of the fryingpan into the fire  a fourfold sigh of relief heralded its return to the pan  mother always began the eldest boy  mr porter took his scorched fingers out of his mouth and smacked the critics head  the dinner was not a success  portions of halfcooked sausages returned to the pan and coming back in the guise of cinders failed to find their rightful owners  last time we had sausages said the eightyearold muriel they melted in your mouth  mr porter glowered at her  instead of in the fire said the eldest boy with a mournful snigger  if i get up to you my lad said the harassed mr porter youll know it  pity you dont keep your sharpness for your lessons  wot country is africa in  why africas a continent  said the startled youth  jes so said his father but wot im asking you is wot country is it in  asia said the reckless one with a sideglance at muriel  and why couldnt you say so before demanded mr porter sternly now you go to the sink and give yourself a thorough good wash  and mind you come straight home from school  theres work to be done  he did some of it himself after the children had gone and finished up the afternoon with a little shopping in the course of which he twice changed his grocer and was threatened with an action for slander by his fishmonger  he returned home with his clothes bulging although a couple of eggs in the lefthand coatpocket had done their best to accommodate themselves to his figure  he went to bed at eleven oclock and at a quarter past clad all too lightly for the job sped rapidly downstairs to admit his wife  some usbands would ave let you sleep on the doorstep all night he said crisply  i know they would returned his wife cheerfully  thats why i married you  i remember the first time i let you come ome with me mother ses there aint much of im susan she ses still arf a loaf is better than  the bedroomdoor slammed behind the indignant mr porter and the three lumps and a depression which had once been a bed received his quivering frame again  with the sheet obstinately drawn over his head he turned a deaf ear to his wifes panegyrics on striking and her heartfelt tribute to the end of a perfect day  even when standing on the cold floor while she remade the bed he maintained an attitude of unbending dignity only relaxing when she smote him lightheartedly with the bolster  in a few illchosen words he expressed his opinion of her mother and her deplorable methods of bringing up her daughters  he rose early next morning and after getting his own breakfast put on his cap and went out closing the streetdoor with a bang that awoke the entire family and caused the somnolent mrs porter to open one eye for the purpose of winking with it  slowly as became a man of leisure he strolled down to the works and moving from knot to knot of his colleagues discussed the prospects of victory  later on with a little natural diffidence he drew mr bert robinson apart and asked his advice upon a situation which was growing more and more difficult  ive got my hands pretty full as it is you know said mr robinson hastily  i know you ave bert murmured the other  but you see she told me last night shes going to try and get some of the other chaps wives to join er so i thought i ought to tell you  mr robinson started  have you tried giving her a hiding he inquired  mr porter shook his head  i darent trust myself he replied  i might go too far once i started  what about appealing to her better nature inquired the other  she aint got one said the unfortunate  well im sorry for you said mr robinson but im busy  ive got to see a labourleader this afternoon and two reporters and this evening theres the meeting  try kindness first and if that dont do lock her up in her bedroom and keep her on bread and water  he moved off to confer with his supporters and mr porter after wandering aimlessly about for an hour or two returned home at midday with a faint hope that his wife might have seen the error of her ways and provided dinner for him  he found the house empty and the beds unmade the remains of breakfast stood on the kitchentable and a puddle of cold tea decorated the floor  the arrival of the children from school hungry and eager completed his discomfiture  for several days he wrestled grimly with the situation while mrs porter who had planned out her week into four days of charing two of amusement and sunday in bed looked on with smiling approval  she even offered to give him a little instructionverbalin scrubbing the kitchenfloor  mr porter who was on his knees at the time rose slowly to his full height and with a superb gesture emptied the bucket which also contained a scrubbingbrush and lump of soap into the backyard  then he set off down the street in quest of a staff  he found it in the person of maudie stevens aged fourteen who lived a few doors lower down  fresh from school the week before she cheerfully undertook to do the housework and cooking and to act as nursemaid in her spare time  her father on his part cheerfully undertook to take care of her wages for her the first weeks payable in advance being banked the same evening at the lord nelson  it was another mouth to feed but the strikepay was coming in very well and mr porter relieved from his unmanly tasks walked the streets a free man  beds were made without his interference meals were ready roughly at the appointed hour and for the first time since the strike he experienced satisfaction in finding fault with the cook  the childrens content was not so great maudie possessing a faith in the virtues of soap and water that they made no attempt to share  they were greatly relieved when their mother returned home after spending a couple of days with aunt jane  whats all this she demanded as she entered the kitchen followed by a ladyfriend  whats all what inquired mr porter who was sitting at dinner with the family  that said his wife pointing at the cookgeneral  mr porter put down his knife and fork  got er in to help he replied uneasily  do you hear that demanded his wife turning to her friend mrs gorman  oh these masters  ah  said her friend vaguely  a strikebreaker said mrs porter rolling her eyes  shame said mrs gorman beginning to understand  coming after my job and taking the bread out of my mouth continued mrs porter fluently  underselling me too ill be bound  thats what comes of not having pickets  unskilled labour said mrs gorman tightening her lips and shaking her head  a scab cried mrs porter wildly  a scab  put her out counselled her friend  put her out repeated mrs porter in a terrible voice  put her out ill tear her limb from limb  ill put her in the copper and boil her  her voice was so loud and her appearance so alarming that the unfortunate maudie emitting three piercing shrieks rose hastily from the table and looked around for a way of escape  the road to the frontdoor was barred and with a final yelp that set her employers teeth on edge she dashed into the yard and went home via the backfences  housewives busy in their kitchens looked up in amazement at the spectacle of a pair of thin black legs descending one fence scudding across the yard to the accompaniment of a terrified moaning and scrambling madly over the other  at her own backdoor maudie collapsed on the step and to the intense discomfort and annoyance of her father had her first fit of hysterics  and the next scab that comes into my house wont get off so easy said mrs porter to her husband  dyou understand  if you ad some husbands began mr porter trembling with rage  yes i know said his wife nodding  dont cry jemmy she added taking the youngest on her knee  mothers only having a little game she and dad are both on strike for more pay and less work  mr porter got up and without going through the formality of saying goodbye to the hardfeatured mrs gorman put on his cap and went out over a couple of halfpints taken as a sedative he realized the growing seriousness of his position  in a dull resigned fashion he took up his household duties again made harder now than before by the scandalous gossip of the aggrieved mr stevens  the anonymous present of a muchworn apron put the finishing touch to his discomfiture and the wellmeant offer of a fair neighbour to teach him how to shake a mat without choking himself met with a reception that took her breath away  it was a surprise to him one afternoon to find that his wife had so far unbent as to tidy up the parlour  ornaments had been dusted and polished and the carpet swept  she had even altered the position of the furniture  the table had been pushed against the wall and the easy chair with its back to the window stood stiffly confronting six or seven assorted chairs two of which at least had been promoted from a lower sphere  its for the meeting said muriel peeping in  meeting repeated her father in a dazed voice  strikemeetings was the reply  mrs gorman and some other ladies are coming at four oclock  didnt mother tell you  mr porter staring helplessly at the row of chairs shook his head  mrs evans is coming continued muriel in a hushed voicethe lady what punched mr brown because he kept bobbie evans in one day  he aint been kept in since  i wish you  she stopped suddenly and held by her fathers gaze backed slowly out of the room  mr porter left with the chairs stood regarding them thoughtfully  their emptiness made an appeal that no rightminded man could ignore  he put his hand over his mouth and his eyes watered  he spent the next halfhour in issuing invitations and at halfpast three every chair was filled by fellowstrikers  three cans of beer clay pipes and a paper of shag stood on the table  mr benjamin todd an obese freshcoloured gentleman of middle age took the easychair glasses and teacups were filled  gentlemen said mr todd lighting his pipe afore we get on to the business of this meeting i want to remind you that there is another meeting of ladies at four oclock so weve got to hurry up  o course if it should happen that we aint finished  go on bennie  said a delighted admirer  i see a female ead peeping in at the winder already said a voice  let em peep said mr todd benignly  then praps theyll be able to see how to run a meeting  theres two more eads said the other  oh lord i know i shant be able to keep a straight face  hsh  commanded mr todd sternly as the streetdoor was heard to open  beave yourself  as i was saying the thing weve got to consider about this strike  the door opened and six ladies headed by mrs porter entered the room in single file and ranged themselves silently along the wall  strike proceeded mr todd who found himself gazing uneasily into the eyes of mrs gormanstrikeerstrike  he said that before said a stout lady in a loud whisper im sure he did  is continued mr todd that we have got to keep thisthiser  strike prompted the same voice  mr todd paused and wiping his mouth with a red pockethandkerchief sat staring straight before him  i move said mrs evans her sharp features twitching with excitement that mrs gorman takes the chair  ow can i take it when hes sitting in it  demanded that lady  shes a lady that knows what she wants and how to get it pursued mrs evans unheeding  she understands men  ive buried two usbands murmured mrs gorman nodding  and how to manage them continued mrs evans  i move that mrs gorman takes the chair  those in favour  mr todd leaning back in his chair and gripping the arms gazed defiantly at a row of palms  carried unanimously  snapped mrs evans  mrs gorman tall and bony advanced and stood over mr todd  strong men held their breath  its my chair she said gruffly  ive been moved into it  possession said mr todd in as firm a voice as he could manage is nine points of the law  im here and  mrs gorman turned and without the slightest warning sat down suddenly and heavily in his lap  a hum of admiration greeted the achievement  get up  shouted the horrified mr todd  get up  mrs gorman settled herself more firmly  let me get up said mr todd panting  mrs gorman rose but remained in a hovering position between which and the chair mr todd flushed and dishevelled extricated himself in all haste  a shrill titter of laughter and a clapping of hands greeted his appearance  he turned furiously on the pallid mr porter  what dyou mean by it  he demanded  are you the master or aint you  a man what cant keep order in his own house aint fit to be called a man  if my wife was carrying on like this  i wish i was your wife said mrs gorman moistening her lips  mr todd turned slowly and surveyed her  i dont he said simply and being by this time near the door faded gently from the room  order  cried mrs gorman thumping the arm of her chair with a large hardworking fist  take your seats ladies  a strange thrill passed through the bodies of her companions and communicated itself to the men in the chairs  there was a moments tense pause and then the end man muttering something about going to see what had happened to poor old ben todd rose slowly and went out  his companions with heads erect and a look of cold disdain upon their faces followed him  it was mr porters last meeting but his wife had several more  they lasted in fact until the day a fortnight later when he came in with flushed face and sparkling eyes to announce that the strike was over and the men victorious  six bob a week more  he said with enthusiasm  you see i was right to strike after all  mrs porter eyed him  i am out for four bob a week more she said calmly  her husband swallowed  youyou dont understand ow these things are done he said at last  it takes time  we ought to nenegotiate  all right said mrs porter readily  seven shillings a week then  lets say four and have done with it exclaimed the other hastily  and mrs porter said it
