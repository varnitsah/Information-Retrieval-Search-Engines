ragged boy of the man who opened the great gate at which the omnibus left him  yes who sent you  mr laurence i have got a letter for the lady  all right go up to the house and give it to her shell see to you little chap  the man spoke pleasantly and the boy went on feeling much cheered by the words through the soft spring rain that fell on sprouting grass and budding trees nat saw a large square house before him a hospitablelooking house with an oldfashioned porch wide steps and lights shining in many windows neither curtains nor shutters hid the cheerful glimmer and pausing a moment before he rang nat saw many little shadows dancing on the walls heard the pleasant hum of young voices and felt that it was hardly possible that the light and warmth and comfort within could be for a homeless little chap like him  i hope the lady will see to me he thought and gave a timid rap with the great bronze knocker which was a jovial griffins head  a rosyfaced servantmaid opened the door and smiled as she took the letter which he silently offered she seemed used to receiving strange boys for she pointed to a seat in the hall and said with a nod  sit there and drip on the mat a bit while i take this in to missis  nat found plenty to amuse him while he waited and stared about him curiously enjoying the view yet glad to do so unobserved in the dusky recess by the door  the house seemed swarming with boys who were beguiling the rainy twilight with all sorts of amusements there were boys everywhere upstairs and downstairs and in the ladys chamber apparently for various open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys little boys and middlesized boys in all stages of evening relaxation not to say effervescence two large rooms on the right were evidently schoolrooms for desks maps blackboards and books were scattered about an open fire burned on the hearth and several indolent lads lay on their backs before it discussing a new cricketground with such animation that their boots waved in the air a tall youth was practising on the flute in one corner quite undisturbed by the racket all about him two or three others were jumping over the desks pausing now and then to get their breath and laugh at the droll sketches of a little wag who was caricaturing the whole household on a blackboard  in the room on the left a long suppertable was seen set forth with great pitchers of new milk piles of brown and white bread and perfect stacks of the shiny gingerbread so dear to boyish souls a flavor of toast was in the air also suggestions of baked apples very tantalizing to one hungry little nose and stomach  the hall however presented the most inviting prospect of all for a brisk game of tag was going on in the upper entry one landing was devoted to marbles the other to checkers while the stairs were occupied by a boy reading a girl singing a lullaby to her doll two puppies a kitten and a constant succession of small boys sliding down the banisters to the great detriment of their clothes and danger to their limbs  so absorbed did nat become in this exciting race that he ventured farther and farther out of his corner and when one very lively boy came down so swiftly that he could not stop himself but fell off the banisters with a crash that would have broken any head but one rendered nearly as hard as a cannonball by eleven years of constant bumping nat forgot himself and ran up to the fallen rider expecting to find him halfdead the boy however only winked rapidly for a second then lay calmly looking up at the new face with a surprised hullo  hullo returned nat not knowing what else to say and thinking that form of reply both brief and easy  are you a new boy asked the recumbent youth without stirring  dont know yet  whats your name  nat blake  mines tommy bangs come up and have a go will you and tommy got upon his legs like one suddenly remembering the duties of hospitality  guess i wont till i see whether im going to stay or not returned nat feeling the desire to stay increase every moment  i say demi heres a new one come and see to him and the lively thomas returned to his sport with unabated relish  at his call the boy reading on the stairs looked up with a pair of big brown eyes and after an instants pause as if a little shy he put the book under his arm and came soberly down to greet the newcomer who found something very attractive in the pleasant face of this slender mildeyed boy  have you seen aunt jo he asked as if that was some sort of important ceremony  i havent seen anybody yet but you boys im waiting answered nat  did uncle laurie send you proceeded demi politely but gravely  mr laurence did  he is uncle laurie and he always sends nice boys  nat looked gratified at the remark and smiled in a way that made his thin face very pleasant he did not know what to say next so the two stood staring at one another in friendly silence till the little girl came up with her doll in her arms she was very like demi only not so tall and had a rounder rosier face and blue eyes  this is my sister daisy announced demi as if presenting a rare and precious creature  the children nodded to one another and the little girls face dimpled with pleasure as she said affably  i hope youll stay we have such good times here dont we demi  of course we do thats what aunt jo has plumfield for  it seems a very nice place indeed observed nat feeling that he must respond to these amiable young persons  its the nicest place in the world isnt it demi said daisy who evidently regarded her brother as authority on all subjects  no i think greenland where the icebergs and seals are is more interesting but im fond of plumfield and it is a very nice place to be in returned demi who was interested just now in a book on greenland he was about to offer to show nat the pictures and explain them when the servant returned saying with a nod toward the parlordoor  all right you are to stop  im glad now come to aunt jo and daisy took him by the hand with a pretty protecting air which made nat feel at home at once  demi returned to his beloved book while his sister led the newcomer into a back room where a stout gentleman was frolicking with two little boys on the sofa and a thin lady was just finishing the letter which she seemed to have been rereading  here he is aunty cried daisy  so this is my new boy i am glad to see you my dear and hope youll be happy here said the lady drawing him to her and stroking back the hair from his forehead with a kind hand and a motherly look which made nats lonely little heart yearn toward her  she was not at all handsome but she had a merry sort of face that never seemed to have forgotten certain childish ways and looks any more than her voice and manner had and these things hard to describe but very plain to see and feel made her a genial comfortable kind of person easy to get on with and generally jolly as boys would say she saw the little tremble of nats lips as she smoothed his hair and her keen eyes grew softer but she only drew the shabby figure nearer and said laughing  i am mother bhaer that gentleman is father bhaer and these are the two little bhaers come here boys and see nat  the three wrestlers obeyed at once and the stout man with a chubby child on each shoulder came up to welcome the new boy rob and teddy merely grinned at him but mr bhaer shook hands and pointing to a low chair near the fire said in a cordial voice  there is a place all ready for thee my son sit down and dry thy wet feet at once  wet so they are my dear off with your shoes this minute and ill have some dry things ready for you in a jiffy cried mrs bhaer bustling about so energetically that nat found himself in the cosy little chair with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet before he would have had time to say jack robinson if he had wanted to try he said thank you maam instead and said it so gratefully that mrs bhaers eyes grew soft again and she said something merry because she felt so tender which was a way she had  there are tommy bangs slippers but he never will remember to put them on in the house so he shall not have them they are too big but thats all the better you cant run away from us so fast as if they fitted  i dont want to run away maam and nat spread his grimy little hands before the comfortable blaze with a long sigh of satisfaction  thats good now i am going to toast you well and try to get rid of that ugly cough how long have you had it dear asked mrs bhaer as she rummaged in her big basket for a strip of flannel  all winter i got cold and it wouldnt get better somehow  no wonder living in that damp cellar with hardly a rag to his poor dear back said mrs bhaer in a low tone to her husband who was looking at the boy with a skillful pair of eyes that marked the thin temples and feverish lips as well as the hoarse voice and frequent fits of coughing that shook the bent shoulders under the patched jacket  robin my man trot up to nursey and tell her to give thee the coughbottle and the liniment said mr bhaer after his eyes had exchanged telegrams with his wifes  nat looked a little anxious at the preparations but forgot his fears in a hearty laugh when mrs bhaer whispered to him with a droll look  hear my rogue teddy try to cough the syrup im going to give you has honey in it and he wants some  little ted was red in the face with his exertions by the time the bottle came and was allowed to suck the spoon after nat had manfully taken a dose and had the bit of flannel put about his throat  these first steps toward a cure were hardly completed when a great bell rang and a loud tramping through the hall announced supper bashful nat quaked at the thought of meeting many strange boys but mrs bhaer held out her hand to him and rob said patronizingly dont be fraid ill take care of you  twelve boys six on a side stood behind their chairs prancing with impatience to begin while the tall fluteplaying youth was trying to curb their ardor but no one sat down till mrs bhaer was in her place behind the teapot with teddy on her left and nat on her right  this is our new boy nat blake after supper you can say how do you do gently boys gently  as she spoke every one stared at nat and then whisked into their seats trying to be orderly and failing utterly the bhaers did their best to have the lads behave well at meal times and generally succeeded pretty well for their rules were few and sensible and the boys knowing that they tried to make things easy and happy did their best to obey but there are times when hungry boys cannot be repressed without real cruelty and saturday evening after a halfholiday was one of those times  dear little souls do let them have one day in which they can howl and racket and frolic to their hearts content a holiday isnt a holiday without plenty of freedom and fun and they shall have full swing once a week mrs bhaer used to say when prim people wondered why banistersliding pillowfights and all manner of jovial games were allowed under the once decorous roof of plumfield  it did seem at times as if the aforesaid roof was in danger of flying off but it never did for a word from father bhaer could at any time produce a lull and the lads had learned that liberty must not be abused so in spite of many dark predictions the school flourished and manners and morals were insinuated without the pupils exactly knowing how it was done  nat found himself very well off behind the tall pitchers with tommy bangs just around the corner and mrs bhaer close by to fill up plate and mug as fast as he could empty them  who is that boy next the girl down at the other end whispered nat to his young neighbor under cover of a general laugh  thats demi brooke mr bhaer is his uncle  what a queer name  his real name is john but they call him demijohn because his father is john too thats a joke dont you see said tommy kindly explaining nat did not see but politely smiled and asked with interest  isnt he a very nice boy  i bet you he is knows lots and reads like any thing  who is the fat one next him  oh thats stuffy cole his name is george but we call him stuffy cause he eats so much the little fellow next father bhaer is his boy rob and then theres big franz his nephew he teaches some and kind of sees to us  he plays the flute doesnt he asked nat as tommy rendered himself speechless by putting a whole baked apple into his mouth at one blow  tommy nodded and said sooner than one would have imagined possible under the circumstances oh dont he though and we dance sometimes and do gymnastics to music i like a drum myself and mean to learn as soon as ever i can  i like a fiddle best i can play one too said nat getting confidential on this attractive subject  can you and tommy stared over the rim of his mug with round eyes full of interest mr bhaers got an old fiddle and hell let you play on it if you want to  could i oh i would like it ever so much you see i used to go round fiddling with my father and another man till he died  wasnt that fun cried tommy much impressed  no it was horrid so cold in winter and hot in summer and i got tired and they were cross sometimes and i didnt get enough to eat nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread as if to assure himself that the hard times were over and then he added regretfully but i did love my little fiddle and i miss it nicolo took it away when father died and wouldnt have me any longer cause i was sick  youll belong to the band if you play good see if you dont  do you have a band here nats eyes sparkled  guess we do a jolly band all boys and they have concerts and things you just see what happens tomorrow night  after this pleasantly exciting remark tommy returned to his supper and nat sank into a blissful reverie over his full plate  mrs bhaer had heard all they said while apparently absorbed in filling mugs and overseeing little ted who was so sleepy that he put his spoon in his eye nodded like a rosy poppy and finally fell fast asleep with his cheek pillowed on a soft bun mrs bhaer had put nat next to tommy because that rolypoly boy had a frank and social way with him very attractive to shy persons nat felt this and had made several small confidences during supper which gave mrs bhaer the key to the new boys character better than if she had talked to him herself  in the letter which mr laurence had sent with nat he had said  dear jo here is a case after your own heart this poor lad is an orphan now sick and friendless he has been a streetmusician and i found him in a cellar mourning for his dead father and his lost violin i think there is something in him and have a fancy that between us we may give this little man a lift you cure his overtasked body fritz help his neglected mind and when he is ready ill see if he is a genius or only a boy with a talent which may earn his bread for him give him a trial for the sake of your own boy  teddy  of course we will cried mrs bhaer as she read the letter and when she saw nat she felt at once that whether he was a genius or not here was a lonely sick boy who needed just what she loved to give a home and motherly care both she and mr bhaer observed him quietly and in spite of ragged clothes awkward manners and a dirty face they saw much about nat that pleased them he was a thin pale boy of twelve with blue eyes and a good forehead under the rough neglected hair an anxious scared face at times as if he expected hard words or blows and a sensitive mouth that trembled when a kind glance fell on him while a gentle speech called up a look of gratitude very sweet to see bless the poor dear he shall fiddle all day long if he likes said mrs bhaer to herself as she saw the eager happy expression on his face when tommy talked of the band  so after supper when the lads flocked into the schoolroom for more high jinks mrs jo appeared with a violin in her hand and after a word with her husband went to nat who sat in a corner watching the scene with intense interest  now my lad give us a little tune we want a violin in our band and i think you will do it nicely  she expected that he would hesitate but he seized the old fiddle at once and handled it with such loving care it was plain to see that music was his passion  ill do the best i can maam was all he said and then drew the bow across the strings as if eager to hear the dear notes again  there was a great clatter in the room but as if deaf to any sounds but those he made nat played softly to himself forgetting every thing in his delight it was only a simple negro melody such as streetmusicians play but it caught the ears of the boys at once and silenced them till they stood listening with surprise and pleasure gradually they got nearer and nearer and mr bhaer came up to watch the boy for as if he was in his element now nat played away and never minded any one while his eyes shone his cheeks reddened and his thin fingers flew as he hugged the old fiddle and made it speak to all their hearts the language that he loved  a hearty round of applause rewarded him better than a shower of pennies when he stopped and glanced about him as if to say  ive done my best please like it  i say you do that first rate cried tommy who considered nat his protege  you shall be the first fiddle in my band added franz with an approving smile  mrs bhaer whispered to her husband  teddy is right theres something in the child and mr bhaer nodded his head emphatically as he clapped nat on the shoulder saying heartily  you play well my son come now and play something which we can sing  it was the proudest happiest minute of the poor boys life when he was led to the place of honor by the piano and the lads gathered round never heeding his poor clothes but eying him respectfully and waiting eagerly to hear him play again  they chose a song he knew and after one or two false starts they got going and violin flute and piano led a chorus of boyish voices that made the old roof ring again it was too much for nat more feeble than he knew and as the final shout died away his face began to work he dropped the fiddle and turning to the wall sobbed like a little child  my dear what is it asked mrs bhaer who had been singing with all her might and trying to keep little rob from beating time with his boots  you are all so kind and its so beautiful i cant help it sobbed nat coughing till he was breathless  come with me dear you must go to bed and rest you are worn out and this is too noisy a place for you whispered mrs bhaer and took him away to her own parlor where she let him cry himself quiet  then she won him to tell her all his troubles and listened to the little story with tears in her own eyes though it was not a new one to her  my child you have got a father and a mother now and this is home dont think of those sad times any more but get well and happy and be sure you shall never suffer again if we can help it this place is made for all sorts of boys to have a good time in and to learn how to help themselves and be useful men i hope you shall have as much music as you want only you must get strong first now come up to nursey and have a bath and then go to bed and tomorrow we will lay some nice little plans together  nat held her hand fast in his but had not a word to say and let his grateful eyes speak for him as mrs bhaer led him up to a big room where they found a stout german woman with a face so round and cheery that it looked like a sort of sun with the wide frill of her cap for rays  this is nursey hummel and she will give you a nice bath and cut your hair and make you all comfy as rob says thats the bathroom in there and on saturday nights we scrub all the little lads first and pack them away in bed before the big ones get through singing now then rob in with you  as she talked mrs bhaer had whipped off robs clothes and popped him into a long bathtub in the little room opening into the nursery  there were two tubs besides footbaths basins douchepipes and all manner of contrivances for cleanliness nat was soon luxuriating in the other bath and while simmering there he watched the performances of the two women who scrubbed clean nightgowned and bundled into bed four or five small boys who of course cut up all sorts of capers during the operation and kept every one in a gale of merriment till they were extinguished in their beds  by the time nat was washed and done up in a blanket by the fire while nursey cut his hair a new detachment of boys arrived and were shut into the bathroom where they made as much splashing and noise as a school of young whales at play  nat had better sleep here so that if his cough troubles him in the night you can see that he takes a good draught of flaxseed tea said mrs bhaer who was flying about like a distracted hen with a large brood of lively ducklings  nursey approved the plan finished nat off with a flannel nightgown a drink of something warm and sweet and then tucked him into one of the three little beds standing in the room where he lay looking like a contented mummy and feeling that nothing more in the way of luxury could be offered him cleanliness in itself was a new and delightful sensation flannel gowns were unknown comforts in his world sips of good stuff soothed his cough as pleasantly as kind words did his lonely heart and the feeling that somebody cared for him made that plain room seem a sort of heaven to the homeless child it was like a cosy dream and he often shut his eyes to see if it would not vanish when he opened them again it was too pleasant to let him sleep and he could not have done so if he had tried for in a few minutes one of the peculiar institutions of plumfield was revealed to his astonished but appreciative eyes  a momentary lull in the aquatic exercises was followed by the sudden appearance of pillows flying in all directions hurled by white goblins who came rioting out of their beds the battle raged in several rooms all down the upper hall and even surged at intervals into the nursery when some hardpressed warrior took refuge there no one seemed to mind this explosion in the least no one forbade it or even looked surprised nursey went on hanging up towels and mrs bhaer laid out clean clothes as calmly as if the most perfect order reigned nay she even chased one daring boy out of the room and fired after him the pillow he had slyly thrown at her  wont they hurt em asked nat who lay laughing with all his might  oh dear no we always allow one pillowfight saturday night the cases are changed tomorrow and it gets up a glow after the boys baths so i rather like it myself said mrs bhaer busy again among her dozen pairs of socks  what a very nice school this is observed nat in a burst of admiration  its an odd one laughed mrs bhaer but you see we dont believe in making children miserable by too many rules and too much study i forbade nightgown parties at first but bless you it was of no use i could no more keep those boys in their beds than so many jacks in the box so i made an agreement with them i was to allow a fifteenminute pillowfight every saturday night and they promised to go properly to bed every other night i tried it and it worked well if they dont keep their word no frolic if they do i just turn the glasses round put the lamps in safe places and let them rampage as much as they like  its a beautiful plan said nat feeling that he should like to join in the fray but not venturing to propose it the first night so he lay enjoying the spectacle which certainly was a lively one  tommy bangs led the assailing party and demi defended his own room with a dogged courage fine to see collecting pillows behind him as fast as they were thrown till the besiegers were out of ammunition when they would charge upon him in a body and recover their arms a few slight accidents occurred but nobody minded and gave and took sounding thwacks with perfect good humor while pillows flew like big snowflakes till mrs bhaer looked at her watch and called out  time is up boys into bed every man jack or pay the forfeit  what is the forfeit asked nat sitting up in his eagerness to know what happened to those wretches who disobeyed this most peculiar but publicspirited schoolmaam  lose their fun next time answered mrs bhaer i give them five minutes to settle down then put out the lights and expect order they are honorable lads and they keep their word  that was evident for the battle ended as abruptly as it began a parting shot or two a final cheer as demi fired the seventh pillow at the retiring foe a few challenges for next time then order prevailed and nothing but an occasional giggle or a suppressed whisper broke the quiet which followed the saturdaynight frolic as mother bhaer kissed her new boy and left him to happy dreams of life at plumfield    chapter ii the boys  while nat takes a good long sleep i will tell my little readers something about the boys among whom he found himself when he woke up  to begin with our old friends franz was a tall lad of sixteen now a regular german big blond and bookish also very domestic amiable and musical his uncle was fitting him for college and his aunt for a happy home of his own hereafter because she carefully fostered in him gentle manners love of children respect for women old and young and helpful ways about the house he was her righthand man on all occasions steady kind and patient and he loved his merry aunt like a mother for such she had tried to be to him  emil was quite different being quicktempered restless and enterprising bent on going to sea for the blood of the old vikings stirred in his veins and could not be tamed his uncle promised that he should go when he was sixteen and set him to studying navigation gave him stories of good and famous admirals and heroes to read and let him lead the life of a frog in river pond and brook when lessons were done his room looked like the cabin of a manofwar for every thing was nautical military and shipshape captain kyd was his delight and his favorite amusement was to rig up like that piratical gentleman and roar out sanguinary seasongs at the top of his voice he would dance nothing but sailors hornpipes rolled in his gait and was as nautical in conversation to his uncle would permit the boys called him commodore and took great pride in his fleet which whitened the pond and suffered disasters that would have daunted any commander but a seastruck boy  demi was one of the children who show plainly the effect of intelligent love and care for soul and body worked harmoniously together the natural refinement which nothing but home influence can teach gave him sweet and simple manners his mother had cherished an innocent and loving heart in him his father had watched over the physical growth of his boy and kept the little body straight and strong on wholesome food and exercise and sleep while grandpa march cultivated the little mind with the tender wisdom of a modern pythagoras not tasking it with long hard lessons parrotlearned but helping it to unfold as naturally and beautifully as sun and dew help roses bloom he was not a perfect child by any means but his faults were of the better sort and being early taught the secret of selfcontrol he was not left at the mercy of appetites and passions as some poor little mortals are and then punished for yielding to the temptations against which they have no armor a quiet quaint boy was demi serious yet cheery quite unconscious that he was unusually bright and beautiful yet quick to see and love intelligence or beauty in other children very fond of books and full of lively fancies born of a strong imagination and a spiritual nature these traits made his parents anxious to balance them with useful knowledge and healthful society lest they should make him one of those pale precocious children who amaze and delight a family sometimes and fade away like hothouse flowers because the young soul blooms too soon and has not a hearty body to root it firmly in the wholesome soil of this world  so demi was transplanted to plumfield and took so kindly to the life there that meg and john and grandpa felt satisfied that they had done well mixing with other boys brought out the practical side of him roused his spirit and brushed away the pretty cobwebs he was so fond of spinning in that little brain of his to be sure he rather shocked his mother when he came home by banging doors saying by george emphatically and demanding tall thick boots that clumped like papas but john rejoiced over him laughed at his explosive remarks got the boots and said contentedly  he is doing well so let him clump i want my son to be a manly boy and this temporary roughness wont hurt him we can polish him up by and by and as for learning he will pick that up as pigeons do peas so dont hurry him  daisy was as sunshiny and charming as ever with all sorts of womanlinesses budding in her for she was like her gentle mother and delighted in domestic things she had a family of dolls whom she brought up in the most exemplary manner she could not get on without her little workbasket and bits of sewing which she did so nicely that demi frequently pulled out his handkerchief display her neat stitches and baby josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by sister daisy she like to quiddle about the chinacloset prepare the saltcellars put the spoons straight on the table and every day went round the parlor with her brush dusting chairs and tables demi called her a betty but was very glad to have her keep his things in order lend him her nimble fingers in all sorts of work and help him with his lessons for they kept abreast there and had no thought of rivalry  the love between them was as strong as ever and no one could laugh demi out of his affectionate ways with daisy he fought her battles valiantly and never could understand why boys should be ashamed to say right out that they loved their sisters daisy adored her twin thought my brother the most remarkable boy in the world and every morning in her little wrapper trotted to tap at his door with a motherly get up my dear its most breakfast time and heres your clean collar  rob was an energetic morsel of a boy who seemed to have discovered the secret of perpetual motion for he never was still fortunately he was not mischievous nor very brave so he kept out of trouble pretty well and vibrated between father and mother like an affectionate little pendulum with a lively tick for rob was a chatterbox  teddy was too young to play a very important part in the affairs of plumfield yet he had his little sphere and filled it beautifully every one felt the need of a pet at times and baby was always ready to accommodate for kissing and cuddling suited him excellently mrs jo seldom stirred without him so he had his little finger in all the domestic pies and every one found them all the better for it for they believed in babies at plumfield  dick brown and adolphus or dolly pettingill were two eight yearolds dolly stuttered badly but was gradually getting over it for no one was allowed to mock him and mr bhaer tried to cure it by making him talk slowly dolly was a good little lad quite uninteresting and ordinary but he flourished here and went through his daily duties and pleasures with placid content and propriety  dick browns affliction was a crooked back yet he bore his burden so cheerfully that demi once asked in his queer way do humps make people goodnatured id like one if they do dick was always merry and did his best to be like other boys for a plucky spirit lived in the feeble little body when he first came he was very sensitive about his misfortune but soon learned to forget it for no one dared remind him of it after mr bhaer had punished one boy for laughing at him  god dont care for my soul is straight if my back isnt sobbed dick to his tormentor on that occasion and by cherishing this idea the bhaers soon led him to believe that people also loved his soul and did not mind his body except to pity and help him to bear it  playing menagerie once with the others some one said  what animal will you be dick  oh im the dromedary dont you see the hump on my back was the laughing answer  so you are my nice little one that dont carry loads but marches by the elephant first in the procession said demi who was arranging the spectacle  i hope others will be as kind to the poor dear as my boys have learned to be said mrs jo quite satisfied with the success of her teaching as dick ambled past her looking like a very happy but a very feeble little dromedary beside stout stuffy who did the elephant with ponderous propriety  jack ford was a sharp rather a sly lad who was sent to this school because it was cheap many men would have thought him a smart boy but mr bhaer did not like his way of illustrating that yankee word and thought his unboyish keenness and moneyloving as much of an affliction as dollys stutter or dicks hump  ned barker was like a thousand other boys of fourteen all legs blunder and bluster indeed the family called him the blunderbuss and always expected to see him tumble over the chairs bump against the tables and knock down any small articles near him he bragged a good deal about what he could do but seldom did any thing to prove it was not brave and a little given to taletelling he was apt to bully the small boys and flatter the big ones and without being at all bad was just the sort of fellow who could very easily be led astray  george cole had been spoilt by an overindulgent mother who stuffed him with sweetmeats till he was sick and then thought him too delicate to study so that at twelve years old he was a pale puffy boy dull fretful and lazy a friend persuaded her to send him to plumfield and there he soon got waked up for sweet things were seldom allowed much exercise required and study made so pleasant that stuffy was gently lured along till he quite amazed his anxious mamma by his improvement and convinced her that there was really something remarkable in plumfield air  billy ward was what the scotch tenderly call an innocent for though thirteen years old he was like a child of six he had been an unusually intelligent boy and his father had hurried him on too fast giving him all sorts of hard lessons keeping at his books six hours a day and expecting him to absorb knowledge as a strasburg goose does the food crammed down its throat he thought he was doing his duty but he nearly killed the boy for a fever gave the poor child a sad holiday and when he recovered the overtasked brain gave out and billys mind was like a slate over which a sponge has passed leaving it blank  it was a terrible lesson to his ambitious father he could not bear the sight of his promising child changed to a feeble idiot and he sent him away to plumfield scarcely hoping that he could be helped but sure that he would be kindly treated quite docile and harmless was billy and it was pitiful to see how hard he tried to learn as if groping dimly after the lost knowledge which had cost him so much  day after day he pored over the alphabet proudly said a and b and thought that he knew them but on the morrow they were gone and all the work was to be done over again mr bhaer had infinite patience with him and kept on in spite of the apparent hopelessness of the task not caring for book lessons but trying gently to clear away the mists from the darkened mind and give it back intelligence enough to make the boy less a burden and an affliction  mrs bhaer strengthened his health by every aid she could invent and the boys all pitied and were kind to him he did not like their active plays but would sit for hours watching the doves would dig holes for teddy till even that ardent grubber was satisfied or follow silas the man from place to place seeing him work for honest si was very good to him and though he forgot his letters billy remembered friendly faces  tommy bangs was the scapegrace of the school and the most trying scapegrace that ever lived as full of mischief as a monkey yet so goodhearted that one could not help forgiving his tricks so scatterbrained that words went by him like the wind yet so penitent for every misdeed that it was impossible to keep sober when he vowed tremendous vows of reformation or proposed all sorts of queer punishments to be inflicted upon himself mr and mrs bhaer lived in a state of preparation for any mishap from the breaking of tommys own neck to the blowing up of the entire family with gunpowder and nursey had a particular drawer in which she kept bandages plasters and salves for his especial use for tommy was always being brought in half dead but nothing ever killed him and he arose from every downfall with redoubled vigor  the first day he came he chopped the top off one finger in the haycutter and during the week fell from the shed roof was chased by an angry hen who tried to pick his out because he examined her chickens got run away with and had his ears boxed violent by asia who caught him luxuriously skimming a pan of cream with half a stolen pie undaunted however by any failures or rebuffs this indomitable youth went on amusing himself with all sorts of tricks till no one felt safe if he did not know his lessons he always had some droll excuse to offer and as he was usually clever at his books and as bright as a button in composing answers when he did not know them he go on pretty well at school but out of school ye gods and little fishes how tommy did carouse  he wound fat asia up in her own clothes line against the post and left here there to fume and scold for half an hour one busy monday morning he dropped a hot cent down mary anns back as that pretty maid was waiting at table one day when there were gentlemen to dinner whereat the poor girl upset the soup and rushed out of the room in dismay leaving the family to think that she had gone mad he fixed a pail of water up in a tree with a bit of ribbon fastened to the handle and when daisy attracted by the gay streamer tried to pull it down she got a douche bath that spoiled her clean frock and hurt her little feelings very much he put rough white pebbles in the sugarbowl when his grandmother came to tea and the poor old lady wondered why they didnt melt in her cup but was too polite to say anything he passed around snuff in church so that five of the boys sneezed with such violence they had to go out he dug paths in winter time and then privately watered them so that people should tumble down he drove poor silas nearly wild by hanging his big boots in conspicuous places for his feet were enormous and he was very much ashamed of them he persuaded confiding little dolly to tie a thread to one of his loose teeth and leave the string hanging from his mouth when he went to sleep so that tommy could pull it out without his feeling the dreaded operation but the tooth wouldnt come at the first tweak and poor dolly woke up in great anguish of spirit and lost all faith in tommy from that day forth  the last prank had been to give the hens bread soaked in rum which made them tipsy and scandalized all the other fowls for the respectable old biddies went staggering about pecking and clucking in the most maudlin manner while the family were convulsed with laughter at their antics till daisy took pity on them and shut them up in the henhouse to sleep off their intoxication  these were the boys and they lived together as happy as twelve lads could studying and playing working and squabbling fighting faults and cultivating virtues in the good oldfashioned way boys at other schools probably learned more from books but less of that better wisdom which makes good men latin greek and mathematics were all very well but in professor bhaers opinion self knowledge selfhelp and selfcontrol were more important and he tried to teach them carefully people shook their heads sometimes at his ideas even while they owned that the boys improved wonderfully in manners and morals but then as mrs jo said to nat it was an odd school    chapter iii sunday  the moment the bell rang next morning nat flew out of bed and dressed himself with great satisfaction in the suit of clothes he found on the chair they were not new being halfworn garments of one of the welltodo boys but mrs bhaer kept all such castoff feathers for the picked robins who strayed into her nest they were hardly on when tommy appeared in a high state of clean collar and escorted nat down to breakfast  the sun was shining into the diningroom on the wellspread table and the flock of hungry hearty lads who gathered round it nat observed that they were much more orderly than they had been the night before and every one stood silently behind his chair while little rob standing beside his father at the head of the table folded his hands reverently bent his curly head and softly repeated a short grace in the devout german fashion which mr bhaer loved and taught his little son to honor then they all sat down to enjoy the sundaymorning breakfast of coffee steak and baked potatoes instead of the bread and milk fare with which they usually satisfied their young appetites there was much pleasant talk while the knives and forks rattled briskly for certain sunday lessons were to be learned the sunday walk settled and plans for the week discussed as he listened nat thought it seemed as if this day must be a very pleasant one for he loved quiet and there was a cheerful sort of hush over every thing that pleased him very much because in spite of his rough life the boy possessed the sensitive nerves which belong to a musicloving nature  now my lads get your morning jobs done and let me find you ready for church when the bus comes round said father bhaer and set the example by going into the schoolroom to get books ready for the morrow  every one scattered to his or her task for each had some little daily duty and was expected to perform it faithfully some brought wood and water brushed the steps or ran errands for mrs bhaer others fed the pet animals and did chores about the barn with franz daisy washed the cups and demi wiped them for the twins liked to work together and demi had been taught to make himself useful in the little house at home even baby teddy had his small job to do and trotted to and fro putting napkins away and pushing chairs into their places for half and hour the lads buzzed about like a hive of bees then the bus drove round father bhaer and franz with the eight older boys piled in and away they went for a threemile drive to church in town  because of the troublesome cough nat prefered to stay at home with the four small boys and spent a happy morning in mrs bhaers room listening to the stories she read them learning the hymns she taught them and then quietly employing himself pasting pictures into an old ledger  this is my sunday closet she said showing him shelves filled with picturebooks paintboxes architectural blocks little diaries and materials for letterwriting i want my boys to love sunday to find it a peaceful pleasant day when they can rest from common study and play yet enjoy quiet pleasures and learn in simple ways lessons more important than any taught in school do you understand me she asked watching nats attentive face  you mean to be good he said after hesitating a minute  yes to be good and to love to be good it is hard work sometimes i know very well but we all help one another and so we get on this is one of the ways in which i try to help my boys and she took down a thick book which seemed halffull of writing and opened at a page on which there was one word at the top  why thats my name cried nat looking both surprised and interested  yes i have a page for each boy i keep a little account of how he gets on through the week and sunday night i show him the record if it is bad i am sorry and disappointed if it is good i am glad and proud but whichever it is the boys know i want to help them and they try to do their best for love of me and father bhaer  i should think they would said nat catching a glimpse of tommys name opposite his own and wondering what was written under it  mrs bhaer saw his eye on the words and shook her head saying as she turned a leaf  no i dont show my records to any but the one to whom each belongs i call this my conscience book and only you and i will ever know what is to be written on the page below your name whether you will be pleased or ashamed to read it next sunday depends on yourself i think it will be a good report at any rate i shall try to make things easy for you in this new place and shall be quite contented if you keep our few rules live happily with the boys and learn something  ill try maam and nats thin face flushed up with the earnestness of his desire to make mrs bhaer glad and proud not sorry and disappointed it must be a great deal of trouble to write about so many he added as she shut her book with an encouraging pat on the shoulder  not to me for i really dont know which i like best writing or boys she said laughing to see nat stare with astonishment at the last item yes i know many people think boys are a nuisance but that is because they dont understand them i do and i never saw the boy yet whom i could not get on capitally with after i had once found the soft spot in his heart bless me i couldnt get on at all without my flock of dear noisy naughty harumscarum little lads could i my teddy and mrs bhaer hugged the young rogue just in time to save the big inkstand from going into his pocket  nat who had never heard anything like this before really did not know whether mother bhaer was a trifle crazy or the most delightful woman he had ever met he rather inclined to the latter opinion in spite of her peculiar tastes for she had a way of filling up a fellows plate before he asked of laughing at his jokes gently tweaking him by the ear or clapping him on the shoulder that nat found very engaging  now i think you would like to go into the schoolroom and practise some of the hymns we are to sing tonight she said rightly guessing the thing of all others that he wanted to do  alone with the beloved violin and the musicbook propped up before him in the sunny window while spring beauty filled the world outside and sabbath silence reigned within nat enjoyed an hour or two of genuine happiness learning the sweet old tunes and forgetting the hard past in the cheerful present  when the churchgoers came back and dinner was over every one read wrote letters home said their sunday lessons or talked quietly to one another sitting here and there about the house at three oclock the entire family turned out to walk for all the active young bodies must have exercise and in these walks the active young minds were taught to see and love the providence of god in the beautiful miracles which nature was working before their eyes mr bhaer always went with them and in his simple fatherly way found for his flock sermons in stones books in the running brooks and good in everything  mrs bhaer with daisy and her own two boys drove into town to pay the weekly visit to grandma which was busy mother bhaers one holiday and greatest pleasure nat was not strong enough for the long walk and asked to stay at home with tommy who kindly offered to do the honors of plumfield youve seen the house so come out and have a look at the garden and the barn and the menagerie said tommy when they were left alone with asia to see that they didnt get into mischief for though tommy was one of the bestmeaning boys who ever adorned knickerbockers accidents of the most direful nature were always happening to him no one could exactly tell how  what is your menagerie asked nat as they trotted along the drive that encircled the house  we all have pets you see and we keep em in the cornbarn and call it the menagerie here you are isnt my guineapig a beauty and tommy proudly presented one of the ugliest specimens of that pleasing animal that nat ever saw  i know a boy with a dozen of em and he said hed give me one only i hadnt any place to keep it so i couldnt have it it was white with black spots a regular rouser and maybe i could get it for you if youd like it said nat feeling it would be a delicate return for tommys attentions  id like it ever so much and ill give you this one and they can live together if they dont fight those white mice are robs franz gave em to him the rabbits are neds and the bantams outside are stuffys that box thing is demis turtletank only he hasnt begun to get em yet last year he had sixtytwo whackers some of em he stamped one of em with his name and the year and let it go and he says maybe he will find it ever so long after and know it he read about a turtle being found that had a mark on it that showed it must be hundreds of years old demis such a funny chap  what is in this box asked nat stopping before a large deep one halffull of earth  oh thats jack fords wormshop he digs heaps of em and keeps em here and when we want any to go afishing with we buy some of him it saves lots of trouble only he charged too much for em why last time we traded i had to pay two cents a dozen and then got little ones jacks mean sometimes and i told him id dig for myself if he didnt lower his prices now i own two hens those gray ones with top knots firstrate ones they are too and i sell mrs bhaer the eggs but i never ask her more than twentyfive cents a dozen never id be ashamed to do it cried tommy with a glance of scorn at the wormshop  who owns the dogs asked nat much interested in these commercial transactions and feeling that t bangs was a man whom it would be a privilege and a pleasure to patronize  the big dog is emils his name is christopher columbus mrs bhaer named him because she likes to say christopher columbus and no one minds it if she means the dog answered tommy in the tone of a showman displaying his menagerie the white pup is robs and the yellow one is teddys a man was going to drown them in our pond and pa bhaer wouldnt let him they do well enough for the little chaps i dont think much of em myself their names are castor and pollux  id like toby the donkey best if i could have anything its so nice to ride and hes so little and good said nat remembering the weary tramps he had taken on his own tired feet  mr laurie sent him out to mrs bhaer so she shouldnt carry teddy on her back when we go to walk were all fond of toby and hes a firstrate donkey sir those pigeons belong to the whole lot of us we each have our pet one and go shares in all the little ones as they come along squabs are great fun there aint any now but you can go up and take a look at the old fellows while i see if cockletop and granny have laid any eggs  nat climbed up a ladder put his head through a trap door and took a long look at the pretty doves billing and cooing in their spacious loft some on their nests some bustling in and out and some sitting at their doors while many went flying from the sunny housetop to the strawstrewn farmyard where six sleek cows were placidly ruminating  everybody has got something but me i wish i had a dove or a hen or even a turtle all my own thought nat feeling very poor as he saw the interesting treasures of the other boys how do you get these things he asked when he joined tommy in the barn  we find em or buy em or folks give em to us my father sends me mine but as soon as i get egg money enough im going to buy a pair of ducks theres a nice little pond for em behind the barn and people pay well for duckeggs and the little duckies are pretty and its fun to see em swim said tommy with the air of a millionaire  nat sighed for he had neither father nor money nothing in the wide world but an old empty pocketbook and the skill that lay in his ten finger tips tommy seemed to understand the question and the sigh which followed his answer for after a moment of deep thought he suddenly broke out  look here ill tell you what ill do if you will hunt eggs for me i hate it ill give you one egg out of every dozen you keep account and when youve had twelve mother bhaer will give you twentyfive cents for em and then you can buy what you like dont you see  ill do it what a kind feller you are tommy cried nat quite dazzled by this brilliant offer  pooh that is not anything you begin now and rummage the barn and ill wait here for you granny is cackling so youre sure to find one somewhere and tommy threw himself down on the hay with a luxurious sense of having made a good bargain and done a friendly thing  nat joyfully began his search and went rustling from loft to loft till he found two fine eggs one hidden under a beam and the other in an old peck measure which mrs cockletop had appropriated  you may have one and ill have the other that will just make up my last dozen and tomorrow well start fresh here you chalk your accounts up near mine and then well be all straight said tommy showing a row of mysterious figures on the side of an old winnowing machine  with a delightful sense of importance the proud possessor of one egg opened his account with his friend who laughingly wrote above the figures these imposing words  t bangs  co  poor nat found them so fascinating that he was with difficulty persuaded to go and deposit his first piece of portable property in asias storeroom then they went on again and having made the acquaintance of the two horses six cows three pigs and one alderney bossy as calves are called in new england tommy took nat to a certain old willowtree that overhung a noisy little brook from the fence it was an easy scramble into a wide niche between the three big branches which had been cut off to send out from year to year a crowd of slender twigs till a green canopy rustled overhead here little seats had been fixed and a hollow place a closet made big enough to hold a book or two a dismantled boat and several halffinished whistles  this is demis and my private place we made it and nobody can come up unless we let em except daisy we dont mind her said tommy as nat looked with delight from the babbling brown water below to the green arch above where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on the long yellow blossoms that filled the air with sweetness  oh its just beautiful cried nat i do hope youll let me up sometimes i never saw such a nice place in all my life id like to be a bird and live here always  it is pretty nice you can come if demi dont mind and i guess he wont because he said last night that he liked you  did he and nat smiled with pleasure for demis regard seemed to be valued by all the boys partly because he was father bhaers nephew and partly because he was such a sober conscientious little fellow  yes demi likes quiet chaps and i guess he and you will get on if you care about reading as he does  poor nats flush of pleasure deepened to a painful scarlet at those last words and he stammered out  i cant read very well i never had any time i was always fiddling round you know  i dont love it myself but i can do it well enough when i want to said tommy after a surprised look which said as plainly as words a boy twelve years old and cant read  i can read music anyway added nat rather ruffled at having to confess his ignorance  i cant and tommy spoke in a respectful tone which emboldened nat to say firmly  i mean to study real hard and learn every thing i can for i never had a chance before does mr bhaer give hard lessons  no he isnt a bit cross he sort of explains and gives you a boost over the hard places some folks dont my other master didnt if we missed a word didnt we get raps on the head and tommy rubbed his own pate as if it tingled yet with the liberal supply of raps the memory of which was the only thing he brought away after a year with his other master  i think i could read this said nat who had been examining the books  read a bit then ill help you resumed tommy with a patronizing air  so nat did his best and floundered through a page with may friendly boosts from tommy who told him he would soon go it as well as anybody then they sat and talked boyfashion about all sorts of things among others gardening for nat looking down from his perch asked what was planted in the many little patches lying below them on the other side of the brook  these are our farms said tommy we each have our own patch and raise what we like in it only have to choose different things and cant change till the crop is in and we must keep it in order all summer  what are you going to raise this year  wal i cattleated to hev beans as they are about the easiest crop agoin  nat could not help laughing for tommy had pushed back his hat put his hands in his pockets and drawled out his words in unconscious imitation of silas the man who managed the place for mr bhaer  come you neednt laugh beans are ever so much easier than corn or potatoes i tried melons last year but the bugs were a bother and the old things wouldnt get ripe before the frost so i didnt have but one good water and two little mush mellions said tommy relapsing into a silasism with the last word  corn looks pretty growing said nat politely to atone for his laugh  yes but you have to hoe it over and over again now six weeks beans only have to be done once or so and they get ripe soon im going to try em for i spoke first stuffy wanted em but hes got to take peas they only have to be picked and he ought to do it he eats such a lot  i wonder if i shall have a garden said nat thinking that even cornhoeing must be pleasant work  of course you will said a voice from below and there was mr bhaer returned from his walk and come to find them for he managed to have a little talk with every one of the lads some time during the day and found that these chats gave them a good start for the coming week  sympathy is a sweet thing and it worked wonders here for each boy knew that father bhaer was interested in him and some were readier to open their hearts to him than to a woman especially the older ones who liked to talk over their hopes and plans man to man when sick or in trouble they instinctively turned to mrs jo while the little ones made her their motherconfessor on all occasions  in descending from their nest tommy fell into the brook being used to it he calmly picked himself out and retired to the house to be dried this left nat to mr bhaer which was just what he wished and during the stroll they took among the garden plots he won the lads heart by giving him a little farm and discussing crops with him as gravely as if the food for the family depended on the harvest from this pleasant topic they went to others and nat had many new and helpful thoughts put into a mind that received them as gratefully as the thirsty earth had received the warm spring rain all supper time he brooded over them often fixing his eyes on mr bhaer with an inquiring look that seemed to say i like that do it again sir i dont know whether the man understood the childs mute language or not but when the boys were all gathered together in mrs bhaers parlor for the sunday evening talk he chose a subject which might have been suggested by the walk in the garden  as he looked about him nat thought it seemed more like a great family than a school for the lads were sitting in a wide halfcircle round the fire some on chairs some on the rug daisy and demi on the knees of uncle fritz and rob snugly stowed away in the back of his mothers easychair where he could nod unseen if the talk got beyond his depth  every one looked quite comfortable and listened attentively for the long walk made rest agreeable and as every boy there knew that he would be called upon for his views he kept his wits awake to be ready with an answer  once upon a time began mr bhaer in the dear oldfashioned way there was a great and wise gardener who had the largest garden ever seen a wonderful and lovely place it was and he watched over it with the greatest skill and care and raised all manner of excellent and useful things but weeds would grow even in this fine garden often the ground was bad and the good seeds sown in it would not spring up he had many under gardeners to help him some did their duty and earned the rich wages he gave them but others neglected their parts and let them run to waste which displeased him very much but he was very patient and for thousands and thousands of years he worked and waited for his great harvest  he must have been pretty old said demi who was looking straight into uncle fritzs face as if to catch every word  hush demi its a fairy story whispered daisy  no i think its an arrygory said demi  what is a arrygory called out tommy who was of an inquiring turn  tell him demi if you can and dont use words unless you are quite sure you know what they mean said mr bhaer  i do know grandpa told me a fable is a arrygory its a story that means something my story without an end is one because the child in it means a soul dont it aunty cried demi eager to prove himself right  thats it dear and uncles story is an allegory i am quite sure so listen and see what it means returned mrs jo who always took part in whatever was going on and enjoyed it as much as any boy among them  demi composed himself and mr bhaer went on in his best english for he had improved much in the last five years and said the boys did it  this great gardener gave a dozen or so of little plots to one of his servants and told him to do his best and see what he could raise now this servant was not rich nor wise nor very good but he wanted to help because the gardener had been very kind to him in many ways so he gladly took the little plots and fell to work they were all sorts of shapes and sizes and some were very good soil some rather stony and all of them needed much care for in the rich soil the weeds grew fast and in the poor soil there were many stones  what was growing in them besides the weeds and stones asked nat so interested he forgot his shyness and spoke before them all  flowers said mr bhaer with a kind look even the roughest most neglected little bed had a bit of heartsease or a sprig of mignonette in it one had roses sweet peas and daisies in it here he pinched the plump cheek of the little girl leaning on his arm another had all sorts of curious plants in it bright pebbles a vine that went climbing up like jacks beanstalk and many good seeds just beginning to sprout for you see this bed had been taken fine care of by a wise old man who had worked in gardens of this sort all his life  at this part of the arrygory demi put his head on one side like an inquisitive bird and fixed his bright eye on his uncles face as if he suspected something and was on the watch but mr bhaer looked perfectly innocent and went on glancing from one young face to another with a grave wistful look that said much to his wife who knew how earnestly he desired to do his duty in these little garden plots  as i tell you some of these beds were easy to cultivate that means to take care of daisy and others were very hard there was one particularly sunshiny little bed that might have been full of fruits and vegetables as well as flowers only it wouldnt take any pains and when the man sowed well well say melons in this bed they came to nothing because the little bed neglected them the man was sorry and kept on trying though every time the crop failed all the bed said was i forgot  here a general laugh broke out and every one looked at tommy who had pricked up his ears at the word melons and hung down his head at the sound of his favorite excuse  i knew he meant us cried demi clapping his hands you are the man and we are the little gardens arent we uncle fritz  you have guessed it now each of you tell me what crop i shall try to sow in you this spring so that next autumn i may get a good harvest out of my twelve no thirteen plots said mr bhaer nodding at nat as he corrected himself  you cant sow corn and beans and peas in us unless you mean we are to eat a great many and get fat said stuffy with a sudden brightening of his round dull face as the pleasing idea occurred to him  he dont mean that kind of seeds he means things to make us good and the weeds are faults cried demi who usually took the lead in these talks because he was used to this sort of thing and liked it very much  yes each of you think what you need most and tell me and i will help you to grow it only you must do your best or you will turn out like tommys melons all leaves and no fruit i will begin with the oldest and ask the mother what she will have in her plot for we are all parts of the beautiful garden and may have rich harvests for our master if we love him enough said father bhaer  i shall devote the whole of my plot to the largest crop of patience i can get for that is what i need most said mrs jo so soberly that the lads fell to thinking in good earnest what they should say when their turns came and some among them felt a twinge of remorse that they had helped to use up mother bhaers stock of patience so fast  franz wanted perseverance tommy steadiness ned went in for good temper daisy for industry demi for as much wiseness as grandpa and nat timidly said he wanted so many things he would let mr bhaer choose for him the others chose much the same things and patience good temper and generosity seemed the favorite crops one boy wished to like to get up early but did not know what name to give that sort of seed and poor stuffy sighed out  i wish i loved my lessons as much as i do my dinner but i cant  we will plant selfdenial and hoe it and water it and make it grow so well that next christmas no one will get ill by eating too much dinner if you exercise your mind george it will get hungry just as your body does and you will love books almost as much as my philosopher here said mr bhaer adding as he stroked the hair off demis fine forehead you are greedy also my son and you like to stuff your little mind full of fairy tales and fancies as well as george likes to fill his little stomach with cake and candy both are bad and i want you to try something better arithmetic is not half so pleasant as arabian nights i know but it is a very useful thing and now is the time to learn it else you will be ashamed and sorry by and by  but harry and lucy and frank are not fairy books and they are all full of barometers and bricks and shoeing horses and useful things and im fond of them aint i daisy said demi anxious to defend himself  so they are but i find you reading roland and maybird a great deal oftener than harry and lucy and i think you are not half so fond of frank as you are of sinbad come i shall make a little bargain with you both george shall eat but three times a day and you shall read but one storybook a week and i will give you the new cricketground only you must promise to play in it said uncle fritz in his persuasive way for stuffy hated to run about and demi was always reading in play hours  but we dont like cricket said demi  perhaps not now but you will when you know it besides you do like to be generous and the other boys want to play and you can give them the new ground if you choose  this was taken them both on the right side and they agreed to the bargain to the great satisfaction of the rest  there was a little more talk about the gardens and then they all sang together the band delighted nat for mrs bhaer played the piano franz the flute mr bhaer a bass viol and he himself the violin a very simple little concert but all seemed to enjoy it and old asia sitting in the corner joined at times with the sweetest voice of any for in this family master and servant old and young black and white shared in the sunday song which went up to the father of them all after this they each shook hands with father bhaer mother bhaer kissed them every one from sixteenyearold franz to little rob how kept the tip of her nose for his own particular kisses and then they trooped up to bed  the light of the shaded lamp that burned in the nursery shone softly on a picture hanging at the foot of nats bed there were several others on the walls but the boy thought there must be something peculiar about this one for it had a graceful frame of moss and cones about it and on a little bracket underneath stood a vase of wild flowers freshly gathered from the spring woods it was the most beautiful picture of them all and nat lay looking at it dimly feeling what it meant and wishing he knew all about it  thats my picture said a little voice in the room nat popped up his head and there was demi in his nightgown pausing on his way back from aunt jos chamber whither he had gone to get a cot for a cut finger  what is he doing to the children asked nat  that is christ the good man and he is blessing the children dont you know about him said demi wondering  not much but id like to he looks so kind answered nat whose chief knowledge of the good man consisted in hearing his name taken in vain  i know all about it and i like it very much because it is true said demi  who told you  my grandpa he knows every thing and tells the best stories in the world i used to play with his big books and make bridges and railroads and houses when i was a little boy began demi  how old are you now asked nat respectfully  most ten  you know a lot of things dont you  yes you see my head is pretty big and grandpa says it will take a good deal to fill it so i keep putting pieces of wisdom into it as fast as i can returned demi in his quaint way  nat laughed and then said soberly  tell on please  and demi gladly told on without pause or punctuation i found a very pretty book one day and wanted to play with it but grandpa said i mustnt and showed me the pictures and told me about them and i liked the stories very much all about joseph and his bad brothers and the frogs that came up out of the sea and dear little moses in the water and ever so many more lovely ones but i liked about the good man best of all and grandpa told it to me so many times that i learned it by heart and he gave me this picture so i shouldnt forget and it was put up here once when i was sick and i left it for other sick boys to see  what makes him bless the children asked nat who found something very attractive in the chief figure of the group  because he loved them  were they poor children asked nat wistfully  yes i think so you see some havent got hardly any clothes on and the mothers dont look like rich ladies he liked poor people and was very good to them he made them well and helped them and told rich people they must not be cross to them and they loved him dearly dearly cried demi with enthusiasm  was he rich  oh no he was born in a barn and was so poor he hadnt any house to live in when he grew up and nothing to eat sometimes but what people gave him and he went round preaching to everybody and trying to make them good till the bad men killed him  what for and nat sat up in his bed to look and listen so interested was he in this man who cared for the poor so much  ill tell you all about it aunt jo wont mind and demi settled himself on the opposite bed glad to tell his favorite story to so good a listener  nursey peeped in to see if nat was asleep but when she saw what was going on she slipped away again and went to mrs bhaer saying with her kind face full of motherly emotion  will the dear lady come and see a pretty sight its nat listening with all his heart to demi telling the story of the christchild like a little white angel as he is  mrs bhaer had meant to go and talk with nat a moment before he slept for she had found that a serious word spoken at this time often did much good but when she stole to the nursery door and saw nat eagerly drinking in the words of his little friends while demi told the sweet and solemn story as it had been taught him speaking softly as he sat with his beautiful eyes fixed on the tender face above them her own filled with tears and she went silently away thinking to herself  demi is unconsciously helping the poor boy better than i can i will not spoil it by a single word  the murmur of the childish voice went on for a long time as one innocent heart preached that great sermon to another and no one hushed it when it ceased at last and mrs bhaer went to take away the lamp demi was gone and nat fast asleep lying with his face toward the picture as if he had already learned to love the good man who loved little children and was a faithful friend to the poor the boys face was very placid and as she looked at it she felt that if a single day of care and kindness had done so much a year of patient cultivation would surely bring a grateful harvest from this neglected garden which was already sown with the best of all seed by the little missionary in the nightgown    chapter iv steppingstones  when nat went into school on monday morning he quaked inwardly for now he thought he should have to display his ignorance before them all but mr bhaer gave him a seat in the deep window where he could turn his back on the others and franz heard him say his lessons there so no one could hear his blunders or see how he blotted his copybook he was truly grateful for this and toiled away so diligently that mr bhaer said smiling when he saw his hot face and inky fingers  dont work so hard my boy you will tire yourself out and there is time enough  but i must work hard or i cant catch up with the others they know heaps and i dont know anything said nat who had been reduced to a state of despair by hearing the boys recite their grammar history and geography with what he thought amazing ease and accuracy  you know a good many things which they dont said mr bhaer sitting down beside him while franz led a class of small students through the intricacies of the multiplication table  do i and nat looked utterly incredulous  yes for one thing you can keep your temper and jack who is quick at numbers cannot that is an excellent lesson and i think you have learned it well then you can play the violin and not one of the lads can though they want to do it very much but best of all nat you really care to learn something and that is half the battle it seems hard at first and you will feel discouraged but plod away and things will get easier and easier as you go on  nats face had brightened more and more as he listened for small as the list of his learning was it cheered him immensely to feel that he had anything to fall back upon yes i can keep my temper fathers beating taught me that and i can fiddle though i dont know where the bay of biscay is he thought with a sense of comfort impossible to express then he said aloud and so earnestly that demi heard him  i do want to learn and i will try i never went to school but i couldnt help it and if the fellows dont laugh at me i guess ill get on first rate you and the lady are so good to me  they shant laugh at you if they do ill ill tell them not to cried demi quite forgetting where he was  the class stopped in the middle of 7 times 9 and everyone looked up to see what was going on  thinking that a lesson in learning to help one another was better than arithmetic just then mr bhaer told them about nat making such an interesting and touching little story out of it that the goodhearted lads all promised to lend him a hand and felt quite honored to be called upon to impart their stores of wisdom to the chap who fiddled so capitally this appeal established the right feeling among them and nat had few hindrances to struggle against for every one was glad to give him a boost up the ladder of learning  till he was stronger much study was not good for him however and mrs jo found various amusements in the house for him while others were at their books but his garden was his best medicine and he worked away like a beaver preparing his little farm sowing his beans watching eagerly to see them grow and rejoicing over each green leaf and slender stock that shot up and flourished in the warm spring weather never was a garden more faithfully hoed mr bhaer really feared that nothing would find time to grow nat kept up such a stirring of the soil so he gave him easy jobs in the flower garden or among the strawberries where he worked and hummed as busily as the bees booming all about him  this is the crop i like best mrs bhaer used to say as she pinched the once thin cheeks now getting plump and ruddy or stroked the bent shoulders that were slowly straightening up with healthful work good food and the absence of that heavy burden poverty  demi was his little friend tommy his patron and daisy the comforter of all his woes for though the children were younger than he his timid spirit found a pleasure in their innocent society and rather shrunk from the rough sports of the elder lads mr laurence did not forget him but sent clothes and books music and kind messages and now and then came out to see how his boy was getting on or took him into town to a concert on which occasions nat felt himself translated into the seventh heaven of bliss for he went to mr laurences great house saw his pretty wife and little fairy of a daughter had a good dinner and was made so comfortable that he talked and dreamed of it for days and nights afterward  it takes so little to make a child happy that it is a pity in a world so full of sunshine and pleasant things that there should be any wistful faces empty hands or lonely little hearts feeling this the bhaers gathered up all the crumbs they could find to feed their flock of hungry sparrows for they were not rich except in charity many of mrs jos friends who had nurseries sent her they toys of which their children so soon tired and in mending these nat found an employment that just suited him he was very neat and skillful with those slender fingers of his and passed many a rainy afternoon with his gumbottle paintbox and knife repairing furniture animals and games while daisy was dressmaker to the dilapidated dolls as fast as the toys were mended they were put carefully away in a certain drawer which was to furnish forth a christmastree for all the poor children of the neighborhood that being the way the plumfield boys celebrated the birthday of him who loved the poor and blessed the little ones  demi was never tired of reading and explaining his favorite books and many a pleasant hour did they spend in the old willow revelling over robinson crusoe arabian nights edgeworths tales and the other dear immortal stories that will delight children for centuries to come this opened a new world to nat and his eagerness to see what came next in the story helped him on till he could read as well as anybody and felt so rich and proud with his new accomplishment that there was danger of his being as much of a bookworm as demi  another helpful thing happened in a most unexpected and agreeable manner several of the boys were in business as they called it for most of them were poor and knowing that they would have their own way to make by and by the bhaers encouraged any efforts at independence tommy sold his eggs jack speculated in live stock franz helped in the teaching and was paid for it ned had a taste for carpentry and a turninglathe was set up for him in which he turned all sorts of useful or pretty things and sold them while demi constructed watermills whirligigs and unknown machines of an intricate and useless nature and disposed of them to the boys  let him be a mechanic if he likes said mr bhaer give a boy a trade and he is independent work is wholesome and whatever talent these lads possess be it for poetry or ploughing it shall be cultivated and made useful to them if possible  so when nat came running to him one day to ask with an excited face  can i go and fiddle for some people who are to have a picnic in our woods they will pay me and id like to earn some money as the other boys do and fiddling is the only way i know how to do it  mr bhaer answered readily  go and welcome it is an easy and a pleasant way to work and i am glad it is offered you  nat went and did so well that when he came home he had two dollars in his pocket which he displayed with intense satisfaction as he told how much he had enjoyed the afternoon how kind the young people were and how they had praised his dance music and promised to have him again  it is so much nicer than fiddling in the street for then i got none of the money and now i have it all and a good time besides im in business now as well as tommy and jack and i like it ever so much said nat proudly patting the old pocketbook and feeling like a millionaire already  he was in business truly for picnics were plenty as summer opened and nats skill was in great demand he was always at liberty to go if lessons were not neglected and if the picnickers were respectable young people for mr bhaer explained to him that a good plain education is necessary for everyone and that no amount of money should hire him to go where he might be tempted to do wrong nat quite agreed to this and it was a pleasant sight to see the innocenthearted lad go driving away in the gay wagons that stopped at the gate for him or to hear him come fiddling home tired but happy with his wellearned money in one pocket and some goodies from the feast for daisy or little ted whom he never forgot  im going to save up till i get enough to buy a violin for myself and then i can earn my own living cant i he used to say as he brought his dollars to mr bhaer to keep  i hope so nat but we must get you strong and hearty first and put a little more knowledge into this musical head of yours then mr laurie will find you a place somewhere and in a few years we will all come to hear you play in public  with much congenial work encouragement and hope nat found life getting easier and happier every day and made such progress in his music lessons that his teacher forgave his slowness in some other things knowing very well that where the heart is the mind works best the only punishment the boy ever needed for neglect of more important lessons was to hang up the fiddle and the bow for a day the fear of losing his bosom friend entirely made him go at his books with a will and having proved that he could master the lessons what was the use of saying i cant  daisy had a great love of music and a great reverence for any one who could make it and she was often found sitting on the stairs outside nats door while he was practising this pleased him very much and he played his best for that one quiet little listener for she never would come in but preferred to sit sewing her gay patchwork or tending one of her many dolls with an expression of dreamy pleasure on her face that made aunt jo say with tears in her eyes so like my beth and go softly by lest even her familiar presence mar the childs sweet satisfaction  nat was very fond of mrs bhaer but found something even more attractive in the good professor who took fatherly care of the shy feeble boy who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea on which his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years some good angel must have been watching over him for though his body had suffered his soul seemed to have taken little harm and came ashore as innocent as a shipwrecked baby perhaps his love of music kept it sweet in spite of the discord all about him mr laurie said so and he ought to know however that might be father bhaer took pleasure in fostering poor nats virtues and in curing his faults finding his new pupil as docile and affectionate as a girl he often called nat his daughter when speaking of him to mrs jo and she used to laugh at his fancy for madame liked manly boys and thought nat amiable but weak though you never would have guessed it for she petted him as she did daisy and he thought her a very delightful woman  one fault of nats gave the bhaers much anxiety although they saw how it had been strengthened by fear and ignorance i regret to say that nat sometimes told lies not very black ones seldom getting deeper than gray and often the mildest of white fibs but that did not matter a lie is a lie and though we all tell many polite untruths in this queer world of ours it is not right and everybody knows it  you cannot be too careful watch your tongue and eyes and hands for it is easy to tell and look and act untruth said mr bhaer in one of the talks he had with nat about his chief temptation  i know it and i dont mean to but its so much easier to get along if you aint very fussy about being exactly true i used to tell em because i was afraid of father and nicolo and now i do sometimes because the boys laugh at me i know its bad but i forget and nat looked much depressed by his sins  when i was a little lad i used to tell lies ach what fibs they were and my old grandmother cured me of it how do you think my parents had talked and cried and punished but still did i forget as you then said the dear old grandmother i shall help you to remember and put a check on this unruly part with that she drew out my tongue and snipped the end with her scissors till the blood ran that was terrible you may believe but it did me much good because it was sore for days and every word i said came so slowly that i had time to think after that i was more careful and got on better for i feared the big scissors yet the dear grandmother was most kind to me in all things and when she lay dying far away in nuremberg she prayed that little fritz might love god and tell the truth  i never had any grandmothers but if you think it will cure me ill let you snip my tongue said nat heroically for he dreaded pain yet did wish to stop fibbing  mr bhaer smiled but shook his head  i have a better way than that i tried it once before and it worked well see now when you tell a lie i will not punish you but you shall punish me  how asked nat startled at the idea  you shall ferule me in the good oldfashioned way i seldom do it myself but it may make you remember better to give me pain than to feel it yourself  strike you oh i couldnt cried nat  then mind that tripping tongue of thine i have no wish to be hurt but i would gladly bear much pain to cure this fault  this suggestion made such an impression on nat that for a long time he set a watch upon his lips and was desperately accurate for mr bhaer judged rightly that love of him would be more powerful with nat that fear for himself but alas one sad day nat was off his guard and when peppery emil threatened to thrash him if it was he who had run over his garden and broken down his best hills of corn nat declared he didnt and then was ashamed to own up that he did do it when jack was chasing him the night before  he thought no one would find it out but tommy happened to see him and when emil spoke of it a day or two later tommy gave his evidence and mr bhaer heard it school was over and they were all standing about in the hall and mr bhaer had just set down on the straw settee to enjoy his frolic with teddy but when he heard tommy and saw nat turn scarlet and look at him with a frightened face he put the little boy down saying go to thy mother bubchen i will come soon and taking nat by the hand led him into the school and shut the door  the boys looked at one another in silence for a minute then tommy slipped out and peeping in at the halfclosed blinds beheld a sight that quite bewildered him mr bhaer had just taken down the long rule that hung over his desk so seldom used that it was covered with dust  my eye hes going to come down heavy on nat this time wish i hadnt told thought goodnatured tommy for to be feruled was the deepest disgrace at this school  you remember what i told you last time said mr bhaer sorrowfully not angrily  yes but please dont make me i cant bear it cried nat backing up against the door with both hands behind him and a face full of distress  why dont he up and take it like a man i would thought tommy though his heart beat fast at the sight  i shall keep my word and you must remember to tell the truth obey me nat take this and give me six good strokes  tommy was so staggered by this last speech that he nearly tumbled down the bank but saved himself and hung onto the window ledge staring in with eyes as round as the stuffed owls on the chimneypiece  nat took the rule for when mr bhaer spoke in that tone everyone obeyed him and looking as scared and guilty as if about to stab his master he gave two feeble blows on the broad hand held out to him then he stopped and looked up halfblind with tears but mr bhaer said steadily  go on and strike harder  as if seeing that it must be done and eager to have the hard task soon over nat drew his sleeve across his eyes and gave two more quick hard strokes that reddened the hand yet hurt the giver more  isnt that enough he asked in a breathless sort of tone  two more was all the answer and he gave them hardly seeing where they fell then threw the rule all across the room and hugging the kind hand in both his own laid his face down on it sobbing out in a passion of love and shame and penitence  i will remember oh i will  then mr bhaer put an arm about him and said in a tone as compassionate as it had just now been firm  i think you will ask the dear god to help you and try to spare us both another scene like this  tommy saw no more for he crept back to the hall looking so excited and sober that the boys crowded round him to ask what was being done to nat  in a most impressive whisper tommy told them and they looked as if the sky was about to fall for this reversing the order of things almost took their breath away  he made me do the same thing once said emil as if confessing a crime of the deepest dye  and you hit him dear old father bhaer by thunder id just like to see you do it now said ned collaring emil in a fit of righteous wrath  it was ever so long ago id rather have my head cut off than do it now and emil mildly laid ned on his back instead of cuffing him as he would have felt it his duty to do on any less solemn occasion  how could you said demi appalled at the idea  i was hopping mad at the time and thought i shouldnt mind a bit rather like it perhaps but when id hit uncle one good crack everything he had ever done for me came into my head all at once somehow and i couldnt go on no sir if hed laid me down and walked on me i wouldnt have minded i felt so mean and emil gave himself a good thump in the chest to express his sense of remorse for the past  nats crying like anything and feels no end sorry so dont lets say a word about it will we said tenderhearted tommy  of course we wont but its awful to tell lies and demi looked as if he found the awfulness much increased when the punishment fell not upon the sinner but his best uncle fritz  suppose we all clear out so nat can cut upstairs if he wants to proposed franz and led the way to the barn their refuge in troublous times  nat did not come to dinner but mrs jo took some up to him and said a tender word which did him good though he could not look at her by and by the lads playing outside heard the violin and said among themselves hes all right now he was all right but felt shy about going down till opening his door to slip away into the woods he found daisy sitting on the stairs with neither work nor doll only her little handkerchief in her hand as if she had been mourning for her captive friend  im going to walk want to come asked nat trying to look as if nothing was the matter yet feeling very grateful for her silent sympathy because he fancied everyone must look upon him as a wretch  oh yes and daisy ran for her hat proud to be chosen as a companion by one of the big boys  the others saw them go but no one followed for boys have a great deal more delicacy than they get credit for and the lads instinctively felt that when in disgrace gentle little daisy was their most congenial friend  the walk did nat good and he came home quieter than usual but looking cheerful again and hung all over with daisychains made by his little playmate while he lay on the grass and told her stories  no one said a word about the scene of the morning but its effect was all the more lasting for that reason perhaps nat tried his very best and found much help not only from the earnest little prayers he prayed to his friend in heaven but also in the patient care of the earthly friend whose kind hand he never touched without remembering that it had willingly borne pain for his sake    chapter v pattypans  whats the matter daisy  the boys wont let me play with them  why not  they say girls cant play football  they can for ive done it and mrs bhaer laughed at the remembrance of certain youthful frolics  i know i can play demi and i used to and have nice times but he wont let me now because the other boys laugh at him and daisy looked deeply grieved at her brothers hardness of heart  on the whole i think he is right deary its all very well when you two are alone but it is too rough a game for you with a dozen boys so id find some nice little play for myself  im tired of playing alone and daisys tone was very mournful  ill play with you by and by but just now i must fly about and get things ready for a trip into town you shall go with me and see mamma and if you like you can stay with her  i should like to go and see her and baby josy but id rather come back please demi would miss me and i love to be here aunty  you cant get on without your demi can you and aunt jo looked as if she quite understood the love of the little girl for her only brother  course i cant were twins and so we love each other more than other people answered daisy with a brightening face for she considered being a twin one of the highest honors she could ever receive  now what will you do with your little self while i fly around asked mrs bhaer who was whisking piles of linen into a wardrobe with great rapidity  i dont know im tired of dolls and things i wish youd make up a new play for me aunty jo said daisy swinging listlessly on the door  i shall have to think of a brand new one and it will take me some time so suppose you go down and see what asia has got for your lunch suggested mrs bhaer thinking that would be a good way in which to dispose of the little hindrance for a time  yes i think id like that if she isnt cross and daisy slowly departed to the kitchen where asia the black cook reigned undisturbed  in five minutes daisy was back again with a wideawake face a bit of dough in her hand and a dab of flour on her little nose  oh aunty please could i go and make gingersnaps and things asia isnt cross and she says i may and it would be such fun please do cried daisy all in one breath  just the thing go and welcome make what you like and stay as long as you please answered mrs bhaer much relieved for sometimes the one little girl was harder to amuse than the dozen boys  daisy ran off and while she worked aunt jo racked her brain for a new play all of a sudden she seemed to have an idea for she smiled to herself slammed the doors of the wardrobe and walked briskly away saying ill do it if its a possible thing  what it was no one found out that day but aunt jos eyes twinkled so when she told daisy she had thought of a new play and was going to buy it that daisy was much excited and asked questions all the way into town without getting answers that told her anything she was left at home to play with the new baby and delight her mothers eyes while aunt jo went off shopping when she came back with all sorts of queer parcels in corners of the carryall daisy was so full of curiosity that she wanted to go back to plumfield at once but her aunt would not be hurried and made a long call in mammas room sitting on the floor with baby in her lap making mrs brooke laugh at the pranks of the boys and all sorts of droll nonsense  how her aunt told the secret daisy could not imagine but her mother evidently knew it for she said as she tied on the little bonnet and kissed the rosy little face inside be a good child my daisy and learn the nice new play aunty has got for you its a most useful and interesting one and it is very kind of her to play it with you because she does not like it very well herself  this last speech made the two ladies laugh heartily and increased daisys bewilderment as they drove away something rattled in the back of the carriage  whats that asked daisy pricking up her ears  the new play answered mrs jo solemnly  what is it made of cried daisy  iron tin wood brass sugar salt coal and a hundred other things  how strange what color is it  all sorts of colors  is it large  part of it is and a part isnt  did i ever see one  ever so many but never one so nice as this  oh what can it be i cant wait when shall i see it and daisy bounced up and down with impatience  tomorrow morning after lessons  is it for the boys too  no all for you and bess the boys will like to see it and want to play one part of it but you can do as you like about letting them  ill let demi if he wants to  no fear that they wont all want to especially stuffy and mrs bhaers eyes twinkled more than ever as she patted a queer knobby bundle in her lap  let me feel just once prayed daisy  not a feel youd guess in a minute and spoil the fun  daisy groaned and then smiled all over her face for through a little hole in the paper she caught a glimpse of something bright  how can i wait so long couldnt i see it today  oh dear no it has got to be arranged and ever so many parts fixed in their places i promised uncle teddy that you shouldnt see it till it was all in applepie order  if uncle knows about it then it must be splendid cried daisy clapping her hands for this kind rich jolly uncle of hers was as good as a fairy godmother to the children and was always planning merry surprises pretty gifts and droll amusements for them  yes teddy went and bought it with me and we had such fun in the shop choosing the different parts he would have everything fine and large and my little plan got regularly splendid when he took hold you must give him your very best kiss when he comes for he is the kindest uncle that ever went and bought a charming little coo bless me i nearly told you what it was and mrs bhaer cut that most interesting word short off in the middle and began to look over her bills as if afraid she would let the cat out of the bag if she talked any more daisy folded her hands with an air of resignation and sat quite still trying to think what play had a coo in it  when they got home she eyed every bundle that was taken out and one large heavy one which franz took straight upstairs and hid in the nursery filled her with amazement and curiosity something very mysterious went on up there that afternoon for franz was hammering and asia trotting up and down and aunt jo flying around like a willothewisp with all sort of things under her apron while little ted who was the only child admitted because he couldnt talk plain babbled and laughed and tried to tell what the sumpin pitty was  all this made daisy halfwild and her excitement spread among the boys who quite overwhelmed mother bhaer with offers of assistance which she declined by quoting their own words to daisy  girls cant play with boys this is for daisy and bess and me so we dont want you whereupon the young gentlemen meekly retired and invited daisy to a game of marbles horse football anything she liked with a sudden warmth and politeness which astonished her innocent little soul  thanks to these attentions she got through the afternoon went early to bed and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made uncle fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day quite a thrill pervaded the schoolroom when daisy was dismissed at eleven oclock for everyone knew that now she was going to have the new and mysterious play  many eyes followed her as she ran away and demis mind was so distracted by this event that when franz asked him where the desert of sahara was he mournfully replied in the nursery and the whole school laughed at him  aunt jo ive done all my lessons and i cant wait one single minute more cried daisy flying into mrs bhaers room  its all ready come on and tucking ted under one arm and her workbasket under the other aunt jo promptly led the way upstairs  i dont see anything said daisy staring about her as she got inside the nursery door  do you hear anything asked aunt jo catching ted back by his little frock as he was making straight for one side of the room  daisy did hear an odd crackling and then a purry little sound as of a kettle singing these noises came from behind a curtain drawn before a deep bay window daisy snatched it back gave one joyful oh and then stood gazing with delight at what do you think  a wide seat ran round the three sides of the window on one side hung and stood all sorts of little pots and pans gridirons and skillets on the other side a small dinner and tea set and on the middle part a cookingstove not a tin one that was of no use but a real iron stove big enough to cook for a large family of very hungry dolls but the best of it was that a real fire burned in it real steam came out of the nose of the little teakettle and the lid of the little boiler actually danced a jig the water inside bubbled so hard a pane of glass had been taken out and replaced by a sheet of tin with a hole for the small funnel and real smoke went sailing away outside so naturally that it did ones heart good to see it the box of wood with a hod of charcoal stood near by just above hung dustpan brush and broom a little market basket was on the low table at which daisy used to play and over the back of her little chair hung a white apron with a bib and a droll mob cap the sun shone in as if he enjoyed the fun the little stove roared beautifully the kettle steamed the new tins sparkled on the walls the pretty china stood in tempting rows and it was altogether as cheery and complete a kitchen as any child could desire  daisy stood quite still after the first glad oh but her eyes went quickly from one charming object to another brightening as they looked till they came to aunt jos merry face there they stopped as the happy little girl hugged her saying gratefully  oh aunty its a splendid new play can i really cook at the dear stove and have parties and mess and sweep and make fires that truly burn i like it so much what made you think of it  your liking to make gingersnaps with asia made me think of it said mrs bhaer holding daisy who frisked as if she would fly i knew asia wouldnt let you mess in her kitchen very often and it wouldnt be safe at this fire up here so i thought id see if i could find a little stove for you and teach you to cook that would be fun and useful too so i travelled round among the toy shops but everything large cost too much and i was thinking i should have to give it up when i met uncle teddy as soon as he knew what i was about he said he wanted to help and insisted on buying the biggest toy stove we could find i scolded but he only laughed and teased me about my cooking when we were young and said i must teach bess as well as you and went on buying all sorts of nice little things for my cooking class as he called it  im so glad you met him said daisy as mrs jo stopped to laugh at the memory of the funny time she had with uncle teddy  you must study hard and learn to make all kinds of things for he says he shall come out to tea very often and expects something uncommonly nice  its the sweetest dearest kitchen in the world and id rather study with it than do anything else cant i learn pies and cake and macaroni and everything cried daisy dancing round the room with a new saucepan in one hand and the tiny poker in the other  all in good time this is to be a useful play i am to help you and you are to be my cook so i shall tell you what to do and show you how then we shall have things fit to eat and you will be really learning how to cook on a small scale ill call you sally and say you are a new girl just come added mrs jo settling down to work while teddy sat on the floor sucking his thumb and staring at the stove as if it was a live thing whose appearance deeply interested him  that will be so lovely what shall i do first asked sally with such a happy face and willing air that aunt jo wished all new cooks were half as pretty and pleasant  first of all put on this clean cap and apron i am rather oldfashioned and i like my cook to be very tidy  sally tucked her curly hair into the round cap and put on the apron without a murmur though usually she rebelled against bibs  now you can put things in order and wash up the new china the old set needs washing also for my last girl was apt to leave it in a sad state after a party  aunt jo spoke quite soberly but sally laughed for she knew who the untidy girl was who had left the cups sticky then she turned up her cuffs and with a sigh of satisfaction began to stir about her kitchen having little raptures now and then over the sweet rolling pin the darling dishtub or the cunning pepperpot  now sally take your basket and go to market here is the list of things i want for dinner said mrs jo giving her a bit of paper when the dishes were all in order  where is the market asked daisy thinking that the new play got more and more interesting every minute  asia is the market  away went sally causing another stir in the schoolroom as she passed the door in her new costume and whispered to demi with a face full of delight its a perfectly splendid play  old asia enjoyed the joke as much as daisy and laughed jollily as the little girl came flying into the room with her cap all on one side the lids of her basket rattling like castanets and looking like a very crazy little cook  mrs aunt jo wants these things and i must have them right away said daisy importantly  lets see honey heres two pounds of steak potatoes squash apples bread and butter the meat aint come yet when it does ill send it up the other things are all handy  then asia packed one potato one apple a bit of squash a little pat of butter and a roll into the basket telling sally to be on the watch for the butchers boy because he sometimes played tricks  who is he and daisy hoped it would be demi  youll see was all asia would say and sally went off in great spirits singing a verse from dear mary howitts sweet story in rhyme       away went little mabel      with the wheaten cake so fine      the newmade pot of butter      and the little flask of wine  put everything but the apple into the storecloset for the present said mrs jo when the cook got home  there was a cupboard under the middle shelf and on opening the door fresh delights appeared one half was evidently the cellar for wood coal and kindlings were piled there the other half was full of little jars boxes and all sorts of droll contrivances for holding small quantities of flour meal sugar salt and other household stores a pot of jam was there a little tin box of gingerbread a cologne bottle full of currant wine and a tiny canister of tea but the crowning charm was two dolls pans of new milk with cream actually rising on it and a wee skimmer all ready to skim it with daisy clasped her hands at this delicious spectacle and wanted to skim it immediately but aunt jo said  not yet you will want the cream to eat on your apple pie at dinner and must not disturb it till then  am i going to have pie cried daisy hardly believing that such bliss could be in store for her  yes if your oven does well we will have two pies one apple and one strawberry said mrs jo who was nearly as much interested in the new play as daisy herself  oh what next asked sally all impatience to begin  shut the lower draught of the stove so that the oven may heat then wash your hands and get out the flour sugar salt butter and cinnamon see if the pieboard is clean and pare your apple ready to put in  daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be expected from so young a cook  i really dont know how to measure for such tiny pies i must guess at it and if these dont succeed we must try again said mrs jo looking rather perplexed and very much amused with the small concern before her take that little pan full of flour put in a pinch of salt and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate always remember to put your dry things together first and then the wet it mixes better so  i know how i saw asia do it dont i butter the pie plates too she did the first thing said daisy whisking the flour about at a great rate  quite right i do believe you have a gift for cooking you take to it so cleverly said aunt jo approvingly now a dash of cold water just enough to wet it then scatter some flour on the board work in a little and roll the paste out yes thats the way now put dabs of butter all over it and roll it out again we wont have our pastry very rich or the dolls will get dyspeptic  daisy laughed at the idea and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it next the apple was sliced in sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it and then the top crust put on with breathless care  i always wanted to cut them round and asia never would let me how nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self said daisy as the little knife went clipping round the dolls plate poised on her hand  all cooks even the best meet with mishaps sometimes and sallys first one occurred then for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped turned a somersault in the air and landed the dear little pie upside down on the floor sally screamed mrs jo laughed teddy scrambled to get it and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen  it didnt spill or break because i pinched the edges together so hard it isnt hurt a bit so ill prick holes in it and then it will be ready said sally picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into shape with a childlike disregard of the dust it had gathered in its fall  my new cook has a good temper i see and that is such a comfort said mrs jo now open the jar of strawberry jam fill the uncovered pie and put some strips of paste over the top as asia does  ill make a d in the middle and have zigzags all round that will be so interesting when i come to eat it said sally loading the pie with quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild now i put them in she exclaimed when the last grimy knob had been carefully planted in the red field of jam and with an air of triumph she shut them into the little oven  clear up your things a good cook never lets her utensils collect then pare your squash and potatoes  there is only one potato giggled sally  cut it in four pieces so it will go into the little kettle and put the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them  do i soak the squash too  no indeed just pare it and cut it up and put in into the steamer over the pot it is drier so though it takes longer to cook  here a scratching at the door caused sally to run and open it when kit appeared with a covered basket in his mouth  heres the butcher boy cried daisy much tickled at the idea as she relieved him of his load whereat he licked his lips and began to beg evidently thinking that it was his own dinner for he often carried it to his master in that way being undeceived he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs to ease his wounded feelings  in the basket were two bits of steak dolls pounds a baked pear a small cake and paper with them on which asia had scrawled for missys lunch if her cookin dont turn out well  i dont want any of her old pears and things my cooking will turn out well and ill have a splendid dinner see if i dont cried daisy indignantly  we may like them if company should come it is always well to have something in the storeroom said aunt jo who had been taught this valuable fact by a series of domestic panics  me is hundry announced teddy who began to think what with so much cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something his mother gave him her workbasket to rummage hoping to keep him quiet till dinner was ready and returned to her housekeeping  put on your vegetables set the table and then have some coals kindling ready for the steak  what a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer to whisk open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on and at last when the coals were red and glowing to put two real steaks on a fingerlong gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork the potatoes were done first and no wonder for they had boiled frantically all the while the were pounded up with a little pestle had much butter and no salt put in cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment then it was made into a mound in a gay red dish smoothed over with a knife dipped in milk and put in the oven to brown  so absorbed in these last performances had sally been that she forgot her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato then a wail arose for alas alas the little pies were burnt black  oh my pies my darling pies they are all spoilt cried poor sally wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work the tart was especially pathetic for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in all directions from the blackened jelly like the walls and chimney of a house after a fire  dear dear i forgot to remind you to take them out its just my luck said aunt jo remorsefully dont cry darling it was my fault well try again after dinner she added as a great tear dropped from sallys eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart  more would have followed if the steak had not blazed up just then and so occupied the attention of cook that she quickly forgot the lost pastry  put the meatdish and your own plates down to warm while you mash the squash with butter salt and a little pepper on the top said mrs jo devoutly hoping that the dinner would meet with no further disasters  the cunning pepperpot soothed sallys feelings and she dished up her squash in fine style the dinner was safely put upon the table the six dolls were seated three on a side teddy took the bottom and sally the top when all were settled it was a most imposing spectacle for one doll was in full ball costume another in her nightgown jerry the worsted boy wore his red winter suit while annabella the noseless darling was airily attired in nothing but her own kid skin teddy as father of the family behaved with great propriety for he smilingly devoured everything offered him and did not find a single fault daisy beamed upon her company like the weary warm but hospitable hostess so often to be seen at larger tables than this and did the honors with an air of innocent satisfaction which we do not often see elsewhere  the steak was so tough that the little carvingknife would not cut it the potato did not go round and the squash was very lumpy but the guests appeared politely unconscious of these trifles and the master and mistress of the house cleared the table with appetites that anyone might envy them the joy of skimming a jugfull of cream mitigated the anguish felt for the loss of the pies and asias despised cake proved a treasure in the way of dessert  that is the nicest lunch i ever had cant i do it every day asked daisy as she scraped up and ate the leavings all round  you can cook things every day after lessons but i prefer that you should eat your dishes at your regular meals and only have a bit of gingerbread for lunch today being the first time i dont mind but we must keep our rules this afternoon you can make something for tea if you like said mrs jo who had enjoyed the dinnerparty very much though no one had invited her to partake  do let me make flapjacks for demi he loves them so and its such fun to turn them and put sugar in between cried daisy tenderly wiping a yellow stain off annabellas broken nose for bella had refused to eat squash when it was pressed upon her as good for lumatism a complaint which it is no wonder she suffered from considering the lightness of her attire  but if you give demi goodies all the others will expect some also and then you will have your hands full  couldnt i have demi come up to tea alone just this one time and after that i could cook things for the others if they were good proposed daisy with a sudden inspiration  that is a capital idea posy we will make your little messes rewards for the good boys and i dont know one among them who would not like something nice to eat more than almost anything else if little men are like big ones good cooking will touch their hearts and soothe their tempers delightfully added aunt jo with a merry nod toward the door where stood papa bhaer surveying the scene with a face full of amusement  that last hit was for me sharp woman i accept it for it is true but if i had married thee for thy cooking hearts dearest i should have fared badly all these years answered the professor laughing as he tossed teddy who became quite apoplectic in his endeavors to describe the feast he had just enjoyed  daisy proudly showed her kitchen and rashly promised uncle fritz as many flapjacks as he could eat she was just telling about the new rewards when the boys headed by demi burst into the room snuffing the air like a pack of hungry hounds for school was out dinner was not ready and the fragrance of daisys steak led them straight to the spot  a prouder little damsel was never seen than sally as she displayed her treasures and told the lads what was in store for them several rather scoffed at the idea of her cooking anything fit to eat but stuffys heart was won at once nat and demi had firm faith in her skill and the others said they would wait and see all admired the kitchen however and examined the stove with deep interest demi offered to buy the boiler on the spot to be used in a steamengine which he was constructing and ned declared that the best and biggest saucepan was just the thing to melt his lead in when he ran bullets hatchets and such trifles  daisy looked so alarmed at these proposals that mrs jo then and there made and proclaimed a law that no boy should touch use or even approach the sacred stove without a special permit from the owner thereof this increased its value immensely in the eyes of the gentlemen especially as any infringement of the law would be punished by forfeiture of all right to partake of the delicacies promised to the virtuous  at this point the bell rang and the entire population went down to dinner which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving daisy a list of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as he earned them daisy whose faith in her stove was unlimited promised everything if aunt jo would tell her how to make them this suggestion rather alarmed mrs jo for some of the dishes were quite beyond her skill weddingcake for instance bullseye candy and cabbage soup with herrings and cherries in it which mr bhaer proposed as his favorite and immediately reduced his wife to despair for german cookery was beyond her  daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done but she was only allowed to clear up fill the kettle ready for tea and wash out her apron which looked as if she had a christmas feast she was then sent out to play till five oclock for uncle fritz said that too much study even at cooking stoves was bad for little minds and bodies and aunt jo knew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are not prudently used  everyone was very kind to daisy that afternoon tommy promised her the first fruits of his garden though the only visible crop just then was pigweed nat offered to supply her with wood free of charge stuffy quite worshipped her ned immediately fell to work on a little refrigerator for her kitchen and demi with a punctuality beautiful to see in one so young escorted her to the nursery just as the clock struck five it was not time for the party to begin but he begged so hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors enjoy for he kindled the fire ran errands and watched the progress of his supper with intense interest mrs jo directed the affair as she came and went being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the house  ask asia for a cup of sour cream then your cakes will be light without much soda which i dont like was the first order  demi tore downstairs and returned with the cream also a puckeredup face for he had tasted it on his way and found it so sour that he predicted the cakes would be uneatable mrs jo took this occasion to deliver a short lecture from the stepladder on the chemical properties of soda to which daisy did not listen but demi did and understood it as he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply  yes i see soda turns sour things sweet and the fizzling up makes them light lets see you do it daisy  fill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to it continued mrs jo  oh dear everything has to have salt in it seems to me said sally who was tired of opening the pillbox in which it was kept  salt is like goodhumor and nearly every thing is better for a pinch of it posy and uncle fritz stopped as he passed hammer in hand to drive up two or three nails for sallys little pans to hang on  you are not invited to tea but ill give you some cakes and i wont be cross said daisy putting up her floury little face to thank him with a kiss  fritz you must not interrupt my cooking class or ill come in and moralize when you are teaching latin how would you like that said mrs jo throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head  very much try it and see and the amiable father bhaer went singing and tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker  put the soda into the cream and when it fizzles as demi says stir it into the flour and beat it up as hard as ever you can have your griddle hot butter it well and then fry away till i come back and aunt jo vanished also  such a clatter as the little spoon made and such a beating as the batter got it quite foamed i assure you and when daisy poured some on to the griddle it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that made demis mouth water to be sure the first one stuck and scorched because she forgot the butter but after that first failure all went well and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish  i think i like maplesyrup better than sugar said demi from his armchair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a new and peculiar manner  then go and ask asia for some answered daisy going into the bathroom to wash her hands  while the nursery was empty something dreadful happened you see kit had been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yet got none to pay him he was not a bad dog but he had his little faults like the rest of us and could not always resist temptation happening to stroll into the nursery at that moment he smelt the cakes saw them unguarded on the low table and never stopping to think of consequences swallowed all six at one mouthful i am glad to say that they were very hot and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp daisy heard it ran in saw the empty dish also the end of a yellow tail disappearing under the bed without a word she seized that tail pulled out the thief and shook him till his ears flapped wildly then bundled him downstairs to the shed where he spent a lonely evening in the coalbin  cheered by the sympathy which demi gave her daisy made another bowlful of batter and fried a dozen cakes which were even better than the others indeed uncle fritz after eating two sent up word that he had never tasted any so nice and every boy at the table below envied demi at the flapjack party above  it was a truly delightful supper for the little teapot lid only fell off three times and the milk jug upset but once the cakes floated in syrup and the toast had a delicious beefsteak flavor owing to cooks using the gridiron to make it on demi forgot philosophy and stuffed like any carnal boy while daisy planned sumptuous banquets and the dolls looked on smiling affably  well dearies have you had a good time asked mrs jo coming up with teddy on her shoulder  a very good time i shall come again soon answered demi with emphasis  im afraid you have eaten too much by the look of that table  no i havent i only ate fifteen cakes and they were very little ones protested demi who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate  they wont hurt him they are so nice said daisy with such a funny mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that aunt jo could only smile and say  well on the whole the new game is a success then  i like it said demi as if his approval was all that was necessary  it is the dearest play ever made cried daisy hugging her little dishtub as she proposed to wash up the cups i just wish everybody had a sweet cooking stove like mine she added regarding it with affection  this play out to have a name said demi gravely removing the syrup from his countenance with his tongue  it has  oh what asked both children eagerly  well i think we will call it pattypans and aunt jo retired satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam    chapter vi a fire brand  please maam could i speak to you it is something very important said nat popping his head in at the door of mrs bhaers room  it was the fifth head which had popped in during the last halfhour but mrs jo was used to it so she looked up and said briskly  what is it my lad  nat came in shut the door carefully behind him and said in an eager anxious tone  dan has come  who is dan  hes a boy i used to know when i fiddled round the streets he sold papers and he was kind to me and i saw him the other day in town and told him how nice it was here and hes come  but my dear boy that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit  oh it isnt a visit he wants to stay if you will let him said nat innocently  well i dont know about that began mrs bhaer rather startled by the coolness of the proposition  why i thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you and be kind to em as you were to me said nat looking surprised and alarmed  so i do but i like to know something about them first i have to choose them because there are so many i have not room for all i wish i had  i told him to come because i thought youd like it but if there isnt room he can go away again said nat sorrowfully  the boys confidence in her hospitality touched mrs bhaer and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope and spoil his kind little plan so she said  tell me about this dan  i dont know any thing only he hasnt got any folks and hes poor and he was good to me so id like to be good to him if i could  excellent reasons every one but really nat the house is full and i dont know where i could put him said mrs bhaer more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her  he could have my bed and i could sleep in the barn it isnt cold now and i dont mind i used to sleep anywhere with father said nat eagerly  something in his speech and face made mrs jo put her hand on his shoulder and say in her kindest tone  bring in your friend nat i think we must find room for him without giving him your place  nat joyfully ran off and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy who slouched in and stood looking about him with a half bold half sullen look which made mrs bhaer say to herself after one glance  a bad specimen i am afraid  this is dan said nat presenting him as if sure of his welcome  nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us began mrs jo in a friendly tone  yes was the gruff reply  have you no friends to take care of you  no  say no maam whispered nat  shant neither muttered dan  how old are you  about fourteen  you look older what can you do  most anything  if you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do work and study as well as play are you willing to agree to that  dont mind trying  well you can stay a few days and we will see how we get on together take him out nat and amuse him till mr bhaer comes home when we will settle about the matter said mrs jo finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard suspicious expression sorrowfully unboyish  come on nat he said and slouched out again  thank you maam added nat as he followed him feeling without quite understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his ungracious friend  the fellows are having a circus out in the barn dont you want to come and see it he asked as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn  are they big fellows said dan  no the big ones are gone fishing  fire away then said dan  nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set who were disporting themselves among the halfempty lofts a large circle was marked out with hay on the wide floor and in the middle stood demi with a long whip while tommy mounted on the muchenduring toby pranced about the circle playing being a monkey  you must pay a pin apiece or you cant see the show said stuffy who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band consisting of a pocketcomb blown upon by ned and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by rob  hes company so ill pay for both said nat handsomely as he stuck two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as moneybox  with a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards and the performance went on after the monkey act ned gave them a fine specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair and running up and down ladders sailor fashion then demi danced a jig with a gravity beautiful to behold nat was called upon to wrestle with stuffy and speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground after this tommy proudly advanced to turn a somersault an accomplishment which he had acquired by painful perseverance practising in private till every joint of his little frame was black and blue his feats were received with great applause and he was about to retire flushed with pride and a rush of blood to the head when a scornful voice in the audience was heard to say  ho that aint any thing  say that again will you and tommy bristled up like an angry turkeycock  do you want to fight said dan promptly descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a businesslike manner  no i dont and the candid thomas retired a step rather taken aback by the proposition  fighting isnt allowed cried the others much excited  youre a nice lot sneered dan  come if you dont behave you shant stay said nat firing up at that insult to his friends  id like to see him do better than i did thats all observed tommy with a swagger  clear the way then and without the slightest preparation dan turned three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet  you cant beat that tom you always hit your head and tumble flat said nat pleased at his friends success  before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more somersaults backwards and a short promenade on the hands head down feet up this brought down the house and tommy joined in the admiring cries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself and looked at them with an air of calm superiority  do you think i could learn to do it without its hurting me very much tom meekly asked as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after the last attempt  what will you give me if ill teach you said dan  my new jackknife its got five blades and only one is broken  give it here then  tommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle dan examined it carefully then putting it into his pocket walked off saying with a wink  keep it up till you learn thats all  a howl of wrath from tommy was followed by a general uproar which did not subside till dan finding himself in a minority proposed that they should play stickknife and whichever won should have the treasure tommy agreed and the game was played in a circle of excited faces which all wore an expression of satisfaction when tommy won and secured the knife in the depth of his safest pocket  you come off with me and ill show you round said nat feeling that he must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private  what passed between them no one knew but when they appeared again dan was more respectful to every one though still gruff in his speech and rough in his manner and what else could be expected of the poor lad who had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one to teach him any better  the boys had decided that they did not like him and so they left him to nat who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility but too kindhearted to desert him  tommy however felt that in spite of the jackknife transaction there was a bond of sympathy between them and longed to return to the interesting subject of somersaults he soon found an opportunity for dan seeing how much he admired him grew more amiable and by the end of the first week was quite intimate with the lively tom  mr bhaer when he heard the story and saw dan shook his head but only said quietly  the experiment may cost us something but we will try it  if dan felt any gratitude for his protection he did not show it and took without thanks all that was give him he was ignorant but very quick to learn when he chose had sharp eyes to watch what went on about him a saucy tongue rough manners and a temper that was fierce and sullen by turns he played with all his might and played well at almost all the games he was silent and gruff before grown people and only now and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads few of them really liked him but few could help admiring his courage and strength for nothing daunted him and he knocked tall franz flat on one occasion with an ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance from his fists mr bhaer watched him silently and did his best to tame the wild boy as they called him but in private the worthy man shook his head and said soberly i hope the experiment will turn out well but i am a little afraid it may cost too much  mrs bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day yet never gave him up and always insisted that there was something good in the lad after all for he was kinder to animals than to people he liked to rove about in the woods and best of all little ted was fond of him what the secret was no one could discover but baby took to him at once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong back to ride on to any of the others and called him my danny out of his own little head teddy was the only creature to whom dan showed an affection and this was only manifested when he thought no one else would see it but mothers eyes are quick and motherly hearts instinctively divine who love their babies so mrs jo soon saw and felt that there was a soft spot in rough dan and bided her time to touch and win him  but an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plans and banished dan from plumfield  tommy nat and demi began by patronizing dan because the other lads rather slighted him but soon they each felt there was a certain fascination about the bad boy and from looking down upon him they came to looking up each for a different reason tommy admired his skill and courage nat was grateful for past kindness and demi regarded him as a sort of animated story book for when he chose dan could tell his adventures in a most interesting way it pleased dan to have the three favorites like him and he exerted himself to be agreeable which was the secret of his success  the bhaers were surprised but hoped the lads would have a good influence over dan and waited with some anxiety trusting that no harm would come of it  dan felt they did not quite trust him and never showed them his best side but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting their hopes as far as he dared  mr bhaer did not approve of fighting and did not think it a proof of either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for the amusement of the rest all sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play  dan laughed at this rule and told such exciting tales of his own valor and the many frays that he had been in that some of the lads were fired with a desire to have a regular good mill  dont tell and ill show you how said dan and getting half a dozen of the lads together behind the barn he gave them a lesson in boxing which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them emil however could not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself for emil was past fourteen and a plucky fellow so he challenged dan to a fight dan accepted at once and the others looked on with intense interest  what little bird carried the news to headquarters no one ever knew but in the very hottest of the fray when dan and emil were fighting like a pair of young bulldogs and the others with fierce excited faces were cheering them on mr bhaer walked into the ring plucked the combatants apart with a strong hand and said in the voice they seldom heard  i cant allow this boys stop it at once and never let me see it again i keep a school for boys not for wild beasts look at each other and be ashamed of yourselves  you let me go and ill knock him down again shouted dan sparring away in spite of the grip on his collar  come on come on i aint thrashed yet cried emil who had been down five times but did not know when he was beaten  they are playing be gladdy whatyoucallems like the romans uncle fritz called out demi whose eyes were bigger than ever with the excitement of this new pastime  they were a fine set of brutes but we have learned something since then i hope and i cannot have you make my barn a colosseum who proposed this asked mr bhaer  dan answered several voices  dont you know that it is forbidden  yes growled dan sullenly  then why break the rule  theyll all be mollycoddles if they dont know how to fight  have you found emil a mollycoddle he doesnt look much like one and mr bhaer brought the two face to face dan had a black eye and his jacket was torn to rags but emils face was covered with blood from a cut lip and a bruised nose while a bump on his forehead was already as purple as a plum in spite of his wounds however he still glared upon his foe and evidently panted to renew the fight  hed make a firstrater if he was taught said dan unable to withhold the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best  hell be taught to fence and box by and by and till then i think he will do very well without any lessons in mauling go and wash your faces and remember dan if you break any more of the rules again you will be sent away that was the bargain do your part and we will do ours  the lads went off and after a few more words to the spectators mr bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators emil went to bed sick and dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week  but the lawless lad had no thought of obeying and soon transgressed again  one saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play tommy said  lets go down to the river and cut a lot of new fishpoles  take toby to drag them back and one of us can ride him down proposed stuffy who hated to walk  that means you i suppose well hurry up lazybones said dan  away they went and having got the poles were about to go home when demi unluckily said to tommy who was on toby with a long rod in his hand  you look like the picture of the man in the bullfight only you havent got a red cloth or pretty clothes on  id like to see one theres old buttercup in the big meadow ride at her tom and see her run proposed dan bent on mischief  no you mustnt began demi who was learning to distrust dans propositions  why not little fussbutton demanded dan  i dont think uncle fritz would like it  did he ever say we must not have a bullfight  no i dont think he ever did admitted demi  then hold your tongue drive on tom and heres a red rag to flap at the old thing ill help you to stir her up and over the wall went dan full of the new game and the rest followed like a flock of sheep even demi who sat upon the bars and watched the fun with interest  poor buttercup was not in a very good mood for she had been lately bereft of her calf and mourned for the little thing most dismally just now she regarded all mankind as her enemies and i do not blame her so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief flying at the end of his long lance she threw up her head and gave a most appropriate moo tommy rode gallantly at her and toby recognizing an old friend was quite willing to approach but when the lance came down on her back with a loud whack both cow and donkey were surprised and disgusted toby back with a bray of remonstrance and buttercup lowered her horns angrily  at her again tom shes jolly cross and will do it capitally called dan coming up behind with another rod while jack and ned followed his example  seeing herself thus beset and treated with such disrespect buttercup trotted round the field getting more and more bewildered and excited every moment for whichever way she turned there was a dreadful boy yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip it was great fun for them but real misery for her till she lost patience and turned the tables in the most unexpected manner all at once she wheeled short round and charged full at her old friend toby whose conduct cut her to the heart poor slow toby backed so precipitately that he tripped over a stone and down went horse matadore and all in one ignominious heap while distracted buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall and galloped wildly out of sight down the road  catch her stop her head her off run boys run shouted dan tearing after her at his best pace for she was mr bhaers pet alderney and if anything happened to her dan feared it would be all over with him such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as there was before she was caught the fishpoles were left behind toby was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase and every boy was red breathless and scared they found poor buttercup at last in a flower garden where she had taken refuge worn out with the long run borrowing a rope for a halter dan led her home followed by a party of very sober young gentlemen for the cow was in a sad state having strained her shoulder jumping so that she limped her eyes looked wild and her glossy coat was wet and muddy  youll catch it this time dan said tommy as he led the wheezing donkey beside the maltreated cow  so will you for you helped  we all did but demi added jack  he put it into our heads said ned  i told you not to do it cried demi who was most brokenhearted at poor buttercups state  old bhaer will send me off i guess dont care if he does muttered dan looking worried in spite of his words  well ask him not to all of us said demi and the others assented with the exception of stuffy who cherished the hope that all the punishment might fall on one guilty head dan only said dont bother about me but he never forgot it even though he led the lads astray again as soon as the temptation came  when mr bhaer saw the animal and heard the story he said very little evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of impatience buttercup was made comfortable in her stall and the boys sent to their rooms till suppertime this brief respite gave them time to think the matter over to wonder what the penalty would be and to try to imagine where dan would be sent he whistled briskly in his room so that no one should think he cared a bit but while he waited to know his fate the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger the more he recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here the hardship and neglect he had felt elsewhere he knew they tried to help him and at the bottom of his heart he was grateful but his rough life had made him hard and careless suspicious and wilful he hated restraint of any sort and fought against it like an untamed creature even while he knew it was kindly meant and dimly felt that he would be the better for it he made up his mind to be turned adrift again to knock about the city as he had done nearly all his life a prospect that made him knit his black brows and look about the cosy little room with a wistful expression that would have touched a much harder heart than mr bhaers if he had seen it it vanished instantly however when the good man came in and said in his accustomed grave way  i have heard all about it dan and though you have broken the rules again i am going to give you one more trial to please mother bhaer  dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve but he only said in his gruff way  i didnt know there was any rule about bullfighting  as i never expected to have any at plumfield i never did make such a rule answered mr bhaer smiling in spite of himself at the boys excuse then he added gravely but one of the first and most important of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the place i want everybody and everything to be happy here to love and trust and serve us as we try to love and trust and serve them faithfully and willingly i have often said that you were kinder to the animals than any of the other boys and mrs bhaer liked that trait in you very much because she thought it showed a good heart but you have disappointed us in that and we are sorry for we hoped to make you quite one of us shall we try again  dans eyes had been on the floor and his hands nervously picking at the bit of wood he had been whittling as mr bhaer came in but when he heard the kind voice ask that question he looked up quickly and said in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before  yes please  very well then we will say no more only you will stay at home from the walk tomorrow as the other boys will and all of you must wait on poor buttercup till she is well again  i will  now go down to supper and do your best my boy more for your own sake than for ours then mr bhaer shook hands with him and dan went down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping which asia had strongly recommended  dan did try for a day or two but not being used to it he soon tired and relapsed into his old wilful ways mr bhaer was called from home on business one day and the boys had no lessons they liked this and played hard till bedtime when most of them turned in and slept like dormice dan however had a plan in his head and when he and nat were alone he unfolded it  look here he said taking from under his bed a bottle a cigar and a pack of cards im going to have some fun and do as i used to with the fellows in town heres some beer i got if of the old man at the station and this cigar you can pay for em or tommy will hes got heaps of money and i havent a cent im going to ask him in no you go they wont mind you  the folks wont like it began nat  they wont know daddy bhaer is away and mrs bhaers busy with ted hes got croup or something and she cant leave him we shant sit up late or make any noise so wheres the harm  asia will know if we burn the lamp long she always does  no she wont ive got a dark lantern on purpose it dont give much light and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming said dan  this idea struck nat as a fine one and lent an air of romance to the thing he started off to tell tommy but put his head in again to say  you want demi too dont you  no i dont the deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him he will be asleep so just tip the wink to tom and cut back again  nat obeyed and returned in a minute with tommy half dressed rather tousled about the head and very sleepy but quite ready for fun as usual  now keep quiet and ill show you how to play a firstrate game called poker said dan as the three revellers gathered round the table on which were set forth the bottle the cigar and the cards first well all have a drink then well take a go at the weed and then well play thats the way men do and its jolly fun  the beer circulated in a mug and all three smacked their lips over it though nat and tommy did not like the bitter stuff the cigar was worse still but they dared not say so and each puffed away till he was dizzy or choked when he passed the weed on to his neighbor dan liked it for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance to imitate the low men who surrounded him he drank and smoked and swaggered as much like them as he could and getting into the spirit of the part he assumed he soon began to swear under his breath for fear some one should hear him you mustnt its wicked to say damn cried tommy who had followed his leader so far  oh hang dont you preach but play away its part of the fun to swear  id rather say thunder turtles said tommy who had composed this interesting exclamation and was very proud of it  and ill say the devil that sounds well added nat much impressed by dans manly ways  dan scoffed at their nonsense and swore stoutly as he tried to teach them the new game  but tommy was very sleepy and nats head began to ache with the beer and the smoke so neither of them was very quick to learn and the game dragged the room was nearly dark for the lantern burned badly they could not laugh loud nor move about much for silas slept next door in the shedchamber and altogether the party was dull in the middle of a deal dan stopped suddenly and called out whos that in a startled tone and at the same moment drew the slide over the light a voice in the darkness said tremulously i cant find tommy and then there was the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from the wing to the main house  its demi hes gone to call some one cut into bed tom and dont tell cried dan whisking all signs of the revel out of sight and beginning to tear off his clothes while nat did the same  tommy flew to his room and dived into bed where he lay laughing till something burned his hand when he discovered that he was still clutching the stump of the festive cigar which he happened to be smoking when the revel broke up  it was nearly out and he was about to extinguish it carefully when nurseys voice was heard and fearing it would betray him if he hid it in the bed he threw it underneath after a final pinch which he thought finished it  nursey came in with demi who looked much amazed to see the red face of tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow  he wasnt there just now because i woke up and could not find him anywhere said demi pouncing on him  what mischief are you at now bad child asked nursey with a goodnatured shake which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly  i only ran into nats room to see him about something go away and let me alone im awful sleepy  nursey tucked demi in and went off to reconnoitre but only found two boys slumbering peacefully in dans room some little frolic she thought and as there was no harm done she said nothing to mrs bhaer who was busy and worried over little teddy  tommy was sleepy and telling demi to mind his own business and not ask questions he was snoring in ten minutes little dreaming what was going on under his bed the cigar did not go out but smouldered away on the straw carpet till it was nicely on fire and a hungry little flame went creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught then the sheets and then the bed itself the beer made tommy sleep heavily and the smoke stupified demi so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them and they were in danger of being burned to death  franz was sitting up to study and as he left the schoolroom he smelt the smoke dashed upstairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left wing of the house without stopping to call any one he ran into the room dragged the boys from the blazing bed and splashed all the water he could find at hand on to the flames it checked but did not quench the fire and the children wakened on being tumbled topsyturvy into a cold hall began to roar at the top of their voices mrs bhaer instantly appeared and a minute after silas burst out of his room shouting fire in a tone that raised the whole house a flock of white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall and for a minute every one was panicstricken  then mrs bhaer found her wits bade nursey see to the burnt boys and sent franz and silas downstairs for some tubs of wet clothes which she flung on the bed over the carpet and up against the curtains now burning finely and threatening to kindle the walls  most of the boys stood dumbly looking on but dan and emil worked bravely running to and fro with water from the bathroom and helping to pull down the dangerous curtains  the peril was soon over and ordering the boys all back to bed and leaving silas to watch lest the fire broke out again mrs bhaer and franz went to see how the poor boys got on demi had escaped with one burn and a grand scare but tommy had not only most of his hair scorched off his head but a great burn on his arm that made him half crazy with the pain demi was soon made cosy and franz took him away to his own bed where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as cosily as a woman nursey watched over poor tommy all night trying to ease his misery and mrs bhaer vibrated between him and little teddy with oil and cotton paregoric and squills saying to herself from time to time as if she found great amusement in the thought i always knew tommy would set the house on fire and now he has done it  when mr bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things tommy in bed teddy wheezing like a little grampus mrs jo quite used up and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins under his quiet management things soon fell into order for every one felt that he was equal to a dozen conflagrations and worked with a will at whatever task he gave them  there was no school that morning but by afternoon the damaged room was put to rights the invalids were better and there was time to hear and judge the little culprits quietly nat and tommy told their parts in the mischief and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the dear old house and all in it but dan put on his devilmaycare look and would not own that there was much harm done  now of all things mr bhaer hated drinking gambling and swearing smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy with whom he had tried to be most forbearing should take advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden vices and teach his innocent little lads to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them he talked long and earnestly to the assembled boys and ended by saying with an air of mingled firmness and regret  i think tommy is punished enough and that scar on his arm will remind him for a long time to let these things alone nats fright will do for him for he is really sorry and does try to obey me but you dan have been many times forgiven and yet it does no good i cannot have my boys hurt by your bad example nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears so you can say goodbye to them all and tell nursey to put up your things in my little black bag  oh sir where is he going cried nat  to a pleasant place up in the country where i sometimes send boys when they dont do well here mr page is a kind man and dan will be happy there if he chooses to do his best  will he ever come back asked demi  that will depend on himself i hope so  as he spoke mr bhaer left the room to write his letter to mr page and the boys crowded round dan very much as people do about a man who is going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions  i wonder if youll like it began jack  shant stay if i dont said dan coolly  where will you go asked nat  i may go to sea or out west or take a look at california answered dan with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little boys  oh dont stay with mr page awhile and then come back here do dan pleaded nat much affected at the whole affair  i dont care where i go or how long i stay and ill be hanged if i ever come back here with which wrathful speech dan went away to put up his things every one of which mr bhaer had given him  that was the only goodbye he gave the boys for they were all talking the matter over in the barn when he came down and he told nat not to call them the wagon stood at the door and mrs bhaer came out to speak to dan looking so sad that his heart smote him and he said in a low tone  may i say goodbye to teddy  yes dear go in and kiss him he will miss his danny very much  no one saw the look in dans eyes as he stooped over the crib and saw the little face light up at first sight of him but he heard mrs bhaer say pleadingly  cant we give the poor lad one more trial fritz and mr bhaer answer in his steady way  my dear it is not best so let him go where he can do no harm to others while they do good to him and by and by he shall come back i promise you  hes the only boy we ever failed with and i am so grieved for i thought there was the making of a fine man in him spite of his faults  dan heard mrs bhaer sigh and he wanted to ask for one more trial himself but his pride would not let him and he came out with the hard look on his face shook hands without a word and drove away with mr bhaer leaving nat and mrs jo to look after him with tears in their eyes  a few days afterwards they received a letter from mr page saying that dan was doing well whereat they all rejoiced but three weeks later came another letter saying that dan had run away and nothing had been heard of him whereat they all looked sober and mr bhaer said  perhaps i ought to have given him another chance  mrs bhaer however nodded wisely and answered dont be troubled fritz the boy will come back to us im sure of it  but time went on and no dan came    chapter vii naughty nan  fritz ive got a new idea cried mrs bhaer as she met her husband one day after school  well my dear what is it and he waited willingly to hear the new plan for some of mrs jos ideas were so droll it was impossible to help laughing at them though usually they were quite sensible and he was glad to carry them out  daisy needs a companion and the boys would be all the better for another girl among them you know we believe in bringing up little men and women together and it is high time we acted up to our belief they pet and tyrannize over daisy by turns and she is getting spoilt then they must learn gentle ways and improve their manners and having girls about will do it better than any thing else  you are right as usual now who shall we have asked mr bhaer seeing by the look in her eye that mrs jo had some one all ready to propose  little annie harding  what naughty nan as the lads call her cried mr bhaer looking very much amused  yes she is running wild at home since her mother died and is too bright a child to be spoilt by servants i have had my eye on her for some time and when i met her father in town the other day i asked him why he did not send her to school he said he would gladly if he could find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys i know he would rejoice to have her come so suppose we drive over this afternoon and see about it  have not you cares enough now my jo without this little gypsy to torment you asked mr bhaer patting the hand that lay on his arm  oh dear no said mother bhaer briskly i like it and never was happier than since i had my wilderness of boys you see fritz i feel a great sympathy for nan because i was such a naughty child myself that i know all about it she is full of spirits and only needs to be taught what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as daisy those quick wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed and what is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy happy child i know how to manage her for i remember how my blessed mother managed me and  and if you succeed half as well as she did you will have done a magnificent work interrupted mr bhaer who labored under the delusion that mrs b was the best and most charming woman alive  now if you make fun of my plan ill give you bad coffee for a week and then where are you sir cried mrs jo tweaking him by the ear just as if he was one of the boys  wont daisys hair stand erect with horror at nans wild ways asked mr bhaer presently when teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat and rob up his back for they always flew at their father the minute school was done  at first perhaps but it will do posy good she is getting prim and bettyish and needs stirring up a bit she always has a good time when nan comes over to play and the two will help each other without knowing it dear me half the science of teaching is knowing how much children do for one another and when to mix them  i only hope she wont turn out another firebrand  my poor dan i never can quite forgive myself for letting him go sighed mrs bhaer  at the sound of the name little teddy who had never forgotten his friend struggled down from his fathers arms and trotted to the door looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face and then trotted back again saying as he always did when disappointed of the longedfor sight  my dannys tummin soon  i really think we ought to have kept him if only for teddys sake he was so fond of him and perhaps babys love would have done for him what we failed to do  ive sometimes felt that myself but after keeping the boys in a ferment and nearly burning up the whole family i thought it safer to remove the firebrand for a time at least said mr bhaer  dinners ready let me ring the bell and rob began a solo upon that instrument which made it impossible to hear ones self speak  then i may have nan may i asked mrs jo  a dozen nans if you want them my dear answered mr bhaer who had room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the world  when mrs bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon before she could unpack the load of little boys without whom she seldom moved a small girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carryall and ran into the house shouting  hi daisy where are you  daisy came and looked pleased to see her guest but also a trifle alarmed when nan said still prancing as if it was impossible to keep still  im going to stay here always papa says i may and my box is coming tomorrow all my things had to be washed and mended and your aunt came and carried me off isnt it great fun  why yes did you bring your big doll asked daisy hoping she had for on the last visit nan had ravaged the baby house and insisted on washing blanche matildas plaster face which spoilt the poor dears complexion for ever  yes shes somewhere round returned nan with most unmaternal carelessness i made you a ring coming along and pulled the hairs out of dobbins tail dont you want it and nan presented a horsehair ring in token of friendship as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted  won by the beauty of the offering daisy grew more cordial and proposed retiring to the nursery but nan said no i want to see the boys and the barn and ran off swinging her hat by one string till it broke when she left it to its fate on the grass  hullo nan cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement  im going to stay  hooray bawled tommy from the wall on which he was perched for nan was a kindred spirit and he foresaw larks in the future  i can bat let me play said nan who could turn her hand to any thing and did not mind hard knocks  we aint playing now and our side beat without you  i can beat you in running any way returned nan falling back on her strong point  can she asked nat of jack  she runs very well for a girl answered jack who looked down upon nan with condescending approval  will you try said nan longing to display her powers  its too hot and tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted  whats the matter with stuffy asked nan whose quick eyes were roving from face to face  ball hurt his hand he howls at every thing answered jack scornfully  i dont i never cry no matter how im hurt its babyish said nan loftily  pooh i could make you cry in two minutes returned stuffy rousing up  see if you can  go and pick that bunch of nettles then and stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall  nan instantly grasped the nettle pulled it up and held it with a defiant gesture in spite of the almost unbearable sting  good for you cried the boys quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex  more nettled than she was stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow and he said tauntingly you are used to poking your hands into every thing so that isnt fair now go and bump your head real hard against the barn and see if you dont howl then  dont do it said nat who hated cruelty  but nan was off and running straight at the barn she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat and sounded like a batteringram dizzy but undaunted she staggered up saying stoutly though her face was drawn with pain  that hurt but i dont cry  do it again said stuffy angrily and nan would have done it but nat held her and tommy forgetting the heat flew at stuffy like a little gamecock roaring out  stop it or ill throw you over the barn and so shook and hustled poor stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels  she told me to was all he could say when tommy let him alone  never mind if she did it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl said demi reproachfully  ho i dont mind i aint a little girl im older than you and daisy so now cried nan ungratefully  dont preach deacon you bully posy every day of your life called out the commodore who just then hove in sight  i dont hurt her do i daisy and demi turned to his sister who was pooring nans tingling hands and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead  you are the best boy in the world promptly answered daisy adding as truth compelled her to do you hurt me sometimes but you dont mean to  put away the bats and things and mind what you are about my hearties no fighting allowed aboard this ship said emil who rather lorded it over the others  how do you do madge wildfire said mr bhaer as nan came in with the rest to supper give the right hand little daughter and mind thy manners he added as nan offered him her left  the other hurts me  the poor little hand what has it been doing to get those blisters he asked drawing it from behind her back where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief  before nan could think of any excuse daisy burst out with the whole story during which stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk when the tale was finished mr bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife and said with a laugh in his eyes  this rather belongs to your side of the house so i wont meddle with it my dear  mrs jo knew what he meant but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck though she only said in her soberest way  do you know why i asked nan to come here  to plague me muttered stuffy with his mouth full  to help make little gentlemen of you and i think you have shown that some of you need it  here stuffy retired into his bowl again and did not emerge till demi made them all laugh by saying in his slow wondering way  how can she when shes such a tomboy  thats just it she needs help as much as you and i expect you set her an example of good manners  is she going to be a little gentleman too asked rob  shed like it wouldnt you nan added tommy  no i shouldnt i hate boys said nan fiercely for her hand still smarted and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way  i am sorry you hate my boys because they can be wellmannered and most agreeable when they choose kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves  mrs bhaer had addressed herself to nan but the boys nudged one another and appeared to take the hint for that time at least and passed the butter said please and thank you yes sir and no maam with unusual elegance and respect nan said nothing but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling demi though strongly tempted to do so because of the dignified airs he put on she also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys and played i spy with them till dark stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candyball during the game which evidently sweetened her temper for the last thing she said on going to bed was  when my battledore and shuttlecock comes ill let you all play with em  her first remark in the morning was has my box come and when told that it would arrive sometime during the day she fretted and fumed and whipped her doll till daisy was shocked she managed to exist however till five oclock when she disappeared and was not missed till suppertime because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with tommy and demi  i saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt said mary ann coming in with the hastypudding and finding every one asking where is nan  she has run home little gypsy cried mrs bhaer looking anxious  perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage suggested franz  that is impossible she does not know the way and if she found it she could never carry the box a mile said mrs bhaer beginning to think that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out  it would be like her and mr bhaer caught up his hat to go and find the child when a shout from jack who was at the window made everyone hurry to the door  there was miss nan to be sure tugging along a very large bandbox tied up in linen bag very hot and dusty and tired did she look but marched stoutly along and came puffing up to the steps where she dropped her load with a sigh of relief and sat down upon it observed as she crossed her tired arms  i couldnt wait any longer so i went and got it  but you did not know the way said tommy while the rest stood round enjoying the joke  oh i found it i never get lost  its a mile how could you go so far  well it was pretty far but i rested a good deal  wasnt that thing very heavy  its so round i couldnt get hold of it good and i thought my arms would break right off  i dont see how the stationmaster let you have it said tommy  i didnt say anything to him he was in the little ticket place and didnt see me so i just took it off the platform  run down and tell him it is all right franz or old dodd will think it is stolen said mr bhaer joining in the shout of laughter at nans coolness  i told you we would send for it if it did not come another time you must wait for you will get into trouble if you run away promise me this or i shall not dare to trust you out of my sight said mrs bhaer wiping the dust off nans little hot face  well i wont only papa tells me not to put off doing things so i dont  that is rather a poser i think you had better give her some supper now and a private lecture by and by said mr bhaer too much amused to be angry at the young ladys exploit  the boys thought it great fun and nan entertained them all suppertime with an account of her adventures for a big dog had barked at her a man had laughed at her a woman had given her a doughnut and her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink exhausted with her exertion  i fancy you will have your hands full now my dear tommy and nan are quite enough for one woman said mr bhaer half an hour later  i know it will take some time to tame the child but she is such a generous warmhearted little thing i should love her even if she were twice as naughty answered mrs jo pointing to the merry group in the middle of which stood nan giving away her things right and left as lavishly as if the big bandbox had no bottom  it was those good traits that soon made little giddygaddy as they called her a favorite with every one daisy never complained of being dull again for nan invented the most delightful plays and her pranks rivalled tommys to the amusement of the whole school she buried her big doll and forgot it for a week and found it well mildewed when she dragged it up daisy was in despair but nan took it to the painter who as at work about the house got him to paint it brick red with staring black eyes then she dressed it up with feathers and scarlet flannel and one of neds leaden hatchets and in the character of an indian chief the late poppydilla tomahawked all the other dolls and caused the nursery to run red with imaginary gore she gave away her new shoes to a beggar child hoping to be allowed to go barefoot but found it impossible to combine charity and comfort and was ordered to ask leave before disposing of her clothes she delighted the boys by making a fireship out of a shingle with two large sails wet with turpentine which she lighted and then sent the little vessel floating down the brook at dusk she harnessed the old turkeycock to a straw wagon and made him trot round the house at a tremendous pace she gave her coral necklace for four unhappy kittens which had been tormented by some heartless lads and tended them for days as gently as a mother dressing their wounds with cold cream feeding them with a dolls spoon and mourning over them when they died till she was consoled by one of demis best turtles she made silas tattoo an anchor on her arm like his and begged hard to have a blue star on each cheek but he dared not do it though she coaxed and scolded till the softhearted fellow longed to give in she rode every animal on the place from the big horse andy to the cross pig from whom she was rescued with difficulty whatever the boys dared her to do she instantly attempted no matter how dangerous it might be and they were never tired of testing her courage  mr bhaer suggested that they should see who would study best and nan found as much pleasure in using her quick wits and fine memory as her active feet and merry tongue while the lads had to do their best to keep their places for nan showed them that girls could do most things as well as boys and some things better there were no rewards in school but mr bhaers well done and mrs bhaers good report on the conscience book taught them to love duty for its own sake and try to do it faithfully sure sooner or later the recompense would come little nan was quick to feel the new atmosphere to enjoy it to show that it was what she needed for this little garden was full of sweet flowers half hidden by the weeds and when kind hands gently began to cultivate it all sorts of green shoots sprung up promising to blossom beautifully in the warmth of love and care the best climate for young hearts and souls all the world over    chapter viii pranks and plays  as there is no particular plan to this story except to describe a few scenes in the life at plumfield for the amusement of certain little persons we will gently ramble along in this chapter and tell some of the pastimes of mrs jos boys i beg leave to assure my honored readers that most of the incidents are taken from real life and that the oddest are the truest for no person no matter how vivid an imagination he may have can invent anything half so droll as the freaks and fancies that originate in the lively brains of little people  daisy and demi were full of these whims and lived in a world of their own peopled with lovely or grotesque creatures to whom they gave the queerest names and with whom they played the queerest games one of these nursery inventions was an invisible sprite called the naughty kittymouse whom the children had believed in feared and served for a long time they seldom spoke of it to any one else kept their rites as private as possible and as they never tried to describe it even to themselves this being had a vague mysterious charm very agreeable to demi who delighted in elves and goblins a most whimsical and tyrannical imp was the naughty kittymouse and daisy found a fearful pleasure in its service blindly obeying its most absurd demands which were usually proclaimed from the lips of demi whose powers of invention were great rob and teddy sometimes joined in these ceremonies and considered them excellent fun although they did not understand half that went on  one day after school demi whispered to his sister with an ominous wag of the head  the kittymouse wants us this afternoon  what for asked daisy anxiously  a sackerryfice answered demi solemnly there must be a fire behind the big rock at two oclock and we must all bring the things we like best and burn them he added with an awful emphasis on the last words  oh dear i love the new paper dollies aunt amy painted for me best of any thing must i burn them up cried daisy who never thought of denying the unseen tyrant any thing it demanded  every one i shall burn my boat my best scrapbook and all my soldiers said demi firmly  well i will but its too bad of kittymouse to want our very nicest things sighed daisy  a sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of so we must explained demi to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing uncle fritz describe the customs of the greeks to the big boys who were reading about them in school  is rob coming too asked daisy  yes and he is going to bring his toy village it is all made of wood you know and will burn nicely well have a grand bonfire and see them blaze up wont we  this brilliant prospect consoled daisy and she ate her dinner with a row of paper dolls before her as a sort of farewell banquet  at the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth each child bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable kittymouse teddy insisted on going also and seeing that all the others had toys he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm and old annabella under the other little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him  where are you going my chickens asked mrs jo as the flock passed her door  to play by the big rock cant we  yes only dont do near the pond and take good care of baby  i always do said daisy leading forth her charge with a capable air  now you must all sit round and not move till i tell you this flat stone is an altar and i am going to make a fire on it  demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze as he had seen the boys do at picnics when the flame burned well he ordered the company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle  i shall begin and as fast as my things are burnt you must bring yours  with that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures pasted in by himself this was followed by a dilapidated boat and then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death not one faltered or hung back from the splendid red and yellow captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs all vanished in the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead  now daisy called the high priest of kittymouse when his rich offerings had been consumed to the great satisfaction of the children  my dear dollies how can i let them go moaned daisy hugging the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe  you must commanded demi and with a farewell kiss to each daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals  let me keep one the dear blue thing she is so sweet besought the poor little mamma clutching her last in despair  more more growled an awful voice and demi cried thats the kittymouse she must have every one quick or she will scratch us  in went the precious blue belle flounces rosy hat and all and nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band  stand the houses and trees round and let them catch themselves it will be like a real fire then said demi who liked variety even in his sackerryfices  charmed by this suggestion the children arranged the doomed village laid a line of coals along the main street and then sat down to watch the conflagration it was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up fired a tree of the palm species which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion and in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily the wooden population stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads as they were till they also caught and blazed away without a cry it took some time to reduce the town to ashes and the lookerson enjoyed the spectacle immensely cheering as each house fell dancing like wild indians when the steeple flamed aloft and actually casting one wretched little churnshaped lady who had escaped to the suburbs into the very heart of the fire  the superb success of this last offering excited teddy to such a degree that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration and before it had time even to roast he planted poor annabella on the funeral pyre of course she did not like it and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer being covered with kid she did not blaze but did what was worse she squirmed first one leg curled up then the other in a very awful and lifelike manner next she flung her arms over her head as if in great agony her head itself turned on her shoulders her glass eyes fell out and with one final writhe of her whole body she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town this unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened teddy half out of his little wits he looked then screamed and fled toward the house roaring marmar at the top of his voice  mrs bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue but teddy could only cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about poor bella hurted a dreat fire and all the dollies dorn fearing some dire mishap his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action where she found the blind worshippers of kittymouse mourning over the charred remains of the lost darling  what have you been at tell me all about it said mrs jo composing herself to listen patiently for the culprits looked so penitent she forgave them beforehand  with some reluctance demi explained their play and aunt jo laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks the children were so solemn and the play was so absurd  i thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this if i had any kittymouse id have a good one who liked you to play in safe pleasant ways and not destroy and frighten just see what a ruin you have made all daisys pretty dolls demis soldiers and robs new village beside poor teddys pet lamb and dear old annabella i shall have to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes of toys       the children of holland take pleasure in making      what the children of boston take pleasure in breaking  only i shall put plumfield instead of boston  we never will again truly truly cried the repentant little sinners much abashed at this reproof  demi told us to said rob  well i heard uncle tell about the greece people who had altars and things and so i wanted to be like them only i hadnt any live creatures to sackerryfice so we burnt up our toys  dear me that is something like the bean story said aunt jo laughing again  tell about it suggested daisy to change the subject  once there was a poor woman who had three or four little children and she used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work to keep them safe on day when she was going away she said now my dears dont let baby fall out of window dont play with the matches and dont put beans up your noses now the children had never dreamed of doing that last thing but she put it into their heads and the minute she was gone they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of beans just to see how it felt and she found them all crying when she came home  did it hurt asked rob with such intense interest that his mother hastily added a warning sequel lest a new edition of the bean story should appear in her own family  very much as i know for when my mother told me this story i was so silly that i went and tried it myself i had no beans so i took some little pebbles and poked several into my nose i did not like it at all and wanted to take them out again very soon but one would not come and i was so ashamed to tell what a goose i been that i went for hours with the stone hurting me very much at last the pain got so bad i had to tell and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came then i was put in a chair and held tight rob while he used his ugly little pincers till the stone hopped out dear me how my wretched little nose did ache and how people laughed at me and mrs jo shook her head in a dismal way as if the memory of her sufferings was too much for her  rob looked deeply impressed and i am glad to say took the warning to heart demi proposed that they should bury poor annabella and in the interest of the funeral teddy forgot his fright daisy was soon consoled by another batch of dolls from aunt amy and the naughty kittymouse seemed to be appeased by the last offerings for she tormented them no more  brops was the name of a new and absorbing play invented by bangs as this interesting animal is not to be found in any zoological garden unless du chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of africa i will mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits for the benefit of inquiring minds the brop is a winged quadruped with a human face of a youthful and merry aspect when it walks the earth it grunts when it soars it gives a shrill hoot occasionally it goes erect and talks good english its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a shawl sometimes red sometimes blue often plaid and strange to say they frequently change skins with one another on their heads they have a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamplighter wings of the same substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly this is never very far from the ground as they usually fall with violence if they attempt any lofty flights they browse over the earth but can sit up and eat like the squirrel their favorite nourishment is the seedcake apples also are freely taken and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food is scarce they live in dens where they have a sort of nest much like a clothesbasket in which the little brops play till their wings are grown these singular animals quarrel at times and it is on these occasions that they burst into human speech call each other names cry scold and sometimes tear off horns and skin declaring fiercely that they wont play the few privileged persons who have studied them are inclined to think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey the sphinx the roc and the queer creatures seen by the famous peter wilkins  this game was a great favorite and the younger children beguiled many a rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery acting like little bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs to be sure it was rather hard upon clothes particularly trouserknees and jacketelbows but mrs bhaer only said as she patched and darned  we do things just as foolish and not half so harmless if i could get as much happiness out of it as the little dears do id be a brop myself  nats favorite amusements were working in his garden and sitting in the willowtree with his violin for that green nest was a fairy world to him and there he loved to perch making music like a happy bird the lads called him old chirper because he was always humming whistling or fiddling and they often stopped a minute in their work or play to listen to the soft tones of the violin which seemed to lead a little orchestra of summer sounds the birds appeared to regard him as one of themselves and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to watch him with their quick bright eyes the robins in the appletree near by evidently considered him a friend for the father bird hunted insects close beside him and the little mother brooded as confidingly over her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who cheered her patient watch with his song the brown brook babbled and sparkled below him the bees haunted the clover fields on either side friendly faces peeped at him as they passed the old house stretched its wide wings hospitably toward him and with a blessed sense of rest and love and happiness nat dreamed for hours in this nook unconscious what healthful miracles were being wrought upon him  one listener he had who never tired and to whom he was more than a mere schoolmate poor billys chief delight was to lie beside the brook watching leaves and bits of foam dance by listening dreamily to the music in the willowtree he seemed to think nat a sort of angel who sat aloft and sang for a few baby memories still lingered in his mind and seemed to grow brighter at these times seeing the interest he took in nat mr bhaer begged him to help them lift the cloud from the feeble brain by this gentle spell glad to do any thing to show his gratitude nat always smiled on billy when he followed him about and let him listen undisturbed to the music which seemed to speak a language he could understand help one another was a favorite plumfield motto and nat learned how much sweetness is added to life by trying to live up to it  jack fords peculiar pastime was buying and selling and he bid fair to follow in the footsteps of his uncle a country merchant who sold a little of every thing and made money fast jack had seen the sugar sanded the molasses watered the butter mixed with lard and things of that kind and labored under the delusion that it was all a proper part of the business his stock in trade was of a different sort but he made as much as he could out of every worm he sold and always got the best of the bargain when he traded with the boys for string knives fishhooks or whatever the article might be the boys who all had nicknames called him skinflint but jack did not care as long as the old tobaccopouch in which he kept his money grew heavier and heavier  he established a sort of auctionroom and now and then sold off all the odds and ends he had collected or helped the lads exchange things with one another he got bats balls hockeysticks etc cheap from one set of mates furbished them up and let them for a few cents a time to another set often extending his business beyond the gates of plumfield in spite of the rules mr bhaer put a stop to some of his speculations and tried to give him a better idea of business talent than mere sharpness in overreaching his neighbors now and then jack made a bad bargain and felt worse about it than about any failure in lessons or conduct and took his revenge on the next innocent customer who came along his accountbook was a curiosity and his quickness at figures quite remarkable mr bhaer praised him for this and tried to make his sense of honesty and honor as quick and by and by when jack found that he could not get on without these virtues he owned that his teacher was right  cricket and football the boys had of course but after the stirring accounts of these games in the immortal tom brown at rugby no feeble female pen may venture to do more than respectfully allude to them  emil spent his holidays on the river or the pond and drilled the elder lads for a race with certain town boys who now and then invaded their territory the race duly came off but as it ended in a general shipwreck it was not mentioned in public and the commodore had serious thoughts of retiring to a desert island so disgusted was he with his kind for a time no desert island being convenient he was forced to remain among his friends and found consolation in building a boathouse  the little girls indulged in the usual plays of their age improving upon them somewhat as their lively fancies suggested the chief and most absorbing play was called mrs shakespeare smith the name was provided by aunt jo but the trials of the poor lady were quite original daisy was mrs s s and nan by turns her daughter or a neighbor mrs giddygaddy  no pen can describe the adventures of these ladies for in one short afternoon their family was the scene of births marriages deaths floods earthquakes teaparties and balloon ascensions millions of miles did these energetic women travel dressed in hats and habits never seen before by mortal eye perched on the bed driving the posts like mettlesome steeds and bouncing up and down till their heads spun fits and fires were the pet afflictions with a general massacre now and then by way of change nan was never tired of inventing fresh combinations and daisy followed her leader with blind admiration poor teddy was a frequent victim and was often rescued from real danger for the excited ladies were apt to forget that he was not of the same stuff their longsuffering dolls once he was shut into the closet for a dungeon and forgotten by the girls who ran off to some outofdoor game another time he was half drowned in the bathtub playing be a cunning little whale and worst of all he was cut down just in time after being hung up for a robber  but the institution most patronized by all was the club it had no other name and it needed none being the only one in the neighborhood the elder lads got it up and the younger were occasionally admitted if they behaved well tommy and demi were honorary members but were always obliged to retire unpleasantly early owing to circumstances over which they had no control the proceedings of this club were somewhat peculiar for it met at all sorts of places and hours had all manner of queer ceremonies and amusements and now and then was broken up tempestuously only to be reestablished however on a firmer basis  rainy evenings the members met in the schoolroom and passed the time in games chess morris backgammon fencing matches recitations debates or dramatic performances of a darkly tragical nature in summer the barn was the rendezvous and what went on there no uninitiated mortal knows on sultry evenings the club adjourned to the brook for aquatic exercises and the members sat about in airy attire froglike and cool on such occasions the speeches were unusually eloquent quite flowing as one might say and if any orators remarks displeased the audience cold water was thrown upon him till his ardor was effectually quenched franz was president and maintained order admirably considering the unruly nature of the members mr bhaer never interfered with their affairs and was rewarded for this wise forbearance by being invited now and then to behold the mysteries unveiled which he appeared to enjoy much  when nan came she wished to join the club and caused great excitement and division among the gentlemen by presenting endless petitions both written and spoken disturbing their solemnities by insulting them through the keyhole performing vigorous solos on the door and writing up derisive remarks on walls and fences for she belonged to the irrepressibles finding these appeals in vain the girls by the advice of mrs jo got up an institution of their own which they called the cosy club to this they magnanimously invited the gentlemen whose youth excluded them from the other one and entertained these favored beings so well with little suppers new games devised by nan and other pleasing festivities that one by one the elder boys confessed a desire to partake of these more elegant enjoyments and after much consultation finally decided to propose an interchange of civilities  the members of the cosy club were invited to adorn the rival establishment on certain evenings and to the surprise of the gentlemen their presence was not found to be a restraint upon the conversation or amusement of the regular frequenters which could not be said of all clubs i fancy the ladies responded handsomely and hospitably to these overtures of peace and both institutions flourished long and happily    chapter ix daisys ball  mrs shakespeare smith would like to have mr john brooke mr thomas bangs and mr nathaniel blake to come to her ball at three oclock today  ps nat must bring his fiddle so we can dance and all the boys must be good or they cannot have any of the nice things we have cooked  this elegant invitation would i fear have been declined but for the hint given in the last line of the postscript  they have been cooking lots of goodies i smelt em lets go said tommy  we neednt stay after the feast you know added demi  i never went to a ball what do you have to do asked nat  oh we just play be men and sit round stiff and stupid like grownup folks and dance to please the girls then we eat up everything and come away as soon as we can  i think i could do that said nat after considering tommys description for a minute  ill write and say well come and demi despatched the following gentlemanly reply  we will all come please have lots to eat j b esquire  great was the anxiety of the ladies about their first ball because if every thing went well they intended to give a dinnerparty to the chosen few  aunt jo likes to have the boys play with us if they are not rough so we must make them like our balls then they will do them good said daisy with her maternal air as she set the table and surveyed the store of refreshments with an anxious eye  demi and nat will be good but tommy will do something bad i know he will replied nan shaking her head over the little cakebasket which she was arranging  then i shall send him right home said daisy with decision  people dont do so at parties it isnt proper  i shall never ask him any more  that would do hed be sorry not to come to the dinnerball wouldnt he  i guess he would well have the splendidest things ever seen wont we real soup with a ladle and a tureem she meant tureen and a little bird for turkey and gravy and all kinds of nice vegytubbles daisy never could say vegetables properly and had given up trying  it is most three and we ought to dress said nan who had arranged a fine costume for the occasion and was anxious to wear it  i am the mother so i shant dress up much said daisy putting on a nightcap ornamented with a red bow one of her aunts long skirts and a shawl a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed her toilette making a plump rosy little matron of her  nan had a wreath of artificial flowers a pair of old pink slippers a yellow scarf a green muslin skirt and a fan made of feathers from the duster also as a last touch of elegance a smellingbottle without any smell in it  i am the daughter so i rig up a good deal and i must sing and dance and talk more than you do the mothers only get the tea and be proper you know  a sudden very loud knock caused miss smith to fly into a chair and fan herself violently while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa and tried to look quite calm and proper little bess who was on a visit acted the part of maid and opened the door saying with a smile wart in gemplemun its all weady  in honor of the occasion the boys wore high paper collars tall black hats and gloves of every color and material for they were an afterthought and not a boy among them had a perfect pair  good day mum said demi in a deep voice which was so hard to keep up that his remarks had to be extremely brief  every one shook hands and then sat down looking so funny yet so sober that the gentlemen forgot their manners and rolled in their chairs with laughter  oh dont cried mrs smith much distressed  you cant ever come again if you act so added miss smith rapping mr bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest  i cant help it you look so like fury gasped mr bangs with most uncourteous candor  so do you but i shouldnt be so rude as to say so he shant come to the dinnerball shall he daisy cried nan indignantly  i think we had better dance now did you bring your fiddle sir asked mrs smith trying to preserve her polite composure  it is outside the door and nat went to get it  better have tea first proposed the unabashed tommy winking openly at demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured the sooner they could escape  no we never have supper first and if you dont dance well you wont have any supper at all not one bit sir said mrs smith so sternly that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with and grew overwhelmingly civil all at once  i will take mr bangs and teach him the polka for he does not know it fit to be seen added the hostess with a reproachful look that sobered tommy at once  nat struck up and the ball opened with two couples who went conscientiously through a somewhat varied dance the ladies did well because they liked it but the gentlemen exerted themselves from more selfish motives for each felt that he must earn his supper and labored manfully toward that end when every one was out of breath they were allowed to rest and indeed poor mrs smith needed it for her long dress had tripped her up many times the little maid passed round molasses and water in such small cups that one guest actually emptied nine i refrain from mentioning his name because this mild beverage affected him so much that he put cup and all into his mouth at the ninth round and choked himself publicly  you must ask nan to play and sing now said daisy to her brother who sat looking very much like an owl as he gravely regarded the festive scene between his high collars  give us a song mum said the obedient guest secretly wondering where the piano was  miss smith sailed up to an old secretary which stood in the room threw back the lid of the writingdesk and sitting down before it accompanied herself with a vigor which made the old desk rattle as she sang that new and lovely song beginning       gaily the troubadour      touched his guitar      as he was hastening      home from the war  the gentlemen applauded so enthusiastically that she gave them bounding billows little bopeep and other gems of song till they were obliged to hint that they had had enough grateful for the praises bestowed upon her daughter mrs smith graciously announced  now we will have tea sit down carefully and dont grab  it was beautiful to see the air of pride with which the good lady did the honors of her table and the calmness with which she bore the little mishaps that occurred the best pie flew wildly on the floor when she tried to cut it with a very dull knife the bread and butter vanished with a rapidity calculated to dismay a housekeepers soul and worst of all the custards were so soft that they had to be drunk up instead of being eaten elegantly with the new tin spoons  i grieve to state that miss smith squabbled with the maid for the best jumble which caused bess to toss the whole dish into the air and burst out crying amid a rain of falling cakes she was comforted by a seat at the table and the sugarbowl to empty but during this flurry a large plate of patties was mysteriously lost and could not be found they were the chief ornament of the feast and mrs smith was indignant at the loss for she had made them herself and they were beautiful to behold i put it to any lady if it was not hard to have one dozen delicious patties made of flour salt and water with a large raisin in the middle of each and much sugar over the whole swept away at one fell swoop  you hid them tommy i know you did cried the outraged hostess threatening her suspected guest with the milkpot  i didnt  you did  it isnt proper to contradict said nan who was hastily eating up the jelly during the fray  give them back demi said tommy  thats a fib youve got them in your own pocket bawled demi roused by the false accusation  lets take em away from him its too bad to make daisy cry suggested nat who found his first ball more exciting than he expected  daisy was already weeping bess like a devoted servant mingled her tears with those of her mistress and nan denounced the entire race of boys as plaguey things meanwhile the battle raged among the gentlemen for when the two defenders of innocence fell upon the foe that hardened youth intrenched himself behind a table and pelted them with the stolen tarts which were very effective missiles being nearly as hard as bullets while his ammunition held out the besieged prospered but the moment the last patty flew over the parapet the villain was seized dragged howling from the room and cast upon the hall floor in an ignominious heap the conquerors then returned flushed with victory and while demi consoled poor mrs smith nat and nan collected the scattered tarts replaced each raisin in its proper bed and rearranged the dish so that it really looked almost as well as ever but their glory had departed for the sugar was gone and no one cared to eat them after the insult offered to them  i guess we had better go said demi suddenly as aunt jos voice was heard on the stairs  praps we had and nat hastily dropped a stray jumble that he had just picked up  but mrs jo was among them before the retreat was accomplished and into her sympathetic ear the young ladies poured the story of their woes  no more balls for these boys till they have atoned for this bad behavior by doing something kind to you said mrs jo shaking her head at the three culprits  we were only in fun began demi  i dont like fun that makes other people unhappy i am disappointed in you demi for i hoped you would never learn to tease daisy such a kind little sister as she is to you  boys always tease their sisters tom says so muttered demi  i dont intend that my boys shall and i must send daisy home if you cannot play happily together said aunt jo soberly  at this awful threat demi sidled up to his sister and daisy hastily dried her tears for to be separated was the worst misfortune that could happen to the twins  nat was bad too and tommy was baddest of all observed nan fearing that two of the sinners would not get their fair share of punishment  i am sorry said nat much ashamed  i aint bawled tommy through the keyhole where he was listening with all his might  mrs jo wanted very much to laugh but kept her countenance and said impressively as she pointed to the door  you can go boys but remember you are not to speak to or play with the little girls till i give you leave you dont deserve the pleasure so i forbid it  the illmannered young gentlemen hastily retired to be received outside with derision and scorn by the unrepentant bangs who would not associate with them for at least fifteen minutes daisy was soon consoled for the failure of her ball but lamented the edict that parted her from her brother and mourned over his shortcomings in her tender little heart nan rather enjoyed the trouble and went about turning up her pug nose at the three especially tommy who pretended not to care and loudly proclaimed his satisfaction at being rid of those stupid girls but in his secret soul he soon repented of the rash act that caused this banishment from the society he loved and every hour of separation taught him the value of the stupid girls  the others gave in very soon and longed to be friends for now there was no daisy to pet and cook for them no nan to amuse and doctor them and worst of all no mrs jo to make home life pleasant and life easy for them to their great affliction mrs jo seemed to consider herself one of the offended girls for she hardly spoke to the outcasts looked as if she did not see them when she passed and was always too busy now to attend to their requests this sudden and entire exile from favor cast a gloom over their souls for when mother bhaer deserted them their sun had set at noonday as it were and they had no refuge left  this unnatural state of things actually lasted for three days then they could bear it no longer and fearing that the eclipse might become total went to mr bhaer for help and counsel  it is my private opinion that he had received instructions how to behave if the case should be laid before him but no one suspected it and he gave the afflicted boys some advice which they gratefully accepted and carried out in the following manner  secluding themselves in the garret they devoted several playhours to the manufacture of some mysterious machine which took so much paste that asia grumbled and the little girls wondered mightily nan nearly got her inquisitive nose pinched in the door trying to see what was going on and daisy sat about openly lamenting that they could not all play nicely together and not have any dreadful secrets wednesday afternoon was fine and after a good deal of consultation about wind and weather nat and tommy went off bearing an immense flat parcel hidden under many newspapers nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity daisy nearly cried with vexation and both quite trembled with interest when demi marched into mrs bhaers room hat in hand and said in the politest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years  please aunt jo would you and the girls come out to a surprise party we have made for you do its a very nice one  thank you we will come with pleasure only i must take teddy with me replied mrs bhaer with a smile that cheered demi like sunshine after rain  wed like to have him the little wagon is all ready for the girls you wont mind walking just up to pennyroyal hill will you aunty  i should like it exceedingly but are you quite sure i shall not be in the way  oh no indeed we want you very much and the party will be spoilt if you dont come cried demi with great earnestness  thank you kindly sir and aunt jo made him a grand curtsey for she liked frolics as well as any of them  now young ladies we must not keep them waiting on with the hats and let us be off at once im all impatience to know what the surprise is  as mrs bhaer spoke every one bustled about and in five minutes the three little girls and teddy were packed into the clothesbasket as they called the wicker wagon which toby drew demi walked at the head of the procession and mrs jo brought up the rear escorted by kit it was a most imposing party i assure you for toby had a red featherduster in his head two remarkable flags waved over the carriage kit had a blue bow on his neck which nearly drove him wild demi wore a nosegay of dandelions in his buttonhole and mrs jo carried the queer japanese umbrella in honor of the occasion  the girls had little flutters of excitement all the way and teddy was so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard and when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself evidently feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the party  when they came to the hill nothing was to be seen but the grass blowing in the wind as the fairy books say and the children looked disappointed but demi said in his most impressive manner  now you all get out and stand still and the surprise party with come in with which remark he retired behind a rock over which heads had been bobbing at intervals for the last halfhour  a short pause of intense suspense and then nat demi and tommy marched forth each bearing a new kite which they presented to the three young ladies shrieks of delight arose but were silenced by the boys who said with faces brimful of merriment that isnt all the surprise and running behind the rock again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size on which was printed in bright yellow letters for mother bhaer  we thought youd like one too because you were angry with us and took the girls part cried all three shaking with laughter for this part of the affair evidently was a surprise to mrs jo  she clapped her hands and joined in the laugh looking thoroughly tickled at the joke  now boys that is regularly splendid who did think of it she asked receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did theirs  uncle fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others he said youd like it so we made a bouncer answered demi beaming with satisfaction at the success of the plot  uncle fritz knows what i like yes these are magnificent kites and we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours werent we girls  thats why we made them for you cried tommy standing on his head as the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions  let us fly them said energetic nan  i dont know how began daisy  well show you we want to cried all the boys in a burst of devotion as demi took daisys tommy nans and nat with difficulty persuaded bess to let go her little blue one  aunty if you will wait a minute well pitch yours for you said demi feeling that mrs bhaers favor must not be lost again by any neglect of theirs  bless your buttons dear i know all about it and here is a boy who will toss up for me added mrs jo as the professor peeped over the rock with a face full of fun  he came out at once tossed up the big kite and mrs jo ran off with it in fine style while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle one by one all the kites went up and floated far overhead like gay birds balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the hill such a merry time as they had running and shouting sending up the kites or pulling them down watching their antics in the air and feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape nan was quite wild with the fun daisy thought the new play nearly as interesting as dolls and little bess was so fond of her boo tite that she would only let it go on very short flights preferring to hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by tommys dashing brush mrs jo enjoyed hers immensely and it acted as if it knew who owned it for it came tumbling down head first when least expected caught on trees nearly pitched into the river and finally darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the clouds  by and by every one got tired and fastening the kitestrings to trees and fences all sat down to rest except mr bhaer who went off to look at the cows with teddy on his shoulder  did you ever have such a good time as this before asked nat as they lay about on the grass nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep  not since i last flew a kite years ago when i was a girl answered mrs jo  id like to have known you when you were a girl you must have been so jolly said nat  i was a naughty little girl i am sorry to say  i like naughty little girls observed tommy looking at nan who made a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment  why dont i remember you then aunty was i too young asked demi  rather dear  i suppose my memory hadnt come then grandpa says that different parts of the mind unfold as we grow up and the memory part of my mind hadnt unfolded when you were little so i cant remember how you looked explained demi  now little socrates you had better keep that question for grandpa it is beyond me said aunt jo putting on the extinguisher  well i will he knows about those things and you dont returned demi feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the comprehension of the present company  tell about the last time you flew a kite said nat for mrs jo had laughed as she spoke of it and he thought it might be interesting  oh it was only rather funny for i was a great girl of fifteen and was ashamed to be seen at such a play so uncle teddy and i privately made our kites and stole away to fly them we had a capital time and were resting as we are now when suddenly we heard voices and saw a party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic teddy did not mind though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite but i was in a great flurry for i knew i should be sadly laughed at and never hear the last of it because my wild ways amused the neighbors as much as nans do us  what shall i do i whispered to teddy as the voices drew nearer and nearer  ill show you he said and whipping out his knife he cut the strings away flew the kites and when the people came up we were picking flowers as properly as you please they never suspected us and we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape  were the kites lost aunty asked daisy  quite lost but i did not care for i made up my mind that it would be best to wait till i was an old lady before i played with kites again and you see i have waited said mrs jo beginning to pull in the big kite for it was getting late  must we go now  i must or you wont have any supper and that sort of surprise party would not suit you i think my chickens  hasnt our party been a nice one asked tommy complacently  splendid answered every one  do you know why it is because your guests have behaved themselves and tried to make everything go well you understand what i mean dont you  yesm was all the boys said but they stole a shamefaced look at one another as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home thinking of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves and things had gone badly on account of it    chapter x home again  july had come and haying begun the little gardens were doing finely and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours the house stood open from morning till night and the lads lived out of doors except at school time the lessons were short and there were many holidays for the bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise and our short summers are best used in outofdoor work such a rosy sunburnt hearty set as the boys became such appetites as they had such sturdy arms and legs as outgrew jackets and trousers such laughing and racing all over the place such antics in house and barn such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale and such satisfaction in the hearts of the worthy bhaers as they saw their flock prospering in mind and body i cannot begin to describe only one thing was needed to make them quite happy and it came when they least expected it  one balmy night when the little lads were in bed the elder ones bathing down at the brook and mrs bhaer undressing teddy in her parlor he suddenly cried out oh my danny and pointed to the window where the moon shone brightly  no lovey he is not there it was the pretty moon said his mother  no no danny at a window teddy saw him persisted baby much excited  it might have been and mrs bhaer hurried to the window hoping it would prove true but the face was gone and nowhere appeared any signs of a mortal boy she called his name ran to the front door with teddy in his little shirt and made him call too thinking the baby voice might have more effect than her own no one answered nothing appeared and they went back much disappointed teddy would not be satisfied with the moon and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask if danny was not tummin soon  by and by he fell asleep the lads trooped up to bed the house grew still and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night mrs bhaer sat sewing for the big basket was always piled with socks full of portentous holes and thinking of the lost boy she had decided that baby had been mistaken and did not even disturb mr bhaer by telling him of the childs fancy for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed and he was busy writing letters it was past ten when she rose to shut up the house as she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps something white caught her eye on one of the haycocks scattered over the lawn the children had been playing there all the afternoon and fancying that nan had left her hat as usual mrs bhaer went out to get it but as she approached she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it she hurried round the haycock and there lay dan fast asleep  ragged dirty thin and wornout he looked one foot was bare the other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt he seemed to have hidden himself behind the haycock but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him he sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him and once when he moved he groaned as if in pain but still slept on quite spent with weariness  he must not lie here said mrs bhaer and stooping over him she gently called his name he opened his eyes and looked at her as if she was a part of his dream for he smiled and said drowsily mother bhaer ive come home  the look the words touched her very much and she put her hand under his head to lift him up saying in her cordial way  i thought you would and im so glad to see you dan he seemed to wake thoroughly then and started up looking about him as if he suddenly remembered where he was and doubted even that kind welcome his face changed and he said in his old rough way  i was going off in the morning i only stopped to peek in as i went by  but why not come in dan didnt you hear us call you teddy saw and cried for you  didnt suppose youd let me in he said fumbling with a little bundle which he had taken up as if going immediately  try and see was all mrs bhaer answered holding out her hand and pointing to the door where the light shone hospitably  with a long breath as if a load was off his mind dan took up a stout stick and began to limp towards the house but stopped suddenly to say inquiringly  mr bhaer wont like it i ran away from page  he knows it and was sorry but it will make no difference are you lame asked mrs jo as he limped on again  getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it i dont mind and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him  mrs bhaer helped him into her own room and once there he dropped into a chair and laid his head back white and faint with weariness and suffering  my poor dan drink this and then eat a little you are at home now and mother bhaer will take good care of you  he only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude as he drank the wine she held to his lips and then began slowly to eat the food she brought him each mouthful seemed to put heart into him and presently he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him  where have you been dan she asked beginning to get out some bandages  i ran off moren a month ago page was good enough but too strict i didnt like it so i cut away down the river with a man who was going in his boat thats why they couldnt tell where id gone when i left the man i worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer but i thrashed his boy and then the old man thrashed me and i ran off again and walked here  all the way  yes the man didnt pay me and i wouldnt ask for it took it out in beating the boy and dan laughed yet looked ashamed as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands  how did you live it was a long long tramp for a boy like you  oh i got on well enough till i hurt my foot folks gave me things to eat and i slept in barns and tramped by day i got lost trying to make a short cut or id have been here sooner  but if you did not mean to come in and stay with us what were you going to do  i thought id like to see teddy again and you and then i was going back to my old work in the city only i was so tired i went to sleep on the hay id have been gone in the morning if you hadnt found me  are you sorry i did and mrs jo looked at him with a half merry half reproachful look as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot  the color came up into dans face and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate as he said very low no maam im glad i wanted to stay but i was afraid you  he did not finish for mrs bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity as she saw his foot for it was seriously hurt  when did you do it  three days ago  and you have walked on it in this state  i had a stick and i washed it at every brook i came to and one woman gave me a rag to put on it  mr bhaer must see and dress it at once and mrs jo hastened into the next room leaving the door ajar behind her so that dan heard all that passed  fritz the boy has come back  who dan  yes teddy saw him at the window and he called to him but he went away and hid behind the haycocks on the lawn i found him there just now fast asleep and half dead with weariness and pain he ran away from page a month ago and has been making his way to us ever since he pretends that he did not mean to let us see him but go on to the city and his old work after a look at us it is evident however that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back  did he say so  his eyes did and when i waked him he said like a lost child mother bhaer ive come home i hadnt the heart to scold him and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold i may keep him fritz  of course you may this proves to me that we have a hold on the boys heart and i would no more send him away now than i would my own rob  dan heard a soft little sound as if mrs jo thanked her husband without words and in the instants silence that followed two great tears that had slowly gathered in the boys eyes brimmed over and rolled down his dusty cheeks no one saw them for he brushed them hastily away but in that little pause i think dans old distrust for these good people vanished for ever the soft spot in his heart was touched and he felt an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that was so patient and forgiving he said nothing he only wished the wish with all his might resolved to try in his blind boyish way and sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain fatigue nor loneliness could wring from him  come and see his foot i am afraid it is badly hurt for he has kept on three days through heat and dust with nothing but water and an old jacket to bind it up with i tell you fritz that boy is a brave lad and will make a fine man yet  i hope so for your sake enthusiastic woman your faith deserves success now i will go and see your little spartan where is he  in my room but dear youll be very kind to him no matter how gruff he seems i am sure that is the way to conquer him he wont bear sternness nor much restraint but a soft word and infinite patience will lead him as it used to lead me  as if you ever like this little rascal cried mr bhaer laughing yet half angry at the idea  i was in spirit though i showed it in a different way i seem to know by instinct how he feels to understand what will win and touch him and to sympathize with his temptations and faults i am glad i do for it will help me to help him and if i can make a good man of this wild boy it will be the best work of my life  god bless the work and help the worker  mr bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done and both came in together to find dans head down upon his arm as if he was quite overcome by sleep but he looked up quickly and tried to rise as mr bhaer said pleasantly  so you like plumfield better than pages farm well let us see if we can get on more comfortably this time than we did before  thanky sir said dan trying not to be gruff and finding it easier than he expected  now the foot ach this is not well we must have dr firth tomorrow warm water jo and old linen  mr bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot while mrs jo prepared the only empty bed in the house it was in the little guestchamber leading from the parlor and often used when the lads were poorly for it saved mrs jo from running up and down and the invalids could see what was going on when it was ready mr bhaer took the boy in his arms and carried him in helped him undress laid him on the little white bed and left him with another handshake and a fatherly goodnight my son  dan dropped asleep at once and slept heavily for several hours then his foot began to throb and ache and he awoke to toss about uneasily trying not to groan lest any one should hear him for he was a brave lad and did bear pain like a little spartan as mr bhaer called him  mrs jo had a way of flitting about the house at night to shut the windows if the wind grew chilly to draw mosquito curtains over teddy or look after tommy who occasionally walked in his sleep the least noise waked her and as she often heard imaginary robbers cats and conflagrations the doors stood open all about so her quick ear caught the sound of dans little moans and she was up in a minute he was just giving his hot pillow a despairing thump when a light came glimmering through the hall and mrs jo crept in looking like a droll ghost with her hair in a great knob on the top of her head and a long gray dressinggown trailing behind her  are you in pain dan  its pretty bad but i didnt mean to wake you  im a sort of owl always flying about at night yes your foot is like fire the bandages must be wet again and away flapped the maternal owl for more cooling stuff and a great mug of ice water  oh thats so nice sighed dan the wet bandages went on again and a long draught of water cooled his thirsty throat  there now sleep your best and dont be frightened if you see me again for ill slip down by and by and give you another sprinkle  as she spoke mrs jo stooped to turn the pillow and smooth the bedclothes when to her great surprise dan put his arm around her neck drew her face down to his and kissed her with a broken thank you maam which said more than the most eloquent speech could have done for the hasty kiss the muttered words meant im sorry i will try she understood it accepted the unspoken confession and did not spoil it by any token of surprise she only remembered that he had no mother kissed the brown cheek half hidden on the pillow as if ashamed of the little touch of tenderness and left him saying what he long remembered you are my boy now and if you choose you can make me proud and glad to say so  once again just at dawn she stole down to find him so fast asleep that he did not wake and showed no sign of consciousness as she wet his foot except that the lines of pain smoothed themselves away and left his face quite peaceful  the day was sunday and the house so still that he never waked till near noon and looking round him saw an eager little face peering in at the door he held out his arms and teddy tore across the room to cast himself bodily upon the bed shouting my dannys tum as he hugged and wriggled with delight mrs bhaer appeared next bringing breakfast and never seeming to see how shamefaced dan looked at the memory of the little scene last night teddy insisted on giving him his betfus and fed him like a baby which as he was not very hungry dan enjoyed very much  then came the doctor and the poor spartan had a bad time of it for some of the little bones in his foot were injured and putting them to rights was such a painful job that dans lips were white and great drops stood on his forehead though he never cried out and only held mrs jos hand so tight that it was red long afterwards  you must keep this boy quiet for a week at least and not let him put his foot to the ground by that time i shall know whether he may hop a little with a crutch or stick to his bed for a while longer said dr firth putting up the shining instruments that dan did not like to see  it will get well sometime wont it he asked looking alarmed at the word crutches  i hope so and with that the doctor departed leaving dan much depressed for the loss of a foot is a dreadful calamity to an active boy  dont be troubled i am a famous nurse and we will have you tramping about as well as ever in a month said mrs jo taking a hopeful view of the case  but the fear of being lame haunted dan and even teddys caresses did not cheer him so mrs jo proposed that one or two of the boys should come in and pay him a little visit and asked whom he would like to see  nat and demi id like my hat too theres something in it i guess theyd like to see i suppose you threw away my bundle of plunder said dan looking rather anxious as he put the question  no i kept it for i thought they must be treasures of some kind you took such care of them and mrs jo brought him his old straw hat stuck full of butterflies and beetles and a handkerchief containing a collection of odd things picked up on his way birds eggs carefully done up in moss curious shells and stones bits of fungus and several little crabs in a state of great indignation at their imprisonment  could i have something to put these fellers in mr hyde and i found em and they are firstrate ones so id like to keep and watch em can i asked dan forgetting his foot and laughing to see the crabs go sidling and backing over the bed  of course you can pollys old cage will be just the thing dont let them nip teddys toes while i get it and away went mrs jo leaving dan overjoyed to find that his treasures were not considered rubbish and thrown away  nat demi and the cage arrived together and the crabs were settled in their new house to the great delight of the boys who in the excitement of the performance forgot any awkwardness they might otherwise have felt in greeting the runaway to these admiring listeners dan related his adventures much more fully than he had done to the bhaers then he displayed his plunder and described each article so well that mrs jo who had retired to the next room to leave them free was surprised and interested as well as amused at their boyish chatter  how much the lad knows of these things how absorbed he is in them and what a mercy it is just now for he cares so little for books it would be hard to amuse him while he is laid up but the boys can supply him with beetles and stones to any extent and i am glad to find out this taste of his it is a good one and may perhaps prove the making of him if he should turn out a great naturalist and nat a musician i should have cause to be proud of this years work and mrs jo sat smiling over her book as she built castles in the air just as she used to do when a girl only then they were for herself and now they were for other people which is the reason perhaps that some of them came to pass in reality for charity is an excellent foundation to build anything upon  nat was most interested in the adventures but demi enjoyed the beetles and butterflies immensely drinking in the history of their changeful little lives as if it were a new and lovely sort of fairy tale for even in his plain way dan told it well and found great satisfaction in the thought that here at least the small philosopher could learn of him so interested were they in the account of catching a musk rat whose skin was among the treasures that mr bhaer had to come himself to tell nat and demi it was time for the walk dan looked so wistfully after them as they ran off that father bhaer proposed carrying him to the sofa in the parlor for a little change of air and scene  when he was established and the house quiet mrs jo who sat near by showing teddy pictures said in an interested tone as she nodded towards the treasures still in dans hands  where did you learn so much about these things  i always liked em but didnt know much till mr hyde told me  oh he was a man who lived round in the woods studying these things i dont know what you call him and wrote about frogs and fishes and so on he stayed at pages and used to want me to go and help him and it was great fun cause he told me ever so much and was uncommon jolly and wise hope ill see him again sometime  i hope you will said mrs jo for dans face had brightened up and he was so interested in the matter that he forgot his usual taciturnity  why he could make birds come to him and rabbits and squirrels didnt mind him any more than if he was a tree did you ever tickle a lizard with a straw asked dan eagerly  no but i should like to try it  well ive done it and its so funny to see em turn over and stretch out they like it so much mr hyde used to do it and hed make snakes listen to him while he whistled and he knew just when certain flowers would blow and bees wouldnt sting him and hed tell the wonderfullest things about fish and flies and the indians and the rocks  i think you were so fond of going with mr hyde you rather neglected mr page said mrs jo slyly  yes i did i hated to have to weed and hoe when i might be tramping round with mr hyde page thought such things silly and called mr hyde crazy because hed lay hours watching a trout or a bird  suppose you say lie instead of lay it is better grammar said mrs jo very gently and then added yes page is a thorough farmer and would not understand that a naturalists work was just as interesting and perhaps just as important as his own now dan if you really love these things as i think you do and i am glad to see it you shall have time to study them and books to help you but i want you to do something besides and to do it faithfully else you will be sorry by and by and find that you have got to begin again  yes maam said dan meekly and looked a little scared by the serious tone of the last remarks for he hated books yet had evidently made up his mind to study anything she proposed  do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it was the next very unexpected question  dan did see two tall oldfashioned ones standing on either side of the piano he knew them well and had often seen nice bits of string nails brown paper and such useful matters come out of the various drawers he nodded and smiled mrs jo went on  well dont you think those drawers would be good places to put your eggs and stones and shells and lichens  oh splendid but you wouldnt like my things clutterin round as mr page used to say would you cried dan sitting up to survey the old piece of furniture with sparkling eyes  i like litter of that sort and if i didnt i should give you the drawers because i have a regard for childrens little treasures and i think they should be treated respectfully now i am going to make a bargain with you dan and i hope you will keep it honorably here are twelve goodsized drawers one for each month of the year and they shall be yours as fast as you earn them by doing the little duties that belong to you i believe in rewards of a certain kind especially for young folks they help us along and though we may begin by being good for the sake of the reward if it is rightly used we shall soon learn to love goodness for itself  do you have em asked dan looking as if this was new talk for him  yes indeed i havent learnt to get on without them yet my rewards are not drawers or presents or holidays but they are things which i like as much as you do the others the good behavior and success of my boys is one of the rewards i love best and i work for it as i want you to work for your cabinet do what you dislike and do it well and you get two rewards one the prize you see and hold the other the satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed do you understand that  yes maam  we all need these little helps so you shall try to do your lessons and your work play kindly with all the boys and use your holidays well and if you bring me a good report or if i see and know it without words for im quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall have a compartment in the drawer for your treasures see some are already divided into four parts and i will have the others made in the same way a place for each week and when the drawer is filled with curious and pretty things i shall be as proud of it as you are prouder i think for in the pebbles mosses and gay butterflies i shall see good resolutions carried out conquered faults and a promise well kept shall we do this dan  the boys answered with one of the looks which said much for it showed that he felt and understood her wish and words although he did not know how to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness she understood the look and seeing by the color that flushed up to his forehead that he was touched as she wished him to be she said no more about that side of the new plan but pulled out the upper drawer dusted it and set it on two chairs before the sofa saying briskly  now let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe place these compartments will hold a good deal you see id pin the butterflies and bugs round the sides they will be quite safe there and leave room for the heavy things below ill give you some cotton wool and clean paper and pins and you can get ready for the weeks work  but i cant go out to find any new things said dan looking piteously at his foot  thats true never mind well let these treasures do for this week and i dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them  they dont know the right sort besides if i lay no lie here all the time i cant work and study and earn my drawers  there are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there and several little jobs of work you can do for me  can i and dan looked both surprised and pleased  you can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play you can amuse teddy for me wind cotton read to me when i sew and do many things without hurting your foot which will make the days pass quickly and not be wasted ones  here demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand and a very ugly little toad in the other  see dan i found them and ran back to give them to you arent they beautiful ones panted demi all out of breath  dan laughed at the toad and said he had no place to put him but the butterfly was a beauty and if mrs jo would give him a big pin he would stick it right up in the drawer  i dont like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin if it must be killed let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor said mrs jo getting out the bottle  i know how to do it mr hyde always killed em that way but i didnt have any camphor so i use a pin and dan gently poured a drop on the insects head when the pale green wings fluttered an instant and then grew still  this dainty little execution was hardly over when teddy shouted from the bedroom oh the little trabs are out and the big ones eaten em all up demi and his aunt ran to the rescue and found teddy dancing excitedly in a chair while two little crabs were scuttling about the floor having got through the wires of the cage a third was clinging to the top of the cage evidently in terror of his life for below appeared a sad yet funny sight the big crab had wedged himself into the little recess where pollys cup used to stand and there he sat eating one of his relations in the coolest way all the claws of the poor victim were pulled off and he was turned upside down his upper shell held in one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish while he leisurely ate out of it with the other claw pausing now and then to turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side and to put out a slender tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with laughter mrs jo carried the cage in for dan to see the sight while demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted washbowl  ill have to let these fellers go for i cant keep em in the house said dan with evident regret  ill take care of them for you if you will tell me how and they can live in my turtletank just as well as not said demi who found them more interesting even that his beloved slow turtles so dan gave him directions about the wants and habits of the crabs and demi bore them away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors what a good boy he is said dan carefully settling the first butterfly and remembering that demi had given up his walk to bring it to him  he ought to be for a great deal has been done to make him so  hes had folks to tell him things and to help him i havent said dan with a sigh thinking of his neglected childhood a thing he seldom did and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow  i know it dear and for that reason i dont expect as much from you as from demi though he is younger you shall have all the help that we can give you now and i hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best way have you forgotten what father bhaer told you when you were here before about wanting to be good and asking god to help you  no maam very low  do you try that way still  no maam lower still  will you do it every night to please me  yes maam very soberly  i shall depend on it and i think i shall know if you are faithful to your promise for these things always show to people who believe in them though not a word is said now here is a pleasant story about a boy who hurt his foot worse than you did yours read it and see how bravely he bore his troubles  she put that charming little book the crofton boys into his hands and left him for an hour passing in and out from time to time that he might not feel lonely dan did not love to read but soon got so interested that he was surprised when the boys came home daisy brought him a nosegay of wild flowers and nan insisted on helping bring him his supper as he lay on the sofa with the door open into the diningroom so that he could see the lads at table and they could nod socially to him over their bread and butter  mr bhaer carried him away to his bed early and teddy came in his nightgown to say goodnight for he went to his little nest with the birds  i want to say my prayers to danny may i he asked and when his mother said yes the little fellow knelt down by dans bed and folding his chubby hands said softly  pease dod bess everybody and hep me to be dood  then he went away smiling with sleepy sweetness over his mothers shoulder  but after the evening talk was done the evening song sung and the house grew still with beautiful sunday silence dan lay in his pleasant room wide awake thinking new thoughts feeling new hopes and desires stirring in his boyish heart for two good angels had entered in love and gratitude began the work which time and effort were to finish and with an earnest wish to keep his first promise dan folded his hands together in the darkness and softly whispered teddys little prayer  please god bless every one and help me to be good    chapter xi uncle teddy  for a week dan only moved from bed to sofa a long week and a hard one for the hurt foot was very painful at times the quiet days were very wearisome to the active lad longing to be out enjoying the summer weather and especially difficult was it to be patient but dan did his best and every one helped him in their various ways so the time passed and he was rewarded at last by hearing the doctor say on saturday morning  this foot is doing better than i expected give the lad the crutch this afternoon and let him stump about the house a little  hooray shouted nat and raced away to tell the other boys the good news  everybody was very glad and after dinner the whole flock assembled to behold dan crutch himself up and down the hall a few times before he settled in the porch to hold a sort of levee he was much pleased at the interest and goodwill shown him and brightened up more and more every minute for the boys came to pay their respects the little girls fussed about him with stools and cushions and teddy watched over him as if he was a frail creature unable to do anything for himself they were still sitting and standing about the steps when a carriage stopped at the gate a hat was waved from it and with a shout of uncle teddy uncle teddy rob scampered down the avenue as fast as his short legs would carry him all he boys but dan ran after him to see who should be first to open the gate and in a moment the carriage drove up with boys swarming all over it while uncle teddy sat laughing in the midst with his little daughter on his knee  stop the triumphal car and let jupiter descend he said and jumping out ran up the steps to meet mrs bhaer who stood smiling and clapping her hands like a girl  how goes it teddy  all right jo  then they shook hands and mr laurie put bess into her aunts arms saying as the child hugged her tight goldilocks wanted to see you so much that i ran away with her for i was quite pining for a sight of you myself we want to play with your boys for an hour or so and to see how the old woman who lived in a shoe and had so many children she did not know what to do is getting on  im so glad play away and dont get into mischief answered mrs jo as the lads crowded round the pretty child admiring her long golden hair dainty dress and lofty ways for the little princess as they called her allowed no one to kiss her but sat smiling down upon them and graciously patting their heads with her little white hands they all adored her especially rob who considered her a sort of doll and dared not touch her lest she should break but worshipped her at a respectful distance made happy by an occasional mark of favor from her little highness as she immediately demanded to see daisys kitchen she was borne off by mrs jo with a train of small boys following the others all but nat and demi ran away to the menagerie and gardens to have all in order for mr laurie always took a general survey and looked disappointed if things were not flourishing  standing on the steps he turned to dan saying like an old acquaintance though he had only seen him once or twice before  how is the foot  better sir  rather tired of the house arent you  guess i am and dans eyes roved away to the green hills and woods where he longed to be  suppose we take a little turn before the others come back that big easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable and a breath of fresh air will do you good get a cushion and a shawl demi and lets carry dan off  the boys thought it a capital joke and dan looked delighted but asked with an unexpected burst of virtue  will mrs bhaer like it  oh yes we settled all that a minute ago  you didnt say any thing about it so i dont see how you could said demi inquisitively  we have a way of sending messages to one another without any words it is a great improvement on the telegraph  i know its eyes i saw you lift your eyebrows and nod toward the carriage and mrs bhaer laughed and nodded back again cried nat who was quite at his ease with kind mr laurie by this time  right now them come on and in a minute dan found himself settled in the carriage his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite nicely covered with a shawl which fell down from the upper regions in a most mysterious manner just when they wanted it demi climbed up to the box beside peter the black coachman nat sat next dan in the place of honor while uncle teddy would sit opposite to take care of the foot he said but really that he might study the faces before him both so happy yet so different for dans was square and brown and strong while nats was long and fair and rather weak but very amiable with its mild eyes and good forehead  by the way ive got a book somewhere here that you may like to see said the oldest boy of the party diving under the seat and producing a book which make dan exclaim  oh by george isnt that a stunner as he turned the leaves and saw fine plates of butterflies and birds and every sort of interesting insect colored like life he was so charmed that he forgot his thanks but mr laurie did not mind and was quite satisfied to see the boys eager delight and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as he came to them nat leaned on his shoulder to look and demi turned his back to the horses and let his feet dangle inside the carriage so that he might join in the conversation  when they got among the beetles mr laurie took a curious little object out of his vestpocket and laying it in the palm of his hand said  theres a beetle that is thousands of years old and then while the lads examined the queer stonebug that looked so old and gray he told them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy after lying for ages in a famous tomb finding them interested he went on to tell about the egyptians and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them the nile and how he sailed up the mighty river with the handsome dark men to work his boat how he shot alligators saw wonderful beasts and birds and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel who pitched him about like a ship in a storm  uncle teddy tells stories most as well as grandpa said demi approvingly when the tale was done and the boys eyes asked for more  thank you said mr laurie quite soberly for he considered demis praise worth having for children are good critics in such cases and to suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of  heres another trifle or two that i tucked into my pocket as i was turning over my traps to see if i had any thing that would amuse dan and uncle teddy produced a fine arrowhead and a string of wampum  oh tell about the indians cried demi who was fond of playing wigwam  dan knows lots about them added nat  more than i do i dare say tell us something and mr laurie looked as interested as the other two  mr hyde told me hes been among em and can talk their talk and likes em began dan flattered by their attention but rather embarrassed by having a grownup listener  what is wampum for asked curious demi from his perch  the others asked questions likewise and before he knew it dan was reeling off all mr hyde had told him as they sailed down the river a few weeks before mr laurie listened well but found the boy more interesting than the indians for mrs jo had told him about dan and he rather took a fancy to the wild lad who ran away as he himself had often longed to do and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and patience  ive been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find and make and have given you mrs jo is too kind to complain but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps halfapint of dorbugs in one of her best vases for instance a couple of dead bats nailed up in the back entry wasps nests tumbling down on peoples heads and stones lying round everywhere enough to pave the avenue there are not many women who would stand that sort of thing are there now  as mr laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes the boys laughed and nudged one another for it was evident that some one told tales out of school else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient treasures  where can we put them then said demi crossing his legs and leaning down to argue the question  in the old carriagehouse  but it leaks and there isnt any window nor any place to put things and its all dust and cobwebs began nat  wait till gibbs and i have touched it up a bit and then see how you like it he is to come over on monday to get it ready then next saturday i shall come out and we will fix it up and make the beginning at least of a fine little museum every one can bring his things and have a place for them and dan is to be the head man because he knows most about such matters and it will be quiet pleasant work for him now that he cant knock about much  wont that be jolly cried nat while dan smiled all over his face and had not a word to say but hugged his book and looked at mr laurie as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever blessed the world  shall i go round again sir asked peter as they came to the gate after two slow turns about the halfmile triangle  no we must be prudent else we cant come again i must go over the premises take a look at the carriagehouse and have a little talk with mrs jo before i go and having deposited dan on his sofa to rest and enjoy his book uncle teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who were raging about the place in search of him leaving the little girls to mess upstairs mrs bhaer sat down by dan and listened to his eager account of the drive till the flock returned dusty warm and much excited about the new museum which every one considered the most brilliant idea of the age  i always wanted to endow some sort of an institution and i am going to begin with this said mr laurie sitting down on a stool at mrs jos feet  you have endowed one already what do you call this and mrs jo pointed to the happyfaced lads who had camped upon the floor about him  i call it a very promising bhaergarden and im proud to be a member of it did you know i was the head boy in this school he asked turning to dan and changing the subject skilfully for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did  i thought franz was answered dan wondering what the man meant  oh dear no im the first boy mrs jo ever had to take care of and i was such a bad one that she isnt done with me yet though she has been working at me for years and years  how old she must be said nat innocently  she began early you see poor thing she was only fifteen when she took me and i led her such a life its a wonder she isnt wrinkled and gray and quite worn out and mr laurie looked up at her laughing  dont teddy i wont have you abuse yourself so and mrs jo stroked the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever for in spite of every thing teddy was her boy still  if it hadnt been for you there never would have been a plumfield it was my success with you sir that gave me courage to try my pet plan so the boys may thank you for it and name the new institution the laurence museum in honor of its founder wont we boys she added looking very like the lively jo of old times  we will we will shouted the boys throwing up their hats for though they had taken them off on entering the house according to rule they had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up  im as hungry as a bear cant i have a cookie asked mr laurie when the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow  trot out and ask asia for the gingerbreadbox demi it isnt in order to eat between meals but on this joyful occasion we wont mind and have a cookie all round said mrs jo and when the box came she dealt them out with a liberal hand every one munching away in a social circle  suddenly in the midst of a bite mr laurie cried out bless my heart i forgot grandmas bundle and running out to the carriage returned with an interesting white parcel which being opened disclosed a choice collection of beasts birds and pretty things cut out of crisp sugary cake and baked a lovely brown  theres one for each and a letter to tell which is whose grandma and hannah made them and i tremble to think what would have happened to me if i had forgotten to leave them  then amid much laughing and fun the cakes were distributed a fish for dan a fiddle for nat a book for demi a money for tommy a flower for daisy a hoop for nan who had driven twice round the triangle without stopping a star for emil who put on airs because he studied astronomy and best of all an omnibus for franz whose great delight was to drive the family bus stuffy got a fat pig and the little folks had birds and cats and rabbits with black currant eyes  now i must go where is my goldilocks mamma will come flying out to get her if im not back early said uncle teddy when the last crumb had vanished which it speedily did you may be sure  the young ladies had gone into the garden and while they waited till franz looked them up jo and laurie stood at the door talking together  how does little giddygaddy come on he asked for nans pranks amused him very much and he was never tired of teasing jo about her  nicely she is getting quite mannerly and begins to see the error of her wild ways  dont the boys encourage her in them  yes but i keep talking and lately she has improved much you saw how prettily she shook hands with you and how gentle she was with bess daisys example has its effect upon her and im quite sure that a few months will work wonders  here mrs jos remarks were cut short by the appearance of nan tearing round the corner at a breakneck pace driving a mettlesome team of four boys and followed by daisy trundling bess in a wheelbarrow hat off hair flying whip cracking and barrow bumping up they came in a cloud of dust looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to see  so these are the model children are they its lucky i didnt bring mrs curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals and manners she would never have recovered from the shock of this spectacle said mr laurie laughing at mrs jos premature rejoicing over nans improvement  laugh away ill succeed yet as you used to say at college quoting some professor though the experiment has failed the principle remains the same said mrs bhaer joining in the merriment  im afraid nans example is taking effect upon daisy instead of the other way look at my little princess she has utterly forgotten her dignity and is screaming like the rest young ladies what does this mean and mr laurie rescued his small daughter from impending destruction for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting madly all about her as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands  were having a race and i beat shouted nan  i could have run faster only i was afraid of spilling bess screamed daisy  hi go long cried the princess giving such a flourish with her whip that the horses ran away and were seen no more  my precious child come away from this illmannered crew before you are quite spoilt goodby jo next time i come i shall expect to find the boys making patchwork  it wouldnt hurt them a bit i dont give in mind you for my experiments always fail a few times before they succeed love to amy and my blessed marmee called mrs jo as the carriage drove away and the last mr laurie saw of her she was consoling daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow and looking as if she liked it  great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the carriagehouse which went briskly on in spite of the incessant questions advice and meddling of the boys old gibbs was nearly driven wild with it all but managed to do his work nevertheless and by friday night the place was all in order roof mended shelves up walls whitewashed a great window cut at the back which let in a flood of sunshine and gave them a fine view of the brook the meadows and the distant hills and over the great door painted in red letters was the laurence museum  all saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished with their spoils and when mr laurie arrived bringing an aquarium which mrs amy said she was tired of their rapture was great  the afternoon was spent in arranging things and when the running and lugging and hammering was over the ladies were invited to behold the institution  it certainly was a pleasant place airy clean and bright a hopvine shook its green bells round the open window the pretty aquarium stood in the middle of the room with some delicate water plants rising above the water and goldfish showing their brightness as they floated to and fro below on either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to receive the curiosities yet to be found dans tall cabinet stood before the great door which was fastened up while the small door was to be used on the cabinet stood a queer indian idol very ugly but very interesting old mr laurence sent it as well as a fine chinese junk in full sail which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle of the room above swinging in a loop and looking as if she was alive hung polly who died at an advanced age had been carefully stuffed and was no presented by mrs jo the walls were decorated with all sorts of things a snakes skin a big wasps nest a birchbark canoe a string of birds eggs wreaths of gray moss from the south and a bunch of cottonpods the dead bats had a place also a large turtleshell and an ostrichegg proudly presented by demi who volunteered to explain these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked there were so many stones that it was impossible to accept them all so only a few of the best were arranged among the shells on the shelves the rest were piled up in corners to be examined by dan at his leisure  every one was eager to give something even silas who sent home for a stuffed wildcat killed in his youth it was rather motheaten and shabby but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was fine for the yellow glass eyes glared and the mouth snarled so naturally that teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it when he came bringing his most cherished treasure one cocoon to lay upon the shrine of science  isnt it beautiful id no idea we had so many curious things i gave that dont it look well we might make a lot by charging something for letting folks see it  jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as the family viewed the room  this is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it ill paint out the name over the door said mr laurie turning so quickly that jack wished he had held his tongue  hear hear cried mr bhaer  speech speech added mrs jo  cant im too bashful you give them a lecture yourself you are used to it mr laurie answered retreating towards the window meaning to escape but she held him fast and said laughing as she looked at the dozen pairs of dirty hands about her  if i did lecture it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of soap come now as the founder of the institution you really ought to give us a few moral remarks and we will applaud tremendously  seeing that there was no way of escaping mr laurie looked up at polly hanging overhead seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird and sitting down upon the table said in his pleasant way  there is one thing id like to suggest boys and that is i want you to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this just putting curious or pretty things here wont do it so suppose you read up about them so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them and understand the matter i used to like these things myself and should enjoy hearing about them now for ive forgotten all i once knew it wasnt much was it jo heres dan now full of stories about birds and bugs and so on let him take care of the museum and once a week the rest of you take turns to read a composition or tell about some animal mineral or vegetable we should all like that and i think it would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads what do you say professor  i like it much and will give the lads all the help i can but they will need books to read up these new subjects and we have not many i fear began mr bhaer looking much pleased planning many fine lectures on geology which he liked we should have a library for the special purpose  is that a useful sort of book dan asked mr laurie pointing to the volume that lay open by the cabinet  oh yes it tells all i want to know about insects i had it here to see how to fix the butterflies right i covered it so it is not hurt and dan caught it up fearing the lender might think him careless  give it here a minute and pulling out his pencil mr laurie wrote dans name in it saying as he set the book up on one of the corner shelves where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail there that is the beginning of the museum library ill hunt up some more books and demi shall keep them in order where are those jolly little books we used to read jo insect architecture or some such name all about ants having battles and bees having queens and crickets eating holes in our clothes and stealing milk and larks of that sort  in the garret at home ill have them sent out and we will plunge into natural history with a will said mrs jo ready for any thing  wont it be hard to write about such things asked nat who hated compositions  at first perhaps but you will soon like it if you think that hard how would you like to have this subject given to you as it was to a girl of thirteen a conversation between themistocles aristides and pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of delos for the ornamentation of athens said mrs jo  the boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names and the gentlemen laughed at the absurdity of the lesson  did she write it asked demi in an awestricken tone  yes but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it though she was rather a bright child  id like to have seen it said mr bhaer  perhaps i can find it for you i went to school with her and mrs jo looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was  hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things wednesday afternoon was appointed for the lectures as they preferred to call them for some chose to talk instead of write mr bhaer promised a portfolio in which the written productions should be kept and mrs bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure  then the dirtyhanded society went off the wash followed by the professor trying to calm the anxiety of rob who had been told by tommy that all water was full of invisible pollywogs  i like your plan very much only dont be too generous teddy said mrs bhaer when they were left alone you know most of the boys have got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us and too much sitting in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it  ill be moderate but do let me amuse myself i get desperately tired of business sometimes and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic with your boys i like that dan very much jo he isnt demonstrative but he has the eye of a hawk and when you have tamed him a little he will do you credit  im so glad you think so thank you very much for your kindness to him especially for this museum affair it will keep him happy while he is lame give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor rough lad and make him love us what did inspire you with such a beautiful helpful idea teddy asked mrs bhaer glancing back at the pleasant room as she turned to leave it  laurie took both her hands in his and answered with a look that made her eyes fill with happy tears  dear jo i have known what it is to be a motherless boy and i never can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years    chapter xii huckleberries  there was a great clashing of tin pails much running to and fro and frequent demands for something to eat one august afternoon for the boys were going huckleberrying and made as much stir about it as if they were setting out to find the north west passage  now my lads get off as quietly as you can for rob is safely out of the way and wont see you said mrs bhaer as she tied daisys broadbrimmed hat and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had enveloped nan  but the plan did not succeed for rob had heard the bustle decided to go and prepared himself without a thought of disappointment the troop was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs with his best hat on a bright tin pail in his hand and a face beaming with satisfaction  oh dear now we shall have a scene sighed mrs bhaer who found her eldest son very hard to manage at times  im all ready said rob and took his place in the ranks with such perfect unconsciousness of his mistake that it really was very hard to undeceive him  its too far for you my love stay and take care of me for i shall be all alone began his mother  youve got teddy im a big boy so i can go you said i might when i was bigger and i am now persisted rob with a cloud beginning to dim the brightness of his happy face  we are going up to the great pasture and its ever so far we dont want you tagging on cried jack who did not admire the little boys  i wont tag ill run and keep up o mamma let me go i want to fill my new pail and ill bring em all to you please please i will be good prayed robby looking up at his mother so grieved and disappointed that her heart began to fail her  but my deary youll get so tired and hot you wont have a good time wait till i go and then we will stay all day and pick as many berries as you want  you never do go you are so busy and im tired of waiting id rather go and get the berries for you all myself i love to pick em and i want to fill my new pail dreffly sobbed rob  the pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail and threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries touched all the ladies present his mother patted the weeper on his back daisy offered to stay home with him and nan said in her decided way  let him come ill take care of him  if franz was going i wouldnt mind for he is very careful but he is haying with the father and im not sure about the rest of you began mrs bhaer  its so far put in jack  id carry him if i was going wish i was said dan with a sigh  thank you dear but you must take care of your foot i wish i could go stop a minute i think i can manage it after all and mrs bhaer ran out to the steps waving her apron wildly  silas was just driving away in the haycart but turned back and agreed at once when mrs jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture and go for them at five oclock  it will delay your work a little but never mind we will pay you in huckleberry pies said mrs jo knowing silass weak point  his rough brown face brightened up and he said with a cheery haw haw wal now mis bhaer if you go to bribin of me i shall give in right away  now boys i have arranged it so that you can all go said mrs bhaer running back again much relieved for she loved to make them happy and always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little sons for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures of children should be tenderly respected by grownup people and never rudely thwarted or ridiculed  can i go said dan delighted  i thought especially of you be careful and never mind the berries but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all about you answered mrs bhaer who remembered his kind offer to her boy  me too me too sung rob dancing with joy and clapping his precious pail and cover like castanets  yes and daisy and nan must take good care of you be at the bars at five oclock and silas will come for you all  robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude promising to bring her every berry he picked and not eat one then they were all packed into the haycart and went rattling away the brightest face among the dozen being that of rob as he sat between his two temporary little mothers beaming upon the whole world and waving his best hat for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it since this was a galaday to him  such a happy afternoon as they had in spite of the mishaps which usually occur on such expeditions of course tommy came to grief tumbled upon a hornets nest and got stung but being used to woe he bore the smart manfully till dan suggested the application of damp earth which much assuaged the pain daisy saw a snake and flying from it lost half her berries but demi helped her to fill up again and discussed reptiles most learnedly the while ned fell out of a tree and split his jacket down the back but suffered no other fracture emil and jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch and while they were squabbling about it stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes and fled to the protection of dan who was enjoying himself immensely the crutch was no longer necessary and he was delighted to see how strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture full of interesting rocks and stumps with familiar little creatures in the grass and wellknown insects dancing in the air  but of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which befell nan and rob was the most exciting and it long remained one of the favorite histories of the household having explored the country pretty generally torn three rents in her frock and scratched her face in a barberrybush nan began to pick the berries that shone like big black beads on the low green bushes her nimble fingers flew but still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired so she kept wandering here and there to search for better places instead of picking contentedly and steadily as daisy did rob followed nan for her energy suited him better than his cousins patience and he too was anxious to have the biggest and best berries for marmar  i keep putting em in but it dont fill up and im so tired said rob pausing a moment to rest his short legs and beginning to think huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it for the sun blazed nan skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper and the berries fell out of his pail almost as fast as he put them in because in his struggles with the bushes it was often upsidedown  last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great bouncers and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire lets go and fill our things quick and then hide in the cave and let the others find us proposed nan thirsting for adventures  rob consented and away they went scrambling over the wall and running down the sloping fields on the other side till they were hidden among the rocks and underbrush the berries were thick and at last the pails were actually full it was shady and cool down there and a little spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy cup  now we will go and rest in the cave and eat our lunch said nan well satisfied with her success so far  do you know the way asked rob  course i do ive been once and i always remember didnt i go and get my box all right  that convinced rob and he followed blindly as nan led him over stock and stone and brought him after much meandering to a small recess in the rock where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made  now isnt it nice asked nan as she took out a bit of breadandbutter rather damaged by being mixed up with nails fishhooks stones and other foreign substances in the young ladys pocket  yes do you think they will find us soon asked rob who found the shadowy glen rather dull and began to long for more society  no i dont because if i hear them i shall hide and have fun making them find me  praps they wont come  dont care i can get home myself  is it a great way asked rob looking at his little stubby boots scratched and wet with his long wandering  its six miles i guess nans ideas of distance were vague and her faith in her own powers great  i think we better go now suggested rob presently  i shant till i have picked over my berries and nan began what seemed to rob an endless task  oh dear you said youd take good care of me he sighed as the sun seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden  well i am taking good care of you as hard as i can dont be cross child ill go in a minute said nan who considered fiveyearold robby a mere infant compared to herself  so little rob sat looking anxiously about him and waiting patiently for spite of some misgivings he felt great confidence in nan  i guess its going to be night pretty soon he observed as if to himself as a mosquito bit him and the frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert  my goodness me so it is come right away this minute or they will be gone cried nan looking up from her work and suddenly perceiving that the sun was down  i heard a horn about an hour ago may be they were blowing for us said rob trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill  where was it asked nan stopping short  over that way he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely wrong direction  lets go that way and meet them and nan wheeled about and began to trot through the bushes feeling a trifle anxious for there were so many cowpaths all about she could not remember which way they came  on they went over stock and stone again pausing now and then to listen for the horn which did not blow any more for it was only the moo of a cow on her way home  i dont remember seeing that pile of stones do you asked nan as she sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation  i dont remember any thing but i want to go home and robs voice had a little tremble in it that made nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down saying in her most capable way  im going just as fast as i can dear dont cry and when we come to the road ill carry you  where is the road and robby wiped his eyes to look for it  over by that big tree dont you know thats the one ned tumbled out of  so it is may be they waited for us id like to ride home wouldnt you and robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the great pasture  no id rather walk answered nan feeling quite sure that she would be obliged to do so and preparing her mind for it  another long trudge through the fastdeepening twilight and another disappointment for when they reached the tree they found to their dismay that it was not the one ned climbed and no road anywhere appeared  are we lost quavered rob clasping his pail in despair  not much i dont just see which way to go and i guess wed better call  so they both shouted till they were hoarse yet nothing answered but the frogs in full chorus  there is another tall tree over there perhaps thats the one said nan whose heart sunk within her though she still spoke bravely  i dont think i can go any more my boots are so heavy i cant pull em and robby sat down on a stone quite worn out  then we must stay here all night i dont care much if snakes dont come  im frightened of snakes i cant stay all night oh dear i dont like to be lost and rob puckered up his face to cry when suddenly a thought occurred to him and he said in a tone of perfect confidence  marmar will come and find me she always does i aint afraid now  she wont know where we are  she didnt know i was shut up in the icehouse but she found me i know shell come returned robby so trustfully that nan felt relieved and sat down by him saying with a remorseful sigh  i wish we hadnt run away  you made me but i dont mind much marmar will love me just the same answered rob clinging to his sheetanchor when all other hope was gone  im so hungry lets eat our berries proposed nan after a pause during which rob began to nod  so am i but i cant eat mine cause i told marmar id keep them all for her  youll have to eat them if no one comes for us said nan who felt like contradicting every thing just then if we stay here a great many days we shall eat up all the berries in the field and then we shall starve she added grimly  i shall eat sassafras i know a big tree of it and dan told me how squirrels dig up the roots and eat them and i love to dig returned rob undaunted by the prospect of starvation  yes and we can catch frogs and cook them my father ate some once and he said they were nice put in nan beginning to find a spice of romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture  how could we cook frogs we havent got any fire  i dont know next time ill have matches in my pocket said nan rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frogcookery  couldnt we light a fire with a firefly asked rob hopefully as he watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks  lets try and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the flies and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two its a lie to call them fireflies when there isnt a fire in them nan said throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn though it shone its best and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent little experimenters  marmars a good while coming said rob after another pause during which they watched the stars overhead smelt the sweet fern crushed under foot and listened to the crickets serenade  i dont see why god made any night day is so much pleasanter said nan thoughtfully  its to sleep in answered rob with a yawn  then do go to sleep said nan pettishly  i want my own bed oh i wish i could see teddy cried rob painfully reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests  i dont believe your mother will ever find us said nan who was becoming desperate for she hated patient waiting of any sort its so dark she wont see us  it was all black in the icehouse and i was so scared i didnt call her but she saw me and she will see me now no matter how dark it is returned confiding rob standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him  i see her i see her he cried and ran as fast as his tired legs would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching suddenly he stopped then turned about and came stumbling back screaming in a great panic  no its a bear a big black one and hid his face in nans skirts  for a moment nan quailed ever her courage gave out at the thought of a real bear and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder when a mild moo changed her fear to merriment as she said laughing  its a cow robby the nice black cow we saw this afternoon  the cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two little people in her pasture after dark and the amiable beast paused to inquire into the case she let them stroke her and stood regarding them with her soft eyes so mildly that nan who feared no animal but a bear was fired with a desire to milk her  silas taught me how and berries and milk would be so nice she said emptying the contents of her pail into her hat and boldly beginning her new task while rob stood by and repeated at her command the poem from mother goose       cushy cow bonny let down your milk      let down your milk to me      and i will give you a gown of silk      a gown of silk and a silver tee  but the immortal rhyme had little effect for the benevolent cow had already been milked and had only half a gill to give the thirsty children  shoo get away you are an old cross patch cried nan ungratefully as she gave up the attempt in despair and poor molly walked on with a gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof  each can have a sip and then we must take a walk we shall go to sleep if we dont and lost people mustnt sleep dont you know how hannah lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died  but there isnt any snow now and its nice and warm said rob who was not blessed with as lively a fancy as nan  no matter we will poke about a little and call some more and then if nobody comes we will hide under the bushes like hopomythumb and his brothers  it was a very short walk however for rob was so sleepy he could not get on and tumbled down so often that nan entirely lost patience being half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself  if you tumble down again ill shake you she said lifting the poor little man up very kindly as she spoke for nans bark was much worse than her bite  please dont its my boots they keep slipping so and rob manfully checked the sob just ready to break out adding with a plaintive patience that touched nans heart if the skeeters didnt bite me so i could go to sleep till marmar comes  put your head on my lap and ill cover you up with my apron im not afraid of the night said nan sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her  wake me up when she comes said rob and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in nans lap under the pinafore  the little girl sat for some fifteen minutes staring about her with anxious eyes and feeling as if each second was an hour then a pale light began to glimmer over the hilltop and she said to herself  i guess the night is over and morning is coming id like to see the sun rise so ill watch and when it comes up we can find our way right home  but before the moons round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope nan had fallen asleep leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns and was deep in a midsummer nights dream of fireflies and blue aprons mountains of huckleberries and robby wiping away the tears of a black cow who sobbed i want to go home i want to go home  while the children were sleeping peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes the family at home were in a great state of agitation the haycart came at five and all but jack emil nan and rob were at the bars ready for it franz drove instead of silas and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood he said looking illpleased they ought to have left rob to ride he will be tired out by the long walk  its shorter that way and they will carry him said stuffy who was in a hurry for his supper  you are sure nan and rob went with them  of course they did i saw them getting over the wall and sung out that it was most five and jack called back that they were going the other way explained tommy  very well pile in then and away rattled the haycart with the tired children and the full pails  mrs jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party and sent franz back with toby to find and bring the little ones home supper was over and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual when franz came trotting back hot dusty and anxious  have they come he called out when halfway up the avenue  no and mrs jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round franz  i cant find them anywhere he began but the words were hardly spoken when a loud hullo startled them all and the next minute jack and emil came round the house  where are nan and rob cried mrs jo clutching emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits  i dont know they came home with the others didnt they he answered quickly  no george and tommy said they went with you  well they didnt havent seen them we took a swim in the pond and came by the wood said jack looking alarmed as well he might  call mr bhaer get the lanterns and tell silas i want him  that was all mrs jo said but they knew what she meant and flew to obey her orders in ten minutes mr bhaer and silas were off to the wood and franz tearing down the road on old andy to search the great pasture mrs jo caught up some food from the table a little bottle of brandy from the medicinecloset took a lantern and bidding jack and emil come with her and the rest not stir she trotted away on toby never stopping for hat or shawl she heard some one running after her but said not a word till as she paused to call and listen the light of her lantern shone on dans face  you here i told jack to come she said halfinclined to send him back much as she needed help  i wouldnt let him he and emil hadnt had any supper and i wanted to come more than they did he said taking the lantern from her and smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her feel as if boy though he was she had some one to depend on  off she jumped and ordered him on to toby in spite of his pleading to walk then they went on again along the dusty solitary road stopping every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to reply  when they came to the great pasture other lights were already flitting to and fro like willothewisps and mr bhaers voice was heard shouting nan rob rob nan in every part of the field silas whistled and roared dan plunged here and there on toby who seemed to understand the case and went over the roughest places with unusual docility often mrs jo hushed them all saying with a sob in her throat the noise may frighten them let me call robby will know my voice and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone of tenderness till the very echoes whispered it softly and the winds seemed to waft it willingly but still no answer came  the sky was overcast now and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen heatlightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then and a faint faroff rumble as of thunder told that a summerstorm was brewing  o my robby my robby mourned poor mrs jo wandering up and down like a pale ghost while dan kept beside her like a faithful firefly what shall i say to nans father if she comes to harm why did i ever trust my darling so far away fritz do you hear any thing and when a mournful no came back she wrung her hands so despairingly that dan sprung down from tobys back tied the bridle to the bars and said in his decided way  they may have gone down the spring im going to look  he was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him but when she reached the spot he lowered the lantern and showed her with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring she fell down on her knees to examine the tracks and then sprung up saying eagerly  yes that is the mark of my robbys little boots come this way they must have gone on  such a weary search but now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead the anxious mother for presently dan uttered a cry and caught up a little shining object lying in the path it was the cover of the new tin pail dropped in the first alarm of being lost mrs jo hugged and kissed it as if it were a living thing and when dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot she stopped him saying as she hurried on no let me find them i let rob go and i want to give him back to his father all myself  a little farther on nans hat appeared and after passing the place more than once they came at last upon the babes in the wood both sound asleep dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his lantern shone that night he thought mrs jo would cry out but she only whispered hush as she softly lifted away the apron and saw the little ruddy face below the berrystained lips were halfopen as the breath came and went the yellow hair lay damp on the hot forehead and both the chubby hands held fast the little pail still full  the sight of the childish harvest treasured through all the troubles of that night for her seemed to touch mrs jo to the heart for suddenly she gathered up her boy and began to cry over him so tenderly yet so heartily that he woke up and at first seemed bewildered then he remembered and hugged her close saying with a laugh of triumph  i knew youd come o marmar i did want you so for a moment they kissed and clung to one another quite forgetting all the world for no matter how lost and soiled and wornout wandering sons may be mothers can forgive and forget every thing as they fold them in their fostering arms happy the son whose faith in his mother remains unchanged and who through all his wanderings has kept some filial token to repay her brave and tender love  dan meantime picked nan out of her bush and with a gentleness none but teddy ever saw in him before he soothed her first alarm at the sudden waking and wiped away her tears for nan also began to cry for joy it was so good to see a kind face and feel a strong arm round her after what seemed to her ages of loneliness and fear  my poor little girl dont cry you are all safe now and no one shall say a word of blame tonight said mrs jo taking nan into her capacious embrace and cuddling both children as a hen might gather her lost chickens under her motherly wings  it was my fault but i am sorry i tried to take care of him and i covered him up and let him sleep and didnt touch his berries though i was so hungry and i never will do it again truly never never sobbed nan quite lost in a sea of penitence and thankfulness  call them now and let us get home said mrs jo and dan getting upon the wall sent a joyful word found ringing over the field  how the wandering lights came dancing from all sides and gathered round the little group among the sweet fern bushes such a hugging and kissing and talking and crying as went on must have amazed the glowworms and evidently delighted the mosquitoes for they hummed frantically while the little moths came in flocks to the party and the frogs croaked as if they could not express their satisfaction loudly enough  then they set out for home a queer party for franz rode on to tell the news dan and toby led the way then came nan in the strong arms of silas who considered her the smartest little baggage he ever saw and teased her all the way home about her pranks mrs bhaer would let no one carry rob but himself and the little fellow refreshed by sleep sat up and chattered gayly feeling himself a hero while his mother went beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that came handy and never tired of hearing him say i knew marmar would come or seeing him lean down to kiss her and put a plump berry into her mouth cause he picked em all for her  the moon shone out just as they reached the avenue and all the boys came shouting to meet them so the lost lambs were borne in triumph and safety and landed in the diningroom where the unromantic little things demanded supper instead of preferring kisses and caresses they were set down to bread and milk while the entire household stood round to gaze upon them nan soon recovered her spirits and recounted her perils with a relish now that they were all over rob seemed absorbed in his food but put down his spoon all of a sudden and set up a doleful roar  my precious why do you cry asked his mother who still hung over him  im crying cause i was lost bawled rob trying to squeeze out a tear and failing entirely  but you are found now nan says you didnt cry out in the field and i was glad you were such a brave boy  i was so busy being frightened i didnt have any time then but i want to cry now cause i dont like to be lost explained rob struggling with sleep emotion and a mouthful of bread and milk  the boys set up such a laugh at this funny way of making up for lost time that rob stopped to look at them and the merriment was so infectious that after a surprised stare he burst out into a merry ha ha and beat his spoon upon the table as if he enjoyed the joke immensely  it is ten oclock into bed every man of you said mr bhaer looking at his watch  and thank heaven there will be no empty ones tonight added mrs bhaer watching with full eyes robby going up in his fathers arms and nan escorted by daisy and demi who considered her the most interesting heroine of their collection  poor aunt jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself said gentle franz putting his arm round her as she paused at the stairfoot looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk  lets make an armchair proposed tommy  no thank you my lads but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean on answered mrs jo  me me and halfadozen jostled one another all eager to be chosen for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm hearts under the round jackets  seeing that they considered it an honor mrs jo gave it to the one who had earned it and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on dans broad shoulder saying with a look that made him color up with pride and pleasure  he found the children so i think he must help me up  dan felt richly rewarded for his evenings work not only that he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp but because mrs jo said heartily goodnight my boy god bless you as he left her at her door  i wish i was your boy said dan who felt as if danger and trouble had somehow brought him nearer than ever to her  you shall be my oldest son and she sealed her promise with a kiss that made dan hers entirely  little rob was all right next day but nan had a headache and lay on mother bhaers sofa with coldcream upon her scratched face her remorse was quite gone and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine amusement mrs jo was not pleased with this state of things and had no desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue or her pupils lying round loose in huckleberry fields so she talked soberly to nan and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and license telling several tales to enforce her lecture she had not decided how to punish nan but one of these stories suggested a way and as mrs jo liked odd penalties she tried it  all children run away pleaded nan as if it was as natural and necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough  not all and some who do run away dont get found again answered mrs jo  didnt you do it yourself asked nan whose keen little eyes saw some traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally before her  mrs jo laughed and owned that she did  tell about it demanded nan feeling that she was getting the upper hand in the discussion  mrs jo saw that and sobered down at once saying with a remorseful shake of the head  i did it a good many times and led my poor mother rather a hard life with my pranks till she cured me  how and nan sat up with a face full of interest  i had a new pair of shoes once and wanted to show them so though i was told not to leave the garden i ran away and was wandering about all day it was in the city and why i wasnt killed i dont know such a time as i had i frolicked in the park with dogs sailed boats in the back bay with strange boys dined with a little irish beggargirl on salt fish and potatoes and was found at last fast asleep on a doorstep with my arms round a great dog it was late in the evening and i was a dirty as a little pig and the new shoes were worn out i had travelled so far  how nice cried nan looking all ready to go and do it herself  it was not nice next day and mrs jo tried to keep her eyes from betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers  did your mother whip you asked nan curiously  she never whipped me but once and then she begged my pardon or i dont think i ever should have forgiven her it hurt my feelings so much  why did she beg your pardon my father dont  because when she had done it i turned round and said well you are mad yourself and ought to be whipped as much as me she looked at me a minute then her anger all died out and she said as if ashamed you are right jo i am angry and why should i punish you for being in a passion when i set you such a bad example forgive me dear and let us try to help one another in a better way i never forgot it and it did me more good than a dozen rods  nan sat thoughtfully turning the little coldcream jar for a minute and mrs jo said nothing but let that idea get well into the busy little mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her  i like that said nan presently and her face looked less elfish with its sharp eyes inquisitive nose and mischievous mouth what did your mother do to you when you ran away that time  she tied me to the bedpost with a long string so that i could not go out of the room and there i stayed all day with the little wornout shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault  i should think that would cure anybody cried nan who loved her liberty above all things  it did cure me and i think it will you so i am going to try it said mrs jo suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her worktable  nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument now and sat feeling much crestfallen while mrs jo tied one end round her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa saying as she finished  i dont like to tie you up like a naughty little dog but if you dont remember any better than a dog i must treat you like one  id just as lief be tied up as not i like to play dog and nan put on a dontcare face and began to growl and grovel on the floor  mrs jo took no notice but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to hem she went away and left miss nan to her own devices this was not agreeable and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord but it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind so she began on the knot at the other end it soon came loose and gathering it up nan was about to get out of the window when she heard mrs jo say to somebody as she passed through the hall  no i dont think she will run away now she is an honorable little girl and knows that i do it to help her  in a minute nan whisked back tied herself up and began to sew violently rob came in a moment after and was so charmed with the new punishment that he got a jumprope and tethered himself to the other arm of the sofa in the most social manner  i got lost too so i ought to be tied up as much as nan he explained to his mother when she saw the new captive  im not sure that you dont deserve a little punishment for you knew it was wrong to go far away from the rest  nan took me began rob willing to enjoy the novel penalty but not willing to take the blame  you neednt have gone you have got a conscience though you are a little boy and you must learn to mind it  well my conscience didnt prick me a bit when she said lets get over the wall answered rob quoting one of demis expressions  did you stop to see if it did  no  then you cannot tell  i guess its such a little conscience that it dont prick hard enough for me to feel it added rob after thinking the matter over for a minute  we must sharpen it up its bad to have a dull conscience so you may stay here till dinnertime and talk about it with nan i trust you both not to untie yourselves till i say the word  no we wont said both feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping to punish themselves  for an hour they were very good then they grew tired of one room and longed to get out never had the hall seemed so inviting even the little bedroom acquired a sudden interest and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed the open windows drove them wild because they could not reach them and the outer world seemed so beautiful they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull nan pined for a race round the lawn and rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning and wondered what poor pollux would do they watched the clock and nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds while rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them it was maddening to smell the dinner to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding and to feel that they would not be on the spot to secure good helps of both when mary ann began to set the table they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there was to be and nan offered to help her make the beds if she would only see that she had lots of sauce on her pudding  when the boys came bursting out of school they found the children tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts and were much edified as well as amused by the sequel to the exciting adventures of the night  untie me now marmar my conscience will prick like a pin next time i know it will said rob as the bell rang and teddy came to look at him with sorrowful surprise  we shall see answered his mother setting him free he took a good run down the hall back through the diningroom and brought up beside nan quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction  ill bring her dinner to her may i he asked pitying his fellowcaptive  thats my kind little son yes pull out the table and get a chair and mrs jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon  nan ate alone and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa mrs bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window and there she stood watching the boys play and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn so that nan might see the fun if she could not join in it tommy turned his best somersaults to console her demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself which amused nan a good deal and dan brought a little treetoad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power  but nothing atoned for the loss of freedom and a few hours of confinement taught nan how precious it was a good many thoughts went through the little head that lay on the windowsill during the last quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see emils new ship launched she was to have christened it and had depended on smashing a tiny bottle of currantwine over the prow as it was named josephine in honor of mrs bhaer now she had lost her chance and daisy wouldnt do it half so well tears rose to her eyes as she remembered that it was all her own fault and she said aloud addressing a fat bee who was rolling about in the yellow heart of a rose just under the window  if you have run away youd better go right home and tell your mother you are sorry and never do so any more  i am glad to hear you give him such good advice and i think he has taken it said mrs jo smiling as the bee spread his dusty wings and flew away  nan brushed off a bright drop or two that shone on the windowsill and nestled against her friend as she took her on her knee adding kindly for she had seen the little drops and knew what they meant  do you think my mothers cure for running away a good one  yes maam answered nan quite subdued by her quiet day  i hope i shall not have to try it again  i guess not and nan looked up with such an earnest little face that mrs jo felt satisfied and said no more for she liked to have her penalties do their own work and did not spoil the effect by too much moralizing  here rob appeared bearing with infinite care what asia called a sarcer pie meaning one baked in a saucer  its made out of some of my berries and im going to give you half at suppertime he announced with a flourish  what makes you when im so naughty asked nan meekly  because we got lost together you aint going to be naughty again are you  never said nan with great decision  oh goody now lets go and get mary ann to cut this for us all ready to eat its most tea time and rob beckoned with the delicious little pie  nan started to follow then stopped and said  i forgot i cant go  try and see said mrs bhaer who had quietly untied the cord sash while she had been talking  nan saw that she was free and with one tempestuous kiss to mrs jo she was off like a hummingbird followed by robby dribbling huckleberry juice as he ran    chapter xiii goldilocks  after the last excitement peace descended upon plumfield and reigned unbroken for several weeks for the elder boys felt that the loss of nan and rob lay at their door and all became so paternal in their care that they were rather wearying while the little ones listened to nans recital of her perils so many times that they regarded being lost as the greatest ill humanity was heir to and hardly dared to put their little noses outside the great gate lest night should suddenly descend upon them and ghostly black cows come looming through the dusk  it is too good to last said mrs jo for years of boyculture had taught her that such lulls were usually followed by outbreaks of some sort and when less wise women would have thought that the boys had become confirmed saints she prepared herself for a sudden eruption of the domestic volcano  one cause of this welcome calm was a visit from little bess whose parents lent her for a week while they were away with grandpa laurence who was poorly the boys regarded goldilocks as a mixture of child angel and fairy for she was a lovely little creature and the golden hair which she inherited from her blonde mamma enveloped her like a shining veil behind which she smiled upon her worshippers when gracious and hid herself when offended her father would not have it cut and it hung below her waist so soft and fine and bright that demi insisted that it was silk spun from a cocoon every one praised the little princess but it did not seem to do her harm only to teach her that her presence brought sunshine her smiles made answering smiles on other faces and her baby griefs filled every heart with tenderest sympathy  unconsciously she did her young subjects more good than many a real sovereign for her rule was very gentle and her power was felt rather than seen her natural refinement made her dainty in all things and had a good effect upon the careless lads about her she would let no one touch her roughly or with unclean hands and more soap was used during her visits than at any other time because the boys considered it the highest honor to be allowed to carry her highness and the deepest disgrace to be repulsed with the disdainful command do away dirty boy  lour voices displeased her and quarrelling frightened her so gentler tones came into the boyish voices as they addressed her and squabbles were promptly suppressed in her presence by lookerson if the principles could not restrain themselves she liked to be waited on and the biggest boys did her little errands without a murmur while the small lads were her devoted slaves in all things they begged to be allowed to draw her carriage bear her berrybasket or pass her plate at table no service was too humble and tommy and ned came to blows before they could decide which should have the honor of blacking her little boots  nan was especially benefited by a week in the society of a wellbred lady though such a very small one for bess would look at her with a mixture of wonder and alarm in her great blue eyes when the hoyden screamed and romped and she shrunk from her as if she thought her a sort of wild animal warmhearted nan felt this very much she said at first pooh i dont care but she did care and was so hurt when bess said i love my tuzzin best tause she is twiet that she shook poor daisy till her teeth chattered in her head and then fled to the barn to cry dismally in that general refuge for perturbed spirits she found comfort and good counsel from some source or other perhaps the swallows from their mudbuilt nests overhead twittered her a little lecture on the beauty of gentleness however that might have been she came out quite subdued and carefully searched the orchard for a certain kind of early apple that bess liked because it was sweet and small and rosy armed with this peaceoffering she approached the little princess and humbly presented it to her great joy it was graciously accepted and when daisy gave nan a forgiving kiss bess did likewise as if she felt that she had been too severe and desired to apologize after this they played pleasantly together and nan enjoyed the royal favor for days to be sure she felt a little like a wild bird in a pretty cage at first and occasionally had to slip out to stretch her wings in a long flight or to sing at the top of her voice where neither would disturb the plump turtledove daisy nor the dainty golden canary bess but it did her good for seeing how every one loved the little princess for her small graces and virtues she began to imitate her because nan wanted much love and tried hard to win it  not a boy in the house but felt the pretty childs influence and was improved by it without exactly knowing how or why for babies can work miracles in the hearts that love them poor billy found infinite satisfaction in staring at her and though she did not like it she permitted without a frown after she had been made to understand that he was not quite like the others and on that account must be more kindly treated dick and dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles the only thing they knew how to make and she accepted but never used them rob served her like a little lover and teddy followed her like a pet dog jack she did not like because he was afflicted with warts and had a harsh voice stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily and george tried hard not to gobble that he might not disgust the dainty little lady opposite ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when he was discovered tormenting some unhappy fieldmice goldilocks could never forget the sad spectacle and retired behind her veil when he approached waving him away with an imperious little hand and crying in a tone of mingled grief and anger  no i tarnt love him he tut the poor mouses little tails off and they queeked  daisy promptly abdicated when bess came and took the humble post of chief cook while nan was first maid of honor emil was chancellor of the exchequer and spent the public monies lavishly in getting up spectacles that cost whole ninepences franz was prime minister and directed her affairs of state planned royal progresses through the kingdom and kept foreign powers in order demi was her philosopher and fared much better than such gentlemen usually do among crowned heads dan was her standing army and defended her territories gallantly tommy was court fool and nat a tuneful rizzio to this innocent little mary  uncle fritz and aunt jo enjoyed this peaceful episode and looked on at the pretty play in which the young folk unconsciously imitated their elders without adding the tragedy that is so apt to spoil the dramas acted on the larger stage  they teach us quite as much as we teach them said mr bhaer  bless the dears they never guess how many hints they give us as to the best way of managing them answered mrs jo  i think you were right about the good effect of having girls among the boys nan has stirred up daisy and bess is teaching the little bears how to behave better than we can if this reformation goes on as it has begun i shall soon feel like dr blimber with his model young gentlemen said professor laughing as he saw tommy not only remove his own hat but knock off neds also as they entered the hall where the princess was taking a ride on the rockinghorse attended by rob and teddy astride of chairs and playing gallant knights to the best of their ability  you will never be a blimber fritz you couldnt do it if you tried and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous hotbed no fear that they will be too elegant american boys like liberty too well but good manners they cannot fail to have if we give them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor making it courteous and cordial like yours my dear old boy  tut tut we will not compliment for if i begin you will run away and i have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end yet mr bhaer looked pleased with the compliment for it was true and mrs jo felt that she had received the best her husband could give her by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society  to return to the children i have just had another proof of goldilocks good influence said mrs jo drawing her chair nearer the sofa where the professor lay resting after a long days work in his various gardens nan hates sewing but for love of bess has been toiling half the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our loveapples to her idol when she goes i praised her for it and she said in her quick way i like to sew for other people it is stupid sewing for myself i took the hint and shall give her some little shirts and aprons for mrs carneys children she is so generous she will sew her fingers sore for them and i shall not have to make a task of it  but needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment my dear  sorry for it my girls shall learn all i can teach them about it even if they give up the latin algebra and halfadozen ologies it is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over nowadays amy means to make bess an accomplished woman but the dears mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already and her mother has several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird without a bill that filled laurie with such pride when bess made it  i also have proof of the princesss power said mrs bhaer after he had watched mrs jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole system of fashionable education jack is so unwilling to be classed with stuffy and ned as distasteful to bess that he came to me a little while ago and asked me to touch his warts with caustic i have often proposed it and he never would consent but now he bore the smart manfully and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand  mrs bhaer laughed at the story and just then stuffy came in to ask if he might give goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him  she is not allowed to eat sweeties but if you like to give her the pretty box with the pink sugarrose in it she would like it very much said mrs jo unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of selfdenial for the fat boy seldom offered to share his sugarplums  wont she eat it i shouldnt like to make her sick said stuffy eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly yet putting it into the box  oh no she wont touch it if i tell her it is to look at not to eat she will keep it for weeks and never think of tasting it can you do as much  i should hope so im ever so much older than she is cried stuffy indignantly  well suppose we try here put your bonbons in this bag and see how long you can keep them let me count two hearts four red fishes three barleysugar horses nine almonds and a dozen chocolate drops do you agree to that asked sly mrs jo popping the sweeties into her little spoolbag  yes said stuffy with a sigh and pocketing the forbidden fruit he went away to give bess the present that won a smile from her and permission to escort her round the garden  poor stuffys heart has really got the better of his stomach at last and his efforts will be much encouraged by the rewards bess gives him said mrs jo  happy is the man who can put temptation in his pocket and learn selfdenial from so sweet a little teacher added mr bhaer as the children passed the window stuffys fat face full of placid satisfaction and goldilocks surveying her sugarrose with polite interest though she would have preferred a real flower with a pitty smell  when her father came to take her home a universal wail arose and the parting gifts showered upon her increased her luggage to such an extent that mr laurie proposed having out the big wagon to take it into town every one had given her something and it was found difficult to pack white mice cake a parcel of shells apples a rabbit kicking violently in a bag a large cabbage for his refreshment a bottle of minnows and a mammoth bouquet the farewell scene was moving for the princess sat upon the halltable surrounded by her subjects she kissed her cousins and held out her hand to the other boys who shook it gently with various soft speeches for they were taught not to be ashamed of showing their emotions  come again soon little dear whispered dan fastening his best greenandgold beetle in her hat  dont forget me princess whatever you do said the engaging tommy taking a last stroke of the pretty hair  i am coming to your house next week and then i shall see you bess added nat as if he found consolation in the thought  do shake hands now cried jack offering a smooth paw  here are two nice new ones to remember us by said dick and dolly presenting fresh whistles quite unconscious that seven old ones had been privately deposited in the kitchenstove  my little precious i shall work you a bookmark right away and you must keep it always said nan with a warm embrace  but of all the farewells poor billys was the most pathetic for the thought that she was really going became so unbearable that he cast himself down before her hugging her little blue boots and blubbering despairingly dont go away oh dont goldilocks was so touched by this burst of feeling that she leaned over and lifting the poor lads head said in her soft little voice  dont cry poor billy i will tiss you and tum adain soon  this promise consoled billy and he fell back beaming with pride at the unusual honor conferred upon him  me too me too clamored dick and dolly feeling that their devotion deserved some return the others looked as if they would like to join in the cry and something in the kind merry faces about her moved the princess to stretch out her arms and say with reckless condescension  i will tiss evvybody  like a swarm of bees about a very sweet flower the affectionate lads surrounded their pretty playmate and kissed her till she looked like a little rose not roughly but so enthusiastically that nothing but the crown of her hat was visible for a moment then her father rescued her and she drove away still smiling and waving her hands while the boys sat on the fence screaming like a flock of guineafowls come back come back till she was out of sight  they all missed her and each dimly felt that he was better for having known a creature so lovely delicate and sweet for little bess appealed to the chivalrous instinct in them as something to love admire and protect with a tender sort of reverence many a man remembers some pretty child who has made a place in his heart and kept her memory alive by the simple magic of her innocence these little men were just learning to feel this power and to love it for its gentle influence not ashamed to let the small hand lead them nor to own their loyalty to womankind even in the bud    chapter xiv damon and pythias  mrs bhaer was right peace was only a temporary lull a storm was brewing and two days after bess left a moral earthquake shook plumfield to its centre  tommys hens were at the bottom of the trouble for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs he could not have sold them and made such sums money is the root of all evil and yet it is such a useful root that we cannot get on without it any more than we can without potatoes tommy certainly could not for he spent his income so recklessly that mr bhaer was obliged to insist on a savingsbank and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice with the name over the door and a tall chimney down which the pennies were to go there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of trapdoor in the floor  the house increased in weight so rapidly that tommy soon became satisfied with his investment and planned to buy unheardof treasures with his capital he kept account of the sums deposited and was promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars on condition that he spent the money wisely only one dollar was needed and the day mrs jo paid him for four dozen eggs he was so delighted that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to nat who was also laying by money for the longdesired violin  i wish i had em to put with my three dollars then id soon get enough to buy my fiddle he said looking wistfully at the money  praps ill lend you some i havent decided yet what ill do with mine said tommy tossing up his quarters and catching them as they fell  hi boys come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake dans got called a voice from behind the barn  come on said tommy and laying his money inside the old winnowing machine away he ran followed by nat  the snake was very interesting and then a long chase after a lame crow and its capture so absorbed tommys mind and time that he never thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night  never mind no one but nat knows where it is said the easygoing lad and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property  next morning just as the boys assembled for school tommy rushed into the room breathlessly demanding  i say who has got my dollar  what are you talking about asked franz  tommy explained and nat corroborated his statement  every one else declared they knew nothing about it and began to look suspiciously at nat who got more and more alarmed and confused with each denial  somebody must have taken it said franz as tommy shook his fist at the whole party and wrathfully declared that  by thunder turtles if i get hold of the thief ill give him what he wont forget in a hurry  keep cool tom we shall find him out thieves always come to grief said dan as one who knew something of the matter  may be some tramp slept in the barn and took it suggested ned  no silas dont allow that besides a tramp wouldnt go looking in that old machine for money said emil with scorn  wasnt it silas himself said jack  well i like that old si is as honest as daylight you wouldnt catch him touching a penny of ours said tommy handsomely defending his chief admirer from suspicion  whoever it was had better tell and not wait to be found out said demi looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family  i know you think its me broke out nat red and excited  you are the only one who knew where it was said franz  i cant help it i didnt take it i tell you i didnt i didnt cried nat in a desperate sort of way  gently gently my son what is all this noise about and mr bhaer walked in among them  tommy repeated the story of his loss and as he listened mr bhaers face grew graver and graver for with all their faults and follies the lads till now had been honest  take your seats he said and when all were in their places he added slowly as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look that was harder to bear than a storm of words  now boys i shall ask each one of you a single question and i want an honest answer i am not going to try to frighten bribe or surprise the truth out of you for every one of you have got a conscience and know what it is for now is the time to undo the wrong done to tommy and set yourselves right before us all i can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than i can deceit dont add a lie to the theft but confess frankly and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive  he paused a moment and one might have heard a pin drop the room was so still then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one receiving the same answer in varying tones from all every face was flushed and excited so that mr bhaer could not take color as a witness and some of the little boys were so frightened that they stammered over the two short words as if guilty though it was evident that they could not be when he came to nat his voice softened for the poor lad looked so wretched mr bhaer felt for him he believed him to be the culprit and hoped to save the boy from another lie by winning him to tell the truth without fear  now my son give me an honest answer did you take the money  no sir and nat looked up at him imploringly  as the words fell from his trembling lips somebody hissed  stop that cried mr bhaer with a sharp rap on his desk as he looked sternly toward the corner whence the sound came  ned jack and emil sat there and the first two looked ashamed of themselves but emil called out  it wasnt me uncle id be ashamed to hit a fellow when he is down  good for you cried tommy who was in a sad state of affliction at the trouble his unlucky dollar had made  silence commanded mr bhaer and when it came he said soberly  i am very sorry nat but evidences are against you and your old fault makes us more ready to doubt you than we should be if we could trust you as we do some of the boys who never fib but mind my child i do not charge you with this theft i shall not punish you for it till i am perfectly sure nor ask any thing more about it i shall leave it for you to settle with your own conscience if you are guilty come to me at any hour of the day or night and confess it and i will forgive and help you to amend if you are innocent the truth will appear sooner or later and the instant it does i will be the first to beg your pardon for doubting you and will so gladly do my best to clear your character before us all  i didnt i didnt sobbed nat with his head down upon his arms for he could not bear the look of distrust and dislike which he read in the many eyes fixed on him  i hope not mr bhaer paused a minute as if to give the culprit whoever he might be one more chance nobody spoke however and only sniffs of sympathy from some of the little fellows broke the silence mr bhaer shook his head and added regretfully  there is nothing more to be done then and i have but one thing to say i shall not speak of this again and i wish you all to follow my example i cannot expect you to feel as kindly toward any one whom you suspect as before this happened but i do expect and desire that you will not torment the suspected person in any way he will have a hard enough time without that now go to your lessons  father bhaer let nat off too easy muttered ned to emil as they got out their books  hold your tongue growled emil who felt that this event was a blot upon the family honor  many of the boys agreed with ned but mr bhaer was right nevertheless and nat would have been wiser to confess on the spot and have the trouble over for even the hardest whipping he ever received from his father was far easier to bear than the cold looks the avoidance and general suspicion that met him on all sides if ever a boy was sent to coventry and kept there it was poor nat and he suffered a week of slow torture though not a hand was raised against him and hardly a word said  that was the worst of it if they would only have talked it out or even have thrashed him all round he could have stood it better than the silent distrust that made very face so terrible to meet even mrs bhaers showed traces of it though her manner was nearly as kind as ever but the sorrowful anxious look in father bhaers eyes cut nat to the heart for he loved his teacher dearly and knew that he had disappointed all his hopes by this double sin  only one person in the house entirely believed in him and stood up for him stoutly against all the rest this was daisy she could not explain why she trusted him against all appearances she only felt that she could not doubt him and her warm sympathy made her strong to take his part she would not hear a word against him from any one and actually slapped her beloved demi when he tried to convince her that it must have been nat because no one else knew where the money was  maybe the hens ate it they are greedy old things she said and when demi laughed she lost her temper slapped the amazed boy and then burst out crying and ran away still declaring he didnt he didnt he didnt  neither aunt nor uncle tried to shake the childs faith in her friend but only hoped her innocent instinct might prove sure and loved her all the better for it nat often said after it was over that he couldnt have stood it if it had not been for daisy when the others shunned him she clung to him closer than ever and turned her back on the rest she did not sit on the stairs now when he solaced himself with the old fiddle but went in and sat beside him listening with a face so full of confidence and affection that nat forgot disgrace for a time and was happy she asked him to help her with her lessons she cooked him marvelous messes in her kitchen which he ate manfully no matter what they were for gratitude gave a sweet flavor to the most distasteful she proposed impossible games of cricket and ball when she found that he shrank from joining the other boys she put little nosegays from her garden on his desk and tried in every way to show that she was not a fairweather friend but faithful through evil as well as good repute nan soon followed her example in kindness at least curbed her sharp tongue and kept her scornful little nose from any demonstration of doubt or dislike which was good of madame giddygaddy for she firmly believed that nat took the money  most of the boys let him severely alone but dan though he said he despised him for being a coward watched over him with a grim sort of protection and promptly cuffed any lad who dared to molest his mate or make him afraid his idea of friendship was as high as daisys and in his own rough way he lived up to it as loyally  sitting by the brook one afternoon absorbed in the study of the domestic habits of waterspiders he overheard a bit of conversation on the other side of the wall ned who was intensely inquisitive had been on tenterhooks to know certainly who was the culprit for of late one or two of the boys had begun to think that they were wrong nat was so steadfast in his denials and so meek in his endurance of their neglect this doubt had teased ned past bearing and he had several times privately beset nat with questions regardless of mr bhaers express command finding nat reading alone on the shady side of the wall ned could not resist stopping for a nibble at the forbidden subject he had worried nat for some ten minutes before dan arrived and the first words the spiderstudent heard were these in nats patient pleading voice  dont ned oh dont i cant tell you because i dont know and its mean of you to keep nagging at me on the sly when father bhaer told you not to plague me you wouldnt dare to if dan was round  i aint afraid of dan hes nothing but an old bully dont believe but what he took toms money and you know it and wont tell come now  he didnt but if he did i would stand up for him he has always been so good to me said nat so earnestly that dan forgot his spiders and rose quickly to thank him but neds next words arrested him  i know dan did it and gave the money to you shouldnt wonder if he got his living picking pockets before he came here for nobody knows any thing about him but you said ned not believing his own words but hoping to get the truth out of nat by making him angry  he succeeded in a part of his ungenerous wish for nat cried out fiercely  if you say that again ill go and tell mr bhaer all about it i dont want to tell tales but by george i will if you dont let dan alone  then youll be a sneak as well as a liar and a thief began ned with a jeer for nat had borne insult to himself so meekly the other did not believe he would dare to face the master just to stand up for dan  what he might have added i cannot tell for the words were hardly out of his mouth when a long arm from behind took him by the collar and jerking him over the wall in a most promiscuous way landed him with a splash in the middle of the brook  say that again and ill duck you till you cant see cried dan looking like a modern colossus of rhodes as he stood with a foot on either side of the narrow stream glaring down at the discomfited youth in the water  i was only in fun said ned  you are a sneak yourself to badger nat round the corner let me catch you at it again and ill souse you in the river next time get up and clear out thundered dan in a rage  ned fled dripping and his impromptu sitzbath evidently did him good for he was very respectful to both the boys after that and seemed to have left his curiosity in the brook as he vanished dan jumped over the wall and found nat lying as if quite worn out and bowed down with his troubles  he wont pester you again i guess if he does just tell me and ill see to him said dan trying to cool down  i dont mind what he says about me so much ive got used to it answered nat sadly but i hate to have him pitch into you  how do you know he isnt right asked dan turning his face away  what about the money cried nat looking up with a startled air  yes  but i dont believe it you dont care for money all you want is your old bugs and things and nat laughed incredulously  i want a butterfly net as much as you want a fiddle why shouldnt i steal the money for it as much as you said dan still turning away and busily punching holes in the turf with his stick  i dont think you would you like to fight and knock folks round sometimes but you dont lie and i dont believe youd steal and nat shook his head decidedly  ive done both i used to fib like fury its too much trouble now and i stole things to eat out of gardens when i ran away from page so you see i am a bad lot said dan speaking in the rough reckless way which he had been learning to drop lately  o dan dont say its you id rather have it any of the other boys cried nat in such a distressed tone that dan looked pleased and showed that he did by turning round with a queer expression in his face though he only answered  i wont say any thing about it but dont you fret and well pull through somehow see if we dont  something in his face and manner gave nat a new idea and he said pressing his hands together in the eagerness of his appeal  i think you know who did it if you do beg him to tell dan its so hard to have em all hate me for nothing i dont think i can bear it much longer if i had any place to go to id run away though i love plumfield dearly but im not brave and big like you so i must stay and wait till some one shows them that i havent lied  as he spoke nat looked so broken and despairing that dan could not bear it and muttered huskily  you wont wait long and he walked rapidly away and was seen no more for hours  what is the matter with dan asked the boys of one another several times during the sunday that followed a week which seemed as if it would never end dan was often moody but that day he was so sober and silent that no one could get any thing out of him when they walked he strayed away from the rest and came home late he took no part in the evening conversation but sat in the shadow so busy with his own thoughts that he scarcely seemed to hear what was going on when mrs jo showed him an unusually good report in the conscience book he looked at it without a smile and said wistfully  you think i am getting on dont you  excellently dan and i am so pleased because i always thought you only needed a little help to make you a boy to be proud of  he looked up at her with a strange expression in his black eyes an expression of mingled pride and love and sorrow which she could not understand then but remembered afterward  im afraid youll be disappointed but i do try he said shutting the book with no sign of pleasure in the page that he usually liked so much to read over and talk about  are you sick dear asked mrs jo with her hand on his shoulder  my foot aches a little i guess ill go to bed goodnight mother he added and held the hand against his cheek a minute then went away looking as if he had said goodbye to something dear  poor dan he takes nats disgrace to heart sadly he is a strange boy i wonder if i ever shall understand him thoroughly said mrs jo to herself as she thought over dans late improvement with real satisfaction yet felt that there was more in the lad than she had at first suspected  one of things which cut nat most deeply was an act of tommys for after his loss tommy had said to him kindly but firmly  i dont wish to hurt you nat but you see i cant afford to lose my money so i guess we wont be partners any longer and with that tommy rubbed out the sign t bangs  co  nat had been very proud of the co and had hunted eggs industriously kept his accounts all straight and had added a good sum to his income from the sale of his share of stock in trade  o tom must you he said feeling that his good name was gone for ever in the business world if this was done  i must returned tommy firmly emil says that when one man bezzles believe thats the word it means to take money and cut away with it the property of a firm the other one sues him or pitches into him somehow and wont have any thing more to do with him now you have bezzled my property i shant sue you and i shant pitch into you but i must dissolve the partnership because i cant trust you and i dont wish to fail  i cant make you believe me and you wont take my money though id be thankful to give all my dollars if youd only say you dont think i took your money do let me hunt for you i wont ask any wages but do it for nothing i know all the places and i like it pleaded nat  but tommy shook his head and his jolly round face looked suspicious and hard as he said shortly cant do it wish you didnt know the places mind you dont go hunting on the sly and speculate in my eggs  poor nat was so hurt that he could not get over it he felt that he had lost not only his partner and patron but that he was bankrupt in honor and an outlaw from the business community no one trusted his word written or spoken in spite of his efforts to redeem the past falsehood the sign was down the firm broken up and he a ruined man the barn which was the boys wall street knew him no more cockletop and her sisters cackled for him in vain and really seemed to take his misfortune to heart for eggs were fewer and some of the biddies retired in disgust to new nests which tommy could not find  they trust me said nat when he heard of it and though the boys shouted at the idea nat found comfort in it for when one is down in the world the confidence of even a speckled hen is most consoling  tommy took no new partner however for distrust had entered in and poisoned the peace of his once confiding soul ned offered to join him but he declined saying with a sense of justice that did him honor  it might turn out that nat didnt take my money and then we could be partners again i dont think it will happen but i will give him a chance and keep the place open a little longer  billy was the only person whom bangs felt he could trust in his shop and billy was trained to hunt eggs and hand them over unbroken being quite satisfied with an apple or a sugarplum for wages the morning after dans gloomy sunday billy said to his employer as he displayed the results of a long hunt  only two  it gets worse and worse i never saw such provoking old hens growled tommy thinking of the days when he often had six to rejoice over well put em in my hat and give me a new bit of chalk i must mark em up any way  billy mounted a peckmeasure and looked into the top of the machine where tommy kept his writing materials  theres lots of money in here said billy  no there isnt catch me leaving my cash round again returned tommy  i see em one four eight two dollars persisted billy who had not yet mastered the figures correctly  what a jack you are and tommy hopped up to get the chalk for himself but nearly tumbled down again for there actually were four bright quarters in a row with a bit of paper on them directed to tom bangs that there might be no mistake  thunder turtles cried tommy and seizing them he dashed into the house bawling wildly its all right got my money wheres nat  he was soon found and his surprise and pleasure were so genuine that few doubted his word when he now denied all knowledge of the money  how could i put it back when i didnt take it do believe me now and be good to me again he said so imploringly that emil slapped him on the back and declared he would for one  so will i and im jolly glad its not you but who the dickens is it said tommy after shaking hands heartily with nat  never mind as long as its found said dan with his eyes fixed on nats happy face  well i like that im not going to have my things hooked and then brought back like the juggling mans tricks cried tommy looking at his money as if he suspected witchcraft  well find him out somehow though he was sly enough to print this so his writing wouldnt be known said franz examining the paper  demi prints tiptop put in rob who had not a very clear idea what the fuss was all about  you cant make me believe its him not if you talk till you are blue said tommy and the others hooted at the mere idea for the little deacon as they called him was above suspicion  nat felt the difference in the way they spoke of demi and himself and would have given all he had or ever hoped to have to be so trusted for he had learned how easy it is to lose the confidence of others how very very hard to win it back and truth became to him a precious thing since he had suffered from neglecting it  mr bhaer was very glad one step had been taken in the right direction and waited hopefully for yet further revelations they came sooner than he expected and in a way that surprised and grieved him very much as they sat at supper that night a square parcel was handed to mrs bhaer from mrs bates a neighbor a note accompanied the parcel and while mr bhaer read it demi pulled off the wrapper exclaiming as he saw its contents  why its the book uncle teddy gave dan  the devil broke from dan for he had not yet quite cured himself of swearing though he tried very hard  mr bhaer looked up quickly at the sound dan tried to meet his eyes but could not his own fell and he sat biting his lips getting redder and redder till he was the picture of shame  what is it asked mrs bhaer anxiously  i should have preferred to talk about this in private but demi has spoilt that plan so i may as well have it out now said mr bhaer looking a little stern as he always did when any meanness or deceit came up for judgment  the note is from mrs bates and she says that her boy jimmy told her he bought this book of dan last saturday she saw that it was worth much more than a dollar and thinking there was some mistake has sent it to me did you sell it dan  yes sir was the slow answer  why  wanted money  for what  to pay somebody  to whom did you owe it  tommy  never borrowed a cent of me in his life cried tommy looked scared for he guessed what was coming now and felt that on the whole he would have preferred witchcraft for he admired dan immensely  perhaps he took it cried ned who owed dan a grudge for the ducking and being a mortal boy liked to pay it off  o dan cried nat clasping his hands regardless of the bread and butter in them  it is a hard thing to do but i must have this settled for i cannot have you watching each other like detectives and the whole school disturbed in this way did you put that dollar in the barn this morning asked mr bhaer  dan looked him straight in the face and answered steadily yes i did  a murmur went round the table tommy dropped his mug with a crash daisy cried out i knew it wasnt nat nan began to cry and mrs jo left the room looking so disappointed sorry and ashamed that dan could not bear it he hid his face in his hands a moment then threw up his head squared his shoulders as if settling some load upon them and said with the dogged look and halfresolute halfreckless tone he had used when he first came  i did it now you may do what you like to me but i wont say another word about it  not even that you are sorry asked mr bhaer troubled by the change in him  i aint sorry  ill forgive him without asking said tommy feeling that it was harder somehow to see brave dan disgraced than timid nat  dont want to be forgiven returned dan gruffly  perhaps you will when you have thought about it quietly by yourself i wont tell you now how surprised and disappointed i am but by and by i will come up and talk to you in your room  wont make any difference said dan trying to speak defiantly but failing as he looked at mr bhaers sorrowful face and taking his words for a dismissal dan left the room as if he found it impossible to stay  it would have done him good if he had stayed for the boys talked the matter over with such sincere regret and pity and wonder it might have touched and won him to ask pardon no one was glad to find that it was he not even nat for spite of all his faults and they were many every one liked dan now because under his rough exterior lay some of the manly virtues which we most admire and love mrs jo had been the chief prop as well as cultivator of dan and she took it sadly to heart that her last and most interesting boy had turned out so ill the theft was bad but the lying about it and allowing another to suffer so much from an unjust suspicion was worse and most discouraging of all was the attempt to restore the money in an underhand way for it showed not only a want of courage but a power of deceit that boded ill for the future still more trying was his steady refusal to talk of the matter to ask pardon or express any remorse days passed and he went about his lessons and his work silent grim and unrepentant as if taking warning by their treatment of nat he asked no sympathy of any one rejected the advances of the boys and spent his leisure hours roaming about the fields and woods trying to find playmates in the birds and beasts and succeeding better than most boys would have done because he knew and loved them so well  if this goes on much longer im afraid he will run away again for he is too young to stand a life like this said mr bhaer quite dejected at the failure of all his efforts  a little while ago i should have been quite sure that nothing would tempt him away but now i am ready of any thing he is so changed answered poor mrs jo who mourned over her boy and could not be comforted because he shunned her more than any one else and only looked at her with the halffierce halfimploring eyes of a wild animal caught in a trap when she tried to talk to him alone  nat followed him about like a shadow and dan did not repulse him as rudely as he did others but said in his blunt way you are all right dont worry about me i can stand it better than you did  but i dont like to have you all alone nat would say sorrowfully  i like it and dan would tramp away stifling a sigh sometimes for he was lonely  passing through the birch grove one day he came up on several of the boys who were amusing themselves by climbing up the trees and swinging down again as they slender elastic stems bent till their tops touched the ground dan paused a minute to watch the fun without offering to join in it and as he stood there jack took his turn he had unfortunately chosen too large a tree for when he swung off it only bent a little way and left him hanging at a dangerous height  go back you cant do it called ned from below  jack tried but the twigs slipped from his hands and he could not get his legs round the trunk he kicked and squirmed and clutched in vain then gave it up and hung breathless saying helplessly  catch me help me i must drop  youll be killed if you do cried ned frightened out of his wits  hold on shouted dan and up the tree he went crashing his way along till he nearly reached jack whose face looked up at him full of fear and hope  youll both come down said ned dancing with excitement on the slope underneath while nat held out his arms in the wild hope of breaking the fall  thats what i want stand from under answered dan coolly and as he spoke his added weight bent the tree many feet nearer the earth  jack dropped safely but the birch lightened of half its load flew up again so suddenly that dan in the act of swinging round to drop feet foremost lost his hold and fell heavily  im not hurt all right in a minute he said sitting up a little pale and dizzy as the boys gathered round him full of admiration and alarm  youre a trump dan and im ever so much obliged to you cried jack gratefully  it wasnt any thing muttered dan rising slowly  i say it was and ill shake hands with you though you are ned checked the unlucky word on his tongue and held out his hand feeling that it was a handsome thing on his part  but i wont shake hands with a sneak and dan turned his back with a look of scorn that caused ned to remember the brook and retire with undignified haste  come home old chap ill give you a lift and nat walked away with him leaving the others to talk over the feat together to wonder when dan would come round and to wish one and all that tommys confounded money had been in jericho before it made such a fuss  when mr bhaer came into school next morning he looked so happy that the boys wondered what had happened to him and really thought he had lost his mind when they saw him go straight to dan and taking him by both hands say all in one breath as he shook them heartily  i know all about it and i beg your pardon it was like you to do it and i love you for it though its never right to tell lies even for a friend  what is it cried nat for dan said not a word only lifted up his head as if a weight of some sort had fallen off his back  dan did not take tommys money and mr bhaer quite shouted it he was so glad  who did cried the boys in a chorus  mr bhaer pointed to one empty seat and every eye followed his finger yet no one spoke for a minute they were so surprised  jack went home early this morning but he left this behind him and in the silence mr bhaer read the note which he had found tied to his doorhandle when he rose  i took tommys dollar i was peeking in through a crack and saw him put it there i was afraid to tell before though i wanted to i didnt care so much about nat but dan is a trump and i cant stand it any longer i never spent the money its under the carpet in my room right behind the washstand im awful sorry i am going home and dont think i shall ever come back so dan may have my things  jack  it was not an elegant confession being badly written much blotted and very short but it was a precious paper to dan and when mr bhaer paused the boy went to him saying in a rather broken voice but with clear eyes and the frank respectful manner they had tried to teach him  ill say im sorry now and ask you to forgive me sir  it was a kind lie dan and i cant help forgiving it but you see it did no good said mr bhaer with a hand on either shoulder and a face full of relief and affection  it kept the boys from plaguing nat thats what i did it for it made him right down miserable i didnt care so much explained dan as if glad to speak out after his hard silence  how could you do it you are always so kind to me faltered nat feeling a strong desire to hug his friend and cry two girlish performances which would have scandalized dan to the last degree  its all right now old fellow so dont be a fool he said swallowing the lump in his throat and laughing out as he had not done for weeks does mrs bhaer know he asked eagerly  yes and she is so happy i dont know what she will do to you began mr bhaer but got no farther for here the boys came crowding about dan in a tumult of pleasure and curiosity but before he had answered more than a dozen questions a voice cried out  three cheers for dan and there was mrs jo in the doorway waving her dishtowel and looking as if she wanted to dance a jig for joy as she used to do when a girl  now then cried mr bhaer and led off a rousing hurrah which startled asia in the kitchen and made old mr roberts shake his head as he drove by saying  schools are not what they were when i was young  dan stood it pretty well for a minute but the sight of mrs jos delight upset him and he suddenly bolted across the hall into the parlor whither she instantly followed and neither were seen for half an hour  mr bhaer found it very difficult to calm his excited flock and seeing that lessons were an impossibility for a time he caught their attention by telling them the fine old story of the friends whose fidelity to one another has made their names immortal the lads listened and remembered for just then their hearts were touched by the loyalty of a humbler pair of friends the lie was wrong but the love that prompted it and the courage that bore in silence the disgrace which belonged to another made dan a hero in their eyes honesty and honor had a new meaning now a good name was more precious than gold for once lost money could not buy it back and faith in one another made life smooth and happy as nothing else could do  tommy proudly restored the name of the firm nat was devoted to dan and all the boys tried to atone to both for former suspicion and neglect mrs jo rejoiced over her flock and mr bhaer was never tired of telling the story of his young damon and pythias    chapter xv in the willow  the old tree saw and heard a good many little scenes and confidences that summer because it became the favorite retreat of all the children and the willow seemed to enjoy it for a pleasant welcome always met them and the quiet hours spent in its arms did them all good it had a great deal of company one saturday afternoon and some little bird reported what went on there  first came nan and daisy with their small tubs and bits of soap for now and then they were seized with a tidy fit and washed up all their dolls clothes in the brook asia would not have them slopping round in her kitchen and the bathroom was forbidden since nan forgot to turn off the water till it overflowed and came gently dripping down through the ceiling daisy went systematically to work washing first the white and then the colored things rinsing them nicely and hanging them to dry on a cord fastened from one barberrybush to another and pinning them up with a set of tiny clothespins ned had turned for her but nan put all her little things to soak in the same tub and then forgot them while she collected thistledown to stuff a pillow for semiramis queen of babylon as one doll was named this took some time and when mrs giddygaddy came to take out her clothes deep green stains appeared on every thing for she had forgotten the green silk lining of a certain cape and its color had soaked nicely into the pink and blue gowns the little chemises and even the best ruffled petticoat  oh me what a mess sighed nan  lay them on the grass to bleach said daisy with an air of experience  so i will and we can sit up in the nest and watch that they dont blow away  the queen of babylons wardrobe was spread forth upon the bank and turning up their tubs to dry the little washerwomen climbed into the nest and fell to talking as ladies are apt to do in the pauses of domestic labor  im going to have a featherbed to go with my new pillow said mrs giddygaddy as she transferred the thistledown from her pocket to her handkerchief losing about half in the process  i wouldnt aunt jo says featherbeds arent healthy i never let my children sleep on any thing but a mattress returned mrs shakespeare smith decidedly  i dont care my children are so strong they often sleep on the floor and dont mind it which was quite true i cant afford nine mattresses and i like to make beds myself  wont tommy charge for the feathers  may be he will but i shant pay him and he wont care returned mrs g taking a base advantage of the wellknown good nature of t bangs  i think the pink will fade out of that dress sooner than the green mark will observed mrs s looking down from her perch and changing the subject for she and her gossip differed on many points and mrs smith was a discreet lady  never mind im tired of dolls and i guess i shall put them all away and attend to my farm i like it rather better than playing house said mrs g unconsciously expressing the desire of many older ladies who cannot dispose of their families so easily however  but you mustnt leave them they will die without their mother cried the tender mrs smith  let em die then im tired of fussing over babies and im going to play with the boys they need me to see to em returned the strongminded lady  daisy knew nothing about womens rights she quietly took all she wanted and no one denied her claim because she did not undertake what she could not carry out but unconsciously used the allpowerful right of her own influence to win from others any privilege for which she had proved her fitness nan attempted all sorts of things undaunted by direful failures and clamored fiercely to be allowed to do every thing that the boys did they laughed at her hustled her out of the way and protested against her meddling with their affairs but she would not be quenched and she would be heard for her will was strong and she had the spirit of a rampant reformer mrs bhaer sympathized with her but tired to curb her frantic desire for entire liberty showing her that she must wait a little learn selfcontrol and be ready to use her freedom before she asked for it nan had meek moments when she agreed to this and the influences at work upon her were gradually taking effect she no longer declared that she would be enginedriver or a blacksmith but turned her mind to farming and found in it a vent for the energy bottled up in her active little body it did not quite satisfy her however for her sage and sweet marjoram were dumb things and could not thank her for her care she wanted something human to love work for and protect and was never happier than when the little boys brought their cut fingers bumped heads or bruised joints for her to mendup seeing this mrs jo proposed that she should learn how to do it nicely and nursey had an apt pupil in bandaging plastering and fomenting the boys began to call her dr giddygaddy and she liked it so well that mrs jo one day said to the professor  fritz i see what we can do for that child she wants something to live for even now and will be one of the sharp strong discontented women if she does not have it dont let us snub her restless little nature but do our best to give her the work she likes and by and by persuade her father to let her study medicine she will make a capital doctor for she has courage strong nerves a tender heart and an intense love and pity for the weak and suffering  mr bhaer smiled at first but agreed to try and gave nan an herbgarden teaching her the various healing properties of the plants she tended and letting her try their virtues on the children in the little illnesses they had from time to time she learned fast remembered well and showed a sense and interest most encouraging to her professor who did not shut his door in her face because she was a little woman  she was thinking of this as she sat in the willow that day and when daisy said in her gentle way  i love to keep house and mean to have a nice one for demi when we grow up and live together  nan replied with decision  well i havent got any brother and i dont want any house to fuss over i shall have an office with lots of bottles and drawers and pestle things in it and i shall drive round in a horse and chaise and cure sick people that will be such fun  ugh how can you bear the badsmelling stuff and the nasty little powders and castoroil and senna and hive syrup cried daisy with a shudder  i shant have to take any so i dont care besides they make people well and i like to cure folks didnt my sagetea make mother bhaers headache go away and my hops stop neds toothache in five hours so now  shall you put leeches on people and cut off legs and pull out teeth asked daisy quaking at the thought  yes i shall do every thing i dont care if the people are all smashed up i shall mend them my grandpa was a doctor and i saw him sew a great cut in a mans cheek and i held the sponge and wasnt frightened a bit and grandpa said i was a brave girl  how could you im sorry for sick people and i like to nurse them but it makes my legs shake so i have to run away im not a brave girl sighed daisy  well you can be my nurse and cuddle my patients when i have given them the physic and cut off their legs said nan whose practice was evidently to be of the heroic kind  ship ahoy where are you nan called a voice from below  here we are  ay ay said the voice and emil appeared holding one hand in the other with his face puckered up as if in pain  oh whats the matter cried daisy anxiously  a confounded splinter in my thumb cant get it out take a pick at it will you nanny  its in very deep and i havent any needle said nan examining a tarry thumb with interest  take a pin said emil in a hurry  no its too big and hasnt got a sharp point  here daisy who had dived into her pocket presented a neat little housewife with four needles in it  you are the posy who always has what we want said emil and nan resolved to have a needlebook in her own pocket henceforth for just such cases as this were always occurring in her practice  daisy covered her eyes but nan probed and picked with a steady hand while emil gave directions not down in any medical work or record  starboard now steady boys steady try another tack heave ho there she is  suck it ordered the doctor surveying the splinter with an experienced eye  too dirty responded the patient shaking his bleeding hand  wait ill tie it up if you have got a handkerchief  havent take one of those rags down there  gracious no indeed they are dolls clothes cried daisy indignantly  take one of mine id like to have you said nan and swinging himself down emil caught up the first rag he saw it happened to be the frilled skirt but nan tore it up without a murmur and when the royal petticoat was turned into a neat little bandage she dismissed her patient with the command  keep it wet and let it alone then it will heal right up and not be sore  what do you charge asked the commodore laughing  nothing i keep a spensary that is a place where poor people are doctored free gratis for nothing explained nan with an air  thank you doctor giddygaddy ill always call you in when i come to grief and emil departed but looked back to say for one good turn deserves another your duds are blowing away doctor  forgiving the disrespectful word duds the ladies hastily descended and gathering up their wash retired to the house to fire up the little stove and go to ironing  a passing breath of air shook the old willow as if it laughed softly at the childish chatter which went on in the nest and it had hardly composed itself when another pair of birds alighted for a confidential twitter  now ill tell you the secret began tommy who was swellin wisibly with the importance of his news  tell away answered nat wishing he had brought his fiddle it was so shady and quiet here  well we fellows were talking over the late interesting case of circumstantial evidence said tommy quoting at random from a speech franz had made at the club and i proposed giving dan something to make up for our suspecting him to show our respect and so on you know something handsome and useful that he could keep always and be proud of what do you think we chose  a butterflynet he wants one ever so much said nat looking a little disappointed for he meant to get it himself  no sir its to be a microscope a real swell one that we see whatdoyoucallems in water with and stars and anteggs and all sorts of games you know wont it be a jolly good present said tommy rather confusing microscopes and telescopes in his remarks  tiptop im so glad wont it cost a heap though cried nat feeling that his friend was beginning to be appreciated  of course it will but we are all going to give something i headed the paper with my five dollars for if it is done at all it must be done handsome  what all of it i never did see such a generous chap as you are and nat beamed upon him with sincere admiration  well you see ive been so bothered with my property that im tired of it and dont mean to save up any more but give it away as i go along and then nobody will envy me or want to steal it and i shant be suspecting folks and worrying about my old cash replied tommy on whom the cares and anxieties of a millionaire weighed heavily  will mr bhaer let you do it  he thought it was a firstrate plan and said that some of the best men he knew preferred to do good with their money instead of laying it up to be squabbled over when they died  your father is rich does he do that way  im not sure he gives me all i want i know that much im going to talk to him about it when i go home anyhow i shall set him a good example and tommy was so serious that nat did not dare to laugh but said respectfully  you will be able to do ever so much with your money wont you  so mr bhaer said and he promised to advise me about useful ways of spending it im going to begin with dan and next time i get a dollar or so i shall do something for dick hes such a good little chap and only has a cent a week for pocketmoney he cant earn much you know so im going to kind of see to him and goodhearted tommy quite longed to begin  i think thats a beautiful plan and im not going to try to buy a fiddle any more im going to get dan his net all myself and if there is any money left ill do something to please poor billy hes fond of me and though he isnt poor hed like some little thing from me because i can make out what he wants better than the rest of you and nat fell to wondering how much happiness could be got out of his precious three dollars  so i would now come and ask mr bhaer if you cant go in town with me on monday afternoon so you can get the net while i get the microscope franz and emil are going too and well have a jolly time larking round among the shops  the lads walked away arminarm discussing the new plans with droll importance yet beginning already to feel the sweet satisfaction which comes to those who try no matter how humbly to be earthly providences to the poor and helpless and gild their mite with the gold of charity before it is laid up where thieves cannot break through and steal  come up and rest while we sort the leaves its so cool and pleasant here said demi as he and dan came sauntering home from a long walk in the woods  all right answered dan who was a boy of few words and up they went  what makes birch leaves shake so much more than the others asked inquiring demi who was always sure of an answer from dan  they are hung differently dont you see the stem where it joins the leaf is sort of pinched one way and where it joins the twig it is pinched another this makes it waggle with the least bit of wind but the elm leaves hang straight and keep stiller  how curious will this do so and demi held up a sprig of acacia which he had broken from a little tree on the lawn because it was so pretty  no that belongs to the sort that shuts up when you touch it draw your finger down the middle of the stem and see if the leaves dont curl up said dan who was examining a bit of mica  demi tried it and presently the little leaves did fold together till the spray showed a single instead of a double line of leaves  i like that tell me about the others what do these do asked demi taking up a new branch  feed silkworms they live on mulberry leaves till they begin to spin themselves up i was in a silkfactory once and there were rooms full of shelves all covered with leaves and worms eating them so fast that it made a rustle sometimes they eat so much they die tell that to stuffy and dan laughed as he took up another bit of rock with a lichen on it  i know one thing about this mullein leaf the fairies use them for blankets said demi who had not quite given up his faith in the existence of the little folk in green  if i had a microscope id show you something prettier than fairies said dan wondering if he should ever own that coveted treasure i knew an old woman who used mullein leaves for a nightcap because she had faceache she sewed them together and wore it all the time  how funny was she your grandmother  never had any she was a queer old woman and lived alone in a little tumbledown house with nineteen cats folks called her a witch but she wasnt though she looked like an old ragbag she was real kind to me when i lived in that place and used to let me get warm at her fire when the folks at the poorhouse were hard on me  did you live in a poorhouse  a little while never mind that i didnt mean to speak of it and dan stopped short in his unusual fit of communicativeness  tell about the cats please said demi feeling that he had asked an unpleasant question and sorry for it  nothing to tell only she had a lot of em and kept em in a barrel nights and i used to go and tip over the barrel sometimes and let em out all over the house and then shed scold and chase em and put em in again spitting and yowling like fury  was she good to them asked demi with a hearty childs laugh pleasant to hear  guess she was poor old soul she took in all the lost and sick cats in the town and when anybody wanted one they went to marm webber and she let em pick any kind and color they wanted and only asked ninepence she was glad to have her pussies get a good home  i should like to see marm webber could i if i went to that place  shes dead all my folks are said dan briefly  im sorry and demi sat silent a minute wondering what subject would be safe to try next he felt delicate about speaking of the departed lady but was very curious about the cats and could not resist asking softly  did she cure the sick ones  sometimes one had a broken leg and she tied it up to a stick and it got well and another had fits and she doctored it with yarbs till it was cured but some of em died and she buried em and when they couldnt get well she killed em easy  how asked demi feeling that there was a peculiar charm about this old woman and some sort of joke about the cats because dan was smiling to himself  a kind lady who was fond of cats told her how and gave her some stuff and sent all her own pussies to be killed that way marm used to put a sponge wet with ether in the bottom of an old boot then poke puss in head downwards the ether put her to sleep in a jiffy and she was drowned in warm water before she woke up  i hope the cats didnt feel it i shall tell daisy about that you have known a great many interesting things havent you asked demi and fell to meditating on the vast experience of a boy who had run away more than once and taken care of himself in a big city  wish i hadnt sometimes  why dont remembering them feel good  no  its very singular how hard it is to manage your mind said demi clasping his hands round his knees and looking up at the sky as if for information upon his favorite topic  devilish hard no i dont mean that and dan bit his lips for the forbidden word slipped out in spite of him and he wanted to be more careful with demi than with any of the other boys  ill play i didnt hear it said demi and you wont do it again im sure  not if i can help it thats one of the things i dont want to remember i keep pegging away but it dont seem to do much good and dan looked discouraged  yes it does you dont say half so many bad words as you used to and aunt jo is pleased because she said it was a hard habit to break up  did she and dan cheered up a bit  you must put swearing away in your faultdrawer and lock it up thats the way i do with my badness  what do you mean asked dan looking as if he found demi almost as amusing as a new sort of cockchafer or beetle  well its one of my private plays and ill tell you but i think youll laugh at it began demi glad to hold forth on this congenial subject i play that my mind is a round room and my soul is a little sort of creature with wings that lives in it the walls are full of shelves and drawers and in them i keep my thoughts and my goodness and badness and all sorts of things the goods i keep where i can see them and the bads i lock up tight but they get out and i have to keep putting them in and squeezing them down they are so strong the thoughts i play with when i am alone or in bed and i make up and do what i like with them every sunday i put my room in order and talk with the little spirit that lives there and tell him what to do he is very bad sometimes and wont mind me and i have to scold him and take him to grandpa he always makes him behave and be sorry for his faults because grandpa likes this play and gives me nice things to put in the drawers and tells me how to shut up the naughties hadnt you better try that way its a very good one and demi looked so earnest and full of faith that dan did not laugh at his quaint fancy but said soberly  i dont think there is a lock strong enough to keep my badness shut up any way my room is in such a clutter i dont know how to clear it up  you keep your drawers in the cabinet all spandy nice why cant you do the others  i aint used to it will you show me how and dan looked as if inclined to try demis childish way of keeping a soul in order  id love to but i dont know how except to talk as grandpa does i cant do it good like him but ill try  dont tell any one only now and then well come here and talk things over and ill pay you for it by telling all i know about my sort of things will that do and dan held out his big rough hand  demi gave his smooth little hand readily and the league was made for in the happy peaceful world where the younger boy lived lions and lambs played together and little children innocently taught their elders  hush said dan pointing toward the house as demi was about to indulge in another discourse on the best way of getting badness down and keeping it down and peeping from their perch they saw mrs jo strolling slowly along reading as she went while teddy trotted behind her dragging a little cart upside down  wait till they see us whispered demi and both sat still as the pair came nearer mrs jo so absorbed in her book that she would have walked into the brook if teddy had not stopped her by saying  marmar i wanter fis  mrs jo put down the charming book which she had been trying to read for a week and looked about her for a fishingpole being used to making toys out of nothing before she had broken one from the hedge a slender willow bough fell at her feet and looking up she saw the boys laughing in the nest  up up cried teddy stretching his arms and flapping his skirts as if about to fly  ill come down and you come up i must go to daisy now and demi departed to rehearse the tale of the nineteen cats with the exciting bootandbarrel episodes  teddy was speedily whisked up and then dan said laughing come too theres plenty of room ill lend you a hand  mrs jo glanced over her shoulder but no one was in sight and rather liking the joke of the thing she laughed back saying well if you wont mention it i think i will and with two nimble steps was in the willow  i havent climbed a tree since i was married i used to be very fond of it when i was a girl she said looking wellpleased with her shady perch  now you read if you want to and ill take care of teddy proposed dan beginning to make a fishingrod for impatient baby  i dont think i care about it now what were you and demi at up here asked mrs jo thinking from the sober look on dans face that he had something on his mind  oh we were talking id been telling him about leaves and things and he was telling me some of his queer plays now then major fish away and dan finished off his work by putting a big blue fly on the bent pin which hung at the end of the cord he had tied to the willowrod  teddy leaned down from the tree and was soon wrapt up in watching for the fish which he felt sure would come dan held him by his little petticoats lest he should take a header into the brook and mrs jo soon won him to talk by doing so herself  i am so glad you told demi about leaves and things it is just what he needs and i wish you would teach him and take him to walk with you  id like to he is so bright but  but what  i didnt think youd trust me  why not  well demi is so kind of precious and so good and im such a bad lot i thought youd keep him away from me  but you are not a bad lot as you say and i do trust you dan entirely because you honestly try to improve and do better and better every week  really and dan looked up at her with the cloud of despondency lifting from his face  yes dont you feel it  i hoped so but i didnt know  i have been waiting and watching quietly for i thought id give you a good trial first and if you stood it i would give you the best reward i had you have stood it well and now im going to trust not only demi but my own boy to you because you can teach them some things better than any of us  can i and dan looked amazed at the idea  demi has lived among older people so much that he needs just what you have knowledge of common things strength and courage he thinks you are the bravest boy he ever saw and admires your strong way of doing things then you know a great deal about natural objects and can tell him more wonderful tales of birds and bees and leaves and animals than his storybooks give him and being true these stories will teach and do him good dont you see now how much you can help him and why i like to have him with you  but i swear sometimes and might tell him something wrong i wouldnt mean to but it might slip out just as devil did a few minutes ago said dan anxious to do his duty and let her know his shortcomings  i know you try not to say or do any thing to harm the little fellow and here is where i think demi will help you because he is so innocent and wise in his small way and has what i am trying to give you dear good principles it is never too early to try and plant them in a child and never too late to cultivate them in the most neglected person you are only boys yet you can teach one another demi will unconsciously strengthen your moral sense you will strengthen his common sense and i shall feel as if i had helped you both  words could not express how pleased and touched dan was by this confidence and praise no one had ever trusted him before no one had cared to find out and foster the good in him and no one had suspected how much there was hidden away in the breast of the neglected boy going fast to ruin yet quick to feel and value sympathy and help no honor that he might earn hereafter would ever be half so precious as the right to teach his few virtues and small store of learning to the child whom he most respected and no more powerful restraint could have been imposed upon him than the innocent companion confided to his care he found courage now to tell mrs jo of the plan already made with demi and she was glad that the first step had been so naturally taken every thing seemed to be working well for dan and she rejoiced over him because it had seemed a hard task yet working on with a firm belief in the possibility of reformation in far older and worse subjects than he there had come this quick and hopeful change to encourage her he felt that he had friends now and a place in the world something to live and work for and though he said little all that was best and bravest in a character made old by a hard experience responded to the love and faith bestowed on him and dans salvation was assured  their quiet talk was interrupted by a shout of delight from teddy who to the surprise of every one did actually catch a trout where no trout had been seen for years he was so enchanted with his splendid success that he insisted on showing his prize to the family before asia cooked it for supper so the three descended and went happily away together all satisfied with the work of that half hour  ned was the next visitor to the tree but he only made a short stay sitting there at his ease while dick and dolly caught a pailful of grasshoppers and crickets for him he wanted to play a joke on tommy and intended to tuck up a few dozen of the lively creatures in his bed so that when bangs got in he would speedily tumble out again and pass a portion of the night in chasing hoppergrasses round the room the hunt was soon over and having paid the hunters with a few peppermints apiece ned retired to make tommys bed  for an hour the old willow sighed and sung to itself talked with the brook and watched the lengthening shadows as the sun went down the first rosy color was touching its graceful branches when a boy came stealing up the avenue across the lawn and spying billy by the brookside went to him saying in a mysterious tone  go and tell mr bhaer i want to see him down here please dont let any one hear  billy nodded and ran off while the boy swung himself up into the tree and sat there looking anxious yet evidently feeling the charm of the place and hour in five minutes mr bhaer appeared and stepping up on the fence leaned into the nest saying kindly  i am glad to see you jack but why not come in and meet us all at once  i wanted to see you first please sir uncle made me come back i know i dont deserve any thing but i hope the fellows wont be hard upon me  poor jack did not get on very well but it was evident that he was sorry and ashamed and wanted to be received as easily as possible for his uncle had thrashed him well and scolded him soundly for following the example he himself set jack had begged not to be sent back but the school was cheap and mr ford insisted so the boy returned as quietly as possible and took refuge behind mr bhaer  i hope not but i cant answer for them though i will see that they are not unjust i think as dan and nat have suffered so much being innocent you should suffer something being guilty dont you asked mr bhaer pitying jack yet feeling he deserved punishment for a fault which had so little excuse  i suppose so but i sent tommys money back and i said i was sorry isnt that enough said jack rather sullenly for the boy who could do so mean a thing was not brave enough to bear the consequences well  no i think you should ask pardon of all three boys openly and honestly you cannot expect them to respect and trust you for a time but you can live down this disgrace if you try and i will help you stealing and lying are detestable sins and i hope this will be a lesson to you i am glad you are ashamed it is a good sign bear it patiently and do your best to earn a better reputation  ill have an auction and sell off all my goods dirt cheap said jack showing his repentance in the most characteristic way  i think it would be better to give them away and begin on a new foundation take honesty is the best policy for your motto and live up to it in act and word and thought and though you dont make a cent of money this summer you will be a rich boy in the autumn said mr bhaer earnestly  it was hard but jack consented for he really felt that cheating didnt pay and wanted to win back the friendship of the boys his heart clung to his possessions and he groaned inwardly at the thought of actually giving away certain precious things asking pardon publicly was easy compared to this but then he began to discover that certain other things invisible but most valuable were better property than knives fishhooks or even money itself so he decided to buy up a little integrity even at a high price and secure the respect of his playmates though it was not a salable article  well ill do it he said with a sudden air of resolution which pleased mr bhaer  good and ill stand by you now come and begin at once  and father bhaer led the bankrupt boy back into the little world which received him coldly at first but slowly warmed to him when he showed that he had profited by the lesson and was sincerely anxious to go into a better business with a new stockintrade    chapter xvi taming the colt  what in the world is that boy doing said mrs jo to herself as she watched dan running round the halfmile triangle as if for a wager he was all alone and seemed possessed by some strange desire to run himself into a fever or break his neck for after several rounds he tried leaping walls and turning somersaults up the avenue and finally dropped down on the grass before the door as if exhausted  are you training for a race dan asked mrs jo from the window where she sat  he looked up quickly and stopped panting to answer with a laugh  no im only working off my steam  cant you find a cooler way of doing it you will be ill if you tear about so in such warm weather said mrs jo laughing also as she threw him out a great palmleaf fan  cant help it i must run somewhere answered dan with such an odd expression in his restless eyes that mrs jo was troubled and asked quickly  is plumfield getting too narrow for you  i wouldnt mind if it was a little bigger i like it though only the fact is the devil gets into me sometimes and then i do want to bolt  the words seemed to come against his will for he looked sorry the minute they were spoken and seemed to think he deserved a reproof for his ingratitude but mrs jo understood the feeling and though sorry to see it she could not blame the boy for confessing it she looked at him anxiously seeing how tall and strong he had grown how full of energy his face was with its eager eyes and resolute mouth and remembering the utter freedom he had known for years before she felt how even the gentle restraint of this home would weigh upon him at times when the old lawless spirit stirred in him yes she said to herself my wild hawk needs a larger cage and yet if i let him go i am afraid he will be lost i must try and find some lure strong enough to keep him safe  i know all about it she added aloud it is not the devil as you call it but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty i used to feel just so and once i really did think for a minute that i would bolt  why didnt you said dan coming to lean on the low windowledge with an evident desire to continue the subject  i knew it was foolish and love for my mother kept me at home  i havent got any mother began dan  i thought you had now said mrs jo gently stroking the rough hair off his hot forehead  you are no end good to me and i cant ever thank you enough but it just isnt the same is it and dan looked up at her with a wistful hungry look that went to her heart  no dear it is not the same and never can be i think an own mother would have been a great deal to you but as that cannot be you must try to let me fill her place i fear i have not done all i ought or you would not want to leave me she added sorrowfully  yes you have cried dan eagerly i dont want to go and i wont go if i can help it but every now and then i feel as if i must burst out somehow i want to run straight ahead somewhere to smash something or pitch into somebody dont know why but i do and thats all about it  dan laughed as he spoke but he meant what he said for he knit his black brows and brought down his fist on the ledge with such force that mrs jos thimble flew off into the grass he brought it back and as she took it she held the big brown hand a minute saying with a look that showed the words cost her something  well dan run if you must but dont run very far and come back to me soon for i want you very much  he was rather taken aback by this unexpected permission to play truant and somehow it seemed to lessen his desire to go he did not understand why but mrs jo did and knowing the natural perversity of the human mind counted on it to help her now she felt instinctively that the more the boy was restrained the more he would fret against it but leave him free and the mere sense of liberty would content him joined to the knowledge that his presence was dear to those whom he loved best it was a little experiment but it succeeded for dan stood silent a moment unconsciously picking the fan to pieces and turning the matter over in his mind he felt that she appealed to his heart and his honor and owned that he understood it by saying presently with a mixture of regret and resolution in his face  i wont go yet awhile and ill give you fair warning before i bolt thats fair isnt it  yes we will let it stand so now i want to see if i cant find some way for you to work off your steam better than running about the place like a mad dog spoiling my fans or fighting with the boys what can we invent and while dan tried to repair the mischief he had done mrs jo racked her brain for some new device to keep her truant safe until he had learned to love his lessons better  how would you like to be my expressman she said as a sudden thought popped into her head  go into town and do the errands asked dan looking interested at once  yes franz is tired of it silas cannot be spared just now and mr bhaer has no time old andy is a safe horse you are a good driver and know your way about the city as well as a postman suppose you try it and see if it wont do most as well to drive away two or three times a week as to run away once a month  id like it ever so much only i must go alone and do it all myself i dont want any of the other fellows bothering round said dan taking to the new idea so kindly that he began to put on business airs already  if mr bhaer does not object you shall have it all your own way i suppose emil will growl but he cannot be trusted with horses and you can by the way tomorrow is marketday and i must make out my list you had better see that the wagon is in order and tell silas to have the fruit and vegetables ready for mother you will have to be up early and get back in time for school can you do that  im always an early bird so i dont mind and dan slung on his jacket with despatch  the early bird got the worm this time im sure said mrs jo merrily  and a jolly good worm it is answered dan as he went laughing away to put a new lash to the whip wash the wagon and order silas about with all the importance of a young expressman  before he is tired of this i will find something else and have it ready when the next restless fit comes on said mrs jo to herself as she wrote her list with a deep sense of gratitude that all her boys were not dans  mr bhaer did not entirely approve of the new plan but agreed to give it a trial which put dan on his mettle and caused him to give up certain wild plans of his own in which the new lash and the long hill were to have borne a part he was up and away very early the next morning heroically resisting the temptation to race with the milkmen going into town once there he did his errands carefully to mr bhaers surprise and mrs jos great satisfaction the commodore did growl at dans promotion but was pacified by a superior padlock to his new boathouse and the thought that seamen were meant for higher honors than driving marketwagons and doing family errands so dan filled his new office well and contentedly for weeks and said no more about bolting but one day mr bhaer found him pummelling jack who was roaring for mercy under his knee  why dan i thought you had given up fighting he said as he went to the rescue  we aint fighting we are only wrestling answered dan leaving off reluctantly  it looks very much like it and feels like it hey jack said mr bhaer as the defeated gentleman got upon his legs with difficulty  catch me wrestling with him again hes most knocked my head off snarled jack holding on to that portion of his frame as if it really was loose upon his shoulders  the fact is we began in fun but when i got him down i couldnt help pounding him sorry i hurt you old fellow explained dan looking rather ashamed of himself  i understand the longing to pitch into somebody was so strong you couldnt resist you are a sort of berserker dan and something to tussle with is as necessary to you as music is to nat said mr bhaer who knew all about the conversation between the boy and mrs jo  cant help it so if you dont want to be pounded youd better keep out of the way answered dan with a warning look in his black eyes that made jack sheer off in haste  if you want something to wrestle with i will give you a tougher specimen than jack said mr bhaer and leading the way to the woodyard he pointed out certain roots of trees that had been grubbed up in the spring and had been lying there waiting to be split  there when you feel inclined to maltreat the boys just come and work off your energies here and ill thank you for it  so i will and seizing the axe that lay near dan hauled out a tough root and went at it so vigorously that the chips flew far and wide and mr bhaer fled for his life  to his great amusement dan took him at his word and was often seen wrestling with the ungainly knots hat and jacket off red face and wrathful eyes for he got into royal rages over some of his adversaries and swore at them under his breath till he had conquered them when he exulted and marched off to the shed with an armful of gnarled oakwood in triumph he blistered his hands tired his back and dulled the axe but it did him good and he got more comfort out of the ugly roots than any one dreamed for with each blow he worked off some of the pentup power that would otherwise have been expended in some less harmless way  when this is gone i really dont know what i shall do said mrs jo to herself for no inspiration came and she was at the end of her resources  but dan found a new occupation for himself and enjoyed it some time before any one discovered the cause of his contentment a fine young horse of mr lauries was kept at plumfield that summer running loose in a large pasture across the brook the boys were all interested in the handsome spirited creature and for a time were fond of watching him gallop and frisk with his plumey tail flying and his handsome head in the air but they soon got tired of it and left prince charlie to himself all but dan he never tired of looking at the horse and seldom failed to visit him each day with a lump of sugar a bit of bread or an apple to make him welcome charlie was grateful accepted his friendship and the two loved one another as if they felt some tie between them inexplicable but strong in whatever part of the wide field he might be charlie always came at full speed when dan whistled at the bars and the boy was never happier than when the beautiful fleet creature put its head on his shoulder looking up at him with fine eyes full of intelligent affection  we understand one another without any palaver dont we old fellow dan would say proud of the horses confidence and so jealous of his regard that he told no one how well the friendship prospered and never asked anybody but teddy to accompany him on these daily visits  mr laurie came now and then to see how charlie got on and spoke of having him broken to harness in the autumn  he wont need much taming he is such a gentle finetempered brute i shall come out and try him with a saddle myself some day he said on one of these visits  he lets me put a halter on him but i dont believe he will bear a saddle even if you put it on answered dan who never failed to be present when charlie and his master met  i shall coax him to bear it and not mind a few tumbles at first he has never been harshly treated so though he will be surprised at the new performance i think he wont be frightened and his antics will do no harm  i wonder what he would do said dan to himself as mr laurie went away with the professor and charlie returned to the bars from which he had retired when the gentlemen came up  a daring fancy to try the experiment took possession of the boy as he sat on the topmost rail with the glossy back temptingly near him never thinking of danger he obeyed the impulse and while charlie unsuspectingly nibbled at the apple he held dan quickly and quietly took his seat he did not keep it long however for with an astonished snort charlie reared straight up and deposited dan on the ground the fall did not hurt him for the turf was soft and he jumped up saying with a laugh  i did it anyway come here you rascal and ill try it again  but charlie declined to approach and dan left him resolving to succeed in the end for a struggle like this suited him exactly next time he took a halter and having got it on he played with the horse for a while leading him to and fro and putting him through various antics till he was a little tired then dan sat on the wall and gave him bread but watched his chance and getting a good grip of the halter slipped on to his back charlie tried the old trick but dan held on having had practice with toby who occasionally had an obstinate fit and tried to shake off his rider charlie was both amazed and indignant and after prancing for a minute set off at a gallop and away went dan heels over head if he had not belonged to the class of boys who go through all sorts of dangers unscathed he would have broken his neck as it was he got a heavy fall and lay still collecting his wits while charlie tore round the field tossing his head with every sign of satisfaction at the discomfiture of his rider presently it seemed to occur to him that something was wrong with dan and being of a magnanimous nature he went to see what the matter was dan let him sniff about and perplex himself for a few minutes then he looked up at him saying as decidedly as if the horse could understand  you think you have beaten but you are mistaken old boy and ill ride you yet see if i dont  he tried no more that day but soon after attempted a new method of introducing charlie to a burden he strapped a folded blanket on his back and then let him race and rear and roll and fume as much as he liked after a few fits of rebellion charlie submitted and in a few days permitted dan to mount him often stopped short to look round as if he said half patiently half reproachfully i dont understand it but i suppose you mean no harm so i permit the liberty  dan patted and praised him and took a short turn every day getting frequent falls but persisting in spite of them and longing to try a saddle and bridle but not daring to confess what he had done he had his wish however for there had been a witness of his pranks who said a good word for him  do you know what that chap has ben doin lately asked silas of his master one evening as he received his orders for the next day  which boy said mr bhaer with an air of resignation expecting some sad revelation  dan hes ben a breaking the colt sir and i wish i may die if he aint done it answered silas chuckling  how do you know  wal i kinder keep an eye on the little fellers and most genlly know what theyre up to so when dan kep going off to the paster and coming home black and blue i mistrusted that suthing was goin on i didnt say nothin but i crep up into the barn chamber and from there i see him goin through all manner of games with charlie blest if he warnt throwed time and agin and knocked round like a bag o meal but the pluck of that boy did beat all and he peared to like it and kep on as ef bound to beat  but silas you should have stopped it the boy might have been killed said mr bhaer wondering what freak his irrepressibles would take into their heads next  spose i oughter but there warnt no real danger for charlie aint no tricks and is as pretty a tempered horse as ever i see fact was i couldnt bear to spile sport for ef theres any thing i do admire its grit and dan is chock full on t but now i know hes hankerin after a saddle and yet wont take even the old one on the sly so i just thought id up and tell and may be youd let him try what he can do mr laurie wont mind and charlies all the better for t  we shall see and off went mr bhaer to inquire into the matter  dan owned up at once and proudly proved that silas was right by showing off his power over charlie for by dint of much coaxing many carrots and infinite perseverance he really had succeeded in riding the colt with a halter and blanket mr laurie was much amused and well pleased with dans courage and skill and let him have a hand in all future performances for he set about charlies education at once saying that he was not going to be outdone by a slip of a boy thanks to dan charlie took kindly to the saddle and bridle when he had once reconciled himself to the indignity of the bit and after mr laurie had trained him a little dan was permitted to ride him to the great envy and admiration of the other boys  isnt he handsome and dont he mind me like a lamb said dan one day as he dismounted and stood with his arm round charlies neck  yes and isnt he a much more useful and agreeable animal than the wild colt who spent his days racing about the field jumping fences and running away now and then asked mrs bhaer from the steps where she always appeared when dan performed with charlie  of course he is see he wont run away now even if i dont hold him and he comes to me the minute i whistle i have tamed him well havent i and dan looked both proud and pleased as well he might for in spite of their struggles together charlie loved him better than his master  i am taming a colt too and i think i shall succeed as well as you if i am as patient and persevering said mrs jo smiling so significantly at him that dan understood and answered laughing yet in earnest  we wont jump over the fence and run away but stay and let them make a handsome useful span of us hey charlie    chapter xvii composition day  hurry up boys its three oclock and uncle fritz likes us to be punctual you know said franz one wednesday afternoon as a bell rang and a stream of literarylooking young gentlemen with books and paper in their hands were seen going toward the museum  tommy was in the schoolroom bending over his desk much bedaubed with ink flushed with the ardor of inspiration and in a great hurry as usual for easygoing bangs never was ready till the very last minute as franz passed the door looking up laggards tommy gave one last blot and flourish and departed out the window waving his paper to dry as he went nan followed looking very important with a large roll in her hand and demi escorted daisy both evidently brimful of some delightful secret  the museum was all in order and the sunshine among the hopvines made pretty shadows on the floor as it peeped through the great window on one side sat mr and mrs bhaer on the other was a little table on which the compositions were laid as soon as read and in a large semicircle sat the children on campstools which occasionally shut up and let the sitter down thus preventing any stiffness in the assembly as it took too much time to have all read they took turns and on this wednesday the younger pupils were the chief performers while the elder ones listened with condescension and criticised freely  ladies first so nan may begin said mr bhaer when the settling of stools and rustling of papers had subsided  nan took her place beside the little table and with a preliminary giggle read the following interesting essay on  the sponge  the sponge my friends is a most useful and interesting plant it grows on rocks under the water and is a kind of seaweed i believe people go and pick it and dry it and wash it because little fish and insects live in the holes of the sponge i found shells in my new one and sand some are very fine and soft babies are washed with them the sponge has many uses i will relate some of them and i hope my friends will remember what i say one use is to wash the face i dont like it myself but i do it because i wish to be clean some people dont and they are dirty here the eye of the reader rested sternly upon dick and dolly who quailed under it and instantly resolved to scrub themselves virtuously on all occasions another use is to wake people up i allude to boys particularly another pause after the long word to enjoy the smothered laugh that went round the room some boys do not get up when called and mary ann squeezes the water out of a wet sponge on their faces and it makes them so mad they wake up here the laugh broke out and emil said as if he had been hit  seems to me you are wandering from the subject  no i aint we are to write about vegetables or animals and im doing both for boys are animals arent they cried nan and undaunted by the indignant no shouted at her she calmly proceeded  one more interesting thing is done with sponges and this is when doctors put ether on it and hold it to peoples noses when they have teeth out i shall do this when i am bigger and give ether to the sick so they will go to sleep and not feel me cut off their legs and arms  i know somebody who killed cats with it called out demi but was promptly crushed by dan who upset his campstool and put a hat over his face  i will not be interruckted said nan frowning upon the unseemly scrimmagers order was instantly restored and the young lady closed her remarks as follows  my composition has three morals my friends somebody groaned but no notice was taken of the insult first is keep your faces clean second get up early third when the ether sponge is put over your nose breathe hard and dont kick and your teeth will come out easy i have no more to say and miss nan sat down amid tumultuous applause  that is a very remarkable composition its tone is high and there is a good deal of humor in it very well done nan now daisy and mr bhaer smiled at one young lady as he beckoned the other  daisy colored prettily as she took her place and said in her modest little voice  im afraid you wont like mine it isnt nice and funny like nans but i couldnt do any better  we always like yours posy said uncle fritz and a gentle murmur from the boys seemed to confirm the remark thus encouraged daisy read her little paper which was listened to with respectful attention  the cat  the cat is a sweet animal i love them very much they are clean and pretty and catch rats and mice and let you pet them and are fond of you if you are kind they are very wise and can find their way anywhere little cats are called kittens and are dear things i have two named huz and buz and their mother is topaz because she has yellow eyes uncle told me a pretty story about a man named mahomet he had a nice cat and when she was asleep on his sleeve and he wanted to go away he cut off the sleeve so as not to wake her up i think he was a kind man some cats catch fish  so do i cried teddy jumping up eager to tell about his trout  hush said his mother setting him down again as quickly as possible for orderly daisy hated to be interruckted as nan expressed it  i read about one who used to do it very slyly i tried to make topaz but she did not like the water and scratched me she does like tea and when i play in my kitchen she pats the teapot with her paw till i give her some she is a fine cat she eats applepudding and molasses most cats do not  thats a firstrater called out nat and daisy retired pleased with the praise of her friend  demi looks so impatient we must have him up at once or he wont hold out said uncle fritz and demi skipped up with alacrity  mine is a poem he announced in a tone of triumph and read his first effort in a loud and solemn voice       i write about the butterfly        it is a pretty thing      and flies about like the birds        but it does not sing      first it is a little grub        and then it is a nice yellow cocoon      and then the butterfly        eats its way out soon      they live on dew and honey        they do not have any hive      they do not sting like wasps and bees and hornets        and to be as good as they are we should strive      i should like to be a beautiful butterfly        all yellow and blue and green and red      but i should not like        to have dan put camphor on my poor little head  this unusual burst of genius brought down the house and demi was obliged to read it again a somewhat difficult task as there was no punctuation whatever and the little poets breath gave out before he got to the end of some of the long lines  he will be a shakespeare yet said aunt jo laughing as if she would die for this poetic gem reminded her of one of her own written at the age of ten and beginning gloomily       i wish i had a quiet tomb        beside a little rill      where birds and bees and butterflies        would sing upon the hill  come on tommy if there is as much ink inside your paper as there is outside it will be a long composition said mr bhaer when demi had been induced to tear himself from his poem and sit down  it isnt a composition its a letter you see i forgot all about its being my turn till after school and then i didnt know what to have and there wasnt time to read up so i thought you wouldnt mind my taking a letter that i wrote to my grandma its got something about birds in it so i thought it would do  with this long excuse tommy plunged into a sea of ink and floundered through pausing now and then to decipher one of his own flourishes  my dear grandma i hope you are well uncle james sent me a pocket rifle it is a beautiful little instrument of killing shaped like this here tommy displayed a remarkable sketch of what looked like an intricate pump or the inside of a small steamengine 44 are the sights 6 is a false stock that fits in at a 3 is the trigger and 2 is the cock it loads at the breech and fires with great force and straightness i am going out shooting squirrels soon i shot several fine birds for the museum they had speckled breasts and dan liked them very much he stuffed them tiptop and they sit on the tree quite natural only one looks a little tipsy we had a frenchman working here the other day and asia called his name so funnily that i will tell you about it his name was germain first she called him jerry but we laughed at her and she changed it to jeremiah but ridicule was the result so it became mr germany but ridicule having been again resumed it became garrymon which it has remained ever since i do not write often i am so busy but i think of you often and sympathize with you and sincerely hope you get on as well as can be expected without me your affectionate grandson  thomas buckminster bangs  ps if you come across any postagestamps remember me  nb love to all and a great deal to aunt almira does she make any nice plumcakes now  ps mrs bhaer sends her respects  ps and so would mr b if he knew i was in act to write  nb father is going to give me a watch on my birthday i am glad as at present i have no means of telling time and am often late at school  ps i hope to see you soon dont you wish to send for me  t b b   as each postscript was received with a fresh laugh from the boys by the time he came to the sixth and last tommy was so exhausted that he was glad to sit down and wipe his ruddy face  i hope the dear old lady will live through it said mr bhaer under cover of the noise  we wont take any notice of the broad hint given in that last ps the letter will be quite as much as she can bear without a visit from tommy answered mrs jo remembering that the old lady usually took to her bed after a visitation from her irrepressible grandson  now me said teddy who had learned a bit of poetry and was so eager to say it that he had been bobbing up and down during the reading and could no longer be restrained  im afraid he will forget it if he waits and i have had a deal of trouble teaching him said his mother  teddy trotted to the rostrum dropped a curtsey and nodded his head at the same time as if anxious to suit every one then in his baby voice and putting the emphasis on the wrong words he said his verse all in one breath       little drops of water        little drains of sand      mate a might okum ocean        and a peasant land      little words of kindness        pokin evvy day      make a home a hebbin        and hep us on a way  clapping his hands at the end he made another double salutation and then ran to hide his head in his mothers lap quite overcome by the success of his piece for the applause was tremendous  dick and dolly did not write but were encouraged to observe the habits of animals and insects and report what they saw dick liked this and always had a great deal to say so when his name was called he marched up and looking at the audience with his bright confiding eyes told his little story so earnestly that no one smiled at his crooked body because the straight soul shone through it beautifully  ive been watching dragonflies and i read about them in dans book and ill try and tell you what i remember theres lots of them flying round on the pond all blue with big eyes and sort of lace wings very pretty i caught one and looked at him and i think he was the handsomest insect i ever saw they catch littler creatures than they are to eat and have a queer kind of hook thing that folds up when they aint hunting it likes the sunshine and dances round all day let me see what else was there to tell about oh i know the eggs are laid in the water and go down to the bottom and are hatched in the mud little ugly things come out of em i cant say the name but they are brown and keep having new skins and getting bigger and bigger only think it takes them two years to be a dragonfly now this is the curiousest part of it so you listen tight for i dont believe you know it when it is ready it knows somehow and the ugly grubby thing climbs up out of the water on a flag or a bulrush and bursts open its back  come i dont believe that said tommy who was not an observant boy and really thought dick was making up  it does burst open its back dont it and dick appealed to mr bhaer who nodded a very decided affirmative to the little speakers great satisfaction  well out comes the dragonfly all whole and he sits in the sun sort of coming alive you know and he gets strong and then he spreads his pretty wings and flies away up in the air and never is a grub any more thats all i know but i shall watch and try to see him do it for i think its splendid to turn into a beautiful dragonfly dont you  dick had told his story well and when he described the flight of the newborn insect had waved his hands and looked up as if he saw and wanted to follow it something in his face suggested to the minds of the elder listeners the thought that some day little dick would have his wish and after years of helplessness and pain would climb up into the sun some happy day and leaving his poor little body behind him find a new lovely shape in a fairer world than this mrs jo drew him to her side and said with a kiss on his thin cheek  that is a sweet little story dear and you remembered it wonderfully well i shall write and tell your mother all about it and dick sat on her knee contentedly smiling at the praise and resolving to watch well and catch the dragonfly in the act of leaving its old body for the new and see how he did it dolly had a few remarks to make upon the duck and made them in a singsong tone for he had learned it by heart and thought it a great plague to do it at all  wild ducks are hard to kill men hide and shoot at them and have tame ducks to quack and make the wild ones come where the men can fire at them they have wooden ducks made too and they sail round and the wild ones come to see them they are stupid i think our ducks are very tame they eat a great deal and go poking round in the mud and water they dont take good care of their eggs but them spoil and  mine dont cried tommy  well some peoples do silas said so hens take good care of little ducks only they dont like to have them go in the water and make a great fuss but the little ones dont care a bit i like to eat ducks with stuffing in them and lots of applesauce  i have something to say about owls began nat who had carefully prepared a paper upon this subject with some help from dan  owls have big heads round eyes hooked bills and strong claws some are gray some white some black and yellowish their feathers are very soft and stick out a great deal they fly very quietly and hunt bats mice little birds and such things they build nests in barns hollow trees and some take the nests of other birds the great horned owl has two eggs bigger than a hens and reddish brown the tawny owl has five eggs white and smooth and this is the kind that hoots at night another kind sounds like a child crying they eat mice and bats whole and the parts that they cannot digest they make into little balls and spit out  my gracious how funny nan was heard to observe  they cannot see by day and if they get out into the light they go flapping round half blind and the other birds chase and peck at them as if they were making fun the horned owl is very big most as big as the eagle it eats rabbits rats snakes and birds and lives in rocks and old tumbledown houses they have a good many cries and scream like a person being choked and say waugh o waugh o and it scares people at night in the woods the white owl lives by the sea and in cold places and looks something like a hawk there is a kind of owl that makes holes to live in like moles it is called the burrowing owl and is very small the barnowl is the commonest kind and i have watched one sitting in a hole in a tree looking like a little gray cat with one eye shut and the other open he comes out at dusk and sits round waiting for the bats i caught one and here he is  with that nat suddenly produced from inside his jacket a little downy bird who blinked and ruffled his feathers looking very plump and sleepy and scared  dont touch him he is going to show off said nat displaying his new pet with great pride first he put a cocked hat on the birds head and the boys laughed at the funny effect then he added a pair of paper spectacles and that gave the owl such a wise look that they shouted with merriment the performance closed with making the bird angry and seeing him cling to a handkerchief upside down pecking and clucking as rob called it he was allowed to fly after that and settled himself on the bunch of pinecones over the door where he sat staring down at the company with an air of sleepy dignity that amused them very much  have you anything for us george asked mr bhaer when the room was still again  well i read and learned ever so much about moles but i declare ive forgotten every bit of it except that they dig holes to live in that you catch them by pouring water down and that they cant possibly live without eating very often and stuffy sat down wishing he had not been too lazy to write out his valuable observations for a general smile went round when he mentioned the last of the three facts which lingered in his memory  then we are done for today began mr bhaer but tommy called out in a great hurry  no we aint dont you know we must give the thing and he winked violently as he made an eyeglass of his fingers  bless my heart i forgot now is your time tom and mr bhaer dropped into his seat again while all the boys but dan looked mightily tickled at something  nat tommy and demi left the room and speedily returned with a little red morocco box set forth in state on mrs jos best silver salver tommy bore it and still escorted by nat and demi marched up to unsuspecting dan who stared at them as if he thought they were going to make fun of him tommy had prepared an elegant and impressive speech for the occasion but when the minute came it all went out of his head and he just said straight from his kindly boyish heart  here old fellow we all wanted to give you something to kind of pay for what happened awhile ago and to show how much we liked you for being such a trump please take it and have a jolly good time with it  dan was so surprised he could only get as red as the little box and mutter thanky boys as he fumbled to open it but when he saw what was inside his face lighted up and he seized the long desired treasure saying so enthusiastically that every one was satisfied though is language was anything but polished  what a stunner i say you fellows are regular bricks to give me this its just what i wanted give us your paw tommy  many paws were given and heartily shaken for the boys were charmed with dans pleasure and crowded round him to shake hands and expatiate on the beauties of their gift in the midst of this pleasant chatter dans eye went to mrs jo who stood outside the group enjoying the scene with all her heart  no i had nothing to do with it the boys got it up all themselves she said answering the grateful look that seemed to thank her for that happy moment dan smiled and said in a tone that only she could understand  its you all the same and making his way through the boys he held out his hand first to her and then to the good professor who was beaming benevolently on his flock  he thanked them both with the silent hearty squeeze he gave the kind hands that had held him up and led him into the safe refuge of a happy home not a word was spoken but they felt all he would say and little teddy expressed his pleasure for them as he leaned from his fathers arm to hug the boy and say in his baby way  my dood danny everybody loves him now  come here show off your spyglass dan and let us see some of your magnified pollywogs and annymalcumisms as you call em said jack who felt so uncomfortable during this scene that he would have slipped away if emil had not kept him  so i will take a squint at that and see what you think of it said dan glad to show off his precious microscope  he held it over a beetle that happened to be lying on the table and jack bent down to take his squint but looked up with an amazed face saying  my eye what nippers the old thing has got i see now why it hurts so confoundedly when you grab a dorbug and he grabs back again  he winked at me cried nan who had poked her head under jacks elbow and got the second peep  every one took a look and then dan showed them the lovely plumage on a moths wing the four feathery corners to a hair the veins on a leaf hardly visible to the naked eye but like a thick net through the wonderful little glass the skin on their own fingers looking like queer hills and valleys a cobweb like a bit of coarse sewing silk and the sting of a bee  its like the fairy spectacles in my storybook only more curious said demi enchanted with the wonders he saw  dan is a magician now and he can show you many miracles going on all round you for he has two things needful patience and a love of nature we live in a beautiful and wonderful world demi and the more you know about it the wiser and the better you will be this little glass will give you a new set of teachers and you may learn fine lessons from them if you will said mr bhaer glad to see how interested the boys were in the matter  could i see anybodys soul with this microscope if i looked hard asked demi who was much impressed with the power of the bit of glass  no dear its not powerful enough for that and never can be made so you must wait a long while before your eyes are clear enough to see the most invisible of gods wonders but looking at the lovely things you can see will help you to understand the lovelier things you can not see answered uncle fritz with his hand on the boys head  well daisy and i both think that if there are any angels their wings look like that butterflys as we see it through the glass only more soft and gold  believe it if you like and keep your own little wings as bright and beautiful only dont fly away for a long time yet  no i wont and demi kept his word  goodby my boys i must go now but i leave you with our new professor of natural history and mrs jo went away well pleased with that composition day    chapter xviii crops  the gardens did well that summer and in september the little crops were gathered in with much rejoicing jack and ned joined their farms and raised potatoes those being a good salable article they got twelve bushels counting little ones and all and sold them to mr bhaer at a fair price for potatoes went fast in that house emil and franz devoted themselves to corn and had a jolly little husking in the barn after which they took their corn to the mill and came proudly home with meal enough to supply the family with hastypudding and johnnycake for a lone time they would not take money for their crop because as franz said we never can pay uncle for all he has done for us if we raised corn for the rest of our days  nat had beans in such abundance that he despaired of ever shelling them till mrs jo proposed a new way which succeeded admirably the dry pods were spread upon the barnfloor nat fiddled and the boys danced quadrilles on them till they were thrashed out with much merriment and very little labor  tommys six weeks beans were a failure for a dry spell early in the season hurt them because he gave them no water and after that he was so sure that they could take care of themselves he let the poor things struggle with bugs and weeds till they were exhausted and died a lingering death so tommy had to dig his farm over again and plant peas but they were late the birds ate many the bushes not being firmly planted blew down and when the poor peas came at last no one cared for them as their day was over and springlamb had grown into mutton tommy consoled himself with a charitable effort for he transplanted all the thistles he could find and tended them carefully for toby who was fond of the prickly delicacy and had eaten all he could find on the place the boys had great fun over toms thistle bed but he insisted that it was better to care for poor toby than for himself and declared that he would devote his entire farm next year to thistles worms and snails that demis turtles and nats pet owl might have the food they loved as well as the donkey so like shiftless kindhearted happygolucky tommy  demi had supplied his grandmother with lettuce all summer and in the autumn sent his grandfather a basket of turnips each one scrubbed up till it looked like a great white egg his grandma was fond of salad and one of his grandpas favorite quotations was       lucullus whom frugality could charm      ate roasted turnips at the sabine farm  therefore these vegetable offerings to the dear domestic god and goddess were affectionate appropriate and classical  daisy had nothing but flowers in her little plot and it bloomed all summer long with a succession of gay or fragrant posies she was very fond of her garden and delved away in it at all hours watching over her roses and pansies sweetpeas and mignonette as faithfully and tenderly as she did over her dolls or her friends little nosegays were sent into town on all occasions and certain vases about the house were her especial care she had all sorts of pretty fancies about her flowers and loved to tell the children the story of the pansy and show them how the stepmotherleaf sat up in her green chair in purple and gold how the two own children in gay yellow had each its little seat while the step children in dull colors both sat on one small stool and the poor little father in his red nightcap was kept out of sight in the middle of the flower that a monks dark face looked out of the monkshood larkspur that the flowers of the canaryvine were so like dainty birds fluttering their yellow wings that one almost expected to see them fly away and the snapdragons that went off like little pistolshots when you cracked them splendid dollies did she make out of scarlet and white poppies with ruffled robes tied round the waist with grass blade sashes and astonishing hats of coreopsis on their green heads peapod boats with roseleaf sails received these flowerpeople and floated them about a placid pool in the most charming style for finding that there were no elves daisy made her own and loved the fanciful little friends who played their parts in her summerlife  nan went in for herbs and had a fine display of useful plants which she tended with steadily increasing interest and care very busy was she in september cutting drying and tying up her sweet harvest and writing down in a little book how the different herbs are to be used she had tried several experiments and made several mistakes so she wished to be particular lest she should give little huz another fit by administering wormwood instead of catnip  dick dolly and rob each grubbed away on his small farm and made more stir about it than all the rest put together parsnips and carrots were the crops of the two ds and they longed for it to be late enough to pull up the precious vegetables dick did privately examine his carrots and plant them again feeling that silas was right in saying it was too soon for them yet  robs crop was four small squashes and one immense pumpkin it really was a bouncer as every one said and i assure you that two small persons could sit on it side by side it seemed to have absorbed all the goodness of the little garden and all the sunshine that shone down on it and lay there a great round golden ball full of rich suggestions of pumpkinpies for weeks to come robby was so proud of his mammoth vegetable that he took every one to see it and when frosts began to nip covered it up each night with an old bedquilt tucking it round as if the pumpkin was a wellbeloved baby the day it was gathered he would let no one touch it but himself and nearly broke his back tugging it to the barn in his little wheelbarrow with dick and dolly harnessed in front to give a heave up the path his mother promised him that the thanksgivingpies should be made from it and hinted vaguely that she had a plan in her head which would cover the prize pumpkin and its owner with glory  poor billy had planted cucumbers but unfortunately hoed them up and left the pigweed this mistake grieved him very much for tem minutes then he forgot all about it and sowed a handful of bright buttons which he had collected evidently thinking in his feeble mind that they were money and would come up and multiply so that he might make many quarters as tommy did no one disturbed him and he did what he liked with his plot which soon looked as if a series of small earthquakes had stirred it up when the general harvestday came he would have had nothing but stones and weeds to show if kind old asia had not hung halfadozen oranges on the dead tree he stuck up in the middle billy was delighted with his crop and no one spoiled his pleasure in the little miracle which pity wrought for him by making withered branches bear strange fruit  stuffy had various trials with his melons for being impatient to taste them he had a solitary revel before they were ripe and made himself so ill that for a day or two it seemed doubtful if he would ever eat any more but he pulled through it and served up his first cantaloupe without tasting a mouthful himself they were excellent melons for he had a warm slope for them and they ripened fast the last and best were lingering on the vines and stuffy had announced that he should sell them to a neighbor this disappointed the boys who had hoped to eat the melons themselves and they expressed their displeasure in a new and striking manner going one morning to gaze upon the three fine watermelons which he had kept for the market stuffy was horrified to find the word pig cut in white letters on the green rind staring at him from every one he was in a great rage and flew to mrs jo for redress she listened condoled with him and then said  if you want to turn the laugh ill tell you how but you must give up the melons  well i will for i cant thrash all the boys but id like to give them something to remember the mean sneaks growled stuff still in a fume  now mrs jo was pretty sure who had done the trick for she had seen three heads suspiciously near to one another in the sofacorner the evening before and when these heads had nodded with chuckles and whispers this experienced woman knew mischief was afoot a moonlight night a rustling in the old cherrytree near emils window a cut on tommys finger all helped to confirm her suspicions and having cooled stuffys wrath a little she bade him bring his maltreated melons to her room and say not a word to any one of what had happened he did so and the three wags were amazed to find their joke so quietly taken it spoilt the fun and the entire disappearance of the melons made them uneasy so did stuffys goodnature for he looked more placid and plump than ever and surveyed them with an air of calm pity that perplexed them very much  at dinnertime they discovered why for then stuffys vengeance fell upon them and the laugh was turned against them when the pudding was eaten and the fruit was put on mary ann reappeared in a high state of giggle bearing a large watermelon silas followed with another and dan brought up the rear with a third one was placed before each of the three guilty lads and they read on the smooth green skins this addition to their own work with the compliments of the pig every one else read it also and the whole table was in a roar for the trick had been whispered about so every one understood the sequel emil ned and tommy did not know where to look and had not a word to say for themselves so they wisely joined in the laugh cut up the melons and handed them round saying what all the rest agreed to that stuffy had taken a wise and merry way to return good for evil  dan had no garden for he was away or lame the greater part of the summer so he had helped silas wherever he could chopped wood for asia and taken care of the lawn so well that mrs jo always had smooth paths and nicely shaven turf before her door  when the others got in their crops he looked sorry that he had so little to show but as autumn went on he bethought himself of a woodland harvest which no one would dispute with him and which was peculiarly his own every saturday he was away alone to the forests fields and hills and always came back loaded with spoils for he seemed to know the meadows where the best flagroot grew the thicket where the sassafras was spiciest the haunts where the squirrels went for nuts the white oak whose bark was most valuable and the little goldthread vine that nursey liked to cure the canker with all sorts of splendid red and yellow leaves did dan bring home for mrs jo to dress her parlor with gracefulseeded grasses clematis tassels downy soft yellow waxwork berries and mosses redbrimmed white or emerald green  i need not sigh for the woods now because dan brings the woods to me mrs jo used to say as she glorified the walls with yellow maple boughs and scarlet woodbine wreaths or filled her vases with russet ferns hemlock sprays full of delicate cones and hardy autumn flowers for dans crop suited her well  the great garret was full of the childrens little stores and for a time was one of the sights of the house daisys flower seeds in neat little paper bags all labelled lay in a drawer of a threelegged table nans herbs hung in bunches against the wall filling the air with their aromatic breath tommy had a basket of thistledown with the tiny seeds attached for he meant to plant them next year if they did not all fly away before that time emil had bunches of popcorn hanging there to dry and demi laid up acorns and different sorts of grain for the pets but dans crop made the best show for fully one half of the floor was covered with the nuts he brought all kinds were there for he ranged the woods for miles round climbed the tallest trees and forced his way into the thickest hedges for his plunder walnuts chestnuts hazelnuts and beechnuts lay in separate compartments getting brown and dry and sweet ready for winter revels  there was one butternuttree on the place and rob and teddy called it theirs it bore well this year and the great dingy nuts came dropping down to hide among the dead leaves where the busy squirrels found them better than the lazy bhaers their father had told them the boys not the squirrels they should have the nuts if they would pick them up but no one was to help it was easy work and teddy liked it only he soon got tired and left his little basket half full for another day but the other day was slow to arrive and meantime the sly squirrels were hard at work scampering up and down the old elmtrees stowing the nuts away till their holes were full then all about the crotches of the boughs to be removed at their leisure their funny little ways amused the boys till one day silas said  hev you sold them nuts to the squirrels  no answered rob wondering what silas meant  wal then youd better fly round or them spry little fellers wont leave you none  oh we can beat them when we begin there are such lots of nuts we shall have a plenty  there aint many more to come down and they have cleared the ground pretty well see if they haint  robby ran to look and was alarmed to find how few remained he called teddy and they worked hard all one afternoon while the squirrels sat on the fence and scolded  now ted we must keep watch and pick up just as fast as they fall or we shant have more than a bushel and every one will laugh at us if we dont  the naughty quillies tarnt have em ill pick fast and run and put em in the barn twick said teddy frowning at little frisky who chattered and whisked his tail indignantly  that night a high wind blew down hundreds of nuts and when mrs jo came to wake her little sons she said briskly  come my laddies the squirrels are hard at it and you will have to work well today or they will have every nut on the ground  no they wont and robby tumbled up in a great hurry gobbled his breakfast and rushed out to save his property  teddy went too and worked like a little beaver trotting to and fro with full and empty baskets another bushel was soon put away in the cornbarn and they were scrambling among the leaves for more nuts when the bell rang for school  o father let me stay out and pick those horrid squirrels will have my nuts if you dont ill do my lessons by and by cried rob running into the schoolroom flushed and tousled by the fresh cold wind and his eager work  if you had been up early and done a little every morning there would be no hurry now i told you that rob and you never minded i cannot have the lessons neglected as the work has been the squirrels will get more than their share this year and they deserve it for they have worked best you may go an hour earlier but that is all and mr bhaer led rob to his place where the little man dashed at his books as if bent on making sure of the precious hour promised him  it was almost maddening to sit still and see the wind shaking down the last nuts and the lively thieves flying about pausing now and then to eat one in his face and flirt their tails as if they said saucily well have them in spite of you lazy rob the only thing that sustained the poor child in this trying moment was the sight of teddy working away all alone it was really splendid the pluck and perseverance of the little lad he picked and picked till his back ached he trudged to and fro till his small legs were tired and he defied wind weariness and wicked quillies till his mother left her work and did the carrying for him full of admiration for the kind little fellow who tried to help his brother when rob was dismissed he found teddy reposing in the bushelbasket quite used up but unwilling to quit the field for he flapped his hat at the thieves with one grubby little hand while he refreshed himself with the big apple held in the other  rob fell to work and the ground was cleared before two oclock the nuts safely in the cornbarn loft and the weary workers exulted in their success but frisky and his wife were not to be vanquished so easily and when rob went up to look at his nuts a few days later he was amazed to see how many had vanished none of the boys could have stolen them because the door had been locked the doves could not have eaten them and there were no rats about there was great lamentation among the young bhaers till dick said  i saw frisky on the roof of the cornbarn may be he took them  i know he did ill have a trap and kill him dead cried rob disgusted with friskys grasping nature  perhaps if you watch you can find out where he puts them and i may be able to get them back for you said dan who was much amused by the fight between the boys and squirrels  so rob watched and saw mr and mrs frisky drop from the drooping elm boughs on to the roof of the cornbarn dodge in at one of the little doors much to the disturbance of the doves and come out with a nut in each mouth so laden they could not get back the way they came but ran down the low roof along the wall and leaping off at a corner they vanished a minute and reappeared without their plunder rob ran to the place and in a hollow under the leaves he found a heap of the stolen property hidden away to be carried off to the holes by and by  oh you little villains ill cheat you now and not leave one said rob so he cleared the corner and the cornbarn and put the contested nuts in the garret making sure that no broken windowpane could anywhere let in the unprincipled squirrels they seemed to feel that the contest was over and retired to their hole but now and then could not resist throwing down nutshells on robs head and scolding violently as if they could not forgive him nor forget that he had the best of the battle  father and mother bhaers crop was of a different sort and not so easily described but they were satisfied with it felt that their summer work had prospered well and by and by had a harvest that made them very happy    chapter xix john brooke  wake up demi dear i want you  why ive just gone to bed it cant be morning yet and demi blinked like a little owl as he waked from his first sound sleep  its only ten but your father is ill and we must go to him o my little john my poor little john and aunt jo laid her head down on the pillow with a sob that scared sleep from demis eyes and filled his heart with fear and wonder for he dimly felt why aunt jo called him john and wept over him as if some loss had come that left him poor he clung to her without a word and in a minute she was quite steady again and said with a tender kiss as she saw his troubled face  we are going to say goodby to him my darling and there is no time to lose so dress quickly and come to me in my room i must go to daisy  yes i will and when aunt jo was gone little demi got up quietly dressed as if in a dream and leaving tommy fast asleep went away through the silent house feeling that something new and sorrowful was going to happen something that set him apart from the other boys for a time and made the world seem as dark and still and strange as those familiar rooms did in the night a carriage sent by mr laurie stood before the door daisy was soon ready and the brother and sister held each other by the hand all the way into town as they drove swiftly and silently with aunt and uncle through the shadowy roads to say goodby to father  none of the boys but franz and emil knew what had happened and when they came down next morning great was their wonderment and discomfort for the house seemed forlorn without its master and mistress breakfast was a dismal meal with no cheery mrs jo behind the teapots and when schooltime came father bhaers place was empty they wandered about in a disconsolate kind of way for an hour waiting for news and hoping it would be all right with demis father for good john brooke was much beloved by the boys ten oclock came and no one arrived to relieve their anxiety they did not feel like playing yet the time dragged heavily and they sat about listless and sober all at once franz got up and said in his persuasive way  look here boys lets go into school and do our lessons just as if uncle was here it will make the day go faster and will please him i know  but who will hear us say them asked jack  i will i dont know much more than you do but im the oldest here and ill try to fill uncles place till he comes if you dont mind  something in the modest serious way franz said this impressed the boys for though the poor lads eyes were red with quiet crying for uncle john in that long sad night there was a new manliness about him as if he had already begun to feel the cares and troubles of life and tried to take them bravely  i will for one and emil went to his seat remembering that obedience to his superior officer is a seamans first duty  the others followed franz took his uncles seat and for an hour order reigned lessons were learned and said and franz made a patient pleasant teacher wisely omitting such lessons as he was not equal to and keeping order more by the unconscious dignity that sorrow gave him than by any words of his own the little boys were reading when a step was heard in the hall and every one looked up to read the news in mr bhaers face as he came in the kind face told them instantly that demi had no father now for it was worn and pale and full of tender grief which left him no words with which to answer rob as he ran to him saying reproachfully  what made you go and leave me in the night papa  the memory of the other father who had left his children in the night never to return made mr bhaer hold his own boy close and for a minute hide his face in robbys curly hair emil laid his head down on his arms franz went to put his hand on his uncles shoulder his boyish face pale with sympathy and sorrow and the others sat so still that the soft rustle of the falling leaves outside was distinctly heard  rob did not clearly understand what had happened but he hated to see papa unhappy so he lifted up the bent head and said in his chirpy little voice  dont cry mein vater we were all so good we did our lessons without you and franz was the master  mr bhaer looked up then tried to smile and said in a grateful tone that made the lads feel like saints i thank you very much my boys it was a beautiful way to help and comfort me i shall not forget it i assure you  franz proposed it and was a firstrate master too said nat and the others gave a murmur of assent most gratifying to the young dominie  mr bhaer put rob down and standing up put his arm round his tall nephews shoulder as he said with a look of genuine pleasure  this makes my hard day easier and gives me confidence in you all i am needed there in town and must leave you for some hours i thought to give you a holiday or send some of you home but if you like to stay and go on as you have begun i shall be glad and proud of my good boys  well stay wed rather franz can see to us cried several delighted with the confidence shown in them  isnt marmar coming home asked rob wistfully for home without marmar was the world without the sun to him  we shall both come tonight but dear aunt meg needs mother more than you do now and i know you like to lend her for a little while  well i will but teddys been crying for her and he slapped nursey and was dreadful naughty answered rob as if the news might bring mother home  where is my little man asked mr bhaer  dan took him out to keep him quiet hes all right now said franz pointing to the window through which they could see dan drawing baby in his little wagon with the dogs frolicking about him  i wont see him it would only upset him again but tell dan i leave teddy in his care you older boys i trust to manage yourselves for a day franz will direct you and silas is here to over see matters so goodby till tonight  just tell me a word about uncle john said emil detaining mr bhaer as he was about hurrying away again  he was only ill a few hours and died as he has lived so cheerfully so peacefully that it seems a sin to mar the beauty of it with any violent or selfish grief we were in time to say goodby and daisy and demi were in his arms as he fell asleep on aunt megs breast no more now i cannot bear it and mr bhaer went hastily away quite bowed with grief for in john brooke he had lost both friend and brother and there was no one left to take his place  all that day the house was very still the small boys played quietly in the nursery the others feeling as if sunday had come in the middle of the week spent it in walking sitting in the willow or among their pets all talking much of uncle john and feeling that something gentle just and strong had gone out of their little world leaving a sense of loss that deepened every hour at dusk mr and mrs bhaer came home alone for demi and daisy were their mothers best comfort now and could not leave her poor mrs jo seemed quite spent and evidently needed the same sort of comfort for her first words as she came up the stairs were where is my baby  here i is answered a little voice as dan put teddy into her arms adding as she hugged him close my danny tooked tare of me all day and i was dood  mrs jo turned to thank the faithful nurse but dan was waving off the boys who had gathered in the hall to meet her and was saying in a low voice keep back she dont want to be bothered with us now  no dont keep back i want you all come in and see me my boys ive neglected you all day and mrs jo held out her hands to them as they gathered round and escorted her into her own room saying little but expressing much by affectionate looks and clumsy little efforts to show their sorrow and sympathy  i am so tired i will lie here and cuddle teddy and you shall bring me in some tea she said trying to speak cheerfully for their sakes  a general stampede into the diningroom followed and the suppertable would have been ravaged if mr bhaer had not interfered it was agreed that one squad should carry in the mothers tea and another bring it out the four nearest and dearest claimed the first honor so franz bore the teapot emil the bread rob the milk and teddy insisted on carrying the sugar basin which was lighter by several lumps when it arrived than when it started some women might have found it annoying at such a time to have boys creaking in and out upsetting cups and rattling spoons in violent efforts to be quiet and helpful but it suited mrs jo because just then her heart was very tender and remembering that many of her boys were fatherless or motherless she yearned over them and found comfort in their blundering affection it was the sort of food that did her more good than the very thick breadandbutter that they gave her and the rough commodores broken whisper  bear up aunty its a hard blow but well weather it somehow cheered her more than the sloppy cup he brought her full of tea as bitter as if some salt tear of his own had dropped into it on the way when supper was over a second deputation removed the tray and dan said holding out his arms for sleepy little teddy  let me put him to bed youre so tired mother  will you go with him lovey asked mrs jo of her small lord and master who lay on her arm among the sofapillows  torse i will and he was proudly carried off by his faithful bearer  i wish i could do something said nat with a sigh as franz leaned over the sofa and softly stroked aunt jos hot forehead  you can dear go and get your violin and play me the sweet little airs uncle teddy sent you last music will comfort me better than any thing else tonight  nat flew for his fiddle and sitting just outside her door played as he had never done before for now his heart was in it and seemed to magnetize his fingers the other lads sat quietly upon the steps keeping watch that no newcomer should disturb the house franz lingered at his post and so soothed served and guarded by her boys poor mrs jo slept at last and forgot her sorrow for an hour  two quiet days and on the third mr bhaer came in just after school with a note in his hand looking both moved and pleased  i want to read you something boys he said and as they stood round him he read this  dear brother fritz i hear that you do not mean to bring your flock today thinking that i may not like it please do the sight of his friends will help demi through the hard hour and i want the boys to hear what father says of my john it will do them good i know if they would sing one of the sweet old hymns you have taught them so well i should like it better than any other music and feel that it was beautifully suited to the occasion please ask them with my love  meg  will you go and mr bhaer looked at the lads who were greatly touched by mrs brookes kind words and wishes  yes they answered like one boy and an hour later they went away with franz to bear their part in john brookes simple funeral  the little house looked as quiet sunny and homelike as when meg entered it as a bride ten years ago only then it was early summer and rose blossomed everywhere now it was early autumn and dead leaves rustled softly down leaving the branches bare the bride was a widow now but the same beautiful serenity shone in her face and the sweet resignation of a truly pious soul made her presence a consolation to those who came to comfort her  o meg how can you bear it so whispered jo as she met them at the door with a smile of welcome and no change in her gentle manner except more gentleness  dear jo the love that has blest me for ten happy years supports me still it could not die and john is more my own than ever whispered meg and in her eyes the tender trust was so beautiful and bright that jo believed her and thanked god for the immortality of love like hers  they were all there father and mother uncle teddy and aunt amy old mr laurence whitehaired and feeble now mr and mrs bhaer with their flock and many friends come to do honor to the dead one would have said that modest john brooke in his busy quiet humble life had had little time to make friends but now they seemed to start up everywhere old and young rich and poor high and low for all unconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt his virtues were remembered and his hidden charities rose up to bless him the group about his coffin was a far more eloquent eulogy than any mr march could utter there were the rich men whom he had served faithfully for years the poor old women whom he cherished with his little store in memory of his mother the wife to whom he had given such happiness that death could not mar it utterly the brothers and sisters in whose hearts he had made a place for ever the little son and daughter who already felt the loss of his strong arm and tender voice the young children sobbing for their kindest playmate and the tall lads watching with softened faces a scene which they never could forget a very simple service and very short for the fatherly voice that had faltered in the marriagesacrament now failed entirely as mr march endeavored to pay his tribute of reverence and love to the son whom he most honored nothing but the soft coo of baby josys voice upstairs broke the long hush that followed the last amen till at a sign from mr bhaer the welltrained boyish voices broke out in a hymn so full of lofty cheer that one by one all joined in it singing with full hearts and finding their troubled spirits lifted into peace on the wings of that brave sweet psalm  as meg listened she felt that she had done well for not only did the moment comfort her with the assurance that johns last lullaby was sung by the young voices he loved so well but in the faces of the boys she saw that they had caught a glimpse of the beauty of virtue in its most impressive form and that the memory of the good man lying dead before them would live long and helpfully in their remembrance daisys head lay in her lap and demi held her hand looking often at her with eyes so like his fathers and a little gesture that seemed to say dont be troubled mother i am here and all about her were friends to lean upon and love so patient pious meg put by her heavy grief feeling that her best help would be to live for others as her john had done  that evening as the plumfield boys sat on the steps as usual in the mild september moonlight they naturally fell to talking of the event of the day  emil began by breaking out in his impetuous way uncle fritz is the wisest and uncle laurie the jolliest but uncle john was the best and id rather be like him than any man i ever saw  so would i did you hear what those gentlemen said to grandpa today i would like to have that said of me when i was dead and franz felt with regret that he had not appreciated uncle john enough  what did they say asked jack who had been much impressed by the scenes of the day  why one of the partners of mr laurence where uncle john has been ever so long was saying that he was conscientious almost to a fault as a business man and above reproach in all things another gentleman said no money could repay the fidelity and honesty with which uncle john had served him and then grandpa told them the best of all uncle john once had a place in the office of a man who cheated and when this man wanted uncle to help him do it uncle wouldnt though he was offered a big salary the man was angry and said you will never get on in business with such strict principles and uncle answered back i never will try to get on without them and left the place for a much harder and poorer one  good cried several of the boys warmly for they were in the mood to understand and value the little story as never before  he wasnt rich was he asked jack  no  he never did any thing to make a stir in the world did he  no  he was only good  thats all and franz found himself wishing that uncle john had done something to boast of for it was evident that jack was disappointed by his replies  only good that is all and every thing said mr bhaer who had overheard the last few words and guessed what was going on the minds of the lads  let me tell you a little about john brooke and you will see why men honor him and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or famous he simply did his duty in all things and did it so cheerfully so faithfully that it kept him patient and brave and happy through poverty and loneliness and years of hard work he was a good son and gave up his own plans to stay and live with his mother while she needed him he was a good friend and taught laurie much beside his greek and latin did it unconsciously perhaps by showing him an example of an upright man he was a faithful servant and made himself so valuable to those who employed him that they will find it hard to fill his place he was a good husband and father so tender wise and thoughtful that laurie and i learned much of him and only knew how well he loved his family when we discovered all he had done for them unsuspected and unassisted  mr bhaer stopped a minute and the boys sat like statues in the moonlight until he went on again in a subdued but earnest voice as he lay dying i said to him have no care for meg and the little ones i will see that they never want then he smiled and pressed my hand and answered in his cheerful way no need of that i have cared for them and so he had for when we looked among his papers all was in order not a debt remained and safely put away was enough to keep meg comfortable and independent then we knew why he had lived so plainly denied himself so many pleasures except that of charity and worked so hard that i fear he shortened his good life he never asked help for himself though often for others but bore his own burden and worked out his own task bravely and quietly no one can say a word of complaint against him so just and generous and kind was he and now when he is gone all find so much to love and praise and honor that i am proud to have been his friend and would rather leave my children the legacy he leaves his than the largest fortune ever made yes simple generous goodness is the best capital to found the business of this life upon it lasts when fame and money fail and is the only riches we can take out of this world with us remember that my boys and if you want to earn respect and confidence and love follow in the footsteps of john brooke  when demi returned to school after some weeks at home he seemed to have recovered from his loss with the blessed elasticity of childhood and so he had in a measure but he did not forget for his was a nature into which things sank deeply to be pondered over and absorbed into the soil where the small virtues were growing fast he played and studied worked and sang just as before and few suspected any change but there was one and aunt jo saw it for she watched over the boy with her whole heart trying to fill johns place in her poor way he seldom spoke of his loss but aunt jo often heard a stifled sobbing in the little bed at night and when she went to comfort him all his cry was i want my father oh i want my father for the tie between the two had been a very tender one and the childs heart bled when it was broken but time was kind to him and slowly he came to feel that father was not lost only invisible for a while and sure to be found again well and strong and fond as ever even though his little son should see the purple asters blossom on his grave many many times before they met to this belief demi held fast and in it found both help and comfort because it led him unconsciously through a tender longing for the father whom he had seen to a childlike trust in the father whom he had not seen both were in heaven and he prayed to both trying to be good for love of them  the outward change corresponded to the inward for in those few weeks demi seemed to have grown tall and began to drop his childish plays not as if ashamed of them as some boys do but as if he had outgrown them and wanted something manlier he took to the hated arithmetic and held on so steadily that his uncle was charmed though he could not understand the whim until demi said  i am going to be a bookkeeper when i grow up like papa and i must know about figures and things else i cant have nice neat ledgers like his  at another time he came to his aunt with a very serious face and said  what can a small boy do to earn money  why do you ask my deary  my father told me to take care of mother and the little girls and i want to but i dont know how to begin  he did not mean now demi but by and by when you are large  but i wish to begin now if i can because i think i ought to make some money to buy things for the family i am ten and other boys no bigger than i earn pennies sometimes  well then suppose you rake up all the dead leaves and cover the strawberry bed ill pay you a dollar for the job said aunt jo  isnt that a great deal i could do it in one day you must be fair and no pay too much because i want to truly earn it  my little john i will be fair and not pay a penny too much dont work too hard and when that is done i will have something else for you to do said mrs jo much touched by his desire to help and his sense of justice so like his scrupulous father  when the leaves were done many barrowloads of chips were wheeled from the wood to the shed and another dollar earned then demi helped cover the schoolbooks working in the evenings under franzs direction tugging patiently away at each book letting no one help and receiving his wages with such satisfaction that the dingy bills became quite glorified in his sight  now i have a dollar for each of them and i should like to take my money to mother all myself so she can see that i have minded my father  so demi made a duteous pilgrimage to his mother who received his little earnings as a treasure of great worth and would have kept it untouched if demi had not begged her to buy some useful thing for herself and the womenchildren whom he felt were left to his care  this made him very happy and though he often forgot his responsibilities for a time the desire to help was still there strengthening with his years he always uttered the words my father with an air of gentle pride and often said as if he claimed a title full of honor dont call me demi any more i am john brooke now so strengthened by a purpose and a hope the little lad of ten bravely began the world and entered into his inheritance the memory of a wise and tender father the legacy of an honest name    chapter xx round the fire  with the october frosts came the cheery fires in the great fireplaces and demis dry pinechips helped dans oakknots to blaze royally and go roaring up the chimney with a jolly sound all were glad to gather round the hearth as the evenings grew longer to play games read or lay plans for the winter but the favorite amusement was storytelling and mr and mrs bhaer were expected to have a store of lively tales always on hand their supply occasionally gave out and then the boys were thrown upon their own resources which were not always successful ghostparties were the rage at one time for the fun of the thing consisted in putting out the lights letting the fire die down and then sitting in the dark and telling the most awful tales they could invent as this resulted in scares of all sorts among the boys tommys walking in his sleep on the shed roof and a general state of nervousness in the little ones it was forbidden and they fell back on more harmless amusements  one evening when the small boys were snugly tucked in bed and the older lads were lounging about the schoolroom fire trying to decide what they should do demi suggested a new way of settling the question  seizing the hearthbrush he marched up and down the room saying row row row and when the boys laughing and pushing had got into line he said now ill give you two minutes to think of a play franz was writing and emil reading the life of lord nelson and neither joined the party but the others thought hard and when the time was up were ready to reply  now tom and the poker softly rapped him on the head  blindmans buff  jack  commerce a good round game and have cents for the pool  uncle forbids our playing for money dan what do you want  lets have a battle between the greeks and romans  stuffy  roast apples pop corn and crack nuts  good good cried several and when the vote was taken stuffys proposal carried the day  some went to the cellar for apples some to the garret for nuts and others looked up the popper and the corn  we had better ask the girls to come in hadnt we said demi in a sudden fit of politeness  daisy pricks chestnuts beautifully put in nat who wanted his little friend to share the fun  nan pops corn tiptop we must have her added tommy  bring in your sweethearts then we dont mind said jack who laughed at the innocent regard the little people had for one another  you shant call my sister a sweetheart it is so silly cried demi in a way that made jack laugh  she is nats darling isnt she old chirper  yes if demi dont mind i cant help being fond of her she is so good to me answered nat with bashful earnestness for jacks rough ways disturbed him  nan is my sweetheart and i shall marry her in about a year so dont you get in the way any of you said tommy stoutly for he and nan had settled their future childfashion and were to live in the willow lower down a basket for food and do other charmingly impossible things  demi was quenched by the decision of bangs who took him by the arm and walked him off to get the ladies nan and daisy were sewing with aunt jo on certain small garments for mrs carneys newest baby  please maam could you lend us the girls for a little while well be very careful of them said tommy winking one eye to express apples snapping his fingers to signify popcorn and gnashing his teeth to convey the idea of nutcracking  the girls understood this pantomime at once and began to pull of their thimbles before mrs jo could decide whether tommy was going into convulsions or was brewing some unusual piece of mischief demi explained with elaboration permission was readily granted and the boys departed with their prize  dont you speak to jack whispered tommy as he and nan promenaded down the hall to get a fork to prick the apples  why not  he laughs at me so i dont wish you to have any thing to do with him  shall if i like said nan promptly resenting this premature assumption of authority on the part of her lord  then i wont have you for my sweetheart  i dont care  why nan i thought you were fond of me and tommys voice was full of tender reproach  if you mind jacks laughing i dont care for you one bit  then you may take back your old ring i wont wear it any longer and tommy plucked off a horsehair pledge of affection which nan had given him in return for one made of a lobsters feeler  i shall give it to ned was her cruel reply for ned liked mrs giddygaddy and had turned her clothespins boxes and spools enough to set up housekeeping with  tommy said thunder turtles as the only vent equal to the pentup anguish of the moment and dropping nans arm retired in high dudgeon leaving her to follow with the fork a neglect which naughty nan punished by proceeding to prick his heart with jealousy as if it were another sort of apple  the hearth was swept and the rosy baldwins put down to roast a shovel was heated and the chestnuts danced merrily upon it while the corn popped wildly in its wire prison dan cracked his best walnuts and every one chattered and laughed while the rain beat on the windowpane and the wind howled round the house  why is billy like this nut asked emil who was frequently inspired with bad conundrums  because he is cracked answered ned  thats not fair you mustnt make fun of billy because he cant hit back again its mean cried dan smashing a nut wrathfully  to what family of insects does blake belong asked peacemaker franz seeing that emil looked ashamed and dan lowering  gnats answered jack  why is daisy like a bee cried nat who had been wrapt in thought for several minutes  because she is queen of the hive said dan  no  because she is sweet  bees are not sweet  give it up  because she makes sweet things is always busy and likes flowers said nat piling up his boyish compliments till daisy blushed like a rosy clover  why is nan like a hornet demanded tommy glowering at her and adding without giving any one time to answer because she isnt sweet makes a great buzzing about nothing and stings like fury  tommys mad and im glad cried ned as nan tossed her head and answered quickly  what thing in the chinacloset is tom like  a pepper pot answered ned giving nan a nut meat with a tantalizing laugh that made tommy feel as if he would like to bounce up like a hot chestnut and hit somebody  seeing that illhumor was getting the better of the small supply of wit in the company franz cast himself into the breach again  lets make a law that the first person who comes into the room shall tell us a story no matter who it is he must do it and it will be fun to see who comes first  the others agreed and did not have to wait long for a heavy step soon came clumping through the hall and silas appeared bearing an armful of wood he was greeted by a general shout and stood staring about him with a bewildered grin on his big red face till franz explained the joke  sho i cant tell a story he said putting down his load and preparing to leave the room but the boys fell upon him forced him into a seat and held him there laughing and clamoring for their story till the goodnatured giant was overpowered  i dont know but jest one story and thats about a horse he said much flattered by the reception he received  tell it tell it cried the boys  wal began silas tipping his chair back against the wall and putting his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat i jined a cavalry regiment durin the war and see a considable amount of fightin my horse major was a fustrate animal and i was as fond on him as ef hed ben a human critter he warnt harnsome but he was the besttempered stiddyest lovenest brute i ever see i fust battle we went into he gave me a lesson that i didnt forgit in a hurry and ill tell you how it was it aint no use tryin to picter the noise and hurry and general horridness of a battle to you young fellers for i aint no words to do it in but im free to confess that i got so sort of confused and upset at the fust on it that i didnt know what i was about we was ordered to charge and went ahead like good ones never stoppin to pick up them that went down in the scrimmage i got a shot in the arm and was pitched out of the saddle dont know how but there i was left behind with two or three others dead and wounded for the rest went on as i say wal i picked myself up and looked round for major feeling as ef id had about enough for that spell i didnt see him nowhere and was kinder walking back to camp when i heard a whinny that sounded nateral i looked round and there was major stopping for me a long way off and lookin as ef he didnt understand why i was loiterin behind i whistled and he trotted up to me as id trained him to do i mounted as well as i could with my left arm bleedin and was for going on to camp for i declare i felt as sick and wimbly as a woman folks often do in their fust battle but no sir major was the bravest of the two and he wouldnt go not a peg he jest rared up and danced and snorted and acted as ef the smell of powder and the noise had drove him half wild i done my best but he wouldnt give in so i did and what do you think that plucky brute done he wheeled slap round and galloped back like a hurricane right into the thickest of the scrimmage  good for him cried dan excitedly while the other boys forgot apples and nuts in their interest  i wish i may die ef i warnt ashamed of myself continued silas warming up at the recollection of that day i was mad as a hornet and i forgot my waound and jest pitched in rampagin raound like fury till there come a shell into the midst of us and in bustin knocked a lot of us flat i didnt know nothin for a spell and when i cometo the fight was over just there and i found myself layin by a wall of poor major longside wuss wounded than i was my leg was broke and i had a ball in my shoulder but he poor old feller was all tore in the side with a piece of that blasted shell  o silas what did you do cried nan pressing close to him with a face full of eager sympathy and interest  i dragged myself nigher and tried to stop the bleedin with sech rags as i could tear off of me with one hand but it warnt no use and he lay moanin with horrid pain and lookin at me with them lovin eyes of his till i thought i couldnt bear it i give him all the help i could and when the sun got hotter and hotter and he began to lap out his tongue i tried to get to a brook that was a good piece away but i couldnt do it being stiff and faint so i give it up and fanned him with my hat now you listen to this and when you hear folks comin down on the rebs you jest remember what one on em did and give him credit of it i poor feller in gray laid not fur off shot through the lungs and dyin fast id offered him my handkerchief to keep the sun off his face and hed thanked me kindly for in sech times as that men dont stop to think on which side they belong but jest buckleto and help one another when he see me mournin over major and tryin to ease his pain he looked up with his face all damp and white with sufferin and sez he theres water in my canteen take it for it cant help me and he flung it to me i couldnt have took it ef i hadnt had a little brandy in a pocket flask and i made him drink it it done him good and i felt as much set up as if id drunk it myself its surprisin the good sech little things do folks sometime and silas paused as if he felt again the comfort of that moment when he and his enemy forgot their feud and helped one another like brothers  tell about major cried the boys impatient for the catastrophe  i poured the water over his poor pantin tongue and ef ever a dumb critter looked grateful he did then but it warnt of much use for the dreadful waound kep on tormentin him till i couldnt bear it any longer it was hard but i done it in mercy and i know he forgive me  what did you do asked emil as silas stopped abruptly with a loud hem and a look in his rough face that made daisy go and stand by him with her little hand on his knee  i shot him  quite a thrill went through the listeners as silas said that for major seemed a hero in their eyes and his tragic end roused all their sympathy  yes i shot him and put him out of his misery i patted him fust and said goodby then i laid his head easy on the grass give a last look into his lovin eyes and sent a bullet through his head he hardly stirred i aimed so true and when i seen him quite still with no more moanin and pain i was glad and yet wal i dont know as i need by ashamed ont i jest put my arms raound his neck and boohooed like a great baby sho i didnt know i was sech a fool and silas drew his sleeve across his eyes as much touched by daisys sob as by the memory of faithful major  no one spoke for a minute because the boys were as quick to feel the pathos of the little story as tenderhearted daisy though they did not show it by crying  id like a horse like that said dan halfaloud  did the rebel man die too asked nan anxiously  not then we laid there all day and at night some of our fellers came to look after the missing ones they natrally wanted to take me fust but i knew i could wait and the rebel had but one chance maybe so i made them carry him off right away he had jest strength enough to hold out his hand to me and say thanky comrade and them was the last words he spoke for he died an hour after he got to the hospitaltent  how glad you must have been that you were kind to him said demi who was deeply impressed by this story  wal i did take comfort thinkin of it as i laid there alone for a number of hours with my head on majors neck and see the moon come up id like to have buried the poor beast decent but it warnt possible so i cut off a bit of his mane and ive kep it ever sence want to see it sissy  oh yes please answered daisy wiping away her tears to look  silas took out an old wallet as he called his pocketbook and produced from an inner fold a bit of brown paper in which was a rough lock of white horsehair the children looked at it silently as it lay in the broad palm and no one found any thing to ridicule in the love silas bore his good horse major  that is a sweet story and i like it though it did make me cry thank you very much si and daisy helped him fold and put away his little relic while nan stuffed a handful of popcorn into his pocket and the boys loudly expressed their flattering opinions of his story feeling that there had been two heroes in it  he departed quite overcome by his honors and the little conspirators talked the tale over while they waited for their next victim it was mrs jo who came in to measure nan for some new pinafores she was making for her they let her get well in and then pounced upon her telling her the law and demanding the story mrs jo was very much amused at the new trap and consented at once for the sound of happy voices had been coming across the hall so pleasantly that she quite longed to join them and forget her own anxious thoughts of sister meg  am i the first mouse you have caught you sly pussiesinboots she asked as she was conducted to the big chair supplied with refreshments and surrounded by a flock of merryfaced listeners  they told her about silas and his contribution and she slapped her forehead in despair for she was quite at her wits end being called upon so unexpectedly for a bran new tale  what shall i tell about she said  boys was the general answer  have a party in it said daisy  and something good to eat added stuffy  that reminds me of a story written years ago by a dear old lady i used to be very fond of it and i fancy you will like it for it has both boys and something good to eat in it  what is it called asked demi  the suspected boy  nat looked up from the nuts he was picking and mrs jo smiled at him guessing what was in his mind  miss crane kept a school for boys in a quiet little town and a very good school it was of the oldfashioned sort six boys lived in her house and four or five more came in from the town among those who lived with her was one named lewis white lewis was not a bad boy but rather timid and now and then he told a lie one day a neighbor sent miss crane a basket of gooseberries there were not enough to go round so kind miss crane who liked to please her boys went to work and made a dozen nice little gooseberry tarts  id like to try gooseberry tarts i wonder if she made them as i do my raspberry ones said daisy whose interest in cooking had lately revived  hush said nat tucking a plump popcorn into her mouth to silence her for he felt a particular interest in this tale and thought it opened well  when the tarts were done miss crane put them away in the best parlor closet and said not a word about them for she wanted to surprise the boys at teatime when the minute came and all were seated at table she went to get her tarts but came back looking much troubled for what do you think had happened  somebody had hooked them cried ned  no there they were but some one had stolen all the fruit out of them by lifting up the upper crust and then putting it down after the gooseberry had been scraped out  what a mean trick and nan looked at tommy as if to imply that he would do the same  when she told the boys her plan and showed them the poor little patties all robbed of their sweetness the boys were much grieved and disappointed and all declared that they knew nothing about the matter perhaps the rats did it said lewis who was among the loudest to deny any knowledge of the tarts no rats would have nibbled crust and all and never lifted it up and scooped out the fruit hands did that said miss crane who was more troubled about the lie that some one must have told than about her lost patties well they had supper and went to bed but in the night miss crane heard some one groaning and going to see who it was she found lewis in great pain he had evidently eaten something that disagreed with him and was so sick that miss crane was alarmed and was going to send for the doctor when lewis moaned out its the gooseberries i ate them and i must tell before i die for the thought of a doctor frightened him if that is all ill give you an emetic and you will soon get over it said miss crane so lewis had a good dose and by morning was quite comfortable oh dont tell the boys they will laugh at me so begged the invalid kind miss crane promised not to but sally the girl told the story and poor lewis had no peace for a long time his mates called him old gooseberry and were never tired of asking him the price of tarts  served him right said emil  badness always gets found out added demi morally  no it dont muttered jack who was tending the apples with great devotion so that he might keep his back to the rest and account for his red face  is that all asked dan  no that is only the first part the second part is more interesting some time after this a peddler came by one day and stopped to show his things to the boys several of whom bought pocketcombs jewsharps and various trifles of that sort among the knives was a little whitehandled penknife that lewis wanted very much but he had spent all his pocketmoney and no one had any to lend him he held the knife in his hand admiring and longing for it till the man packed up his goods to go then he reluctantly laid it down and the man went on his way the next day however the peddler returned to say that he could not find that very knife and thought he must have left it at miss cranes it was a very nice one with a pearl handle and he could not afford to lose it every one looked and every one declared they knew nothing about it this young gentleman had it last and seemed to want it very much are you quite sure you put it back said the man to lewis who was much troubled at the loss and vowed over and over again that he did return it his denials seemed to do no good however for every one was sure he had taken it and after a stormy scene miss crane paid for it and the man went grumbling away  did lewis have it cried nat much excited  you will see now poor lewis had another trial to bear for the boys were constantly saying lend me your pearlhandled knife gooseberry and things of that sort till lewis was so unhappy he begged to be sent home miss crane did her best to keep the boys quiet but it was hard work for they would tease and she could not be with them all the time that is one of the hardest things to teach boys they wont hit a fellow when he is down as they say but they will torment him in little ways till he would thank them to fight it out all round  i know that said dan  so do i added nat softly  jack said nothing but he quite agreed for he knew that the elder boys despised him and let him alone for that very reason  do go on about poor lewis aunt jo i dont believe he took the knife but i want to be sure said daisy in great anxiety  well week after week went on and the matter was not cleared up the boys avoided lewis and he poor fellow was almost sick with the trouble he had brought upon himself he resolved never to tell another lie and tried so hard that miss crane pitied and helped him and really came at last to believe that he did not take the knife two months after the peddlers first visit he came again and the first thing he said was  well maam i found that knife after all it had slipped behind the lining of my valise and fell out the other day when i was putting in a new stock of goods i thought id call and let you know as you paid for it and maybe would like it so here it is  the boys had all gathered round and at these words they felt much ashamed and begged lewis pardon so heartily that he could not refuse to give it miss crane presented the knife to him and he kept it many years to remind him of the fault that had brought him so much trouble  i wonder why it is that things you eat on the sly hurt you and dont when you eat them at table observed stuffy thoughtfully  perhaps your conscience affects your stomach said mrs jo smiling at his speech  he is thinking of the cucumbers said ned and a gale of merriment followed the words for stuffys last mishap had been a funny one  he ate two large cucumbers in private felt very ill and confided his anguish to ned imploring him to do something ned goodnaturedly recommended a mustard plaster and a hot flat iron to the feet only in applying these remedies he reversed the order of things and put the plaster on the feet the flat iron on the stomach and poor stuffy was found in the barn with blistered soles and a scorched jacket  suppose you tell another story that was such an interesting one said nat as the laughter subsided  before mrs jo could refuse these insatiable oliver twists rob walked into the room trailing his little bedcover after him and wearing an expression of great sweetness as he said steering straight to his mother as a sure haven of refuge  i heard a great noise and i thought sumfin dreffle might have happened so i came to see  did you think i would forget you naughty boy asked his mother trying to look stern  no but i thought youd feel better to see me right here responded the insinuating little party  i had much rather see you in bed so march straight up again robin  everybody that comes in here has to tell a story and you cant so youd better cut and run said emil  yes i can i tell teddy lots of ones all about bears and moons and little flies that say things when they buzz protested rob bound to stay at any price  tell one now then right away said dan preparing to shoulder and bear him off  well i will let me fink a minute and rob climbed into his mothers lap where he was cuddled with the remark  it is a family failing this getting out of bed at wrong times demi used to do it and as for me i was hopping in and out all night long meg used to think the house was on fire and send me down to see and i used to stay and enjoy myself as you mean to my bad son  ive finked now observed rob quite at his ease and eager to win the entree into this delightful circle  every one looked and listened with faces full of suppressed merriment as rob perched on his mothers knee and wrapped in the gay coverlet told the following brief but tragic tale with an earnestness that made it very funny  once a lady had a million children and one nice little boy she went upstairs and said you mustnt go in the yard but he wented and fell into the pump and was drowned dead  is that all asked franz as rob paused out of breath with this startling beginning  no there is another piece of it and rob knit his downy eyebrows in the effort to evolve another inspiration  what did the lady do when he fell into the pump asked his mother to help him on  oh she pumped him up and wrapped him in a newspaper and put him on a shelf to dry for seed  a general explosion of laughter greeted this surprising conclusion and mrs jo patted the curly head as she said solemnly  my son you inherit your mothers gift of storytelling go where glory waits thee  now i can stay cant i wasnt it a good story cried rob in high feather at his superb success  you can stay till you have eaten these twelve popcorns said his mother expecting to see them vanish at one mouthful  but rob was a shrewd little man and got the better of her by eating them one by one very slowly and enjoying every minute with all his might  hadnt you better tell the other story while you wait for him said demi anxious that no time should be lost  i really have nothing but a little tale about a woodbox said mrs jo seeing that rob had still seven corns to eat  is there a boy in it  it is all boy  is it true asked demi  every bit of it  goody tell on please  james snow and his mother lived in a little house up in new hampshire they were poor and james had to work to help his mother but he loved books so well he hated work and just wanted to sit and study all day long  how could he i hate books and like work said dan objecting to james at the very outset  it takes all sorts of people to make a world workers and students both are needed and there is room for all but i think the workers should study some and the students should know how to work if necessary answered mrs jo looking from dan to demi with a significant expression  im sure i do work and demi showed three small hard spots in his little palm with pride  and im sure i study added dan nodding with a groan toward the blackboard full of neat figures  see what james did he did not mean to be selfish but his mother was proud of him and let him do as he liked working by herself that he might have books and time to read them one autumn james wanted to go to school and went to the minister to see if he would help him about decent clothes and books now the minister had heard the gossip about jamess idleness and was not inclined to do much for him thinking that a boy who neglected his mother and let her slave for him was not likely to do very well even at school but the good man felt more interested when he found how earnest james was and being rather an odd man he made this proposal to the boy to try now sincere he was  i will give you clothes and books on one condition james  what is that sir and the boy brightened up at once  you are to keep your mothers woodbox full all winter long and do it yourself if you fail school stops james laughed at the queer condition and readily agreed to it thinking it a very easy one  he began school and for a time got on capitally with the woodbox for it was autumn and chips and brushwood were plentiful he ran out morning and evening and got a basket full or chopped up the cat sticks for the little cooking stove and as his mother was careful and saving the task was not hard but in november the frost came the days were dull and cold and wood went fast his mother bought a load with her own earnings but it seemed to melt away and was nearly gone before james remembered that he was to get the next mrs snow was feeble and lame with rheumatism and unable to work as she had done so james had to put down the books and see what he could do  it was hard for he was going on well and so interested in his lessons that he hated to stop except for food and sleep but he knew the minister would keep his word and much against his will james set about earning money in his spare hours lest the woodbox should get empty he did all sorts of things ran errands took care of a neighbors cow helped the old sexton dust and warm the church on sundays and in these ways got enough to buy fuel in small quantities but it was hard work the days were short the winter was bitterly cold and precious time went fast and the dear books were so fascinating that it was sad to leave them for dull duties that never seemed done  the minister watched him quietly and seeing that he was in earnest helped him without his knowledge he met him often driving the wood sleds from the forest where the men were chopping and as james plodded beside the slow oxen he read or studied anxious to use every minute the boy is worth helping this lesson will do him good and when he has learned it i will give him an easier one said the minister to himself and on christmas eve a splendid load of wood was quietly dropped at the door of the little house with a new saw and a bit of paper saying only  the lord helps those who help themselves  poor james expected nothing but when he woke on that cold christmas morning he found a pair of warm mittens knit by his mother with her stiff painful fingers this gift pleased him very much but her kiss and tender look as she called him her good son was better still in trying to keep her warm he had warmed his own heart you see and in filling the woodbox he had also filled those months with duties faithfully done he began to see this to feel that there was something better than books and to try to learn the lessons god set him as well as those his schoolmaster gave  when he saw the great pile of oak and pine logs at his door and read the little paper he knew who sent it and understood the ministers plan thanked him for it and fell to work with all his might other boys frolicked that day but james sawed wood and i think of all the lads in the town the happiest was the one in the new mittens who whistled like a blackbird as he filled his mothers woodbox  thats a first rater cried dan who enjoyed a simple matterofface story better than the finest fairy tale i like that fellow after all  i could saw wood for you aunt jo said demi feeling as if a new means of earning money for his mother was suggested by the story  tell about a bad boy i like them best said nan  youd better tell about a naughty crosspatch of a girl said tommy whose evening had been spoilt by nans unkindness it made his apple taste bitter his popcorn was insipid his nuts were hard to crack and the sight of ned and nan on one bench made him feel his life a burden  but there were no more stories from mrs jo for on looking down at rob he was discovered to be fast asleep with his last corn firmly clasped in his chubby hand bundling him up in his coverlet his mother carried him away and tucked him up with no fear of his popping out again  now lets see who will come next said emil setting the door temptingly ajar  mary ann passed first and he called out to her but silas had warned her and she only laughed and hurried on in spite of their enticements presently a door opened and a strong voice was heard humming in the hall       ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten      dass ich so traurig bin  its uncle fritz all laugh loud and he will be sure to come in said emil  a wild burst of laughter followed and in came uncle fritz asking what is the joke my lads  caught caught you cant go out till youve told a story cried the boys slamming the door  so that is the joke then well i have no wish to go it is so pleasant here and i pay my forfeit at once which he did by sitting down and beginning instantly  a long time ago your grandfather demi went to lecture in a great town hoping to get some money for a home for little orphans that some good people were getting up his lecture did well and he put a considerable sum of money in his pocket feeling very happy about it as he was driving in a chaise to another town he came to a lonely bit of road late in the afternoon and was just thinking what a good place it was for robbers when he saw a badlooking man come out of the woods in front of him and go slowly along as if waiting till he came up the thought of the money made grandfather rather anxious and at first he had a mind to turn round and drive away but the horse was tired and then he did not like to suspect the man so he kept on and when he got nearer and saw how poor and sick and ragged the stranger looked his heart reproached him and stopping he said in a kind voice  my friend you look tired let me give you a lift the man seemed surprised hesitated a minute and then got in he did not seem inclined to talk but grandfather kept on in his wise cheerful way speaking of what a hard year it had been how much the poor had suffered and how difficult it was to get on sometimes the man slowly softened a little and won by the kind chat told his story how he had been sick could get no work had a family of children and was almost in despair grandfather was so full of pity that he forgot his fear and asking the man his name said he would try to get him work in the next town as he had friends there wishing to get at pencil and paper to write down the address grandfather took out his plump pocketbook and the minute he did so the mans eye was on it then grandfather remembered what was in it and trembled for his money but said quietly  yes i have a little sum here for some poor orphans i wish it was my own i would so gladly give you some of it i am not rich but i know many of the trials of the poor this five dollars is mine and i want to give it to you for your children  the hard hungry look in the mans eyes changed to a grateful one as he took the small sum freely given and left the orphans money untouched he rode on with grandfather till they approached the town then he asked to be set down grandpa shook hands with him and was about to drive on when the man said as if something made him i was desperate when we met and i meant to rob you but you were so kind i couldnt do it god bless you sir for keeping me from it  did grandpa ever see him again asked daisy eagerly  no but i believe the man found work and did not try robbery any more  that was a curious way to treat him id have knocked him down said dan  kindness is always better than force try it and see answered mr bhaer rising  tell another please cried daisy  you must aunt jo did added demi  then i certainly wont but keep my others for next time too many tales are as bad as too many bonbons i have paid my forfeit and i go and mr bhaer ran for his life with the whole flock in full pursuit he had the start however and escaped safely into his study leaving the boys to go rioting back again  they were so stirred up by the race that they could not settle to their former quiet and a lively game of blindmans buff followed in which tommy showed that he had taken the moral of the last story to heart for when he caught nan he whispered in her ear im sorry i called you a crosspatch  nan was not to be outdone in kindness so when they played button button whos got the button and it was her turn to go round she said hold fast all i give you with such a friendly smile at tommy that he was not surprised to find the horsehair ring in his hand instead of the button he only smiled back at her then but when they were going to bed he offered nan the best bite of his last apple she saw the ring on his stumpy little finger accepted the bite and peace was declared both were ashamed of the temporary coldness neither was ashamed to say i was wrong forgive me so the childish friendship remained unbroken and the home in the willow lasted long a pleasant little castle in the air    chapter xxi thanksgiving  this yearly festival was always kept at plumfield in the good oldfashioned way and nothing was allowed to interfere with it for days beforehand the little girls helped asia and mrs jo in storeroom and kitchen making pies and puddings sorting fruit dusting dishes and being very busy and immensely important the boys hovered on the outskirts of the forbidden ground sniffing the savory odors peeping in at the mysterious performances and occasionally being permitted to taste some delicacy in the process of preparation  something more than usual seemed to be on foot this year for the girls were as busy upstairs as down so were the boys in schoolroom and barn and a general air of bustle pervaded the house there was a great hunting up of old ribbons and finery much cutting and pasting of gold paper and the most remarkable quantity of straw gray cotton flannel and big black beads used by franz and mrs jo ned hammered at strange machines in the workshop demi and tommy went about murmuring to themselves as if learning something a fearful racket was heard in emils room at intervals and peals of laughter from the nursery when rob and teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time but the thing that puzzled mr bhaer the most was what became of robs big pumpkin it had been borne in triumph to the kitchen where a dozen goldentinted pies soon after appeared it would not have taken more than a quarter of the mammoth vegetable to make them yet where was the rest it disappeared and rob never seemed to care only chuckled when it was mentioned and told his father to wait and see for the fun of the whole thing was to surprise father bhaer at the end and not let him know a bit about what was to happen  he obediently shut eyes ears and mouth and went about trying not to see what was in plain sight not to hear the telltale sounds that filled the air not to understand any of the perfectly transparent mysteries going on all about him being a german he loved these simple domestic festivals and encouraged them with all his heart for they made home so pleasant that the boys did not care to go elsewhere for fun  when at last the day came the boys went off for a long walk that they might have good appetites for dinner as if they ever needed them the girls remained at home to help set the table and give last touches to various affairs which filled their busy little souls with anxiety the schoolroom had been shut up since the night before and mr bhaer was forbidden to enter it on pain of a beating from teddy who guarded the door like a small dragon though he was dying to tell about it and nothing but his fathers heroic selfdenial in not listening kept him from betraying a grand secret  its all done and its perfectly splendid cried nan coming out at last with an air of triumph  the you know goes beautifully and silas knows just what to do now added daisy skipping with delight at some unspeakable success  im blest if it aint the cutest thing i ever see them critters in particular said silas who had been let into the secret went off laughing like a great boy  they are coming i hear emil roaring land lubbers lying down below so we must run and dress cried nan and upstairs they scampered in a great hurry  the boys came trooping home with appetites that would have made the big turkey tremble if it had not been past all fear they also retired to dress and for halfanhour there was a washing brushing and prinking that would have done any tidy womans heart good to see when the bell rang a troop of freshfaced lads with shiny hair clean collars and sunday jackets on filed into the diningroom where mrs jo in her one black silk with a knot of her favorite white chrysanthemums in her bosom sat at the head of the table looking splendid as the boys said whenever she got herself up daisy and nan were as gay as a posy bed in their new winter dresses with bright sashes and hair ribbons teddy was gorgeous to behold in a crimson merino blouse and his best button boots which absorbed and distracted him as much as mr toots wristbands did on one occasion  as mr and mrs bhaer glanced at each other down the long table with those rows of happy faces on either side they had a little thanksgiving all to themselves and without a word for one heart said to the other  our work has prospered let us be grateful and go on  the clatter of knives and forks prevented much conversation for a few minutes and mary ann with an amazing pink bow in her hair flew round briskly handing plates and ladling out gravy nearly every one had contributed to the feast so the dinner was a peculiarly interesting ones to the eaters of it who beguiled the pauses by remarks on their own productions  if these are not good potatoes i never saw any observed jack as he received his fourth big mealy one  some of my herbs are in the stuffing of the turkey thats why its so nice said nan taking a mouthful with intense satisfaction  my ducks are prime any way asia said she never cooked such fat ones added tommy  well our carrots are beautiful aint they and our parsnips will be ever so good when we dig them put in dick and dolly murmured his assent from behind the bone he was picking  i helped make the pies with my pumpkin called out robby with a laugh which he stopped by retiring into his mug  i picked some of the apples that the cider is made of said demi  i raked the cranberries for the sauce cried nat  i got the nuts added dan and so it went on all round the table  who made up thanksgiving asked rob for being lately promoted to jacket and trousers he felt a new and manly interest in the institutions of his country  see who can answer that question and mr bhaer nodded to one or two of his best history boys  i know said demi the pilgrims made it  what for asked rob without waiting to learn who the pilgrims were  i forget and demi subsided  i believe it was because they were starved once and so when they had a good harvest they said we will thank god for it and they had a day and called it thanksgiving said dan who liked the story of the brave men who suffered so nobly for their faith  good i didnt think you would remember any thing but natural history and mr bhaer tapped gently on the table as applause for his pupil  dan looked pleased and mrs jo said to her son now do you understand about it robby  no i dont i thought pilgrins were a sort of big bird that lived on rocks and i saw pictures of them in demis book  he means penguins oh isnt he a little goosey and demi laid back in his chair and laughed aloud  dont laugh at him but tell him all about it if you can said mrs bhaer consoling rob with more cranberry sauce for the general smile that went round the table at his mistake  well i will and after a pause to collect his ideas demi delivered the following sketch of the pilgrim fathers which would have made even those grave gentlemen smile if they could have heard it  you see rob some of the people in england didnt like the king or something so they got into ships and sailed away to this country it was all full of indians and bears and wild creatures and they lived in forts and had a dreadful time  the bears asked robby with interest  no the pilgrims because the indians troubled them they hadnt enough to eat and they went to church with guns and ever so many died and they got out of the ships on a rock and its called plymouth rock and aunt jo saw it and touched it the pilgrims killed all the indians and got rich and hung the witches and were very good and some of the greatest greatgrandpas came in the ships one was the mayflower and they made thanksgiving and we have it always and i like it some more turkey please  i think demi will be an historian there is such order and clearness in his account of events and uncle fritzs eyes laughed at aunt jo as he helped the descendant of the pilgrims to his third bit of turkey  i thought you must eat as much as ever you could on thanksgiving but franz says you mustnt even then and stuffy looked as if he had received bad news  franz is right so mind your knife and fork and be moderate or else you wont be able to help in the surprise by and by said mrs jo  ill be careful but everybody does eat lots and i like it better than being moderate said stuffy who leaned to the popular belief that thanksgiving must be kept by coming as near apoplexy as possible and escaping with merely a fit of indigestion or a headache  now my pilgrims amuse yourselves quietly till teatime for you will have enough excitement this evening said mrs jo as they rose from the table after a protracted sitting finished by drinking every ones health in cider  i think i will take the whole flock for a drive it is so pleasant then you can rest my dear or you will be worn out this evening added mr bhaer and as soon as coats and hats could be put on the great omnibus was packed full and away they went for a long gay drive leaving mrs jo to rest and finish sundry small affairs in peace  an early and light tea was followed by more brushing of hair and washing of hands then the flock waited impatiently for the company to come only the family was expected for these small revels were strictly domestic and such being the case sorrow was not allowed to sadden the present festival all came mr and mrs march with aunt meg so sweet and lovely in spite of her black dress and the little widows cap that encircled her tranquil face uncle teddy and aunt amy with the princess looking more fairylike than ever in a skyblue gown and a great bouquet of hothouse flowers which she divided among the boys sticking one in each buttonhole making them feel peculiarly elegant and festive one strange face appeared and uncle teddy led the unknown gentleman up to the bhaers saying  this is mr hyde he has been inquiring about dan and i ventured to bring him tonight that he might see how much the boy has improved  the bhaers received him cordially for dans sake pleased that the lad had been remembered but after a few minutes chat they were glad to know mr hyde for his own sake so genial simple and interesting was he it was pleasant to see the boys face light up when he caught sight of his friend pleasanter still to see mr hydes surprise and satisfaction in dans improved manners and appearance and pleasantest of all to watch the two sit talking in a corner forgetting the differences of age culture and position in the one subject which interested both as man and boy compared notes and told the story of their summer life  the performance must begin soon or the actors will go to sleep said mrs jo when the first greetings were over  so every one went into the schoolroom and took seats before a curtain made of two bedcovers the children had already vanished but stifled laughter and funny little exclamations from behind the curtain betrayed their whereabouts the entertainment began with a spirited exhibition of gymnastics led by franz the six elder lads in blue trousers and red shirts made a fine display of muscle with dumbbells clubs and weights keeping time to the music of the piano played by mrs jo behind the scenes dan was so energetic in this exercise that there was some danger of his knocking down his neighbors like so many ninepins or sending his beanbags whizzing among the audience for he was excited by mr hydes presence and a burning desire to do honor to his teachers  a fine strong lad if i go on my trip to south america in a year or two i shall be tempted to ask you to lend him to me mr bhaer said mr hyde whose interest in dan was much increased by the report he had just heard of him  you shall have him and welcome though we shall miss our young hercules very much it would do him a world of good and i am sure he would serve his friend faithfully  dan heard both question and answer and his heart leaped with joy at the thought of travelling in a new country with mr hyde and swelled with gratitude for the kindly commendation which rewarded his efforts to be all these friends desired to see him  after the gymnastics demi and tommy spoke the old school dialogue money makes the mare go demi did very well but tommy was capital as the old farmer for he imitated silas in a way that convulsed the audience and caused silas himself to laugh so hard that asia had to slap him on the back as they stood in the hall enjoying the fun immensely  then emil who had got his breath by this time gave them a seasong in costume with a great deal about stormy winds lee shores and a rousing chorus of luff boys luff which made the room ring after which ned performed a funny chinese dance and hopped about like a large frog in a pagoda hat as this was the only public exhibition ever held at plumfield a few exercises in lightningarithmetic spelling and reading were given jack quite amazed the public by his rapid calculations on the blackboard tommy won in the spelling match and demi read a little french fable so well that uncle teddy was charmed  where are the other children asked every one as the curtain fell and none of the little ones appeared  oh that is the surprise its so lovely i pity you because you dont know it said demi who had gone to get his mothers kiss and stayed by her to explain the mystery when it should be revealed  goldilocks had been carried off by aunt jo to the great amazement of her papa who quite outdid mr bhaer in acting wonder suspense and wild impatience to know what was going to happen  at last after much rustling hammering and very audible directions from the stage manager the curtain rose to soft music and bess was discovered sitting on a stool beside a brown paper fireplace a dearer little cinderella was never seen for the gray gown was very ragged the tiny shoes all worn the face so pretty under the bright hair and the attitude so dejected it brought tears as well as smiles to the fond eyes looking at the baby actress she sat quite still till a voice whispered now then she sighed a funny little sigh and said oh i wish i tood go to the ball so naturally that her father clapped frantically and her mother called out little darling these highly improper expressions of feeling caused cinderella to forget herself and shake her head at them saying reprovingly you mustnt peak to me  silence instantly prevailed and three taps were heard on the wall cinderella looked alarmed but before she could remember to say what is dat the back of the brown paper fireplace opened like a door and with some difficulty the fairy godmother got herself and her pointed hat through it was nan in a red cloak a cap and a wand which she waved as she said decidedly  you shall go to the ball my dear  now you must pull and show my pretty dress returned cinderella tugging at her brown gown  no no you must say how can i go in my rags said the godmother in her own voice  oh yes so i mus and the princess said it quite undisturbed by her forgetfulness  i change your rags into a splendid dress because you are good said the godmother in her stage tones and deliberately unbuttoning the brown pinafore she displayed a gorgeous sight  the little princess really was pretty enough to turn the heads of any number of small princes for her mamma had dressed her like a tiny court lady in a rosy silk train with satin underskirt and bits of bouquets here and there quite lovely to behold the godmother put a crown with pink and white feathers drooping from it on her head and gave her a pair of silver paper slippers which she put on and then stood up lifting her skirts to show them to the audience saying with pride my dlass ones aint they pitty  she was so charmed with them that she was with difficulty recalled to her part and made to say  but i have no toach dodmother  behold it and nan waved her wand with such a flourish that she nearly knocked off the crown of the princess  then appeared the grand triumph of the piece first a rope was seen to flap on the floor to tighten with a twitch as emils voice was heard to say heave ahoy and silass gruff one to reply stiddy now stiddy a shout of laughter followed for four large gray rats appeared rather shaky as to their legs and queer as to their tails but quite fine about the head where black beads shone in the most lifelike manner they drew or were intended to appear as if they did a magnificent coach made of half the mammoth pumpkin mounted on the wheels of teddys wagon painted yellow to match the gay carriage perched on a seat in front sat a jolly little coachman in a white cottonwool wig cocked hat scarlet breeches and laced coat who cracked a long whip and jerked the red reins so energetically that the gray steeds reared finely it was teddy and he beamed upon the company so affably that they gave him a round all to himself and uncle laurie said if i could find as sober a coachman as that one i would engage him on the spot the coach stopped the godmother lifted in the princess and she was trundled away in state kissing her hand to the public with her glass shoes sticking up in front and her pink train sweeping the ground behind for elegant as the coach was i regret to say that her highness was rather a tight fit  the next scene was the ball and here nan and daisy appeared as gay as peacocks in all sorts of finery nan was especially good as the proud sister and crushed many imaginary ladies as she swept about the palacehall the prince in solitary state upon a somewhat unsteady throne sat gazing about him from under an imposing crown as he played with his sword and admired the rosettes in his shoes when cinderella came in he jumped up and exclaimed with more warmth than elegance  my gracious who is that and immediately led the lady out to dance while the sisters scowled and turned up their noses in the corner  the stately jig executed by the little couple was very pretty for the childish faces were so earnest the costumes so gay and the steps so peculiar that they looked like the dainty quaint figures painted on a watteau fan the princesss train was very much in her way and the sword of prince rob nearly tripped him up several times but they overcame these obstacles remarkably well and finished the dance with much grace and spirit considering that neither knew what the other was about  drop your shoe whispered mrs jos voice as the lady was about to sit down  oh i fordot and taking off one of the silvery slippers cinderella planted it carefully in the middle of the stage said to rob now you must try and tatch me and ran away while the prince picking up the shoe obediently trotted after her  the third scene as everybody knows is where the herald comes to try on the shoe teddy still in coachmans dress came in blowing a tin fishhorn melodiously and the proud sisters each tried to put on the slipper nan insisted on playing cut off her toe with a carvingknife and performed that operation so well that the herald was alarmed and begged her to be welly keerful cinderella then was called and came in with the pinafore half on slipped her foot into the slipper and announced with satisfaction  i am the pinsiss  daisy wept and begged pardon but nan who liked tragedy improved upon the story and fell in a faintingfit upon the floor where she remained comfortably enjoying the rest of the play it was not long for the prince ran in dropped upon his knees and kissed the hand of goldilocks with great ardor while the herald blew a blast that nearly deafened the audience the curtain had no chance to fall for the princess ran off the stage to her father crying didnt i do well while the prince and herald had a fencingmatch with the tin horn and wooden sword  it was beautiful said every one and when the raptures had a little subsided nat came out with his violin in his hand  hush hush cried all the children and silence followed for something in the boys bashful manner and appealing eyes make every one listen kindly  the bhaers thought he would play some of the old airs he knew so well but to their surprise they heard a new and lovely melody so softly sweetly played that they could hardly believe it could be nat it was one of those songs without words that touch the heart and sing of all tender homelike hopes and joys soothing and cheering those who listen to its simple music aunt meg leaned her head on demis shoulder grandmother wiped her eyes and mrs jo looked up at mr laurie saying in a choky whisper  you composed that  i wanted your boy to do you honor and thank you in his own way answered laurie leaning down to answer her  when nat made his bow and was about to go he was called back by many hands and had to play again he did so with such a happy face that it was good to see him for he did his best and gave them the gay old tunes that set the feet to dancing and made quietude impossible  clear the floor cried emil and in a minute the chairs were pushed back the older people put safely in corners and the children gathered on the stage  show your manners called emil and the boys pranced up to the ladies old and young with polite invitations to tread the mazy as dear dick swiveller has it the small lads nearly came to blows for the princess but she chose dick like a kind little gentlewoman as she was and let him lead her proudly to her place mrs jo was not allowed to decline and aunt amy filled dan with unspeakable delight by refusing franz and taking him of course nan and tommy nat and daisy paired off while uncle teddy went and got asia who was longing to jig it and felt much elated by the honor done her silas and mary ann had a private dance in the hall and for halfanhour plumfield was at its merriest  the party wound up with a grand promenade of all the young folks headed by the pumpkincoach with the princess and driver inside and the rats in a wildly frisky state  while the children enjoyed this final frolic the elders sat in the parlor looking on as they talked together of the little people with the interest of parents and friends  what are you thinking of all by yourself with such a happy face sister jo asked laurie sitting down beside her on the sofa  my summers work teddy and amusing myself by imagining the future of my boys she answered smiling as she made room for him  they are all to be poets painters and statesmen famous soldiers or at least merchant princes i suppose  no i am not as aspiring as i once was and i shall be satisfied if they are honest men but i will confess that i do expect a little glory and a career for some of them demi is not a common child and i think he will blossom into something good and great in the best sense of the word the others will do well i hope especially my last two boys for after hearing nat play tonight i really think he has genius  too soon to say talent he certainly has and there is no doubt that the boy can soon earn his bread by the work he loves build him up for another year or so and then i will take him off your hands and launch him properly  that is such a pleasant prospect for poor nat who came to me six months ago so friendless and forlorn dans future is already plain to me mr hyde will want him soon and i mean to give him a brave and faithful little servant dan is one who can serve well if the wages are love and confidence and he has the energy to carve out his own future in his own way yes i am very happy over our success with these boys one so weak and one so wild both so much better now and so full of promise  what magic did you use jo  i only loved them and let them see it fritz did the rest  dear soul you look as if only loving had been rather hard work sometimes said laurie stroking her thin cheek with a look of more tender admiration than he had ever given her as a girl  im a faded old woman but im a very happy one so dont pity me teddy and she glanced about the room with eyes full of a sincere content  yes your plan seems to work better and better every year he said with an emphatic nod of approval toward the cheery scene before him  how can it fail to work well when i have so much help from you all answered mrs jo looking gratefully at her most generous patron  it is the best joke of the family this school of yours and its success so unlike the future we planned for you and yet so suited to you after all it was a regular inspiration jo said laurie dodging her thanks as usual  ah but you laughed at it in the beginning and still make all manner of fun of me and my inspirations didnt you predict that having girls with the boys would be a dead failure now see how well it works and she pointed to the happy group of lads and lassies dancing singing and chattering together with every sign of kindly good fellowship  i give in and when my goldilocks is old enough ill send her to you can i say more than that  i shall be so proud to have your little treasure trusted to me but really teddy the effect of these girls has been excellent i know you will laugh at me but i dont mind im used to it so ill tell you that one of my favorite fancies is to look at my family as a small world to watch the progress of my little men and lately to see how well the influence of my little women works upon them daisy is the domestic element and they all feel the charm of her quiet womanly ways nan is the restless energetic strongminded one they admire her courage and give her a fair chance to work out her will seeing that she has sympathy as well as strength and the power to do much in their small world your bess is the lady full of natural refinement grace and beauty she polishes them unconsciously and fills her place as any lovely woman may using her gentle influence to lift and hold them above the coarse rough things of life and keep them gentlemen in the best sense of the fine old word  it is not always the ladies who do that best jo it is sometimes the strong brave woman who stirs up the boy and makes a man of him and laurie bowed to her with a significant laugh  no i think the graceful woman whom the boy you allude to married has done more for him than the wild nan of his youth or better still the wise motherly woman who watched over him as daisy watches over demi did more to make him what he is and jo turned toward her mother who sat a little apart with meg looking so full of the sweet dignity and beauty of old age that laurie gave her a glance of filial respect and love as he replied in serious earnest  all three did much for him and i can understand how well these little girls will help your lads  not more than the lads help them it is mutual i assure you nat does much for daisy with his music dan can manage nan better than any of us and demi teaches your goldilocks so easily and well that fritz calls them roger ascham and lady jane grey dear me if men and women would only trust understand and help one another as my children do what a capital place the world would be and mrs jos eyes grew absent as if she was looking at a new and charming state of society in which people lived as happily and innocently as her flock at plumfield  you are doing your best to help on the good time my dear continue to believe in it to work for it and to prove its possibility by the success of her small experiment said mr march pausing as he passed to say an encouraging word for the good man never lost his faith in humanity and still hoped to see peace goodwill and happiness reign upon the earth  i am not so ambitious as that father i only want to give these children a home in which they can be taught a few simple things which will help to make life less hard to them when they go out to fight their battles in the world honesty courage industry faith in god their fellowcreatures and themselves that is all i try for  that is every thing give them these helps then let them go to work out their life as men and women and whatever their success or failure is i think they will remember and bless your efforts my good son and daughter  the professor had joined them and as mr march spoke he gave a hand to each and left them with a look that was a blessing as jo and her husband stood together for a moment talking quietly and feeling that their summer work had been well done if father approved mr laurie slipped into the hall said a word to the children and all of a sudden the whole flock pranced into the room joined hands and danced about father and mother bhaer singing blithely       summer days are over      summer work is done      harvests have been gathered      gayly one by one      now the feast is eaten      finished is the play      but one rite remains for      our thanksgivingday      best of all the harvest      in the dear gods sight      are the happy children      in the home tonight      and we come to offer      thanks where thanks are due      with grateful hearts and voices      father mother unto you  with the last words the circle narrowed till the good professor and his wife were taken prisoner by many arms and half hidden by the bouquet of laughing young faces which surrounded them proving that one plant had taken root and blossomed beautifully in all the little gardens for love is a flower that grows in any soil works its sweet miracles undaunted by autumn frost or winter snow blooming fair and fragrant all the year and blessing those who give and those who receive
