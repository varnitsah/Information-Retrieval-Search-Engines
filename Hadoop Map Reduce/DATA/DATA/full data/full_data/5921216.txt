york      1909       for all little friends      of      mr mcgregor  peter  benjamin  illustration  it is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is soporific  i have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces but then i am not a rabbit  they certainly had a very soporific effect upon the flopsy bunnies  when benjamin bunny grew up he married his cousin flopsy they had a large family and they were very improvident and cheerful  i do not remember the separate names of their children they were generally called the flopsy bunnies  illustration  illustration  as there was not always quite enough to eatbenjamin used to borrow cabbages from flopsys brother peter rabbit who kept a nursery garden  sometimes peter rabbit had no cabbages to spare  illustration  illustration  when this happened the flopsy bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap in the ditch outside mr mcgregors garden  mr mcgregors rubbish heap was a mixture there were jam pots and paper bags and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine which always tasted oily and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two one dayoh joythere were a quantity of overgrown lettuces which had shot into flower  illustration  the flopsy bunnies simply stuffed lettuces by degrees one after another they were overcome with slumber and lay down in the mown grass  benjamin was not so much overcome as his children before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies  the little flopsy bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun from the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine the bluebottles buzzed about the wall and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots  i can tell you her name she was called thomasina tittlemouse a woodmouse with a long tail  illustration  illustration  she rustled across the paper bag and awakened benjamin bunny  the mouse apologized profusely and said that she knew peter rabbit  while she and benjamin were talking close under the wall they heard a heavy tread above their heads and suddenly mr mcgregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping flopsy bunnies benjamin shrank down under his paper bag the mouse hid in a jam pot  illustration  illustration  the little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific  they dreamt that their mother flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed  mr mcgregor looked down after emptying his sack he saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings he stared at them for some time  presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved  mr mcgregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap  one two three four five six leetle rabbits said he as he dropped them into his sack the flopsy bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed they stirred a little in their sleep but still they did not wake up  illustration  illustration  mr mcgregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall  he went to put away the mowing machine  while he was gone mrs flopsy bunny who had remained at home came across the field  she looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was  illustration  then the mouse came out of her jam pot and benjamin took the paper bag off his head and they told the doleful tale  benjamin and flopsy were in despair they could not undo the string  but mrs tittlemouse was a resourceful person she nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack  illustration  the little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them  their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows an old blackingbrush and two decayed turnips  illustration  then they all hid under a bush and watched for mr mcgregor  illustration  mr mcgregor came back and picked up the sack and carried it off  he carried it hanging down as if it were rather heavy  the flopsy bunnies followed at a safe distance  illustration  the watched him go into his house  and then they crept up to the window to listen  illustration  mr mcgregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the flopsy bunnies if they had happened to have been inside it  they could hear him drag his chair on the flags and chuckle  one two three four five six leetle rabbits said mr mcgregor  illustration  illustration  eh whats that what have they been spoiling now enquired mrs mcgregor  one two three four five six leetle fat rabbits repeated mr mcgregor counting on his fingersone two three  dont you be silly what do you mean you silly old man  in the sack one two three four five six replied mr mcgregor  the youngest flopsy bunny got upon the windowsill  mrs mcgregor took hold of the sack and felt it she said she could feel six but they must be old rabbits because they were so hard and all different shapes  not fit to eat but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak  line your old cloak shouted mr mcgregori shall sell them and buy myself baccy  rabbit tobacco i shall skin them and cut off their heads  illustration  mrs mcgregor untied the sack and put her hand inside  when she felt the vegetables she became very very angry she said that mr mcgregor had done it a purpose  illustration  and mr mcgregor was very angry too one of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window and hit the youngest flopsy bunny  it was rather hurt  illustration  then benjamin and flopsy thought that it was time to go home  illustration  so mr mcgregor did not get his tobacco and mrs mcgregor did not get her rabbit skins  illustration  but next christmas thomasina tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbitwool to make herself a cloak and a hood and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens  illustration  illustration     the tale of the flopsy bunnies  by beatrix potter  f warne  co
