voice of the city   twentyfive years ago the school children used to chant their lessons the manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an episcopal minister and the drone of a tired sawmill i mean no disrespect we must have lumber and sawdust  i remember one beautiful and instructive little lyric that emanated from the physiology class the most striking line of it was this  the shinbone is the longest bone in the human body  what an inestimable boon it would have been if all the corporeal and spiritual facts pertaining to man had thus been tunefully and logically inculcated in our youthful minds but what we gained in anatomy music and philosophy was meagre  the other day i became confused i needed a ray of light i turned back to those school days for aid but in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those hard benches i could not recall one that treated of the voice of agglomerated mankind  in other words of the composite vocal message of massed humanity  in other words of the voice of a big city  now the individual voice is not lacking we can understand the song of the poet the ripple of the brook the meaning of the man who wants 5 until next monday the inscriptions on the tombs of the pharaohs the language of flowers the step lively of the conductor and the prelude of the milk cans at 4 a m certain largeeared ones even assert that they are wise to the vibrations of the tympanum produced by concussion of the air emanating from mr h james but who can comprehend the meaning of the voice of the city  i went out for to see  first i asked aurelia she wore white swiss and a hat with flowers on it and ribbons and ends of things fluttered here and there  tell me i said stammeringly for i have no voice of my own what does this bigerenormouserwhopping city say it must have a voice of some kind does it ever speak to you how do you interpret its meaning it is a tremendous mass but it must have a key  like a saratoga trunk asked aurelia  no said i please do not refer to the lid i have a fancy that every city has a voice each one has something to say to the one who can hear it what does the big one say to you  all cities said aurelia judicially say the same thing when they get through saying it there is an echo from philadelphia so they are unanimous  here are 4000000 people said i scholastically compressed upon an island which is mostly lamb surrounded by wall street water the conjunction of so many units into so small a space must result in an identityor or rather a homogeneity that finds its oral expression through a common channel it is as you might say a consensus of translation concentrating in a crystallized general idea which reveals itself in what may be termed the voice of the city can you tell me what it is  aurelia smiled wonderfully she sat on the high stoop a spray of insolent ivy bobbed against her right ear a ray of impudent moonlight flickered upon her nose but i was adamant nickelplated  i must go and find out i said what is the voice of this city other cities have voices it is an assignment i must have it new york i continued in a rising tone had better not hand me a cigar and say old man i cant talk for publication no other city acts in that way chicago says unhesitatingly i will i philadelphia says i should new orleans says i used to louisville says dont care if i do st louis says excuse me pittsburg says smoke up now new york  aurelia smiled  very well said i i must go elsewhere and find out  i went into a palace tilefloored cherubceilinged and square with the cop i put my foot on the brass rail and said to billy magnus the best bartender in the diocese  billy youve lived in new york a long timewhat kind of a songanddance does this old town give you what i mean is doesnt the gab of it seem to kind of bunch up and slide over the bar to you in a sort of amalgamated tip that hits off the burg in a kind of an epigram with a dash of bitters and a slice of  excuse me a minute said billy somebodys punching the button at the side door  he went away came back with an empty tin bucket again vanished with it full returned and said to me  that was mame she rings twice she likes a glass of beer for supper her and the kid if you ever saw that little skeesicks of mine brace up in his high chair and take his beer and but say what was yours i get kind of excited when i hear them two ringswas it the baseball score or gin fizz you asked for  ginger ale i answered  i walked up to broadway i saw a cop on the corner the cops take kids up women across and men in i went up to him  if im not exceeding the spiel limit i said let me ask you you see new york during its vocative hours it is the function of you and your brother cops to preserve the acoustics of the city there must be a civic voice that is intelligible to you at night during your lonely rounds you must have heard it what is the epitome of its turmoil and shouting what does the city say to you  friend said the policeman spinning his club it dont say nothing i get my orders from the man higher up say i guess youre all right stand here for a few minutes and keep an eye open for the roundsman  the cop melted into the darkness of the side street in ten minutes he had returned  married last tuesday he said half gruffly you know how they are she comes to that corner at nine every night for acomes to say hello i generally manage to be there say what was it you asked me a bit agowhats doing in the city oh theres a roofgarden or two just opened twelve blocks up  i crossed a crowsfoot of streetcar tracks and skirted the edge of an umbrageous park an artificial diana gilded heroic poised windruled on the tower shimmered in the clear light of her namesake in the sky along came my poet hurrying hatted haired emitting dactyls spondees and dactylis i seized him  bill said i in the magazine he is cleon give me a lift i am on an assignment to find out the voice of the city you see its a special order ordinarily a symposium comprising the views of henry clews john l sullivan edwin markham may irwin and charles schwab would be about all but this is a different matter we want a broad poetic mystic vocalization of the citys soul and meaning you are the very chap to give me a hint some years ago a man got at the niagara falls and gave us its pitch the note was about two feet below the lowest g on the piano now you cant put new york into a note unless its better indorsed than that but give me an idea of what it would say if it should speak it is bound to be a mighty and farreaching utterance to arrive at it we must take the tremendous crash of the chords of the days traffic the laughter and music of the night the solemn tones of dr parkhurst the ragtime the weeping the stealthy hum of cabwheels the shout of the press agent the tinkle of fountains on the roof gardens the hullabaloo of the strawberry vender and the covers of everybodys magazine the whispers of the lovers in the parksall these sounds must go into your voicenot combined but mixed and of the mixture an essence made and of the essence an extractan audible extract of which one drop shall form the thing we seek  do you remember asked the poet with a chuckle that california girl we met at stivers studio last week well im on my way to see her she repeated that poem of mine the tribute of spring word for word shes the smartest proposition in this town just at present say how does this confounded tie look i spoiled four before i got one to set right  and the voice that i asked you about i inquired  oh she doesnt sing said cleon but you ought to hear her recite my angel of the inshore wind  i passed on i cornered a newsboy and he flashed at me prophetic pink papers that outstripped the news by two revolutions of the clocks longest hand  son i said while i pretended to chase coins in my penny pocket doesnt it sometimes seem to you as if the city ought to be able to talk all these ups and downs and funny business and queer things happening every daywhat would it say do you think if it could speak  quit yer kiddin said the boy wot paper yer want i got no time to waste its mags birthday and i want thirty cents to git her a present  here was no interpreter of the citys mouthpiece i bought a paper and consigned its undeclared treaties its premeditated murders and unfought battles to an ash can  again i repaired to the park and sat in the moon shade i thought and thought and wondered why none could tell me what i asked for  and then as swift as light from a fixed star the answer came to me i arose and hurriedhurried as so many reasoners must back around my circle i knew the answer and i hugged it in my breast as i flew fearing lest some one would stop me and demand my secret  aurelia was still on the stoop the moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper i sat at her side and we watched a little cloud tilt at the drifting moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited  and then wonder of wonders and delight of delights our hands somehow touched and our fingers closed together and did not part  after half an hour aurelia said with that smile of hers  do you know you havent spoken a word since you came back  that said i nodding wisely is the voice of the city     ii  the complete life of john hopkins   there is a saying that no man has tasted the full flavour of life until he has known poverty love and war the justness of this reflection commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy the three conditions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing a surface thinker might deem that wealth should be added to the list not so when a poor man finds a longhidden quarterdollar that has slipped through a rip into his vest lining he sounds the pleasure of life with a deeper plummet than any millionaire can hope to cast  it seems that the wise executive power that rules life has thought best to drill man in these three conditions and none may escape all three in rural places the terms do not mean so much poverty is less pinching love is temperate war shrinks to contests about boundary lines and the neighbors hens it is in the cities that our epigram gains in truth and vigor and it has remained for one john hopkins to crowd the experience into a rather small space of time  the hopkins flat was like a thousand others there was a rubber plant in one window a fleabitten terrier sat in the other wondering when he was to have his day  john hopkins was like a thousand others he worked at 20 per week in a ninestory redbrick building at either insurance buckles hoisting engines chiropody loans pulleys boas renovated waltz guaranteed in five lessons or artificial limbs it is not for us to wring mr hopkinss avocation from these outward signs that be  mrs hopkins was like a thousand others the auriferous tooth the sedentary disposition the sunday afternoon wanderlust the draught upon the delicatessen store for homemade comforts the furor for department store markeddown sales the feeling of superiority to the lady in the thirdfloor front who wore genuine ostrich tips and had two names over her bell the mucilaginous hours during which she remained glued to the window sill the vigilant avoidance of the instalment man the tireless patronage of the acoustics of the dumbwaiter shaftall the attributes of the gotham flatdweller were hers  one moment yet of sententiousness and the story moves  in the big city large and sudden things happen you round a corner and thrust the rib of your umbrella into the eye of your old friend from kootenai falls you stroll out to pluck a sweet william in the parkand lo bandits attack youyou are ambulanced to the hospitalyou marry your nurse are divorcedget squeezed while short on u p s and d o w n sstand in the bread linemarry an heiress take out your laundry and pay your club duesseemingly all in the wink of an eye you travel the streets and a finger beckons to you a handkerchief is dropped for you a brick is dropped upon you the elevator cable or your bank breaks a table dhôte or your wife disagrees with you and fate tosses you about like cork crumbs in wine opened by an unfeed waiter the city is a sprightly youngster and you are red paint upon its toy and you get licked off  john hopkins sat after a compressed dinner in his glovefitting straightfront flat he sat upon a hornblende couch and gazed with satiated eyes at art brought home to the people in the shape of the storm tacked against the wall mrs hopkins discoursed droningly of the dinner smells from the flat across the hall the fleabitten terrier gave hopkins a look of disgust and showed a manhating tooth  here was neither poverty love nor war but upon such barren stems may be grafted those essentials of a complete life  john hopkins sought to inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence putting a new elevator in at the office he said discarding the nominative noun and the boss has turned out his whiskers  you dont mean it commented mrs hopkins  mr whipples continued john wore his new spring suit down today i liked it fine its a gray with he stopped suddenly stricken by a need that made itself known to him i believe ill walk down to the corner and get a fivecent cigar he concluded  john hopkins took his hat and picked his way down the musty halls and stairs of the flathouse  the evening air was mild and the streets shrill with the careless cries of children playing games controlled by mysterious rhythms and phrases their elders held the doorways and steps with leisurely pipe and gossip paradoxically the fireescapes supported lovers in couples who made no attempt to fly the mounting conflagration they were there to fan  the corner cigar store aimed at by john hopkins was kept by a man named freshmayer who looked upon the earth as a sterile promontory  hopkins unknown in the store entered and called genially for his bunch of spinach carfare grade this imputation deepened the pessimism of freshmayer but he set out a brand that came perilously near to filling the order hopkins bit off the roots of his purchase and lighted up at the swinging gas jet feeling in his pockets to make payment he found not a penny there  say my friend he explained frankly ive come out without any change hand you that nickel first time i pass  joy surged in freshmayers heart here was corroboration of his belief that the world was rotten and man a peripatetic evil without a word he rounded the end of his counter and made earnest onslaught upon his customer hopkins was no man to serve as a punchingbag for a pessimistic tobacconist he quickly bestowed upon freshmayer a coloradomaduro eye in return for the ardent kick that he received from that dealer in goods for cash only  the impetus of the enemys attack forced the hopkins line back to the sidewalk there the conflict raged the pacific wooden indian with his carven smile was overturned and those of the street who delighted in carnage pressed round to view the zealous joust  but then came the inevitable cop and imminent inconvenience for both the attacker and attacked john hopkins was a peaceful citizen who worked at rebuses of nights in a flat but he was not without the fundamental spirit of resistance that comes with the battlerage he knocked the policeman into a grocers sidewalk display of goods and gave freshmayer a punch that caused him temporarily to regret that he had not made it a rule to extend a fivecent line of credit to certain customers then hopkins took spiritedly to his heels down the sidewalk closely followed by the cigardealer and the policeman whose uniform testified to the reason in the grocers sign that read eggs cheaper than anywhere else in the city  as hopkins ran he became aware of a big low red racing automobile that kept abreast of him in the street this auto steered in to the side of the sidewalk and the man guiding it motioned to hopkins to jump into it he did so without slackening his speed and fell into the turkeyred upholstered seat beside the chauffeur the big machine with a diminuendo cough flew away like an albatross down the avenue into which the street emptied  the driver of the auto sped his machine without a word he was masked beyond guess in the goggles and diabolic garb of the chauffeur  much obliged old man called hopkins gratefully i guess youve got sporting blood in you all right and dont admire the sight of two men trying to soak one little more and id have been pinched  the chauffeur made no sign that he had heard hopkins shrugged a shoulder and chewed at his cigar to which his teeth had clung grimly throughout the mêlée  ten minutes and the auto turned into the open carriage entrance of a noble mansion of brown stone and stood still the chauffeur leaped out and said  come quick the lady she will explain it is the great honor you will have monsieur ah that milady could call upon armand to do this thing but no i am only one chauffeur  with vehement gestures the chauffeur conducted hopkins into the house he was ushered into a small but luxurious reception chamber a lady young and possessing the beauty of visions rose from a chair in her eyes smouldered a becoming anger her higharched threadlike brows were ruffled into a delicious frown  milady said the chauffeur bowing low i have the honor to relate to you that i went to the house of monsieur long and found him to be not at home as i came back i see this gentleman in combat againsthow you saygreatest odds he is fighting with fivetenthirty mengendarmes aussi yes milady he what you call swat onethreeeight policemans if that monsieur long is out i say to myself this gentleman he will serve milady so well and i bring him here  very well armand said the lady you may go she turned to hopkins  i sent my chauffeur she said to bring my cousin walter long there is a man in this house who has treated me with insult and abuse i have complained to my aunt and she laughs at me armand says you are brave in these prosaic days men who are both brave and chivalrous are few may i count upon your assistance  john hopkins thrust the remains of his cigar into his coat pocket he looked upon this winning creature and felt his first thrill of romance it was a knightly love and contained no disloyalty to the flat with the fleabitten terrier and the lady of his choice he had married her after a picnic of the lady label stickers union lodge no 2 on a dare and a bet of new hats and chowder all around with his friend billy mcmanus this angel who was begging him to come to her rescue was something too heavenly for chowder and as for hatsgolden jewelled crowns for her  say said john hopkins just show me the guy that youve got the grouch at ive neglected my talents as a scrapper heretofore but this is my busy night  he is in there said the lady pointing to a closed door come are you sure that you do not falter or fear  me said john hopkins just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing will you  the lady gave him a red red rose john hopkins kissed it stuffed it into his vest pocket opened the door and walked into the room it was a handsome library softly but brightly lighted a young man was there reading  books on etiquette is what you want to study said john hopkins abruptly get up here and ill give you some lessors be rude to a lady will you  the young man looked mildly surprised then he arose languidly dextrously caught the arms of john hopkins and conducted him irresistibly to the front door of the house  beware ralph branscombe cried the lady who had followed what you do to the gallant man who has tried to protect me  the young man shoved john hopkins gently out the door and then closed it  bess he said calmly i wish you would quit reading historical novels how in the world did that fellow get in here  armand brought him said the young lady i think you are awfully mean not to let me have that st bernard i sent armand for walter i was so angry with you  be sensible bess said the young man taking her arm that dog isnt safe he has bitten two or three people around the kennels come now lets go tell auntie we are in good humor again  arm in arm they moved away  john hopkins walked to his flat the janitors fiveyearold daughter was playing on the steps hopkins gave her a nice red rose and walked upstairs  mrs hopkins was philandering with curlpapers  get your cigar she asked disinterestedly  sure said hopkins and i knocked around a while outside its a nice night  he sat upon the hornblende sofa took out the stump of his cigar lighted it and gazed at the graceful figures in the storm on the opposite wall  i was telling you said he about mr whipples suit its a gray with an invisible check and it looks fine     iii  a lickpenny lover   there were 3000 girls in the biggest store masie was one of them she was eighteen and a saleslady in the gents gloves here she became versed in two varieties of human beingsthe kind of gents who buy their gloves in department stores and the kind of women who buy gloves for unfortunate gents besides this wide knowledge of the human species masie had acquired other information she had listened to the promulgated wisdom of the 2999 other girls and had stored it in a brain that was as secretive and wary as that of a maltese cat perhaps nature foreseeing that she would lack wise counsellors had mingled the saving ingredient of shrewdness along with her beauty as she has endowed the silver fox of the priceless fur above the other animals with cunning  for masie was beautiful she was a deeptinted blonde with the calm poise of a lady who cooks butter cakes in a window she stood behind her counter in the biggest store and as you closed your hand over the tapeline for your glove measure you thought of hebe and as you looked again you wondered how she had come by minervas eyes  when the floorwalker was not looking masie chewed tutti frutti when he was looking she gazed up as if at the clouds and smiled wistfully  that is the shopgirl smile and i enjoin you to shun it unless you are well fortified with callosity of the heart caramels and a congeniality for the capers of cupid this smile belonged to masies recreation hours and not to the store but the floorwalker must have his own he is the shylock of the stores when he comes nosing around the bridge of his nose is a tollbridge it is googoo eyes or git when he looks toward a pretty girl of course not all floorwalkers are thus only a few days ago the papers printed news of one over eighty years of age  one day irving carter painter millionaire traveller poet automobilist happened to enter the biggest store it is due to him to add that his visit was not voluntary filial duty took him by the collar and dragged him inside while his mother philandered among the bronze and terracotta statuettes  carter strolled across to the glove counter in order to shoot a few minutes on the wing his need for gloves was genuine he had forgotten to bring a pair with him but his action hardly calls for apology because he had never heard of glovecounter flirtations  as he neared the vicinity of his fate he hesitated suddenly conscious of this unknown phase of cupids less worthy profession  three or four cheap fellows sonorously garbed were leaning over the counters wrestling with the mediatorial handcoverings while giggling girls played vivacious seconds to their lead upon the strident string of coquetry carter would have retreated but he had gone too far masie confronted him behind her counter with a questioning look in eyes as coldly beautifully warmly blue as the glint of summer sunshine on an iceberg drifting in southern seas  and then irving carter painter millionaire etc felt a warm flush rise to his aristocratically pale face but not from diffidence the blush was intellectual in origin he knew in a moment that he stood in the ranks of the readymade youths who wooed the giggling girls at other counters himself leaned against the oaken trysting place of a cockney cupid with a desire in his heart for the favor of a glove salesgirl he was no more than bill and jack and mickey and then he felt a sudden tolerance for them and an elating courageous contempt for the conventions upon which he had fed and an unhesitating determination to have this perfect creature for his own  when the gloves were paid for and wrapped carter lingered for a moment the dimples at the corners of masies damask mouth deepened all gentlemen who bought gloves lingered in just that way she curved an arm showing like psyches through her shirtwaist sleeve and rested an elbow upon the showcase edge  carter had never before encountered a situation of which he had not been perfect master but now he stood far more awkward than bill or jack or mickey he had no chance of meeting this beautiful girl socially his mind struggled to recall the nature and habits of shopgirls as he had read or heard of them somehow he had received the idea that they sometimes did not insist too strictly upon the regular channels of introduction his heart beat loudly at the thought of proposing an unconventional meeting with this lovely and virginal being but the tumult in his heart gave him courage  after a few friendly and wellreceived remarks on general subjects he laid his card by her hand on the counter  will you please pardon me he said if i seem too bold but i earnestly hope you will allow me the pleasure of seeing you again there is my name i assure you that it is with the greatest respect that i ask the favor of becoming one of your fracquaintances may i not hope for the privilege  masie knew menespecially men who buy gloves without hesitation she looked him frankly and smilingly in the eyes and said  sure i guess youre all right i dont usually go out with strange gentlemen though it aint quite ladylike when should you want to see me again  as soon as i may said carter if you would allow me to call at your home i  masie laughed musically oh gee no she said emphatically if you could see our flat once theres five of us in three rooms id just like to see mas face if i was to bring a gentleman friend there  anywhere then said the enamored carter that will be convenient to you  say suggested masie with a brightidea look in her peachblow face i guess thursday night will about suit me suppose you come to the corner of eighth avenue and fortyeighth street at 730 i live right near the corner but ive got to be back home by eleven ma never lets me stay out after eleven  carter promised gratefully to keep the tryst and then hastened to his mother who was looking about for him to ratify her purchase of a bronze diana  a salesgirl with small eyes and an obtuse nose strolled near masie with a friendly leer  did you make a hit with his nobs mase she asked familiarly  the gentleman asked permission to call answered masie with the grand air as she slipped carters card into the bosom of her waist  permission to call echoed small eyes with a snigger did he say anything about dinner in the waldorf and a spin in his auto afterward  oh cheese it said masie wearily youve been used to swell things i dont think youve had a swelled head ever since that hosecart driver took you out to a chop suey joint no he never mentioned the waldorf but theres a fifth avenue address on his card and if he buys the supper you can bet your life there wont be no pigtail on the waiter what takes the order  as carter glided away from the biggest store with his mother in his electric runabout he bit his lip with a dull pain at his heart he knew that love had come to him for the first time in all the twentynine years of his life and that the object of it should make so readily an appointment with him at a street corner though it was a step toward his desires tortured him with misgivings  carter did not know the shopgirl he did not know that her home is often either a scarcely habitable tiny room or a domicile filled to overflowing with kith and kin the streetcorner is her parlor the park is her drawingroom the avenue is her garden walk yet for the most part she is as inviolate mistress of herself in them as is my lady inside her tapestried chamber  one evening at dusk two weeks after their first meeting carter and masie strolled arminarm into a little dimlylit park they found a bench treeshadowed and secluded and sat there  for the first time his arm stole gently around her her goldenbronze head slid restfully against his shoulder  gee sighed masie thankfully why didnt you ever think of that before  masie said carter earnestly you surely know that i love you i ask you sincerely to marry me you know me well enough by this time to have no doubts of me i want you and i must have you i care nothing for the difference in our stations  what is the difference asked masie curiously  well there isnt any said carter quickly except in the minds of foolish people it is in my power to give you a life of luxury my social position is beyond dispute and my means are ample  they all say that remarked masie its the kid they all give you i suppose you really work in a delicatessen or follow the races i aint as green as i look  i can furnish you all the proofs you want said carter gently and i want you masie i loved you the first day i saw you  they all do said masie with an amused laugh to hear em talk if i could meet a man that got stuck on me the third time hed seen me i think id get mashed on him  please dont say such things pleaded carter listen to me dear ever since i first looked into your eyes you have been the only woman in the world for me  oh aint you the kidder smiled masie how many other girls did you ever tell that  but carter persisted and at length he reached the flimsy fluttering little soul of the shopgirl that existed somewhere deep down in her lovely bosom his words penetrated the heart whose very lightness was its safest armor she looked up at him with eyes that saw and a warm glow visited her cool cheeks tremblingly awfully her moth wings closed and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities on the other side of her glove counter dawned upon her carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity  marry me masie he whispered softly and we will go away from this ugly city to beautiful ones we will forget work and business and life will be one long holiday i know where i should take youi have been there often just think of a shore where summer is eternal where the waves are always rippling on the lovely beach and the people are happy and free as children we will sail to those shores and remain there as long as you please in one of those faraway cities there are grand and lovely palaces and towers full of beautiful pictures and statues the streets of the city are water and one travels about in  i know said masie sitting up suddenly gondolas  yes smiled carter  i thought so said masie  and then continued carter we will travel on and see whatever we wish in the world after the european cities we will visit india and the ancient cities there and ride on elephants and see the wonderful temples of the hindoos and brahmins and the japanese gardens and the camel trains and chariot races in persia and all the queer sights of foreign countries dont you think you would like it masie  masie rose to her feet  i think we had better be going home she said coolly its getting late  carter humored her he had come to know her varying thistledown moods and that it was useless to combat them but he felt a certain happy triumph he had held for a moment though but by a silken thread the soul of his wild psyche and hope was stronger within him once she had folded her wings and her cool hand had closed about his own  at the biggest store the next day masies chum lulu waylaid her in an angle of the counter  how are you and your swell friend making it she asked  oh him said masie patting her side curls he aint in it any more say lu what do you think that fellow wanted me to do  go on the stage guessed lulu breathlessly  nit hes too cheap a guy for that he wanted me to marry him and go down to coney island for a wedding tour     iv  doughertys eyeopener   big jim dougherty was a sport he belonged to that race of men in manhattan it is a distinct race they are the caribs of the northstrong artful selfsufficient clannish honorable within the laws of their race holding in lenient contempt neighboring tribes who bow to the measure of societys tapeline i refer of course to the titled nobility of sportdom there is a class which bears as a qualifying adjective the substantive belonging to a wind instrument made of a cheap and base metal but the tin mines of cornwall never produced the material for manufacturing descriptive nomenclature for big jim dougherty  the habitat of the sport is the lobby or the outside corner of certain hotels and combination restaurants and cafés they are mostly men of different sizes running from small to large but they are unanimous in the possession of a recently shaven blueblack cheek and chin and dark overcoats in season with black velvet collars  of the domestic life of the sport little is known it has been said that cupid and hymen sometimes take a hand in the game and copper the queen of hearts to lose daring theorists have averrednot content with simply sayingthat a sport often contracts a spouse and even incurs descendants sometimes he sits in the game of politics and then at chowder picnics there is a revelation of a mrs sport and little sports in glazed hats with tin pails  but mostly the sport is oriental he believes his womenfolk should not be too patent somewhere behind grilles or flowerornamented fire escapes they await him there no doubt they tread on rugs from teheran and are diverted by the bulbul and play upon the dulcimer and feed upon sweetmeats but away from his home the sport is an integer he does not as men of other races in manhattan do become the convoy in his unoccupied hours of fluttering laces and high heels that tick off delectably the happy seconds of the evening parade he herds with his own race at corners and delivers a commentary in his carib lingo upon the passing show  big jim dougherty had a wife but he did not wear a button portrait of her upon his lapel he had a home in one of those brownstone ironrailed streets on the west side that look like a recently excavated bowling alley of pompeii  to this home of his mr dougherty repaired each night when the hour was so late as to promise no further diversion in the arch domains of sport by that time the occupant of the monogamistic harem would be in dreamland the bulbul silenced and the hour propitious for slumber  big jim always arose at twelve meridian for breakfast and soon afterward he would return to the rendezvous of his crowd  he was always vaguely conscious that there was a mrs dougherty he would have received without denial the charge that the quiet neat comfortable little woman across the table at home was his wife in fact he remembered pretty well that they had been married for nearly four years she would often tell him about the cute tricks of spot the canary and the lighthaired lady that lived in the window of the flat across the street  big jim dougherty even listened to this conversation of hers sometimes he knew that she would have a nice dinner ready for him every evening at seven when he came for it she sometimes went to matinées and she had a talking machine with six dozen records once when her uncle amos blew in on a wind from upstate she went with him to the eden musée surely these things were diversions enough for any woman  one afternoon mr dougherty finished his breakfast put on his hat and got away fairly for the door when his hand was on the knob be heard his wifes voice  jim she said firmly i wish you would take me out to dinner this evening it has been three years since you have been outside the door with me  big jim was astounded she had never asked anything like this before it had the flavour of a totally new proposition but he was a game sport  all right he said you be ready when i come at seven none of this wait two minutes till i primp an hour or two kind of business now dele  ill be ready said his wife calmly  at seven she descended the stone steps in the pompeian bowling alley at the side of big jim dougherty she wore a dinner gown made of a stuff that the spiders must have woven and of a color that a twilight sky must have contributed a light coat with many admirably unnecessary capes and adorably inutile ribbons floated downward from her shoulders fine feathers do make fine birds and the only reproach in the saying is for the man who refuses to give up his earnings to the ostrichtip industry  big jim dougherty was troubled there was a being at his side whom he did not know he thought of the soberhued plumage that this bird of paradise was accustomed to wear in her cage and this winged revelation puzzled him in some way she reminded him of the delia cullen that he had married four years before shyly and rather awkwardly he stalked at her right hand  after dinner ill take you back home dele said mr dougherty and then ill drop back up to seltzers with the boys you can have swell chuck tonight if you want it i made a winning on anaconda yesterday so you can go as far as you like  mr dougherty had intended to make the outing with his unwonted wife an inconspicuous one uxoriousness was a weakness that the precepts of the caribs did not countenance if any of his friends of the track the billiard cloth or the square circle had wives they had never complained of the fact in public there were a number of table dhôte places on the cross streets near the broad and shining way and to one of these he had purposed to escort her so that the bushel might not be removed from the light of his domesticity  but while on the way mr dougherty altered those intentions he had been casting stealthy glances at his attractive companion and he was seized with the conviction that she was no selling plater he resolved to parade with his wife past seltzers café where at this time a number of his tribe would be gathered to view the daily evening procession yes and he would take her to dine at hoogleys the swellest slowlunch warehouse on the line he said to himself  the congregation of smoothfaced tribal gentlemen were on watch at seltzers as mr dougherty and his reorganized delia passed they stared momentarily petrified and then removed their hatsa performance as unusual to them as was the astonishing innovation presented to their gaze by big jim on the latter gentlemans impassive face there appeared a slight flicker of triumpha faint flicker no more to be observed than the expression called there by the draft of little casino to a fourcard spade flush  hoogleys was animated electric lights shone as indeed they were expected to do and the napery the glassware and the flowers also meritoriously performed the spectacular duties required of them the guests were numerous welldressed and gay  a waiternot necessarily obsequiousconducted big jim dougherty and his wife to a table  play that menu straight across for what you like dele said big jim its you for a trough of the gilded oats tonight it strikes me that maybe weve been sticking too fast to home fodder  big jims wife gave her order he looked at her with respect she had mentioned truffles and he had not known that she knew what truffles were from the wine list she designated an appropriate and desirable brand he looked at her with some admiration  she was beaming with the innocent excitement that woman derives from the exercise of her gregariousness she was talking to him about a hundred things with animation and delight and as the meal progressed her cheeks colorless from a life indoors took on a delicate flush big jim looked around the room and saw that none of the women there had her charm and then he thought of the three years she had suffered immurement uncomplaining and a flush of shame warmed him for he carried fair play as an item in his creed  but when the honorable patrick corrigan leader in doughertys district and a friend of his saw them and came over to the table matters got to the threequarter stretch the honorable patrick was a gallant man both in deeds and words as for the blarney stone his previous actions toward it must have been pronounced heavy damages for breach of promise could surely have been obtained had the blarney stone seen fit to sue the honorable patrick  jimmy old man he called he clapped dougherty on the back he shone like a midday sun upon delia  honorable mr corriganmrs dougherty said big jim  the honorable patrick became a fountain of entertainment and admiration the waiter had to fetch a third chair for him he made another at the table and the wineglasses were refilled  you selfish old rascal he exclaimed shaking an arch finger at big jim to have kept mrs dougherty a secret from us  and then big jim dougherty who was no talker sat dumb and saw the wife who had dined every evening for three years at home blossom like a fairy flower quick witty charming full of light and ready talk she received the experienced attack of the honorable patrick on the field of repartee and surprised vanquished delighted him she unfolded her longclosed petals and around her the room became a garden they tried to include big jim in the conversation but he was without a vocabulary  and then a stray bunch of politicians and good fellows who lived for sport came into the room they saw big jim and the leader and over they came and were made acquainted with mrs dougherty and in a few minutes she was holding a salon half a dozen men surrounded her courtiers all and six found her capable of charming big jim sat grim and kept saying to himself three years three years  the dinner came to an end the honorable patrick reached for mrs doughertys cloak but that was a matter of action instead of words and doughertys big hand got it first by two seconds  while the farewells were being said at the door the honorable patrick smote dougherty mightily between the shoulders  jimmy me boy he declared in a giant whisper the madam is a jewel of the first water yere a lucky dog  big jim walked homeward with his wife she seemed quite as pleased with the lights and show windows in the streets as with the admiration of the men in hoogleys as they passed seltzers they heard the sound of many voices in the café the boys would be starting the drinks around now and discussing past performances  at the door of their home delia paused the pleasure of the outing radiated softly from her countenance she could not hope for jim of evenings but the glory of this one would lighten her lonely hours for a long time  thank you for taking me out jim she said gratefully youll be going back up to seltzers now of course  to  with seltzers said big jim emphatically and d pat corrigan does he think i havent got any eyes  and the door closed behind both of them     v  little speck in garnered fruit   the honeymoon was at its full there was a flat with the reddest of new carpets tasselled portières and six steins with pewter lids arranged on a ledge above the wainscoting of the diningroom the wonder of it was yet upon them neither of them had ever seen a yellow primrose by the rivers brim but if such a sight had met their eyes at that time it would have seemed likewell whatever the poet expected the right kind of people to see in it besides a primrose  the bride sat in the rocker with her feet resting upon the world she was wrapt in rosy dreams and a kimono of the same hue she wondered what the people in greenland and tasmania and beloochistan were saying one to another about her marriage to kid mcgarry not that it made any difference there was no welterweight from london to the southern cross that could stand up four hoursno four roundswith her bridegroom and he had been hers for three weeks and the crook of her little finger could sway him more than the fist of any 142pounder in the world  love when it is ours is the other name for selfabnegation and sacrifice when it belongs to people across the airshaft it means arrogance and selfconceit  the bride crossed her oxfords and looked thoughtfully at the distemper cupids on the ceiling  precious said she with the air of cleopatra asking antony for rome done up in tissue paper and delivered at residence i think i would like a peach  kid mcgarry arose and put on his coat and hat he was serious shaven sentimental and spry  all right said he as coolly as though he were only agreeing to sign articles to fight the champion of england ill step down and cop one out for yousee  dont be long said the bride ill be lonesome without my naughty boy get a nice ripe one  after a series of farewells that would have befitted an imminent voyage to foreign parts the kid went down to the street  here he not unreasonably hesitated for the season was yet early spring and there seemed small chance of wresting anywhere from those chill streets and stores the coveted luscious guerdon of summers golden prime  at the italians fruitstand on the corner he stopped and cast a contemptuous eye over the display of papered oranges highly polished apples and wan sunhungry bananas  gotta da peach asked the kid in the tongue of dante the lover of lovers  ah no sighed the vender not for one mont coma da peach too soon gotta da nicea orange likea da orange  scornful the kid pursued his quest he entered the allnight chophouse café and bowlingalley of his friend and admirer justus ocallahan the ocallahan was about in his institution looking for leaks  i want it straight said the kid to him the old woman has got a hunch that she wants a peach now if youve got a peach cal get it out quick i want it and others like it if youve got em in plural quantities  the house is yours said ocallahan but theres no peach in it its too soon i dont suppose you could even find em at one of the broadway joints thats too bad when a lady fixes her mouth for a certain kind of fruit nothing else wont do its too late now to find any of the firstclass fruiterers open but if you think the missis would like some nice oranges ive just got a box of fine ones in that she might  much obliged cal its a peach proposition right from the ring of the gong ill try further  the time was nearly midnight as the kid walked down the westside avenue few stores were open and such as were practically hooted at the idea of a peach  but in her moated flat the bride confidently awaited her persian fruit a champion welterweight not find a peachnot stride triumphantly over the seasons and the zodiac and the almanac to fetch an amsdens june or a georgia cling to his ownyown  the kids eye caught sight of a window that was lighted and gorgeous with natures most entrancing colors the light suddenly went out the kid sprinted and caught the fruiterer locking his door  peaches said he with extreme deliberation  well no sir not for three or four weeks yet i havent any idea where you might find some there may be a few in town from under the glass but theyd be hard to locate maybe at one of the more expensive hotelssome place where theres plenty of money to waste ive got some very fine oranges thoughfrom a shipload that came in today  the kid lingered on the corner for a moment and then set out briskly toward a pair of green lights that flanked the steps of a building down a dark side street  captain around anywhere he asked of the desk sergeant of the police station  at that moment the captain came briskly forward from the rear he was in plain clothes and had a busy air  hello kid he said to the pugilist thought you were bridaltouring  got back yesterday im a solid citizen now think ill take an interest in municipal doings how would it suit you to get into denver dicks place tonight cap  past performances said the captain twisting his moustache denver was closed up two months ago  correct said the kid rafferty chased him out of the fortythird hes running in your precinct now and his games bigger than ever im down on this gambling business i can put you against his game  in my precinct growled the captain are you sure kid ill take it as a favor have you got the entrée how is it to be done  hammers said the kid they havent got any steel on the doors yet youll need ten men no they wont let me in the place denver has been trying to do me he thought i tipped him off for the other raid i didnt though you want to hurry ive got to get back home the house is only three blocks from here  before ten minutes had sped the captain with a dozen men stole with their guide into the hallway of a dark and virtuouslooking building in which many businesses were conducted by day  third floor rear said the kid softly ill lead the way  two axemen faced the door that he pointed out to them  it seems all quiet said the captain doubtfully are you sure your tip is straight  cut away said the kid its on me if it aint  the axes crashed through the as yet unprotected door a blaze of light from within poured through the smashed panels the door fell and the raiders sprang into the room with their guns handy  the big room was furnished with the gaudy magnificence dear to denver dicks western ideas various wellpatronized games were in progress about fifty men who were in the room rushed upon the police in a grand break for personal liberty the plainclothes men had to do a little clubswinging more than half the patrons escaped  denver dick had graced his game with his own presence that night he led the rush that was intended to sweep away the smaller body of raiders but when he saw the kid his manner became personal being in the heavyweight class he cast himself joyfully upon his slighter enemy and they rolled down a flight of stairs in each others arms on the landing they separated and arose and then the kid was able to use some of his professional tactics which had been useless to him while in the excited clutch of a 200pound sporting gentleman who was about to lose 20000 worth of paraphernalia  after vanquishing his adversary the kid hurried upstairs and through the gamblingroom into a smaller apartment connecting by an arched doorway  here was a long table set with choicest chinaware and silver and lavishly furnished with food of that expensive and spectacular sort of which the devotees of sport are supposed to be fond here again was to be perceived the liberal and florid taste of the gentleman with the urban cognomenal prefix  a no 10 patent leather shoe protruded a few of its inches outside the tablecloth along the floor the kid seized this and plucked forth a black man in a white tie and the garb of a servitor  get up commanded the kid are you in charge of this free lunch  yes sah i was has they done pinched us agin boss  looks that way listen to me are there any peaches in this layout if there aint ill have to throw up the sponge  there was three dozen sah when the game opened this evenin but i reckon the gentlemen done eat em all up if youd like to eat a fustrate orange sah i kin find you some  get busy ordered the kid sternly and move whatever peach crop youve got quick or therell be trouble if anybody oranges me again tonight ill knock his face off  the raid on denver dicks highpriced and prodigal luncheon revealed one lone last peach that had escaped the epicurean jaws of the followers of chance into the kids pocket it went and that indefatigable forager departed immediately with his prize with scarcely a glance at the scene on the sidewalk below where the officers were loading their prisoners into the patrol wagons he moved homeward with long swift strides  his heart was light as he went so rode the knights back to camelot after perils and high deeds done for their ladies fair the kids lady had commanded him and he had obeyed true it was but a peach that she had craved but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at midnight from that wintry city where yet the february snows lay like iron she had asked for a peach she was his bride in his pocket the peach was warming in his hand that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost  on the way the kid turned in at an allnight drug store and said to the spectacled clerk  say sport i wish youd size up this rib of mine and see if its broke i was in a little scrap and bumped down a flight or two of stairs  the druggist made an examination it isnt broken was his diagnosis but you have a bruise there that looks like youd fallen off the flatiron twice  thats all right said the kid lets have your clothesbrush please  the bride waited in the rosy glow of the pink lamp shade the miracles were not all passed away by breathing a desire for some slight thinga flower a pomegranate aoh yes a peachshe could send forth her man into the night into the world which could not withstand him and he would do her bidding  and now he stood by her chair and laid the peach in her hand  naughty boy she said fondly did i say a peach i think i would much rather have had an orange  blest be the bride     vi  the harbinger   long before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the yokel does the city man know that the grassgreen goddess is upon her throne he sits at his breakfast eggs and toast begirt by stone walls opens his morning paper and sees journalism leave vernalism at the post  for whereas springs couriers were once the evidence of our finer senses now the associated press does the trick  the warble of the first robin in hackensack the stirring of the maple sap in bennington the budding of the pussy willows along main street in syracuse the first chirp of the bluebird the swan song of the blue point the annual tornado in st louis the plaint of the peach pessimist from pompton n j the regular visit of the tame wild goose with a broken leg to the pond near bilgewater junction the base attempt of the drug trust to boost the price of quinine foiled in the house by congressman jinks the first tall poplar struck by lightning and the usual stunned picknickers who had taken refuge the first crack of the ice jam in the allegheny river the finding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent at round cornersthese are the advance signs of the burgeoning season that are wired into the wise city while the farmer sees nothing but winter upon his dreary fields  but these be mere externals the true harbinger is the heart when strephon seeks his chloe and mike his maggie then only is spring arrived and the newspaper report of the fivefoot rattler killed in squire pettigrews pasture confirmed  ere the first violet blew mr peters mr ragsdale and mr kidd sat together on a bench in union square and conspired mr peters was the dartagnan of the loafers there he was the dingiest the laziest the sorriest brown blot against the green background of any bench in the park but just then he was the most important of the trio  mr peters had a wife this had not heretofore affected his standing with ragsy and kidd but today it invested him with a peculiar interest his friends having escaped matrimony had shown a disposition to deride mr peters for his venture on that troubled sea but at last they had been forced to acknowledge that either he had been gifted with a large foresight or that he was one of fortunes lucky sons  for mrs peters had a dollar a whole dollar bill good and receivable by the government for customs taxes and all public dues how to get possession of that dollar was the question up for discussion by the three musty musketeers  how do you know it was a dollar asked ragsy the immensity of the sum inclining him to scepticism  the coalman seen her have it said mr peters she went out and done some washing yesterday and look what she give me for breakfastthe heel of a loaf and a cup of coffee and her with a dollar  its fierce said ragsy  say we go up and punch er and stick a towel in er mouth and cop the coin suggested kidd viciously y aint afraid of a woman are you  she might holler and have us pinched demurred ragsy i dont believe in slugging no woman in a houseful of people  gentmen said mr peters severely through his russet stubble remember that you are speaking of my wife a man who would lift his hand to a lady except in the way of  maguire said ragsy pointedly has got his bock beer sign out if we had a dollar we could  hush up said mr peters licking his lips we got to get that case note somehow boys aint whats a mans wifes his leave it to me ill go over to the house and get it wait here for me  ive seen em give up quick and tell you where its hid if you kick em in the ribs said kidd  no man would kick a woman said peters virtuously a little chokingjust a touch on the windpipethat gets away with emand no marks left wait for me ill bring back that dollar boys  high up in a tenementhouse between second avenue and the river lived the peterses in a back room so gloomy that the landlord blushed to take the rent for it mrs peters worked at sundry times doing odd jobs of scrubbing and washing mr peters had a pure unbroken record of five years without having earned a penny and yet they clung together sharing each others hatred and misery being creatures of habit of habit the power that keeps the earth from flying to pieces though there is some silly theory of gravitation  mrs peters reposed her 200 pounds on the safer of the two chairs and gazed stolidly out the one window at the brick wall opposite her eyes were red and damp the furniture could have been carried away on a pushcart but no pushcart man would have removed it as a gift  the door opened to admit mr peters his foxterrier eyes expressed a wish his wifes diagnosis located correctly the seat of it but misread it hunger instead of thirst  youll get nothing more to eat till night she said looking out of the window again take your hounddogs face out of the room  mr peterss eye calculated the distance between them by taking her by surprise it might be possible to spring upon her overthrow her and apply the throttling tactics of which he had boasted to his waiting comrades true it had been only a boast never yet had he dared to lay violent hands upon her but with the thoughts of the delicious cool bock or culmbacher bracing his nerves he was near to upsetting his own theories of the treatment due by a gentleman to a lady but with his loafers love for the more artistic and less strenuous way he chose diplomacy first the high card in the gamethe assumed attitude of success already attained  you have a dollar he said loftily but significantly in the tone that goes with the lighting of a cigarwhen the properties are at hand  i have said mrs peters producing the bill from her bosom and crackling it teasingly  i am offered a position in ain a tea store said mr peters i am to begin work tomorrow but it will be necessary for me to buy a pair of  you are a liar said mrs peters reinterring the note no tea store nor no a b c store nor no junk shop would have you i rubbed the skin off both me hands washin jumpers and overalls to make that dollar do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind you put into you skiddoo get your mind off of money  evidently the poses of talleyrand were not worth one hundred cents on that dollar but diplomacy is dexterous the artistic temperament of mr peters lifted him by the straps of his congress gaiters and set him on new ground he called up a look of desperate melancholy to his eyes  clara he said hollowly to struggle further is useless you have always misunderstood me heaven knows i have striven with all my might to keep my head above the waves of misfortune but  cut out the rainbow of hope and that stuff about walkin one by one through the narrow isles of spain said mrs peters with a sigh ive heard it so often theres an ounce bottle of carbolic on the shelf behind the empty coffee can drink hearty  mr peters reflected what next the old expedients had failed the two musty musketeers were awaiting him hard by the ruined châteauthat is to say on a park bench with rickety castiron legs his honor was at stake he had engaged to storm the castle singlehanded and bring back the treasure that was to furnish them wassail and solace and all that stood between him and the coveted dollar was his wife once a little girl whom he couldahawhy not again once with soft words he could as they say twist her around his little finger why not again not for years had he tried it grim poverty and mutual hatred had killed all that but ragsy and kidd were waiting for him to bring the dollar  mr peters took a surreptitiously keen look at his wife her formless bulk overflowed the chair she kept her eyes fixed out the window in a strange kind of trance her eyes showed that she had been recently weeping  i wonder said mr peters to himself if thered be anything in it  the window was open upon its outlook of brick walls and drab barren back yards except for the mildness of the air that entered it might have been midwinter yet in the city that turns such a frowning face to besieging spring but spring doesnt come with the thunder of cannon she is a sapper and a miner and you must capitulate  ill try it said mr peters to himself making a wry face  he went up to his wife and put his arm across her shoulders  clara darling he said in tones that shouldnt have fooled a baby seal why should we have hard words aint you my own tootsum wootsum  a black mark against you mr peters in the sacred ledger of cupid charges of attempted graft are filed against you and of forgery and utterance of two of loves holiest of appellations  but the miracle of spring was wrought into the back room over the back alley between the black walls had crept the harbinger it was ridiculous and yet well it is a rat trap and you madam and sir and all of us are in it  red and fat and crying like niobe or niagara mrs peters threw her arms around her lord and dissolved upon him mr peters would have striven to extricate the dollar bill from its deposit vault but his arms were bound to his sides  do you love me james asked mrs peters  madly said james but  you are ill exclaimed mrs peters why are you so pale and tired looking  i feel weak said mr peters i  oh wait i know what it is wait james ill be back in a minute  with a parting hug that revived in mr peters recollections of the terrible turk his wife hurried out of the room and down the stairs  mr peters hitched his thumbs under his suspenders  all right he confided to the ceiling ive got her going i hadnt any idea the old girl was soft any more under the foolish rib well sir aint i the claude melnotte of the lower east side what its a 100 to 1 shot that i get the dollar i wonder what she went out for i guess shes gone to tell mrs muldoon on the second floor that were reconciled ill remember this soft soap and ragsy was talking about slugging her  mrs peters came back with a bottle of sarsaparilla  im glad i happened to have that dollar she said youre all run down honey  mr peters had a tablespoonful of the stuff inserted into him then mrs peters sat on his lap and murmured  call me tootsum wootsums again james  he sat still held there by his materialized goddess of spring  spring had come  on the bench in union square mr ragsdale and mr kidd squirmed tongueparched awaiting dartagnan and his dollar  i wish i had choked her at first said mr peters to himself     vii  while the auto waits   promptly at the beginning of twilight came again to that quiet corner of that quiet small park the girl in gray she sat upon a bench and read a book for there was yet to come a half hour in which print could be accomplished  to repeat her dress was gray and plain enough to mask its impeccancy of style and fit a largemeshed veil imprisoned her turban hat and a face that shone through it with a calm and unconscious beauty she had come there at the same hour on the day previous and on the day before that and there was one who knew it  the young man who knew it hovered near relying upon burnt sacrifices to the great joss luck his piety was rewarded for in turning a page her book slipped from her fingers and bounded from the bench a full yard away  the young man pounced upon it with instant avidity returning it to its owner with that air that seems to flourish in parks and public placesa compound of gallantry and hope tempered with respect for the policeman on the beat in a pleasant voice he risked an inconsequent remark upon the weatherthat introductory topic responsible for so much of the worlds unhappinessand stood poised for a moment awaiting his fate  the girl looked him over leisurely at his ordinary neat dress and his features distinguished by nothing particular in the way of expression  you may sit down if you like she said in a full deliberate contralto really i would like to have you do so the light is too bad for reading i would prefer to talk  the vassal of luck slid upon the seat by her side with complaisance  do you know he said speaking the formula with which park chairmen open their meetings that you are quite the stunningest girl i have seen in a long time i had my eye on you yesterday didnt know somebody was bowled over by those pretty lamps of yours did you honeysuckle  whoever you are said the girl in icy tones you must remember that i am a lady i will excuse the remark you have just made because the mistake was doubtless not an unnatural onein your circle i asked you to sit down if the invitation must constitute me your honeysuckle consider it withdrawn  i earnestly beg your pardon pleaded the young ran his expression of satisfaction had changed to one of penitence and humility it was my fault you knowi mean there are girls in parks you knowthat is of course you dont know but  abandon the subject if you please of course i know now tell me about these people passing and crowding each way along these paths where are they going why do they hurry so are they happy  the young man had promptly abandoned his air of coquetry his cue was now for a waiting part he could not guess the rôle he would be expected to play  it is interesting to watch them he replied postulating her mood it is the wonderful drama of life some are going to supper and some toerother places one wonders what their histories are  i do not said the girl i am not so inquisitive i come here to sit because here only can i be near the great common throbbing heart of humanity my part in life is cast where its beats are never felt can you surmise why i spoke to you mr  parkenstacker supplied the young man then he looked eager and hopeful  no said the girl holding up a slender finger and smiling slightly you would recognize it immediately it is impossible to keep ones name out of print or even ones portrait this veil and this hat of my maid furnish me with an incog you should have seen the chauffeur stare at it when he thought i did not see candidly there are five or six names that belong in the holy of holies and mine by the accident of birth is one of them i spoke to you mr stackenpot  parkenstacker corrected the young man modestly  mr parkenstacker because i wanted to talk for once with a natural manone unspoiled by the despicable gloss of wealth and supposed social superiority oh you do not know how weary i am of itmoney money money and of the men who surround me dancing like little marionettes all cut by the same pattern i am sick of pleasure of jewels of travel of society of luxuries of all kinds  i always had an idea ventured the young man hesitatingly that money must be a pretty good thing  a competence is to be desired but when you have so many millions that she concluded the sentence with a gesture of despair it is the monotony of it she continued that palls drives dinners theatres balls suppers with the gilding of superfluous wealth over it all sometimes the very tinkle of the ice in my champagne glass nearly drives me mad  mr parkenstacker looked ingenuously interested  i have always liked he said to read and hear about the ways of wealthy and fashionable folks i suppose i am a bit of a snob but i like to have my information accurate now i had formed the opinion that champagn is cooled in the bottle and not by placing ice in the glass  the girl gave a musical laugh of genuine amusement  you should know she explained in an indulgent tone that we of the nonuseful class depend for our amusement upon departure from precedent just now it is a fad to put ice in champagne the idea was originated by a visiting prince of tartary while dining at the waldorf it will soon give way to some other whim just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives  i see admitted the young man humbly  these special diversions of the inner circle do not become familiar to the common public  sometimes continued the girl acknowledging his confession of error by a slight bow i have thought that if i ever should love a man it would be one of lowly station one who is a worker and not a drone but doubtless the claims of caste and wealth will prove stronger than my inclination just now i am besieged by two one is a grand duke of a german principality i think he has or has had a wife somewhere driven mad by his intemperance and cruelty the other is an english marquis so cold and mercenary that i even prefer the diabolism of the duke what is it that impels me to tell you these things mr packenstacker  parkenstacker breathed the young man indeed you cannot know how much i appreciate your confidences  the girl contemplated him with the calm impersonal regard that befitted the difference in their stations  what is your line of business mr parkenstacker she asked  a very humble one but i hope to rise in the world were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position  indeed i was but i said might there is the grand duke and the marquis you know yes no calling could be too humble were the man what i would wish him to be  i work declared mr parkenstacker in a restaurant  the girl shrank slightly  not as a waiter she said a little imploringly labor is noble but personal attendance you knowvalets and  i am not a waiter i am cashier inon the street they faced that bounded the opposite side of the park was the brilliant electric sign restauranti am cashier in that restaurant you see there  the girl consulted a tiny watch set in a bracelet of rich design upon her left wrist and rose hurriedly she thrust her book into a glittering reticule suspended from her waist for which however the book was too large  why are you not at work she asked  i am on the night turn said the young man it is yet an hour before my period begins may i not hope to see you again  i do not know perhapsbut the whim may not seize me again i must go quickly now there is a dinner and a box at the playand oh the same old round perhaps you noticed an automobile at the upper corner of the park as you came one with a white body  and red running gear asked the young man knitting his brows reflectively  yes i always come in that pierre waits for me there he supposes me to be shopping in the department store across the square conceive of the bondage of the life wherein we must deceive even our chauffeurs goodnight  but it is dark now said mr parkenstacker and the park is full of rude men may i not walk  if you have the slightest regard for my wishes said the girl firmly you will remain at this bench for ten minutes after i have left i do not mean to accuse you but you are probably aware that autos generally bear the monogram of their owner again goodnight  swift and stately she moved away through the dusk the young man watched her graceful form as she reached the pavement at the parks edge and turned up along it toward the corner where stood the automobile then he treacherously and unhesitatingly began to dodge and skim among the park trees and shrubbery in a course parallel to her route keeping her well in sight  when she reached the corner she turned her head to glance at the motor car and then passed it continuing on across the street sheltered behind a convenient standing cab the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes passing down the sidewalk of the street opposite the park she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign the place was one of those frankly glaring establishments all white paint and glass where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously the girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear whence she quickly emerged without her hat and veil  the cashiers desk was well to the front a redhaired girl an the stool climbed down glancing pointedly at the clock as she did so the girl in gray mounted in her place  the young man thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly back along the sidewalk at the corner his foot struck a small papercovered volume lying there sending it sliding to the edge of the turf by its picturesque cover he recognized it as the book the girl had been reading he picked it up carelessly and saw that its title was new arabian nights the author being of the name of stevenson he dropped it again upon the grass and lounged irresolute for a minute then he stepped into the automobile reclined upon the cushions and said two words to the chauffeur  club henri     viii  a comedy in rubber   one may hope in spite of the metaphorists to avoid the breath of the deadly upas tree one may by great good fortune succeed in blacking the eye of the basilisk one might even dodge the attentions of cerberus and argus but no man alive or dead can escape the gaze of the rubberer  new york is the caoutchouc city there are many of course who go their ways making money without turning to the right or the left but there is a tribe abroad wonderfully composed like the martians solely of eyes and means of locomotion  these devotees of curiosity swarm like flies in a moment in a struggling breathless circle about the scene of an unusual occurrence if a workman opens a manhole if a street car runs over a man from north tarrytown if a little boy drops an egg on his way home from the grocery if a casual house or two drops into the subway if a lady loses a nickel through a hole in the lisle thread if the police drag a telephone and a racing chart forth from an ibsen society readingroom if senator depew or mr chuck connors walks out to take the airif any of these incidents or accidents takes place you will see the mad irresistible rush of the rubber tribe to the spot  the importance of the event does not count they gaze with equal interest and absorption at a chorus girl or at a man painting a liver pill sign they will form as deep a cordon around a man with a clubfoot as they will around a balked automobile they have the furor rubberendi they are optical gluttons feasting and fattening on the misfortunes of their fellow beings they gloat and pore and glare and squint and stare with their fishy eyes like goggleeyed perch at the book baited with calamity  it would seem that cupid would find these ocular vampires too cold game for his calorific shafts but have we not yet to discover an immune even among the protozoa yes beautiful romance descended upon two of this tribe and love came into their hearts as they crowded about the prostrate form of a man who had been run over by a brewery wagon  william pry was the first on the spot he was an expert at such gatherings with an expression of intense happiness on his features he stood over the victim of the accident listening to his groans as if to the sweetest music when the crowd of spectators had swelled to a closely packed circle william saw a violent commotion in the crowd opposite him men were hurled aside like ninepins by the impact of some moving body that clove them like the rush of a tornado with elbows umbrella hatpin tongue and fingernails doing their duty violet seymour forced her way through the mob of onlookers to the first row strong men who even had been able to secure a seat on the 530 harlem express staggered back like children as she bucked centre two large lady spectators who had seen the duke of roxburgh married and had often blocked traffic on twentythird street fell back into the second row with ripped shirtwaists when violet had finished with them william pry loved her at first sight  the ambulance removed the unconscious agent of cupid william and violet remained after the crowd had dispersed they were true rubberers people who leave the scene of an accident with the ambulance have not genuine caoutchouc in the cosmogony of their necks the delicate fine flavour of the affair is to be had only in the aftertastein gloating over the spot in gazing fixedly at the houses opposite in hovering there in a dream more exquisite than the opiumeaters ecstasy william pry and violet seymour were connoisseurs in casualties they knew how to extract full enjoyment from every incident  presently they looked at each other violet had a brown birthmark on her neck as large as a silver halfdollar william fixed his eyes upon it william pry had inordinately bowed legs violet allowed her gaze to linger unswervingly upon them face to face they stood thus for moments each staring at the other etiquette would not allow them to speak but in the caoutchouc city it is permitted to gaze without stint at the trees in the parks and at the physical blemishes of a fellow creature  at length with a sigh they parted but cupid had been the driver of the brewery wagon and the wheel that broke a leg united two fond hearts  the next meeting of the hero and heroine was in front of a board fence near broadway the day had been a disappointing one there had been no fights on the street children had kept from under the wheels of the street cars cripples and fat men in negligée shirts were scarce nobody seemed to be inclined to slip on banana peels or fall down with heart disease even the sport from kokomo ind who claims to be a cousin of exmayor low and scatters nickels from a cab window had not put in his appearance there was nothing to stare at and william pry had premonitions of ennui  but he saw a large crowd scrambling and pushing excitedly in front of a billboard sprinting for it he knocked down an old woman and a child carrying a bottle of milk and fought his way like a demon into the mass of spectators already in the inner line stood violet seymour with one sleeve and two gold fillings gone a corset steel puncture and a sprained wrist but happy she was looking at what there was to see a man was painting upon the fence eat bricklets they fill your face  violet blushed when she saw william pry william jabbed a lady in a black silk raglan in the ribs kicked a boy in the shin bit an old gentleman on the left ear and managed to crowd nearer to violet they stood for an hour looking at the man paint the letters then williams love could be repressed no longer he touched her on the arm  come with me he said i know where there is a bootblack without an adams apple  she looked up at him shyly yet with unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance  and you have saved it for me she asked trembling with the first dim ecstasy of a woman beloved  together they hurried to the bootblacks stand an hour they spent there gazing at the malformed youth  a windowcleaner fell from the fifth story to the sidewalk beside them as the ambulance came clanging up william pressed her hand joyously four ribs at least and a compound fracture he whispered swiftly you are not sorry that you met me are you dearest  me said violet returning the pressure sure not i could stand all day rubbering with you  the climax of the romance occurred a few days later perhaps the reader will remember the intense excitement into which the city was thrown when eliza jane a colored woman was served with a subpoena the rubber tribe encamped on the spot with his own hands william pry placed a board upon two beer kegs in the street opposite eliza janes residence he and violet sat there for three days and nights then it occurred to a detective to open the door and serve the subpoena he sent for a kinetoscope and did so  two souls with such congenial tastes could not long remain apart as a policeman drove them away with his night stick that evening they plighted their troth the seeds of love had been well sown and had grown up hardy and vigorous into alet us call it a rubber plant  the wedding of william pry and violet seymour was set for june 10 the big church in the middle of the block was banked high with flowers the populous tribe of rubberers the world over is rampant over weddings they are the pessimists of the pews they are the guyers of the groom and the banterers of the bride they come to laugh at your marriage and should you escape from hymens tower on the back of deaths pale steed they will come to the funeral and sit in the same pew and cry over your luck rubber will stretch  the church was lighted a grosgrain carpet lay over the asphalt to the edge of the sidewalk bridesmaids were patting one anothers sashes awry and speaking of the brides freckles coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks the minister was musing over his possible fee essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of laura jane libbey for his wife yea cupid was in the air  and outside the church oh my brothers surged and heaved the rank and file of the tribe of rubberers in two bodies they were with the grosgrain carpet and cops with clubs between they crowded like cattle they fought they pressed and surged and swayed and trampled one another to see a bit of a girl in a white veil acquire license to go through a mans pockets while he sleeps  but the hour for the wedding came and went and the bride and bridegroom came not and impatience gave way to alarm and alarm brought about search and they were not found and then two big policemen took a hand and dragged out of the furious mob of onlookers a crushed and trampled thing with a wedding ring in its vest pocket and a shredded and hysterical woman beating her way to the carpets edge ragged bruised and obstreperous  william pry and violet seymour creatures of habit had joined in the seething game of the spectators unable to resist the overwhelming desire to gaze upon themselves entering as bride and bridegroom the rosedecked church  rubber will out     ix  one thousand dollars   one thousand dollars repeated lawyer tolman solemnly and severely and here is the money  young gillian gave a decidedly amused laugh as he fingered the thin package of new fiftydollar notes  its such a confoundedly awkward amount he explained genially to the lawyer if it had been ten thousand a fellow might wind up with a lot of fireworks and do himself credit even fifty dollars would have been less trouble  you heard the reading of your uncles will continued lawyer tolman professionally dry in his tones i do not know if you paid much attention to its details i must remind you of one you are required to render to us an account of the manner of expenditure of this 1000 as soon as you have disposed of it the will stipulates that i trust that you will so far comply with the late mr gillians wishes  you may depend upon it said the young man politely in spite of the extra expense it will entail i may have to engage a secretary i was never good at accounts  gillian went to his club there he hunted out one whom he called old bryson  old bryson was calm and forty and sequestered he was in a corner reading a book and when he saw gillian approaching he sighed laid down his book and took off his glasses  old bryson wake up said gillian ive a funny story to tell you  i wish you would tell it to some one in the billiard room said old bryson you know how i hate your stories  this is a better one than usual said gillian rolling a cigarette and im glad to tell it to you its too sad and funny to go with the rattling of billiard balls ive just come from my late uncles firm of legal corsairs he leaves me an even thousand dollars now what can a man possibly do with a thousand dollars  i thought said old bryson showing as much interest as a bee shows in a vinegar cruet that the late septimus gillian was worth something like half a million  he was assented gillian joyously and thats where the joke comes in hes left his whole cargo of doubloons to a microbe that is part of it goes to the man who invents a new bacillus and the rest to establish a hospital for doing away with it again there are one or two trifling bequests on the side the butler and the housekeeper get a seal ring and 10 each his nephew gets 1000  youve always had plenty of money to spend observed old bryson  tons said gillian uncle was the fairy godmother as far as an allowance was concerned  any other heirs asked old bryson  none gillian frowned at his cigarette and kicked the upholstered leather of a divan uneasily there is a miss hayden a ward of my uncle who lived in his house shes a quiet thingmusicalthe daughter of somebody who was unlucky enough to be his friend i forgot to say that she was in on the seal ring and 10 joke too i wish i had been then i could have had two bottles of brut tipped the waiter with the ring and had the whole business off my hands dont be superior and insulting old brysontell me what a fellow can do with a thousand dollars  old bryson rubbed his glasses and smiled and when old bryson smiled gillian knew that he intended to be more offensive than ever  a thousand dollars he said means much or little one man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at rockefeller another could send his wife south with it and save her life a thousand dollars would buy pure milk for one hundred babies during june july and august and save fifty of their lives you could count upon a half hours diversion with it at faro in one of the fortified art galleries it would furnish an education to an ambitious boy i am told that a genuine corot was secured for that amount in an auction room yesterday you could move to a new hampshire town and live respectably two years on it you could rent madison square garden for one evening with it and lecture your audience if you should have one on the precariousness of the profession of heir presumptive  people might like you old bryson said gillian always unruffled if you wouldnt moralize i asked you to tell me what i could do with a thousand dollars  you said bryson with a gentle laugh why bobby gillian theres only one logical thing you could do you can go buy miss lotta lauriere a diamond pendant with the money and then take yourself off to idaho and inflict your presence upon a ranch i advise a sheep ranch as i have a particular dislike for sheep  thanks said gillian rising i thought i could depend upon you old bryson youve hit on the very scheme i wanted to chuck the money in a lump for ive got to turn in an account for it and i hate itemizing  gillian phoned for a cab and said to the driver  the stage entrance of the columbine theatre  miss lotta lauriere was assisting nature with a powder puff almost ready for her call at a crowded matinée when her dresser mentioned the name of mr gillian  let it in said miss lauriere now what is it bobby im going on in two minutes  rabbitfoot your right ear a little suggested gillian critically thats better it wont take two minutes for me what do you say to a little thing in the pendant line i can stand three ciphers with a figure one in front of em  oh just as you say carolled miss lauriere my right glove adams say bobby did you see that necklace della stacey had on the other night twentytwo hundred dollars it cost at tiffanys but of coursepull my sash a little to the left adams  miss lauriere for the opening chorus cried the call boy without  gillian strolled out to where his cab was waiting  what would you do with a thousand dollars if you had it he asked the driver  open a sloon said the cabby promptly and huskily i know a place i could take money in with both hands its a fourstory brick on a corner ive got it figured out second storychinks and chop suey third floormanicures and foreign missions fourth floorpoolroom if you was thinking of putting up the cap  oh no said gillian i merely asked from curiosity i take you by the hour drive til i tell you to stop  eight blocks down broadway gillian poked up the trap with his cane and got out a blind man sat upon a stool on the sidewalk selling pencils gillian went out and stood before him  excuse me he said but would you mind telling me what you would do if you had a thousand dollars  you got out of that cab that just drove up didnt you asked the blind man  i did said gillian  i guess you are all right said the pencil dealer to ride in a cab by daylight take a look at that if you like  he drew a small book from his coat pocket and held it out gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank deposit book it showed a balance of 1785 to the blind mans credit  gillian returned the book and got into the cab  i forgot something he said you may drive to the law offices of tolman  sharp at  broadway  lawyer tolman looked at him hostilely and inquiringly through his goldrimmed glasses  i beg your pardon said gillian cheerfully but may i ask you a question it is not an impertinent one i hope was miss hayden left anything by my uncles will besides the ring and the 10  nothing said mr tolman  i thank you very much sir said gillian and on he went to his cab he gave the driver the address of his late uncles home  miss hayden was writing letters in the library she was small and slender and clothed in black but you would have noticed her eyes gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent  ive just come from old tolmans he explained theyve been going over the papers down there they found agillian searched his memory for a legal termthey found an amendment or a postscript or something to the will it seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars i was driving up this way and tolman asked me to bring you the money here it is youd better count it to see if its right gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk  miss hayden turned white oh she said and again oh  gillian half turned and looked out the window  i suppose of course he said in a low voice that you know i love you  i am sorry said miss hayden taking up her money  there is no use asked gillian almost lightheartedly  i am sorry she said again  may i write a note asked gillian with a smile he seated himself at the big library table she supplied him with paper and pen and then went back to her secrétaire  gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars in these words  paid by the black sheep robert gillian 1000 on account of the eternal happiness owed by heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth  gillian slipped his writing into an envelope bowed and went his way  his cab stopped again at the offices of tolman  sharp  i have expended the thousand dollars he said cheerily to tolman of the gold glasses and i have come to render account of it as i agreed there is quite a feeling of summer in the airdo you not think so mr tolman he tossed a white envelope on the lawyers table you will find there a memorandum sir of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars  without touching the envelope mr tolman went to a door and called his partner sharp together they explored the caverns of an immense safe forth they dragged as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax this they forcibly invaded and wagged their venerable heads together over its contents then tolman became spokesman  mr gillian he said formally there was a codicil to your uncles will it was intrusted to us privately with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the 1000 bequest in the will as you have fulfilled the conditions my partner and i have read the codicil i do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology but i will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents  in the event that your disposition of the 1000 demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifications that deserve reward much benefit will accrue to you mr sharp and i are named as the judges and i assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justicewith liberality we are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you mr gillian but let us return to the letter of the codicil if your disposal of the money in question has been prudent wise or unselfish it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of 50000 which have been placed in our hands for that purpose but ifas our client the late mr gillian explicitly providesyou have used this money as you have money in the past i quote the late mr gillianin reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associatesthe 50000 is to be paid to miriam hayden ward of the late mr gillian without delay now mr gillian mr sharp and i will examine your account in regard to the 1000 you submit it in writing i believe i hope you will repose confidence in our decision  mr tolman reached for the envelope gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up he tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket  its all right he said smilingly there isnt a bit of need to bother you with this i dont suppose youd understand these itemized bets anyway i lost the thousand dollars on the races goodday to you gentlemen  tolman  sharp shook their heads mournfully at each other when gillian left for they heard him whistling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator     x  the defeat of the city   robert walmsleys descent upon the city resulted in a kilkenny struggle he came out of the fight victor by a fortune and a reputation on the other hand he was swallowed up by the city the city gave him what he demanded and then branded him with its brand it remodelled cut trimmed and stamped him to the pattern it approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a closecropped formal lawn with the select herd of ruminants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming insolence that irritating completeness that sophisticated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness  one of the upstate rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckleberrystained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsleys frecklefaced bob abandoned the certain threeperdiem meals of the onehorse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the threeringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party automobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fellows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name  but the matterhorn of robert walmsleys success was not scaled until he married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggledreached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other peoples ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objectionable characters who smoked pipes  this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an icecream freezer beneath his doublet frappéeing the region of his heart  after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple returned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best society they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a cemetery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpenstock and thermometer  one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his mother it was an unerudite letter full of crops and motherly love and farm notes it chronicled the health of the pig and the recent red calf and asked concerning roberts in return it was a letter direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips pæans of newlaid eggs neglected parents and the slump in dried apples  why have i not been shown your mothers letters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of accounts at tiffanys of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert  we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision  i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm félice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties  robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he endeavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsidized he had become  a week passed and found them landed at the little country station five hours out from the city a grinning stentorian sarcastic youth driving a mule to a spring wagon hailed robert savagely  hallo mr walmsley found your way back at last have you sorry i couldnt bring in the automobile for you but dads bulltonguing the tenacre clover patch with it today guess youll excuse my not wearing a dress suit over to meet youit aint six oclock yet you know  im glad to see you tom said robert grasping his brothers hand yes ive found my way at last youve a right to say at last its been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy  alicia cool in the summer heat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts  they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curling around wood and dale and hill like a ribbon lost from the robe of careless summer the wind followed like a whinnying colt in the track of phoebuss steeds  by and by the farmhouse peeped gray out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creeks bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pans pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slowgoing cowbells struck out a homely accompanimentand this was what each one said youve found your way back at last have you  the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabulary of his careless youththe inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away  this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in connection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not belong to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and highso intangible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasants cabbage garden  that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite palegray tea gown roberts mother discoursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybodys way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth unseen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away  father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you dont he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentlemans boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him howling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically  robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush  come out here you landlubber he cried to tom and ill put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers  tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his own prowess they stumbled back to the porch millie cast a pert reflection upon the qualities of a city brother in an instant robert had secured a horrid katydid in his fingers and bore down upon her screaming wildly she fled up the lane pursued by the avenging glass of form a quarter of a mile and they returned she full of apology to the victorious dude the rustic mania possessed him unabatedly  i can do up a cowpenful of you slow hayseeds he proclaimed vaingloriously bring on your bulldogs your hired men and your logrollers  he turned handsprings on the grass that prodded tom to envious sarcasm and then with a whoop he clattered to the rear and brought back uncle ike a battered colored retainer of the family with his banjo and strewed sand on the porch and danced chicken in the bread tray and did buckandwing wonders for half an hour longer incredibly wild and boisterous things he did he sang he told stories that set all but one shrieking he played the yokel the humorous clodhopper he was mad mad with the revival of the old life in his blood  he became so extravagant that once his mother sought gently to reprove him then alicia moved as though she were about to speak but she did not through it all she sat immovable a slim white spirit in the dusk that no man might question or read  by and by she asked permission to ascend to her room saying that she was tired on her way she passed robert he was standing in the door the figure of vulgar comedy with ruffled hair reddened face and unpardonable confusion of attireno trace there of the immaculate robert walmsley the courted clubman and ornament of select circles he was doing a conjuring trick with some household utensils and the family now won over to him without exception was beholding him with worshipful admiration  as alicia passed in robert started suddenly he had forgotten for the moment that she was present without a glance at him she went on upstairs  after that the fun grew quiet an hour passed in talk and then robert went up himself  she was standing by the window when he entered their room she was still clothed as when they were on the porch outside and crowding against the window was a giant apple tree full blossomed  robert sighed and went near the window he was ready to meet his fate a confessed vulgarian he foresaw the verdict of justice in the shape of that whiteclad form he knew the rigid lines that a van der pool would draw he was a peasant gambolling indecorously in the valley and the pure cold white unthawed summit of the matterhorn could not but frown on him he had been unmasked by his own actions all the polish the poise the form that the city had given him had fallen from him like an illfitting mantle at the first breath of a country breeze dully he awaited the approaching condemnation  robert said the calm cool voice of his judge i thought i married a gentleman  yes it was coming and yet in the face of it robert walmsley was eagerly regarding a certain branch of the apple tree upon which he used to climb out of that very window he believed he could do it now he wondered how many blossoms there were on the treeten millions but here was some one speaking again  i thought i married a gentleman the voice went on but  why had she come and was standing so close by his side  but i find that i have marriedwas this alicia talkingsomething bettera manbob dear kiss me wont you  the city was far away     xi  the shocks of doom   there is an aristocracy of the public parks and even of the vagabonds who use them for their private apartments vallance felt rather than knew this but when he stepped down out of his world into chaos his feet brought him directly to madison square  raw and astringent as a schoolgirlof the old orderyoung may breathed austerely among the budding trees vallance buttoned his coat lighted his last cigarette and took his seat upon a bench for three minutes he mildly regretted the last hundred of his last thousand that it had cost him when the bicycle cop put an end to his last automobile ride then he felt in every pocket and found not a single penny he had given up his apartment that morning his furniture had gone toward certain debts his clothes save what were upon him had descended to his manservant for back wages as he sat there was not in the whole city for him a bed or a broiled lobster or a streetcar fare or a carnation for buttonhole unless he should obtain them by sponging on his friends or by false pretenses therefore he had chosen the park  and all this was because an uncle had disinherited him and cut down his allowance from liberality to nothing and all that was because his nephew had disobeyed him concerning a certain girl who comes not into this storytherefore all readers who brush their hair toward its roots may be warned to read no further there was another nephew of a different branch who had once been the prospective heir and favorite being without grace or hope he had long ago disappeared in the mire now dragnets were out for him he was to be rehabilitated and restored and so vallance fell grandly as lucifer to the lowest pit joining the tattered ghosts in the little park  sitting there he leaned far back on the hard bench and laughed a jet of cigarette smoke up to the lowest tree branches the sudden severing of all his lifes ties had brought him a free thrilling almost joyous elation he felt precisely the sensation of the aeronaut when he cuts loose his parachute and lets his balloon drift away  the hour was nearly ten not many loungers were on the benches the parkdweller though a stubborn fighter against autumnal coolness is slow to attack the advance line of springs chilly cohorts  then arose one from a seat near the leaping fountain and came and sat himself at vallances side he was either young or old cheap lodginghouses had flavoured him mustily razors and combs had passed him by in him drink had been bottled and sealed in the devils bond he begged a match which is the form of introduction among park benchers and then he began to talk  youre not one of the regulars he said to vallance i know tailored clothes when i see em you just stopped for a moment on your way through the park dont mind my talking to you for a while ive got to be with somebody im afraidim afraid ive told two or three of those bummers over about it they think im crazy saylet me tell youall ive had to eat today was a couple pretzels and an apple tomorrow ill stand in line to inherit three millions and that restaurant you see over there with the autos around it will be too cheap for me to

call at the lawyers office at ten tomorrow and step into my old shoes againheir to three million dawson and 10000 a year pocket money andim afraidim afraid  the vagrant leaped to his feet and raised both trembling arms above his head he caught his breath and moaned hysterically  vallance seized his arm and forced him back to the bench  be quiet he commanded with something like disgust in his tones one would think you had lost a fortune instead of being about to acquire one of what are you afraid  ide cowered and shivered on the bench he clung to vallances sleeve and even in the dim glow of the broadway lights the latest disinherited one could see drops on the others brow wrung out by some strange terror  why im afraid something will happen to me before morning i dont know whatsomething to keep me from coming into that money im afraid a tree will fall on meim afraid a cab will run over me or a stone drop on me from a housetop or something i never was afraid before ive sat in this park a hundred nights as calm as a graven image without knowing where my breakfast was to come from but now its different i love money dawsonim happy as a god when its trickling through my fingers and people are bowing to me with the music and the flowers and fine clothes all around as long as i knew i was out of the game i didnt mind i was even happy sitting here ragged and hungry listening to the fountain jump and watching the carriages go up the avenue but its in reach of my hand again nowalmostand i cant stand it to wait twelve hours dawsoni cant stand it there are fifty things that could happen to mei could go blindi might be attacked with heart diseasethe world might come to an end before i could  ide sprang to his feet again with a shriek people stirred on the benches and began to look vallance took his arm  come and walk he said soothingly and try to calm yourself there is no need to become excited or alarmed nothing is going to happen to you one night is like another  thats right said ide stay with me dawsonthats a good fellow walk around with me awhile i never went to pieces like this before and ive had a good many hard knocks do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch old man im afraid my nerves too far gone to try any panhandling  vallance led his companion up almost deserted fifth avenue and then westward along the thirties toward broadway wait here a few minutes he said leaving ide in a quiet and shadowed spot he entered a familiar hotel and strolled toward the bar quite in his old assured way  theres a poor devil outside jimmy he said to the bartender who says hes hungry and looks it you know what they do when you give them money fix up a sandwich or two for him and ill see that he doesnt throw it away  certainly mr vallance said the bartender they aint all fakes dont like to see anybody go hungry  he folded a liberal supply of the free lunch into a napkin vallance went with it and joined his companion ide pounced upon the food ravenously i havent had any free lunch as good as this in a year he said arent you going to eat any dawson  im not hungrythanks said vallance  well go back to the square said ide the cops wont bother us there ill roll up the rest of this ham and stuff for our breakfast i wont eat any more im afraid ill get sick suppose id die of cramps or something tonight and never get to touch that money again its eleven hours yet till time to see that lawyer you wont leave me will you dawson im afraid something might happen you havent any place to go have you  no said vallance nowhere tonight ill have a bench with you  you take it cool said ide if youve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair  i believe ive already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet  its funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow heres your bench dawson right next to mine the light dont shine in your eyes here say dawson ill get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home youve helped me a lot tonight i dont believe i could have gone through the night if i hadnt struck you  thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep  for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated he felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when he thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which he gazed he remembered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench  at ten oclock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer meads office in ann street  ides nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded  when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting he turned to ide who stood with white face and trembling limbs before the expected crisis  i sent a second letter to your address last night mr ide he said i learned this morning that you were not there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him  ides trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and he straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered hat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fingers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically  tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step  lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled  i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as  hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and calling to his clerk bring a glass of watermr vallance has fainted     xii  the plutonian fire   there are a few editor men with whom i am privileged to come in contact it has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me there is a difference  they tell me that with a large number of the manuscripts that are submitted to them come advices in the way of a boost from the author asseverating that the incidents in the story are true the destination of such contributions depends wholly upon the question of the enclosure of stamps some are returned the rest are thrown on the floor in a corner on top of a pair of gum shoes an overturned statuette of the winged victory and a pile of old magazines containing a picture of the editor in the act of reading the latest copy of le petit journal right side upyou can tell by the illustrations it is only a legend that there are waste baskets in editors offices  thus is truth held in disrepute but in time truth and science and nature will adapt themselves to art things will happen logically and the villain be discomfited instead of being elected to the board of directors but in the meantime fiction must not only be divorced from fact but must pay alimony and be awarded custody of the press despatches  this preamble is to warn you off the grade crossing of a true story being that it shall be told simply with conjunctions substituted for adjectives wherever possible and whatever evidences of style may appear in it shall be due to the linotype man it is a story of the literary life in a great city and it should be of interest to every author within a 20mile radius of gosport ind whose desk holds a ms story beginning thus while the cheers following his nomination were still ringing through the old courthouse harwood broke away from the congratulating handclasps of his henchmen and hurried to judge creswells house to find ida  pettit came up out of alabama to write fiction the southern papers had printed eight of his stories under an editorial caption identifying the author as the son of the gallant major pettingill pettit our former county attorney and hero of the battle of lookout mountain  pettit was a rugged fellow with a kind of shamefaced culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pinewoods and broomsedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year 1329 thats nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for usor on us as the saying isand thenand then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent airdraft gas burners at 125 everybody should have em  i took pettit to the redbrick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test  suppose you try your hand at a descriptive article i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the  dont be a fool said pettit lets go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city  we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great lightflooded vitreous front adorned with snowwhite scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cutlery the piercing recitative of the whiteaproned grubmaidens at the morguelike banquet tables the recurrent liedmotif of the cashregisterit was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening souluplifting pageant of heroic and emblematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellowartists cared to dine at sad little tables in their socalled bohemian restaurants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their presence  pettit wrote many stories which the editors returned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the wellknown and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them  now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the pokergame stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little tenyearold girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were wonderfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin  pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page  they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substanceit was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme  you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colts 45 and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a sixshooter could  oh well said i thats different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chaparreras if i wanted to and it wouldnt be noticed until the usual errorsharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the papers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialismthey read byron but they look up bradstreets too while theyre among the bs and brigham also if they have timebut its pretty much the same old internal disturbance everywhere you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you cant put him up a tree with a love story so youve got to fall in love and then write the real thing  pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether he fell an accidental victim  there was a girl he had met at one of these studio contrivancesa glorious impudent lucid openminded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a goodnatured way of despising you she was a new york girl  well as the narrative style permits us to say infrequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lovers doubts those heartburnings and tremors of which he had written so unconvincingly were his talk about shylocks pound of flesh twentyfive pounds cupid got from pettit which is the usurer  one night pettit came to my room exalted pale and haggard but exalted she had given him a jonquil  old hoss said he with a new smile flickering around his mouth i believe i could write that story tonightthe one you know that is to win out i can feel it i dont know whether it will come out or not but i can feel it  i pushed him out of my door go to your room and write it i ordered else i can see your finish i told you this must come first write it tonight and put it under my door when it is done put it under my door tonight when it is finisheddont keep it until tomorrow  i was reading my bully old pal montaigne at two oclock when i heard the sheets rustle under my door i gathered them up and read the story  the hissing of geese the languishing cooing of doves the braying of donkeys the chatter of irresponsible sparrowsthese were in my minds ear as i read suffering sappho i exclaimed to myself is this the divine fire that is supposed to ignite genius and make it practical and wageearning  the story was sentimental drivel full of whimpering softheartedness and gushing egoism all the art that pettit had acquired was gone a perusal of its buttery phrases would have made a cynic of a sighing chambermaid  in the morning pettit came to my room i read him his doom mercilessly he laughed idiotically  all right old hoss he said cheerily make cigarlighters of it whats the difference im going to take her to lunch at claremont today  there was about a month of it and then pettit came to me bearing an invisible mitten with the fortitude of a dishrag he talked of the grave and south america and prussic acid and i lost an afternoon getting him straight i took him out and saw that large and curative doses of whiskey were administered to him i warned you this was a true storyware your white ribbons if only follow this tale for two weeks i fed him whiskey and omar and read to him regularly every evening the column in the evening paper that reveals the secrets of female beauty i recommend the treatment  after pettit was cured he wrote more stories he recovered his oldtime facility and did work just short of good enough then the curtain rose on the third act  a little darkeyed silent girl from new hampshire who was studying applied design fell deeply in love with him she was the intense sort but externally glacé such as new england sometimes fools us with pettit liked her mildly and took her about a good deal she worshipped him and now and then bored him  there came a climax when she tried to jump out of a window and he had to save her by some perfunctary unmeant wooing even i was shaken by the depths of the absorbing affection she showed home friends traditions creeds went up like thistledown in the scale against her love it was really discomposing  one night again pettit sauntered in yawning as he had told me before he said he felt that he could do a great story and as before i hunted him to his room and saw him open his inkstand at one oclock the sheets of paper slid under my door  i read that story and i jumped up late as it was with a whoop of joy old pettit had done it just as though it lay there red and bleeding a womans heart was written into the lines you couldnt see the joining but art exquisite art and pulsing nature had been combined into a love story that took you by the throat like the quinsy i broke into pettits room and beat him on the back and called him namesnames high up in the galaxy of the immortals that we admired and pettit yawned and begged to be allowed to sleep  on the morrow i dragged him to an editor the great man read and rising gave pettit his hand that was a decoration a wreath of bay and a guarantee of rent  and then old pettit smiled slowly i call him gentleman pettit now to myself its a miserable name to give a man but it sounds better than it looks in print  i see said old pettit as he took up his story and began tearing it into small strips i see the game now you cant write with ink and you cant write with your own hearts blood but you can write with the hearts blood of some one else you have to be a cad before you can be an artist well i am for old alabam and the majors store have you got a light old hoss  i went with pettit to the dépôt and died hard  shakespeares sonnets i blurted making a last stand how about him  a cad said pettit they give it to you and you sell itlove you know id rather sell ploughs for father  but i protested you are reversing the decision of the worlds greatest  goodby old hoss said pettit  critics i continued butsayif the major can use a fairly good salesman and bookkeeper down there in the store let me know will you     xiii  nemesis and the candy man   we sail at eight in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve  i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage  of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of informing you ourselves  ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope  outside in the street a highpitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of candeeeeees nice fresh candeeeeeeees  its our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses theres nothing in the broadway shops half so good  the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost lifesize glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semifoolish smile striped cuffs with doghead buttons covered the tan on his wrists  i do believe hes going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and today is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure  ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the oldfashioned stoop and handed it in i remember said ives  wait said honoria  she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper onequarter of an inch by two inches in size  this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened  it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it      as long as skies above are blue     to you my love i will be true   this he read from the slip of flimsy paper  we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town is quite deserted there is nowhere to go yet i am told that one or two of the roof gardens are amusing the singingand the dancingon one or two seem to have met with approval  ives did not wince when you are in the ring you are not surprised when your adversary taps you on the ribs  i followed the candy man that time said ives irrelevantly and gave him five dollars at the corner of broadway  he reached for the paper bag in honorias lap took out one of the square wrapped confections and slowly unrolled it  sara chillingworths father said honoria has given her an automobile  read that said ives handing over the slip that had been wrapped around the square of candy      life teaches ushow to live     love teaches usto forgive   honorias checks turned pink  honoria cried ives starting up from his chair  miss clinton corrected honoria rising like venus from the bead on the surf i warned you not to speak that name again  honoria repeated ives you must hear me i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but i must have it there is a madness that possesses one sometimes for which his better nature is not responsible i throw everything else but you to the winds i strike off the chains that have bound me i renounce the siren that lured me from you let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me it is you only whom i can love let your love forgive and i swear to you that mine will be true as long as skies above are blue    on the west side between sixth and seventh avenues an alley cuts the block in the middle it perishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality precarious  in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven oclock he pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley  there was a window above the spot where he always stopped his pushcart in the cool of the afternoon mlle adèle drawing card of the aërial roof garden sat at the window and took the air generally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aiding sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shouldersthe point of her that the photographers always made the most ofwas loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were barethere were no sculptors there to rave over thembut even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus félice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aërial audiences  gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself beneath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocationthe charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy manno fit game for her darts trulybut of the sex upon which she had been born to make war  after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times one afternoon she suddenly thawed and poured down upon him a smile that put to shame the sweets upon his cart  candy man she said cooingly while sidonie followed her impulsive dive brushing the heavy auburn hair dont you think i am beautiful  the candy man laughed harshly and looked up with his thin jaw set while he wiped his forehead with a redandblue handkerchief  yerd make a dandy magazine cover he said grudgingly beautiful or not is for them that cares its not my line if yer lookin for bouquets apply elsewhere between nine and twelve i think well have rain  truly fascinating a candy man is like killing rabbits in a deep snow but the hunters blood is widely diffused mademoiselle tugged a great coil of hair from sidonies hands and let it fall out the window  candy man have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that and with an arm so round she flexed an arm like galateas after the miracle across the windowsill  the candy man cackled shrilly as he arranged a stock of butterscotch that had tumbled down  smoke up said he vulgarly nothin doin in the complimentary line im too wise to be bamboozled by a switch of hair and a newly massaged arm oh i guess youll make good in the calcium all right with plenty of powder and paint on and the orchestra playing under the old apple tree but dont put on your hat and chase downstairs to fly to the little church around the corner with me ive been up against peroxide and makeup boxes before say all joking asidedont you think well have rain  candy man said mademoiselle softly with her lips curving and her chin dimpling dont you think im pretty  the candy man grinned  savin money aint yer said he by bein yer own press agent i smoke but i havent seen yer mug on any of the fivecent cigar boxes itd take a new brand of woman to get me goin anyway i know em from sidecombs to shoelaces gimme a good days sales and steakandonions at seven and a pipe and an evenin paper back there in the court and ill not trouble lillian russell herself to wink at me if you please  mademoiselle pouted  candy man she said softly and deeply yet you shall say that i am beautiful all men say so and so shall you  the candy man laughed and pulled out his pipe  well said he i must be goin in there is a story in the evenin paper that i am readin men are divin in the seas for a treasure and pirates are watchin them from behind a reef and there aint a woman on land or water or in the air goodevenin and he trundled his pushcart down the alley and back to the musty court where he lived  incredibly to him who has not learned woman mademoiselle sat at the window each day and spread her nets for the ignominious game once she kept a grand cavalier waiting in her reception chamber for half an hour while she battered in vain the candy mans tough philosophy his rough laugh chafed her vanity to its core daily he sat on his cart in the breeze of the alley while her hair was being ministered to and daily the shafts of her beauty rebounded from his dull bosom pointless and ineffectual unworthy pique brightened her eyes pridehurt she glowed upon him in a way that would have sent her higher adorers into an egoistic paradise the candy mans hard eyes looked upon her with a halfconcealed derision that urged her to the use of the sharpest arrow in her beautys quiver  one afternoon she leaned far over the sill and she did not challenge and torment him as usual  candy man said she stand up and look into my eyes  he stood up and looked into her eyes with his harsh laugh like the sawing of wood he took out his pipe fumbled with it and put it back into big pocket with a trembling hand  that will do said mademoiselle with a slow smile i must go now to my masseuse goodevening  the next evening at seven the candy man came and rested his cart under the window but was it the candy man his clothes were a bright new check his necktie was a flaming red adorned by a glittering horseshoe pin almost lifesize his shoes were polished the tan of his cheeks had paledhis hands had been washed the window was empty and he waited under it with his nose upward like a hound hoping for a bone  mademoiselle came with sidonie carrying her load of hair she looked at the candy man and smiled a slow smile that faded away into ennui instantly she knew that the game was bagged and so quickly she wearied of the chase she began to talk to sidonie  been a fine day said the candy man hollowly first time in a month ive felt firstclass hit it up down old madison hollering out like i useter think itll rain tomorrow  mademoiselle laid two round arms on the cushion on the windowsill and a dimpled chin upon them  candy man said she softly do you not love me  the candy man stood up and leaned against the brick wall  lady said he chokingly ive got 800 saved up did i say you wasnt beautiful take it every bit of it and buy a collar for your dog with it  a sound as of a hundred silvery bells tinkled in the room of mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle exhausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the window  candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there  here is a note for mademoiselle said félice coming to the window in the room  there is no justice said the candy man lifting the handle of his cart and moving away  three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alternately upon it  what is it he called  sidonies severe head came into the window  mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has goneyou may have heard of himhe is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean tomorrow oh you men     xiv  squaring the circle   at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehement emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry  nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city mans feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself  the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirts optic proves the invasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read natures most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss  beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchanting golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks  on the other hand straight lines show that nature has been deflected imagine venuss girdle transformed into a straight front  when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious productfor instance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whiskey a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker  nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its wayseven of its recreation and sportscoldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature  wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical introduction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles  the feud began in the cumberland mountains between the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax  the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamplit cabin windows coming from campmeeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized  by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavour to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate opposing folwell  a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron washpot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the compound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpetsack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colts revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a huntingknife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpetsack as he started muleback for the lowland railroad station the last folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of whitepine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the folwell buryingground  sam folwell arrived in new york in the night still moving and living in the free circles of nature he did not perceive the formidable pitiless restless fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark to close about the rotundity of his heart and brain and mould him to the form of its millions of reshaped victims a cabby picked him out of the whirl as sam himself had often picked a nut from a bed of windtossed autumn leaves and whisked him away to a hotel commensurate to his boots and carpetsack  on the next morning the last of the folwells made his sortie into the city that sheltered the last harkness the colt was thrust beneath his coat and secured by a narrow leather belt the huntingknife hung between his shoulderblades with the haft an inch below his coat collar he knew this muchthat cal harkness drove an express wagon somewhere in that town and that he sam folwell had come to kill him and as he stepped upon the sidewalk the red came into his eye and the feudhate into his heart  the clamor of the central avenues drew him thitherward he had half expected to see cal coming down the street in his shirtsleeves with a jug and a whip in his hand just as he would have seen him in frankfort or laurel city but an hour went by and cal did not appear perhaps he was waiting in ambush to shoot him from a door or a window sam kept a sharp eye on doors and windows for a while  about noon the city tired of playing with its mouse and suddenly squeezed him with its straight lines  sam folwell stood where two great rectangular arteries of the city cross he looked four ways and saw the world hurled from its orbit and reduced by spirit level and tape to an edged and cornered plane all life moved on tracks in grooves according to system within boundaries by rote the root of life was the cube root the measure of existence was square measure people streamed by in straight rows the horrible din and crash stupefied him  sam leaned against the sharp corner of a stone building those faces passed him by thousands and none of them were turned toward him a sudden foolish fear that he had died and was a spirit and that they could not see him seized him and then the city smote him with loneliness  a fat man dropped out of the stream and stood a few feet distant waiting for his car sam crept to his side and shouted above the tumult into his ear  the rankinses hogs weighed moren ourn a whole passel but the mast in thar neighborhood was a fine chance better than what it was down  the fat man moved away unostentatiously and bought roasted chestnuts to cover his alarm  sam felt the need of a drop of mountain dew across the street men passed in and out through swinging doors brief glimpses could be had of a glistening bar and its bedeckings the feudist crossed and essayed to enter again had art eliminated the familiar circle sams hand found no doorknobit slid in vain over a rectangular brass plate and polished oak with nothing even so large as a pins head upon which his fingers might close  abashed reddened heartbroken he walked away from the bootless door and sat upon a step a locust club tickled him in the ribs  take a walk for yourself said the policeman youve been loafing around here long enough  at the next corner a shrill whistle sounded in sams ear he wheeled around and saw a blackbrowed villain scowling at him over peanuts heaped on a steaming machine he started across the street an immense engine running without mules with the voice of a bull and the smell of a smoky lamp whizzed past grazing his knee a cabdriver bumped him with a hub and explained to him that kind words were invented to be used on other occasions a motorman clanged his bell wildly and for once in his life corroborated a cabdriver a large lady in a changeable silk waist dug an elbow into his back and a newsy pensively pelted him with banana rinds murmuring i hates to do itbut if anybody seen me let it pass  cal harkness his days work over and his express wagon stabled turned the sharp edge of the building that by the cheek of architects is modelled upon a safety razor out of the mass of hurrying people his eye picked up three yards away the surviving bloody and implacable foe of his kith and kin  he stopped short and wavered for a moment being unarmed and sharply surprised but the keen mountaineers eye of sam folwell had picked him out  there was a sudden spring a ripple in the stream of passersby and the sound of sams voice crying  howdy cal im durned glad to see ye  and in the angles of broadway fifth avenue and twentythird street the cumberland feudists shook hands     xv  roses ruses and romance   ravenelravenel the traveller artist and poet threw his magazine to the floor sammy brown brokers clerk who sat by the window jumped  what is it ravvy he asked the critics been hammering your stock down  romance is dead said ravenel lightly when ravenel spoke lightly he was generally serious he picked up the magazine and fluttered its leaves  even a philistine like you sammy said ravenel seriously a tone that insured him to be speaking lightly ought to understand now here is a magazine that once printed poe and lowell and whitman and bret harte and du maurier and lanier andwell that gives you the idea the current number has this literary feast to set before you an article on the stokers and coal bunkers of battleships an exposé of the methods employed in making liverwurst a continued story of a standard preferred international baking powder deal in wall street a poem on the bear that the president missed another story by a young woman who spent a week as a spy making overalls on the east side another fiction story that reeks of the garage and a certain make of automobile of course the title contains the words cupid and chauffeuran article on naval strategy illustrated with cuts of the spanish armada and the new staten island ferryboats another story of a political boss who won the love of a fifth avenue belle by blackening her eye and refusing to vote for an iniquitous ordinance it doesnt say whether it was in the streetcleaning department or congress and nineteen pages by the editors bragging about the circulation the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance  sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather armchair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks skyblue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black butterfly had alighted and spread his wings sammys faceleast importantwas round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance  that window of ravenels apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartmenthouse towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street opposite ravenels window an old old mansion stood halfhidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the drawbridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle  three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenels apartment he belonged to the poets club for the former browns had been conspicuous though sammy had been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it came to matters equine and batting scores he was something of a pink edition he loved to sit in the leather armchair by ravenels window and ravenel didnt mind particularly sammy seemed to enjoy his talk and then the brokers clerk was such a perfect embodiment of modernity and the days sordid practicality that ravenel rather liked to use him as a scapegoat  ill tell you whats the matter with you said sammy with the shrewdness that business had taught him the magazine has turned down some of your poetry stunts thats why you are sore at it  that would be a good guess in wall street or in a campaign for the presidency of a womans club said ravenel quietly now there is a poemif you will allow me to call it thatof my own in this number of the magazine  read it to me said sammy watching a cloud of pipesmoke he had just blown out the window  ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebodyorother must take hold of us somewhere when she dips us in the somethingorother that makes us invulnerable he read aloud this verse in the magazine      the four roses     one rose i twined within your hair        white rose that spake of worth     and one you placed upon your breast        red rose loves seal of birth     you plucked another from its stem        tea rose that means for aye     and one you gavethat bore for me        the thorns of memory   thats a crackerjack said sammy admiringly  there are five more verses said ravenel patiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course  oh lets have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didnt mean to cut you off im not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didnt look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it  ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully well have it next time ill be off now got a date at five oclock  he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy  the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two  through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flowing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of romance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princesss bower beautiful as any flower sung by poetthus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars  thus as if to challenge the poets flaunt at romance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision had dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenels entire world were redistributed the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep doublebass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute  thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again  at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great fullblown rosered and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the windowsill  yes emblemshe would be unworthy if he had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored  ravenel noticed beside the roses a small floweringpot containing a plant without shame he brought his operaglasses and employed them from the cover of his windowcurtain a nutmeg geranium  with the true poetic instinct he dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers  geranium nutmegi expect a meeting  so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimneycorner if you will let her  and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when he thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting  a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown  ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the farflung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenelthe brokers clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poets sombre apartment  sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily  by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i cant stay old man ive got a date at 430  why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that  sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker  fact is ravvy he explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didnt know i had it till i came ill tell you old mantheres a dandy girl in that old house next door that im dead gone on i put it straightwere engaged the old man says nit but that dont go he keeps her pretty close i can see ediths window from yours here she gives me a tip when shes going shopping and i meet her its 430 today maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know its all right with youso long  how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile  roses said sammy briefly four of em today means four oclock at the corner of broadway and twentythird  but the geranium persisted ravenel clutching at the end of flying romances trailing robe  means halfpast shouted sammy from the hall see you tomorrow     xvi  the city of dreadful night   during the recent warmedover spell said my friend carney driver of express wagon no 8606 a good many opportunities was had of observing human nature through peekaboo waists  the park commissioner and the commissioner of polis and the forestry commission gets together and agrees to let the people sleep in the parks until the weather bureau gets the thermometer down again to a living basis so they draws up openair resolutions and has them okd by the secretary of agriculture mr comstock and the village improvement mosquito exterminating society of south orange n j  when the proclamation was made opening up to the people by special grant the public parks that belong to em there was a general exodus into central park by the communities existing along its borders in ten minutes after sundown youd have thought that there was an undress rehearsal of a potato famine in ireland and a kishineff massacre they come by families gangs clambake societies clans clubs and tribes from all sides to enjoy a cool sleep on the grass them that didnt have oil stoves brought along plenty of blankets so as not to be upset with the cold and discomforts of sleeping outdoors by building fires of the shade trees and huddling together in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of 5000 head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone  ye know i live in the elegant furnished apartment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central railroad  when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sodding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction all over the place  the tenants began to pack up feather beds rubber boots strings of garlic hotwater bags portable canoes and scuttles of coal to take along for the sake of comfort the sidewalk looked like a russian camp in oyamas line of march there was wailing and lamenting up and down stairs from danny geoghegans flat on the top floor to the apartments of missis goldsteinupski on the first  for why says danny coming down and raging in his blue yarn socks to the janitor should i be turned out of me comfortable apartments to lay in the dirty grass like a rabbit tis like jerome to stir up trouble wid small matters like this instead of  whist says officer reagan on the sidewalk rapping with his club tis not jerome tis by order of the polis commissioner turn out every one of yez and hike yerselves to the park  now twas a peaceful and happy home that all of us had in them same beersheba flats the odowds and the steinowitzes and the callahans and the cohens and the spizzinellis and the mcmanuses and the spiegelmayers and the jonesesall nations of us we lived like one big family together and when the hot nights come along we kept a line of children reaching from the front door to kellys on the corner passing along the cans of beer from one to another without the trouble of running after it and with no more clothing on than is provided for in the statutes sitting in all the windies with a cool growler in every one and your feet out in the air and the rosenstein girls singing on the fireescape of the sixth floor and patsy rourkes flute going in the eighth and the ladies calling each other synonyms out the windie and now and then a breeze sailing in over mister depews centrali tell you the beersheba flats was a summer resort that made the catskills look like a hole in the ground with his person full of beer and his feet out the windy and his old woman frying pork chops over a charcoal furnace and the childher dancing in cotton slips on the sidewalk around the organgrinder and the rent paid for a weekwhat does a man want better on a hot night than that and then comes this ruling of the polis driving people out o their comfortable homes to sleep in parkstwas for all the world like a ukase of them russianstwill be heard from again at next election time  well then officer reagan drives the whole lot of us to the park and turns us in by the nearest gate tis dark under the trees and all the children sets up to howling that they want to go home  yell pass the night in this stretch of woods and scenery says officer reagan twill be fine and imprisonment for insoolting the park commissioner and the chief of the weather bureau if ye refuse im in charge of thirty acres between here and the agyptian monument and i advise ye to give no trouble tis sleeping on the grass yez all have been condemned to by the authorities yezll be permitted to leave in the morning but ye must retoorn be night me orders was silent on the subject of bail but ill find out if tis required and therell be bondsmen at the gate  there being no lights except along the automobile drives us 179 tenants of the beersheba flats prepared to spend the night as best we could in the raging forest them that brought blankets and kindling wood was best off they got fires started and wrapped the blankets round their heads and laid down cursing in the grass there was nothing to see nothing to drink nothing to do in the dark we had no way of telling friend or foe except by feeling the noses of em i brought along me last winter overcoat me toothbrush some quinine pills and the red quilt off the bed in me flat three times during the night somebody rolled on me quilt and stuck his knees against the adams apple of me and three times i judged his character by running me hand over his face and three times i rose up and kicked the intruder down the hill to the gravelly walk below and then some one with a flavour of kellys whiskey snuggled up to me and i found his nose turned up the right way and i says is that you then patsey and he says it is carney how long do you think itll last  im no weatherprophet says i but if they bring out a strong antitammany ticket next fall it ought to get us home in time to sleep on a bed once or twice before they line us up at the polls  aplaying of my flute into the airshaft says patsey rourke and aperspiring in me own windy to the joyful noise of the passing trains and the smell of liver and onions and areading of the latest murder in the smoke of the cooking is well enough for me says he what is this herding us in grass for not to mention the crawling things with legs that walk up the trousers of us and the jersey snipes that peck at us masquerading under the name and denomination of mosquitoes what is it all for carney and the rint going on just the same over at the flats  tis the great annual municipal free night outing lawn party says i given by the polis hetty green and the drug trust during the heated season they hold a week of it in the principal parks tis a scheme to reach that portion of the people thats not worth taking up to north beach for a fish fry  i cant sleep on the ground says patsey wid any benefit i have the hay fever and the rheumatism and me car is full of ants  well the night goes on and the extenants of the flats groans and stumbles around in the dark trying to find rest and recreation in the forest the children is screaming with the coldness and the janitor makes hot tea for em and keeps the fires going with the signboards that point to the tavern and the casino the tenants try to lay down on the grass by families in the dark but youre lucky if you can sleep next to a man from the same floor or believing in the same religion now and then a murpby accidental rolls over on the grass of a rosenstein or a cohen tries to crawl under the ogrady bush and then theres a feeling of noses and somebody is rolled down the hill to the driveway and stays there there is some hairpulling among the women folks and everybody spanks the nearest howling kid to him by the sense of feeling only regardless of its parentage and ownership tis hard to keep up the social distinctions in the dark that flourish by daylight in the beersheba flats mrs rafferty that despises the asphalt that a dago treads on wakes up in the morning with her feet in the bosom of antonio spizzinelli and mike odowd that always threw peddlers downstairs as fast as he came upon em has to unwind old isaacsteins whiskers from around his neck and wake up the whole gang at daylight but here and there some few got acquainted and overlooked the discomforts of the elements there was five engagements to be married announced at the flats the next morning  about midnight i gets up and wrings the dew out of my hair and goes to the side of the driveway and sits down at one side of the park i could see the lights in the streets and houses and i was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for em to  just then an automobile stops by me and a finelooking welldressed man steps out  me man says he can you tell me why all these people are lying around on the grass in the park i thought it was against the rules  twas an ordinance says i just passed by the polis department and ratified by the turf cutters association providing that all persons not carrying a license number on their rear axles shall keep in the public parks until further notice fortunately the orders comes this year during a spell of fine weather and the mortality except on the borders of the lake and along the automobile drives will not be any greater than usual  who are these people on the side of the hill asks the man  sure says i none others than the tenants of the beersheba flatsa fine home for any man especially on hot nights may daylight come soon  they come here be night says he and breathe in the pure air and the fragrance of the flowers and trees they do that says he coming every night from the burning heat of dwellings of brick and stone  and wood says i and marble and plaster and iron  the matter will be attended to at once says the man putting up his book  are ye the park commissioner i asks  i own the beersheba flats says he god bless the grass and the trees that give extra benefits to a mans tenants the rents shall be raised fifteen per cent tomorrow goodnight says he     xvii  the easter of the soul   it is hardly likely that a goddess may die then eastre the old saxon goddess of spring must be laughing in her muslin sleeve at people who believe that easter her namesake exists only along certain strips of fifth avenue pavement after church service  aye it belongs to the world the ptarmigan in chilkoot pass discards his winter white feathers for brown the patagonian beau brummell oils his chignon and clubs him another sweetheart to drag to his skullstrewn flat and down in chrystie street  mr tiger mcquirk arose with a feeling of disquiet that he did not understand with a practised foot he rolled three of his younger brothers like logs out of his way as they lay sleeping on the floor before a footsquare looking glass hung by the window he stood and shaved himself if that may seem to you a task too slight to be thus impressively chronicled i bear with you you do not know of the areas to be accomplished in traversing the cheek and chin of mr mcquirk  mcquirk senior had gone to work long before the big son of the house was idle he was a marblecutter and the marblecutters were out on a strike  what ails ye asked his mother looking at him curiously are ye not feeling well the morning maybe now  hes thinking along of annie maria doyle impudently explained younger brother tim ten years old  tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair  i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the idontknowwhatyoucallits i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i dont know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from popcorn to the elephant houdahs  its the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk its the sap risin time was when i couldnt keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggists  back up said mr mcquirk impatiently theres no spring in sight theres snow yet on the shed in donovans backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be  after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his greenandpurple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pineloquent of his chosen calling  since the strike had been called it was this particular strikers habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblacks stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve oclock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable faceblue where the razor had travelled his carefully considered clothes and air of capability was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye  but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system  mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organgrinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go pennyhunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blossomed there were green patches among the sidewalk debris of the grocers on a thirdstory windowsill the first elbow cushion of the seasonold gold stripes on a crimson groundsupported the kimonoed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were flying to the eaves with straws a secondhand store combining foresight with faith had set out an icechest and baseball goods  and then tigers eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus confronted him betokening the forward and heady brew  mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door  wots the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a goldlined épergne to drink it out ofhey  say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a fortyfivedegree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles ive changed me mind about drinkinsee you got your money aint you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you  thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him  leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee  irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty  hello dutch said mr mcquirk cant get your mind off of frankfurters can you  bah exclaimed the german coming and leaning in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters today dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bicnics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees  say said mr mcquirk setting his hat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there aint any more spring in the air than there is in a horsehair sofa in a second avenue furnished room for

feel der approach of spring firstdey are boets lovers and poor vidows  mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because he did not know what it was  two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat  mr mcquirk made the attack with the characteristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the defence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers unselfishly gave the warning cry of cheese itthe cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communicating backyards at the rear of the houses  mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamppost for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a redhaired young woman eating gumdrops came and looked freezingly at him across the icebound steppes of the counter  say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it lets see how it leads off      when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love      and whisper of those days of yore   im having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it hes a devil for songs and poetry when he cant get out to drink  we have not replied the young woman with unconcealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way      let us sit together in the old armchair      and while the firelight flickers well be comfortable there   there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last  is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever  come out in the hall said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weatheron the level  are you crazy sure said annie maria  i am said the tiger theyve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i  dear me said annie mariahavent you noticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there aint any yetits just a kind of feeling you

katzenjammer ive got dont spell violets it spells yer own name annie maria and its you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girldo we make a team  jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disappearing in his overcoat dont you see that spring is all over the world right this minute  but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow felleven so late in march on fifth avenue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be perceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre  at six oclock herr lutz began to close his shop he heard a wellknown shout hello dutch  tiger mcquirk in his shirtsleeves with his hat on the back of his head stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar  donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet  yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality its springtime by the watch     xviii  the foolkiller   down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness everybody says send for jesse holmes  jesse holmes is the foolkiller of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons cannot tell you whence comes the foolkillers name but few and happy are the households from the roanoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes  i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oftthreatened devoirs to me he was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet  but this is a story not a sequel  i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not contain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dicks three fingers of red pizen to the inefficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe dripone absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool greeneyeddeceptive  kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illustrated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idaho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a fullpage wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you employed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a monocle in the distance is a section of fortysecond street during a search for a lost gaspipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india  enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and gloriously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life had so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair kerners hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artists thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and he audited his dinners with red wine but most of all he was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he had come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitzjames obrien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool  id better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerners friendship he showed me her picture in a locketshe was a blonde or a brunettei have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl had worked for five years to reach that supreme elevation of remuneration beginning at 150 per week  kerners father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes kerner sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account  one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the exfathers two millionspouf  she was a wonder small and halfway pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap café as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didnt tell us that a large man with a ruby stickpin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that 2000000 can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elisecertainly that was her name told us merrily that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she the girlconfound the english language was heating an iron over the gas jet and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist andwell i wondered how in the world the chewing gum came to be theredont they ever stop chewing it  a while after thatdont be impatient the absinthe drip is coming nowkerner and i were dining at farronis a mandolin and a guitar were being attacked the room was full of smoke in nice long crinkly layers just like the artists draw the steam from a plum pudding on christmas posters and a lady in a blue silk and gasolined gauntlets was beginning to hum an air from the catskills  kerner said i you are a fool  of course said kerner i wouldnt let her go on working not my wife whats the use to wait shes willing i sold that water color of the palisades yesterday we could cook on a twoburner gas stove you know the ragouts i can throw together yes i think we will marry next week  kerner said i you are a fool  have an absinthe drip said kerner grandly tonight you are the guest of art in paying quantities i think we will get a flat with a bath  i never tried onei mean an absinthe drip said i  the waiter brought it and poured the water slowly over the ice in the dripper  it looks exactly like the mississippi river water in the big bend below natchez said i fascinated gazing at the bemuddled drip  there are such flats for eight dollars a week said kerner  you are a fool said i and began to sip the filtration what you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes  kerner not being a southerner did not comprehend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood  presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling had begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too highstrung to view such deviations from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood  one absinthe drip is not muchbut i said again to kerner kindly  you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours  and then i looked around and saw the foolkiller as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioners look and the dusty shoes of one who had been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i had invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men had escaped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes  the foolkiller got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ignoring me  you are a hopeless fool he said to the artist havent you had enough of starvation yet i offer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences  the foolkillers threatening face was within a foot of his victims but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence  we will be married next week he muttered absentmindedly with my studio furniture and some secondhand stuff we can make out  you have decided your own fate said the foolkiller in a low but terrible voice you may consider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance  in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money  on your own head be it hissed the foolkiller and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerners eyes nor his ears took the slightest cognizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i had been elected to save my friend from destruction at the foolkillers hands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face  excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me  the foolkiller turned and walked out of farronis  wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence  you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me  the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf  i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips  wait here said i furious if you dont care for your own life i will save it for you  i hurried out and overtook the man in gray halfway down the block he looked as i had seen him in my fancy a thousand timestruculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the streetsprinkler the dust would have been flying under his tread  i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with vacancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring  jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kernerthe wisest chap i ever knew in my life  the foolkiller looked at me grimly and closely  youve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if im not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too  i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by all the standards that you know he is the most egregious and grandiloquent and gorgeous fool in all the world thats why you want to kill him  would you mind telling me who or what you think i am asked the old man  i laughed boisterously and then stopped suddenly for i remembered that it would not do to be seen so hilarious in the company of nothing but a brick wall  you are jesse holmes the foolkiller i said solemnly and you are going to kill my friend kerner i dont know who rang you up but if you do kill him ill see that you get pinched for it that is i added despairingly if i can get a cop to see you they have a poor eye for mortals and i think it would take the whole force to round up a myth murderer  well said the foolkiller briskly i must be going you had better go home and sleep it off goodnight  at this i was moved by a sudden fear for kerner to a softer and more pleading mood i leaned against the gray mans sleeve and besought him  good mr foolkiller please dont kill little kerner why cant you go back south and kill congressmen and clayeaters and let us alone why dont you go up on fifth avenue and kill millionaires that keep their money locked up and wont let young fools marry because one of em lives on the wrong street come and have a drink jesse will you never get on to your job  do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about asked the foolkiller  i have the honor said i and thats why i called kerner a fool he is a fool because he has waited so long before marrying her he is a fool because he has been waiting in the hopes of getting the consent of some absurd twomilliondollarfool parent or something of the sort  maybe said the foolkillermaybe ii might have looked at it differently would you mind going back to the restaurant and bringing your friend kerner here  oh whats the use jesse i yawned he cant see you he didnt know you were talking to him at the table you are a fictitious character you know  maybe he can this time will you go fetch him  all right said i but ive a suspicion that youre not strictly sober jesse you seem to be wavering and losing your outlines dont vanish before i get back  i went back to kerner and said  theres a man with an invisible homicidal mania waiting to see you outside i believe he wants to murder you come along you wont see him so theres nothing to be frightened about  kerner looked anxious  why said he i had no idea one absinthe would do that youd better stick to würzburger ill walk home with you  i led him to jesse holmess  rudolf said the foolkiller ill give in bring her up to the house give me your hand boy  good for you dad said kerner shaking hands with the old man youll never regret it after you know her  so you did see him when he was talking to you at the table i asked kerner  we hadnt spoken to each other in a year said kerner its all right now  i walked away  where are you going called kerner  i am going to look for jesse holmes i answered with dignity and reserve     xix  transients in arcadia   there is a hotel on broadway that has escaped discovery by the summerresort promoters it is deep and wide and cool its rooms are finished in dark oak of a low temperature homemade breezes and deepgreen shrubbery give it the delights without the inconveniences of the adirondacks one can mount its broad staircases or glide dreamily upward in its aërial elevators attended by guides in brass buttons with a serene joy that alpine climbers have never attained there is a chef in its kitchen who will prepare for you brook trout better than the white mountains ever served sea food that would turn old point comfortby gad sahgreen with envy and maine venison that would melt the official heart of a game warden  a few have found out this oasis in the july desert of manhattan during that month you will see the hotels reduced array of guests scattered luxuriously about in the cool twilight of its lofty diningroom gazing at one another across the snowy waste of unoccupied tables silently congratulatory  superfluous watchful pneumatically moving waiters hover near supplying every want before it is expressed the temperature is perpetual april the ceiling is painted in water colors to counterfeit a summer sky across which delicate clouds drift and do not vanish as those of nature do to our regret  the pleasing distant roar of broadway is transformed in the imagination of the happy guests to the noise of a waterfall filling the woods with its restful sound at every strange footstep the guests turn an anxious ear fearful lest their retreat be discovered and invaded by the restless pleasureseekers who are forever hounding nature to her deepest lairs  thus in the depopulated caravansary the little band of connoisseurs jealously hide themselves during the heated season enjoying to the uttermost the delights of mountain and seashore that art and skill have gathered and served to them  in this july came to the hotel one whose card that she sent to the clerk for her name to be registered read mme héloise darcy beaumont  madame beaumont was a guest such as the hotel lotus loved she possessed the fine air of the élite tempered and sweetened by a cordial graciousness that made the hotel employees her slaves bellboys fought for the honor of answering her ring the clerks but for the question of ownership would have deeded to her the hotel and its contents the other guests regarded her as the final touch of feminine exclusiveness and beauty that rendered the entourage perfect  this superexcellent guest rarely left the hotel her habits were consonant with the customs of the discriminating patrons of the hotel lotus to enjoy that delectable hostelry one must forego the city as though it were leagues away by night a brief excursion to the nearby roofs is in order but during the torrid day one remains in the umbrageous fastnesses of the lotus as a trout hangs poised in the pellucid sanctuaries of his favorite pool  though alone in the hotel lotus madame beaumont preserved the state of a queen whose loneliness was of position only she breakfasted at ten a cool sweet leisurely delicate being who glowed softly in the dimness like a jasmine flower in the dusk  but at dinner was madames glory at its height she wore a gown as beautiful and immaterial as the mist from an unseen cataract in a mountain gorge the nomenclature of this gown is beyond the guess of the scribe always palered roses reposed against its lacegarnished front it was a gown that the headwaiter viewed with respect and met at the door you thought of paris when you saw it and maybe of mysterious countesses and certainly of versailles and rapiers and mrs fiske and rougeetnoir there was an untraceable rumor in the hotel lotus that madame was a cosmopolite and that she was pulling with her slender white hands certain strings between the nations in the favor of russia being a citizeness of the worlds smoothest roads it was small wonder that she was quick to recognize in the refined purlieus of the hotel lotus the most desirable spot in america for a restful sojourn during the heat of midsummer  on the third day of madame beaumonts residence in the hotel a young man entered and registered himself as a guest his clothingto speak of his points in approved orderwas quietly in the mode his features good and regular his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world he informed the clerk that he would remain three or four days inquired concerning the sailing of european steamships and sank into the blissful inanition of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn  the young mannot to question the veracity of the registerwas harold farrington he drifted into the exclusive and calm current of life in the lotus so tactfully and silently that not a ripple alarmed his fellowseekers after rest he ate in the lotus and of its patronym and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven  after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recovered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance  perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of summer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation  one tires of the old resorts said madame beaumont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there  even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter discovers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac  i hope our secret will be safe for a week anyhow said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so delightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains  i hear that badenbaden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority  i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails  harold farringtons eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad  madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture  one cannot hide here forever charming though it may be the château has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must givewhat a nuisance but i shall never forget my week in the hotel lotus  nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric  on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup  madame beaumont wore the same beautiful evening gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a onedollar bill  mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you something im going to leave before breakfast in the morning because ive got to go back to my work im behind the hosiery counter at caseys mammoth store and my vacations up at eight oclock tomorrow that paperdollar is the last cent ill see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night youre a real gentleman and youve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went  ive been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now ive done it and ive had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life im going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because ii thought you kind of liked me and ii liked you but oh i couldnt help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things ive read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady  this dress ive got onits the only one i have thats fit to weari bought from odowd  levinsky on the instalment plan  seventyfive dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid 10 down and theyre to collect 1 a week till its paid for thatll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress tomorrow i guess ill go up to my room now  harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotuss loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar  ive got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now theres a receipt for the dollar instalment ive been a collector for odowd  levinsky for three years funny aint it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation ive always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boatwhat  the face of the pseudo madame héloise darcy beaumont beamed  oh you bet ill go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coneyll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells  below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter singlefooted near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort  at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave and madame beaumont made her last ascent but before they reached the noiseless cage he said just forget that harold farrington will you mcmanus is the namejames mcmanus some call me jimmy  goodnight jimmy said madame     xx  the rathskeller and the rose   miss posie carrington had earned her success she began life handicapped by the family name of boggs in the small town known as cranberry corners at the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of carrington and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of broiler member of the famous dickeybird octette in the successful musical comedy fudge and fellows leader of the potatobug dance in folderol and at length to the part of the maid toinette in the kings bathrobe which captured the critics and gave her her chance and when we come to consider miss carrington she is in the heydey of flattery fame and fizz and that astute manager herr timothy goldstein has her signature to ironclad papers that she will star the coming season in dyde richs new play paresis by gaslight  promptly there came to herr timothy a capable twentiethcentury young character actor by the name of highsmith who besought engagement as sol haytosser the comic and chief male character part in paresis by gaslight  my boy said goldstein take the part if you can get it miss carrington wont listen to any of my suggestions she has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city she declares she wont set a foot on the stage unless haytosser is the best that can be raked up she was raised in a village you know and when a broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom shes on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought denman thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i dont want him or john drew or jim corbett or any of these swell actors that dont know a turnip from a turnstile i want the real article so my boy if you want to play sol haytosser you will have to convince miss carrington luck be with you  highsmith took the train the next day for cranberry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cranberry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes  it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the kings bathrobe  there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite marvellous bubbling electric famedrunken shall be named first herr goldstein follows sonorous curlyhaired heavy a trifle anxious as some bear that had caught somehow a butterfly in his claws next a man condemned to a newspaper sad courted armed analyzing for press agents dross every sentence that was poured over him eating his à la newburg in the silence of greatness to conclude a youth with parted hair a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the back of a supper check these sat at a table while the musicians played while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk  at 1145 a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed  exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxenhaired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and whitesocked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter  you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor  the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who regards bigeyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation  howre ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted dont ye remember mebill summersthe summerses that lived back of the blacksmith shop i reckon ive growed up some since ye left cranberry corners  liza perry lowed i might see ye in the city while i was here you know liza married benny stanfield and she says  ah say interrupted miss carrington brightly lize perry is never marriedwhat oh the freckles of her  married in june grinned the gossip and livin in the old tatum place ham riley perfessed religion old mrs blithers sold her place to capn spooner the youngest waters girl run away with a music teacher the courthouse burned up last march your uncle wiley was elected constable matilda hoskins died from runnin a needle in her hand and tom beedle is courtin sallie lathropthey say he dont miss a night but what hes settin on their porch  the walleyed thing exclaimed miss carrington with asperity why tom beedle oncesay you folks excuse me a whilethis is an old friend of minemrwhat was it yes mr summersmr goldstein mr ricketts mr oh whats yours johnnyll docome on over here and tell me some more  she swept him to an isolated table in a corner herr goldstein shrugged his fat shoulders and beckoned to the waiter the newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe the youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy the guests of the rathskeller laughed clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treating them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely  posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audiencea faculty that had won her laurels for her  i dont seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man but i know the summerses all right i guess there aint many changes in the old town you see any of my folks lately  and then highsmith played his trump the part of sol haytosser called for pathos as well as comedy miss carrington should see that he could do that as well  miss posie said bill summers i was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago no there aint many changes to speak of the lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down and yet it dont seem the same place that it used to be  hows ma asked miss carrington  she was settin by the front door crocheting a lampmat when i saw her last said bill shes oldern she was miss posie but everything in the house looked jest the same your ma asked me to set down dont touch that willow rocker william says she it aint been moved since posie left and thats the apron she was hemmin layin over the arm of it jist as she flung it im in hopes she goes on that posiell finish runnin out that hem some day  miss carrington beckoned peremptorily to a waiter  a pint of extra dry she ordered briefly and give the check to goldstein  the sun was shinin in the door went on the chronicler from cranberry and your ma was settin right in it i asked her if she hadnt better move back a little william says she when i get sot down and lookin down the road i cant bear to move never a day says she but what i set here every minute that i can spare and watch over them palins for posie she went away down that road in the night for we seen her little shoe tracks in the dust and somethin tells me shell come back that way agin when shes weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother  when i was comin away concluded bill i pulled this offn the bush by the front steps i thought maybe i might see you in the city and i knowed youd like somethin from the old home  he took from his coat pocket a rosea drooping yellow velvet odorous rose that hung its head in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a roman arena  miss carringtons penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orchestras rendering of bluebells  oh say she cried with glee aint those poky places the limit i just know that two hours at cranberry corners would give me the horrors now well im awful glad to have seen you mr summers guess ill bustle around to the hotel now and get my beauty sleep  she thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful dainty silken garments stood up and nodded imperiously at herr goldstein  her three companions and bill summers attended her to her cab when her flounces and streamers were all safely tucked inside she dazzled them with au revoirs from her shining eyes and teeth  come around to the hotel and see me bill before you leave the city she called as the glittering cab rolled away  highsmith still in his makeup went with herr goldstein to a café booth  bright idea eh asked the smiling actor ought to land sol haytosser for me dont you think the little lady never once tumbled  i didnt hear your conversation said goldstein but your makeup and acting was o k heres to your success youd better call on miss carrington early tomorrow and strike her for the part i dont see how she can keep from being satisfied with your exhibition of ability  at 1145 a m on the next day highsmith handsome dressed in the latest mode confident with a fuchsia in his buttonhole sent up his card to miss carrington in her select apartment hotel  he was shown up and received by the actresss french maid  i am sorree said mlle hortense but i am to say this to all it is with great regret mees carrington have cancelled all engagements on the stage and have returned to live in thathow you call that town cranberry cornaire     xxi  the clarion call   half of this story can be found in the records of the police department the other half belongs behind the business counter of a newspaper office  one afternoon two weeks after millionaire norcross was found in his apartment murdered by a burglar the murderer while strolling serenely down broadway ran plump against detective barney woods  is that you johnny kernan asked woods who had been nearsighted in public for five years  no less cried kernan heartily if it isnt barney woods late and early of old saint jo youll have to show me what are you doing east do the greengoods circulars get out that far  ive been in new york some years said woods im on the city detective force  well well said kernan breathing smiling joy and patting the detectives arm  come into mullers said woods and lets hunt a quiet table id like to talk to you awhile  it lacked a few minutes to the hour of four the tides of trade were not yet loosed and they found a quiet corner of the café kernan well dressed slightly swaggering selfconfident seated himself opposite the little detective with his pale sandy mustache squinting eyes and readymade cheviot suit  what business are you in now asked woods you know you left saint jo a year before i did  im selling shares in a copper mine said kernan i may establish an office here well well and so old barney is a new york detective you always had a turn that way you were on the police in saint jo after i left there werent you  six months said woods and now theres one more question johnny ive followed your record pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in saratoga and i never knew you to use your gun before why did you kill norcross  kernan stared for a few moments with concentrated attention at the slice of lemon in his highball and then he looked at the detective with a sudden crooked brilliant smile  how did you guess it barney he asked admiringly i swear i thought the job was as clean and as smooth as a peeled onion did i leave a string hanging out anywhere  woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil intended for a watchcharm  its the one i gave you the last christmas we were in saint jo ive got your shaving mug yet i found this under a corner of the rug in norcrosss room i warn you to be careful what you say ive got it put on to you johnny we were old friends once but i must do my duty youll have to go to the chair for norcross  kernan laughed  my luck stays with me said he whod have thought old barney was on my trail he slipped one hand inside his coat in an instant woods had a revolver against his side  put it away said kernan wrinkling his nose im only investigating aha it takes nine tailors to make a man but one can do a man up theres a hole in that vest pocket i took that pencil off my chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap put up your gun barney and ill tell you why i had to shoot norcross the old fool started down the hall after me popping at the buttons on the back of my coat with a peevish little 22 and i had to stop him the old lady was a darling she just lay in bed and saw her 12000 diamond necklace go without a chirp while she begged like a panhandler to have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth about 3 i guess she married old norcross for his money all right dont they hang on to the little trinkets from the man who lost out though there were six rings two brooches and a chatelaine watch fifteen thousand would cover the lot  i warned you not to talk said woods  oh thats all right said kernan the stuff is in my suit case at the hotel and now ill tell you why im talking because its safe im talking to a man i know you owe me a thousand dollars barney woods and even if you wanted to arrest me your hand wouldnt make the move  i havent forgotten said woods you counted out twenty fifties without a word ill pay it back some day that thousand saved me andwell they were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when i got back to the house  and so continued kernan you being barney woods born as true as steel and bound to play a white mans game cant lift a finger to arrest the man youre indebted to oh i have to study men as well as yale locks and window fastenings in my business now keep quiet while i ring for the waiter ive had a thirst for a year or two that worries me a little if im ever caught the lucky sleuth will have to divide honors with old boy booze but i never drink during business hours after a job i can crook elbows with my old friend barney with a clear conscience what are you taking  the waiter came with the little decanters and the siphon and left them alone again  youve called the turn said woods as he rolled the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful forefinger ive got to pass you up i cant lay a hand on you if id apaid that money backbut i didnt and that settles it its a bad break im making johnny but i cant dodge it you helped me once and it calls for the same  i knew it said kernan raising his glass with a flushed smile of selfappreciation i can judge men heres to barney forhes a jolly good fellow  i dont believe went on woods quietly as if he were thinking aloud that if accounts had been square between you and me all the money in all the banks in new york could have bought you out of my hands tonight  i know it couldnt said kernan thats why i knew i was safe with you  most people continued the detective look sideways at my business they dont class it among the fine arts and the professions but ive always taken a kind of fool pride in it and here is where i go busted i guess im a man first and a detective afterward ive got to let you go and then ive got to resign from the force i guess i can drive an express wagon your thousand dollars is further off than ever johnny  oh youre welcome to it said kernan with a lordly air id be willing to call the debt off but i know you wouldnt have it it was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it and now lets drop the subject im off to the west on a morning train i know a place out there where i can negotiate the norcross sparks drink up barney and forget your troubles well have a jolly time while the police are knocking their heads together over the case ive got one of my sahara thirsts on tonight but im in the handsthe unofficial handsof my old friend barney and i wont even dream of a cop  and then as kernans ready finger kept the button and the waiter working his weak pointa tremendous vanity and arrogant egotism began to show itself he recounted story after story of his successful plunderings ingenious plots and infamous transgressions until woods with all his familiarity with evildoers felt growing within him a cold abhorrence toward the utterly vicious man who had once been his benefactor  im disposed of of course said woods at length but i advise you to keep under cover for a spell the newspapers may take up this norcross affair there has been an epidemic of burglaries and manslaughter in town this summer  the word sent kernan into a high glow of sullen and vindictive rage  to hl with the newspapers he growled what do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in boxcar letters suppose they do take up a casewhat does it amount to the police are easy enough to fool but what do the newspapers do they send a lot of pinhead reporters around to the scene and they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while they take photos of the bartenders oldest daughter in evening dress to print as the fiancée of the young man in the tenth story who thought he heard a noise below on the night of the murder thats about as near as the newspapers ever come to running down mr burglar  well i dont know said woods reflecting some of the papers have done good work in that line theres the morning mars for instance it warmed up two or three trails and got the man after the police had let em get cold  ill show you said kernan rising and expanding his chest ill show you what i think of newspapers in general and your morning mars in particular  three feet from their table was the telephone booth kernan went inside and sat at the instrument leaving the door open he found a number in the book took down the receiver and made his demand upon central woods sat still looking at the sneering cold vigilant face waiting close to the transmitter and listened to the words that came from the thin truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile  that the morning mars    i want to speak to the managing editor   why tell him its some one who wants to talk to him about the norcross murder  you the editor    all right   i am the man who killed old norcross    wait hold the wire im not the usual crank    oh there isnt the slightest danger ive just been discussing it with a detective friend of mine i killed the old man at 230 a m two weeks ago tomorrow    have a drink with you now hadnt you better leave that kind of talk to your funny man cant you tell whether a mans guying you or whether youre being offered the biggest scoop your dull dishrag of a paper ever had    well thats so its a bobtail scoopbut you can hardly expect me to phone in my name and address    why oh because i heard you make a specialty of solving mysterious crimes that stump the police   no thats not all i want to tell you that your rotten lying penny sheet is of no more use in tracking an intelligent murderer or highwayman than a blind poodle would be   what    oh no this isnt a rival newspaper office youre getting it straight i did the norcross job and ive got the jewels in my suit case atthe name of the hotel could not be learnedyou recognize that phrase dont you i thought so youve used it often enough kind of rattles you doesnt it to have the mysterious villain call up your great big allpowerful organ of right and justice and good government and tell you what a helpless old gasbag you are    cut that out youre not that big a foolno you dont think im a fraud i can tell it by your voice    now listen and ill give you a pointer that will prove it to you of course youve had this murder case worked over by your staff of bright young blockheads half of the second button on old mrs norcrosss nightgown is broken off i saw it when i took the garnet ring off her finger i thought it was a ruby   stop that it wont work  kernan turned to woods with a diabolic smile  ive got him going he believes me now he didnt quite cover the transmitter with his hand when he told somebody to call up central on another phone and get our number ill give him just one more dig and then well make a getaway  hello    yes im here yet you didnt think id run from such a little subsidized turncoat rag of a newspaper did you    have me inside of fortyeight hours say will you quit being funny now you let grown men alone and attend to your business of hunting up divorce cases and streetcar accidents and printing the filth and scandal that you make your living by goodby old boysorry i havent time to call on you id feel perfectly safe in your sanctum asinorum trala  hes as mad as a cat thats lost a mouse said kernan hanging up the receiver and coming out and now barney my boy well go to a show and enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime four hours sleep for me and then the westbound  the two dined in a broadway restaurant kernan was pleased with himself he spent money like a prince of fiction and then a weird and gorgeous musical comedy engaged their attention afterward there was a late supper in a grillroom with champagne and kernan at the height of his complacency  halfpast three in the morning found them in a corner of an allnight café kernan still boasting in a vapid and rambling way woods thinking moodily over the end that had come to his usefulness as an upholder of the law  but as he pondered his eye brightened with a speculative light  i wonder if its possible he said to himself i wonder if its possible  and then outside the café the comparative stillness of the early morning was punctured by faint uncertain cries that seemed mere fireflies of sound some growing louder some fainter waxing and waning amid the rumble of milk wagons and infrequent cars shrill cries they were when nearwellknown cries that conveyed many meanings to the ears of those of the slumbering millions of the great city who waked to hear them cries that bore upon their significant small volume the weight of a worlds woe and laughter and delight and stress to some cowering beneath the protection of a nights ephemeral cover they brought news of the hideous bright day to others wrapped in happy sleep they announced a morning that would dawn blacker than sable night to many of the rich they brought a besom to sweep away what had been theirs while the stars shone to the poor they broughtanother day  all over the city the cries were starting up keen and sonorous heralding the chances that the slipping of one cogwheel in the machinery of time had made apportioning to the sleepers while they lay at the mercy of fate the vengeance profit grief reward and doom that the new figure in the calendar had brought them shrill and yet plaintive were the cries as if the young voices grieved that so much evil and so little good was in their irresponsible hands thus echoed in the streets of the helpless city the transmission of the latest decrees of the gods the cries of the newsboysthe clarion call of the press  woods flipped a dime to the waiter and said get me a morning mars  when the paper came he glanced at its first page and then tore a leaf out of his memorandum book and began to write on it with the little gold pencil  whats the news yawned kernan  woods flipped over to him the piece of writing      the new york morning mars     please pay to the order of john kernan the one thousand    dollars reward coming to me for his arrest and conviction     barnard woods   i kind of thought they would do that said woods when you were jollying them so hard now johnny youll come to the police station with me     xxii  extradited from bohemia   from near the village of harmony at the foot of the green mountains came miss medora martin to new york with her colorbox and easel  miss medora resembled the rose which the autumnal frosts had spared the longest of all her sister blossoms in harmony when she started alone to the wicked city to study art they said she was a mad reckless headstrong girl in new york when she first took her seat at a west side boardinghouse table the boarders asked who is the nicelooking old maid  medora took heart a cheap hall bedroom and two art lessons a week from professor angelini a retired barber who had studied his profession in a harlem dancing academy there was no one to set her right for here in the big city they do it unto all of us how many of us are badly shaved daily and taught the twostep imperfectly by expupils of bastien le page and gérôme the most pathetic sight in new yorkexcept the manners of the rushhour crowdsis the dreary march of the hopeless army of mediocrity here art is no benignant goddess but a circe who turns her wooers into mewing toms and tabbies who linger about the doorsteps of her abode unmindful of the flying brickbats and bootjacks of the critics some of us creep back to our native villages to the skimmilk of i told you so but most of us prefer to remain in the cold courtyard of our mistresss temple snatching the scraps that fall from her divine table dhôte but some of us grow weary at last of the fruitless service and then there are two fates open to us we can get a job driving a grocers wagon or we can get swallowed up in the vortex of bohemia the latter sounds good but the former really pans out better for when the grocer pays us off we can rent a dress suit andthe capitalized system of humor describes it bestget bohemia on the run  miss medora chose the vortex and thereby furnishes us with our little story  professor angelini praised her sketches excessively once when she had made a neat study of a horsechestnut tree in the park he declared she would become a second rosa bonheur againa great artist has his moodshe would say cruel and cutting things for example medora had spent an afternoon patiently sketching the statue and the architecture at columbus circle tossing it aside with a sneer the professor informed her that giotto had once drawn a perfect circle with one sweep of his hand  one day it rained the weekly remittance from harmony was overdue medora had a headache the professor had tried to borrow two dollars from her her art dealer had sent back all her watercolors unsold andmr binkley asked her out to dinner  mr binkley was the gay boy of the boardinghouse he was fortynine and owned a fishstall in a downtown market but after six oclock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts the young men said he was an indian he was supposed to be an accomplished habitué of the inner circles of bohemia it was no secret that he had once loaned 10 to a young man who had had a drawing printed in puck often has one thus obtained his entrée into the charmed circle while the other obtained both his entrée and roast  the other boarders enviously regarded medora as she left at mr binkleys side at nine oclock she was as sweet as a cluster of dried autumn grasses in her pale blueoherthat very thin stuffin her pale blue comstockized silk waist and boxpleated voile skirt with a soft pink glow on her thin cheeks and the tiniest bit of rouge powder on her face with her handkerchief and room key in her brown walrus pebblegrain handbag  and mr binkley looked imposing and dashing with his red face and gray mustache and his tight dress coat that made the back of his neck roll up just like a successful novelists  they drove in a cab to the café terence just off the most glittering part of broadway which as every one knows is one of the most popular and widely patronized jealously exclusive bohemian resorts in the city  down between the rows of little tables tripped medora of the green mountains after her escort thrice in a lifetime may woman walk upon cloudsonce when she trippeth to the altar once when she first enters bohemian halls the last when she marches back across her first garden with the dead hen of her neighbor in her hand  there was a table set with three or four about it a waiter buzzed around it like a bee and silver and glass shone upon it and preliminary to the meal as the prehistoric granite strata heralded the protozoa the bread of gaul compounded after the formula of the recipe for the eternal hills was there set forth to the hand and tooth of a longsuffering city while the gods lay beside their nectar and homemade biscuits and smiled and the dentists leaped for joy in their goldleafy dens  the eye of binkley fixed a young man at his table with the bohemian gleam which is a compound of the look of the basilisk the shine of a bubble of würzburger the inspiration of genius and the pleading of a panhandler  the young man sprang to his feet hello bink old boy he shouted dont tell me you were going to pass our table join usunless youve another crowd on hand  dont mind old chap said binkley of the fishstall you know how i like to butt up against the fine arts mr vandykemr madderermiss martin one of the elect also in arter  the introduction went around there were also miss elise and miss toinette perhaps they were models for they chattered of the st regis decorations and henry jamesand they did it not badly  medora sat in transport musicwild intoxicating music made by troubadours direct from a rear basement room in elysiumset her thoughts to dancing here was a world never before penetrated by her warmest imagination or any of the lines controlled by harriman with the green mountains external calm upon her she sat her soul flaming in her with the fire of andalusia the tables were filled with bohemia the room was full of the fragrance of flowersboth mille and cauli questions and corks popped laughter and silver rang champagne flashed in the pail wit flashed in the pan  vandyke ruffled his long black locks disarranged his careless tie and leaned over to madder  say maddy he whispered feelingly sometimes im tempted to pay this philistine his ten dollars and get rid of him  madder ruffled his long sandy locks and disarranged his careless tie  dont think of it vandy he replied we are short and art is long  medora ate strange viands and drank elderberry wine that they poured in her glass it was just the color of that in the vermont home the waiter poured something in another glass that seemed to be boiling but when she tasted it it was not hot she had never felt so lighthearted before she thought lovingly of the green mountain farm and its fauna she leaned smiling to miss elise  if i were at home she said beamingly i could show you the cutest little calf  nothing for you in the white lane said miss elise why dont you pad  the orchestra played a wailing waltz that medora had learned from the handorgans she followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum madder looked across the table at her and wondered in what strange waters binkley had caught her in his seine she smiled at him and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled when it was cold binkley had abandoned art and was prating of the unusual spring catch of shad miss elise arranged the paletteandmaulstick tie pin of mr vandyke a philistine at some distant table was maundering volubly either about jerome or gérôme a famous actress was discoursing excitably about monogrammed hosiery a hose clerk from a department store was loudly proclaiming his opinions of the drama a writer was abusing dickens a magazine editor and a photographer were drinking a dry brand at a reserved table a 362542 young lady was saying to an eminent sculptor fudge for your prax italys bring one of your venus anno dominis down to cohens and see how quick shed be turned down for a cloak model back to the quarries with your greeks and dagos  thus went bohemia  at eleven mr binkley took medora to the boardinghouse and left her with a society bow at the foot of the hall stairs she went up to her room and lit the gas  and then as suddenly as the dreadful genie arose in vapor from the copper vase of the fisherman arose in that room the formidable shape of the new england conscience the terrible thing that medora had done was revealed to her in its full enormity she had sat in the presence of the ungodly and looked upon the wine both when it was red and effervescent  at midnight she wrote this letter      mr beriah hoskins harmony vermont     dear sir henceforth consider me as dead to you forever    i have loved you too well to blight your career by bringing    into it my guilty and sinstained life i have succumbed    to the insidious wiles of this wicked world and have been    drawn into the vortex of bohemia there is scarcely any    depth of glittering iniquity that i have not sounded it is    hopeless to combat my decision there is no rising from the    depths to which i have sunk endeavor to forget me i am    lost forever in the fair but brutal maze of awful bohemia    farewell     once your medora   on the next day medora formed her resolutions beelzebub flung from heaven was no more cast down between her and the apple blossoms of harmony there was a fixed gulf flaming cherubim warded her from the gates of her lost paradise in one evening by the aid of binkley and mumm bohemia had gathered her into its awful midst  there remained to her but one thinga life of brilliant but irremediable error vermont was a shrine that she never would dare to approach again but she would not sinkthere were great and compelling ones in history upon whom she would model her meteoric careercamille lola montez royal mary zazasuch a name as one of these would that of medora martin be to future generations  for two days medora kept her room on the third she opened a magazine at the portrait of the king of belgium and laughed sardonically if that farfamed breaker of womens hearts should cross her path he would have to bow before her cold and imperious beauty she would not spare the old or the young all americaall europe should do homage to her sinister but compelling charm  as yet she could not bear to think of the life she had once desireda peaceful one in the shadow of the green mountains with beriah at her side and orders for expensive oil paintings coming in by each mail from new york her one fatal misstep had shattered that dream  on the fourth day medora powdered her face and rouged her lips once she had seen carter in zaza she stood before the mirror in a reckless attitude and cried zut zut she rhymed it with nut but with the lawless word harmony seemed to pass away forever the vortex had her she belonged to bohemia for evermore and never would beriah  the door opened and beriah walked in  dory said he whats all that chalk and pink stuff on your face honey  medora extended an arm  too late she said solemnly the die is cast i belong in another world curse me if you willit is your right go and leave me in the path i have chosen bid them all at home never to mention my name again and sometimes beriah pray for me when i am revelling in the gaudy but hollow pleasures of bohemia  get a towel dory said beriah and wipe that paint off your face i came as soon as i got your letter them pictures of yours aint amounting to anything ive got tickets for both of us back on the evening train hurry and get your things in your trunk  fate was too strong for me beriah go while i am strong to bear it  how do you fold this easel dorynow begin to pack so we have time to eat before train time the maples is all out in fullgrown leaves doryyou just ought to see em  not this early beriah  you ought to see em dory theyre like an ocean of green in the morning sunlight  oh beriah  on the train she said to him suddenly  i wonder why you came when you got my letter  oh shucks said beriah did you think you could fool me how could you be run away to that bohemia country like you said when your letter was postmarked new york as plain as day     xxiii  a philistine in bohemia   george washington with his right arm upraised sits his iron horse at the lower corner of union square forever signaling the broadway cars to stop as they round the curve into fourteenth street but the cars buzz on heedless as they do at the beck of a private citizen and the great general must feel unless his nerves are iron that rapid transit gloria mundi  should the general raise his left hand as he has raised his right it would point to a quarter of the city that forms a haven for the oppressed and suppressed of foreign lands in the cause of national or personal freedom they have found a refuge here and the patriot who made it for them sits his steed overlooking their district while he listens through his left ear to vaudeville that caricatures the posterity of his protégés italy poland the former spanish possessions and the polyglot tribes of austriahungary have spilled here a thick lather of their effervescent sons in the eccentric cafés and lodginghouses of the vicinity they hover over their native wines and political secrets the colony changes with much frequency faces disappear from the haunts to be replaced by others whither do these uneasy birds flit for half of the answer observe carefully the suave foreign air and foreign courtesy of the next waiter who serves your table dhôte for the other half perhaps if the barber shops had tongues and who will dispute it they could tell their share  titles are as plentiful as finger rings among these transitory exiles for lack of proper exploitation a stock of title goods large enough to supply the trade of upper fifth avenue is here condemned to a mere pushcart traffic the newworld landlords who entertain these offshoots of nobility are not dazzled by coronets and crests they have doughnuts to sell instead of daughters with them it is a serious matter of trading in flour and sugar instead of pearl powder and bonbons  these assertions are deemed fitting as an introduction to the tale which is of plebeians and contains no one with even the ghost of a title  katy dempseys mother kept a furnishedroom house in this oasis of the aliens the business was not profitable if the two scraped together enough to meet the landlords agent on rent day and negotiate for the ingredients of a daily irish stew they called it success often the stew lacked both meat and potatoes sometimes it became as bad as consommé with music  in this mouldy old house katy waxed plump and pert and wholesome and as beautiful and freckled as a tiger lily she was the good fairy who was guilty of placing the damp clean towels and cracked pitchers of freshly laundered croton in the lodgers rooms  you are informed by virtue of the privileges of astronomical discovery that the star lodgers name was mr brunelli his wearing a yellow tie and paying his rent promptly distinguished him from the other lodgers his raiment was splendid his complexion olive his mustache fierce his manners a princes his rings and pins as magnificent as those of a traveling dentist  he had breakfast served in his room and he ate it in a red dressing gown with green tassels he left the house at noon and returned at midnight those were mysterious hours but there was nothing mysterious about mrs dempseys lodgers except the things that were not mysterious one of mr kiplings poems is addressed to ye who hold the unwritten clue to all save all unwritten things the same readers are invited to tackle the foregoing assertion  mr brunelli being impressionable and a latin fell to conjugating the verb amare with katy in the objective case though not because of antipathy she talked it over with her mother  sure i like him said katy hes more politeness than twinty candidates for alderman and lie makes me feel like a queen whin he walks at me side but what is he i dinno ive me suspicions the marninll coom whin hell throt out the picture av his baronial halls and ax to have the weeks rint hung up in the ice chist along wid all the rist of em  tis thrue admitted mrs dempsey that he seems to be a sort iv a dago and too coolchured in his spache for a rale gentleman but ye may be misjudgin him ye should niver suspect any wan of bein of noble descint that pays cash and pathronizes the laundry riglar  hes the same thricks of spakin and blarneyin wid his hands sighed katy as the frinch nobleman at mrs tooles that ran away wid mr tooles sunday pants and left the photograph of the bastile his grandfathers chattaw as security for tin weeks rint  mr brunelli continued his calorific wooing katy continued to hesitate one day he asked her out to dine and she felt that a dénouement was in the air while they are on their way with katy in her best muslin you must take as an entracte a brief peep at new yorks bohemia  tonios restaurant is in bohemia the very location of it is secret if you wish to know where it is ask the first person you meet he will tell you in a whisper tonio discountenances custom he keeps his housefront black and forbidding he gives you a pretty bad dinner he locks his door at the dining hour but he knows spaghetti as the boardinghouse knows cold veal andhe has deposited many dollars in a certain banco di something with many gold vowels in the name on its windows  to this restaurant mr brunelli conducted katy the house was dark and the shades were lowered but mr brunelli touched an electric button by the basement door and they were admitted  along a long dark narrow hallway they went and then through a shining and spotless kitchen that opened directly upon a back yard  the walls of houses hemmed three sides of the yard a high board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits with defective pronunciation might make puns in connection with the ragout  a dozen and a half little tables set upon the bare ground were crowded with bohemiahunters who flocked there because tonio pretended not to want them and pretended to give them a good dinner there was a sprinkling of real bohemians present who came for a change because they were tired of the real bohemia and a smart shower of the men who originate the bright sayings of congressmen and the little nephew of the wellknown general passenger agent of the evansville and terre haute railroad company  here is a bon mot that was manufactured at tonios  a dinner at tonios said a bohemian always amounts to twice the price that is asked for it  let us assume that an accommodating voice inquires  how so  the dinner costs you 40 cents you give 10 cents to the waiter and it makes you feel like 30 cents  most of the diners were confirmed table dhôtersgastronomic adventurers forever seeking the el dorado of a good claret and consistently coming to grief in california  mr brunelli escorted katy to a little table embowered with shrubbery in tubs and asked her to excuse him for a while  katy sat enchanted by a scene so brilliant to her the grand ladies in splendid dresses and plumes and sparkling rings the fine gentlemen who laughed so loudly the cries of garsong and we monseer and hello mame that distinguish bohemia the lively chatter the cigarette smoke the interchange of bright smiles and eyeglancesall this display and magnificence overpowered the daughter of mrs dempsey and held her motionless  mr brunelli stepped into the yard and seemed to spread his smile and bow over the entire company and everywhere there was a great clapping of hands and a few cries of bravo and tonio tonio whatever those words might mean ladies waved their napkins at him gentlemen almost twisted their necks off trying to catch his nod  when the ovation was concluded mr brunelli with a final bow stepped nimbly into the kitchen and flung off his coat and waistcoat  flaherty the nimblest garsong among the waiters had been assigned to the special service of katy she was a little faint from hunger for the irish stew on the dempsey table had been particularly weak that day delicious odors from unknown dishes tantalized her and flaherty began to bring to her table course after course of ambrosial food that the gods might have pronounced excellent  but even in the midst of her lucullian repast katy laid down her knife and fork her heart sank as lead and a tear fell upon her filet mignon her haunting suspicions of the star lodger arose again fourfold thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly what else could mr brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled patricians glorious of name but shy of rent money concerning whom experience had made her wise with a sense of his ineligibility growing within her there was mingled a torturing conviction that his personality was becoming more pleasing to her day by day and why had he left her to dine alone  but here he was coming again now coatless his snowy shirtsleeves rolled high above his jeffriesonian elbows a white yachting cap perched upon his jetty curls  tonio tonio shouted many and the spaghetti the spaghetti shouted the rest  never at tonios did a waiter dare to serve a dish of spaghetti until tonio came to test it to prove the sauce and add the needful dash of seasoning that gave it perfection  from table to table moved tonio like a prince in his palace greeting his guests white jewelled hands signalled him from every side  a glass of wine with this one and that smiles for all a jest and repartee for any that might challengetruly few princes could be so agreeable a host and what artist could ask for further appreciation of his handiwork katy did not know that the proudest consummation of a new yorkers ambition is to shake hands with a spaghetti chef or to receive a nod from a broadway headwaiter  at last the company thinned leaving but a few couples and quartettes lingering over new wine and old stories and then came mr brunelli to katys secluded table and drew a chair close to hers  katy smiled at him dreamily she was eating the last spoonful of a raspberry roll with burgundy sauce  you have seen said mr brunelli laying one hand upon his collar bone i am antonio brunelli yes i am the great tonio you have not suspect that i loave you katy and you shall marry with me is it not so call me antonio and say that you will be mine  katys head drooped to the shoulder that was now freed from all suspicion of having received the knightly accolade  oh andy she sighed this is great sure ill marry wid ye but why didnt ye tell me ye was the cook i was near turnin ye down for bein one of thim foreign counts     xxiv  from each according to his ability   vuyning left his club cursing it softly without any particular anger from ten in the morning until eleven it had bored him immeasurably kirk with his fish story brooks with his porto rico cigars old morrison with his anecdote about the widow hepburn with his invariable luck at billiardsall these afflictions had been repeated without change of bill or scenery besides these morning evils miss allison had refused him again on the night before but that was a chronic trouble five times she had laughed at his offer to make her mrs vuyning he intended to ask her again the next wednesday evening  vuyning walked along fortyfourth street to broadway and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the goldmines of gotham he wore a morning suit of light gray low dull kid shoes a plain finely woven straw hat and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope his necktie was the bluegray of a november sky and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion  now to write of a mans haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel around paul jones or to pen a testimonial to a hayfever cure  therefore let it be known that the description of vuynings apparel is germane to the movements of the story and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods  even broadway that morning was a discord in vuynings ears and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy dreary minutes a certain howling scorching seething malodorous slice of street that he remembered in morocco he saw the struggling mass of dogs beggars fakirs slavedrivers and veiled women in carts without horses the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the streetand then a lady passing jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to broadway  five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner where a number of silent palefaced men are accustomed to stand immovably for hours busy with the file blades of their penknives with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids wall street speculators driving home in their carriages love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous loungingplace of the crooks on wall street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives  vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing he was hungry for something out of the ordinary and to be accosted by this smoothfaced keeneyed lowvoiced athletic member of the under world with his grim yet pleasant smile had all the taste of an adventure to the conventionweary vuyning  excuse me friend said he could i have a few minutes talk with youon the level  certainly said vuyning with a smile but suppose we step aside to a quieter place there is a divana café over here that will do schrumm will give us a private corner  schrumm established them under a growing palm with two seidls between them vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions thus forming a hinge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other  in the first place said his companion with the air of one who presents his credentials i want you to understand that i am a crook out west i am known as rowdy the dude pickpocket supper man secondstory man yeggman boxman allround burglar cardsharp and slickest con man west of the twentythird street ferry landingthats my history thats to show im on the squarewith you my names emerson  confound old kirk with his fish stories said vuyning to himself with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card its pronounced vining he said as he tossed it over to the other and ill be as frank with you im just a kind of a loafer i guess living on my daddys money at the club they call me leftatthepost i never did a days work in my life and i havent the heart to run over a chicken when im motoring its a pretty shabby record altogether  theres one thing you can do said emerson admiringly you can carry duds ive watched you several times pass on broadway you look the best dressed man ive seen and ill bet you a gold mine ive got 50 worth more gents furnishings on my frame than you have thats what i wanted to see you about i cant do the trick take a look at me whats wrong  stand up said vuyning  emerson arose and slowly revolved  youve been outfitted declared the clubman some broadway windowdresser has misused you thats an expensive suit though emerson  a hundred dollars said emerson  twenty too much said vuyning six months old in cut one inch too long and half an inch too much lapel your hat is plainly dated one year ago although theres only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story that english poke in your collar is too short by the distance between troy and london a plain gold link cuffbutton would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with diamond settings those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a brooklyn schoolmaam on a two weeks visit to lake ronkonkoma i think i caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when youimproperly drew up your trousers as you sat down there are always plain ones to be had in the stores have i hurt your feelings emerson  double the ante cried the criticised one greedily give me more of it theres a way to tote the haberdashery and i want to get wise to it say youre the right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me  your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness  thanks gratefullyi spent over half an hour at it before i  thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window  yours truly said emerson sitting down again its bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldnt just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes  oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago im told they did that  and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didnt have a chance to catch on to the correct styles  i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings ill take you to my tailor hell eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense  play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy ive got a roll as big around as a barrel of blackeyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a twoforfiver i dont mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglarproof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of 16000  arent you afraid asked vuyning that ill call a cop and hand you over  you tell me said emerson coolly why i didnt keep them  he laid vuynings pocketbook and watchthe vuyning 100yearold family watchon the table  man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the sixpound trout and the old fisherman  seems not said emerson politely id like to  but you wont said vuyning ive heard it scores of times thats why i wont tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor    boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening  will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair  will he mention the new twentythreestory masonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his noseglasses  will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely  be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safeblower and a pal of mine  oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor  it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuynings right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insignificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deepchested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash  and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snowtopped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pinecrowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a bloodstained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the lookingglass country  as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and fortyfive reduced ennui to a minimum  and then with a sweep of his white unringed hands he dismissed melpomene and forthwith diana and amaryllis footed it before the minds eyes of the clubmen  the savannas of the continent spread before them the wind humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite closed their ears to the citys staccato noises he told them of camps of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blossoms of gallops in the stilly night that apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy he read them the great rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the hand of man the mason his words were a telescope to the city men whose eyes had looked upon youngstown o and whose tongues had called it west  in fact emerson had them going    the next morning at ten he met vuyning by appointment at a fortysecond street café  emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles  mr vuyning said he with the clear ingenuous smile of the successful crook its up to me to go the limit for you any time i can do so youre the real thing and if i can ever return the favor you bet your life ill do it  what was that cowpunchers name asked vuyning who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane and throw him till he put the bridle on  bates said emerson  thanks said vuyning i thought it was yates oh about that toggery businessid forgotten that  ive been looking for some guy to put me on the right track for years said emerson youre the goods duty free and halfway to the warehouse in a red wagon  bacon toasted on a green willow switch over red coals ought to put broiled lobsters out of business said vuyning and you say a horse at the end of a thirtyfoot rope cant pull a teninch stake out of wet prairie well goodbye old man if you must be off  at one oclock vuyning had luncheon with miss allison by previous arrangement  for thirty minutes he babbled to her unaccountably of ranches horses cañons cyclones roundups rocky mountains and beans and bacon she looked at him with wondering and halfterrified eyes  i was going to propose again today said vuyning cheerily but i wont ive worried you often enough you know dad has a ranch in colorado whats the good of staying here jumping jonquils but its great out there im going to start next tuesday  no you wont said miss allison  what said vuyning  not alone said miss allison dropping a tear upon her salad what do you think  betty exclaimed vuyning what do you mean  ill go too said miss allison forcibly vuyning filled her glass with apollinaris  heres to rowdy the dude he gavea toast mysterious  dont know him said miss allison but if hes your friend jimmyhere goes     xxv  the memento   miss lynnette darmande turned her back on broadway this was but tit for tat because broadway had often done the same thing to miss darmande still the tats seemed to have it for the exleading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no viceversâ  so miss lynnette darmande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lislethread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressingroom on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stockings must not be neglected silk does wear out so butafter all isnt it just the only goods there is  the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thoroughfares clash here the playerbands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are bookingoffices theatres agents schools and the lobsterpalaces to which those thorny paths lead  wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the house lingers a sense of unrest of expectation of transientness even of anxiety and apprehension the halls are a labyrinth without a guide you wander like a lost soul in a sam loyd puzzle  turning any corner a dressingsack or a culdesac may bring you up short you meet alarming tragedians stalking in bathrobes in search of rumored bathrooms from hundreds of rooms come the buzz of talk scraps of new and old songs and the ready laughter of the convened players  summer has come their companies have disbanded and they take their rest in their favorite caravansary while they besiege the managers for engagements for the coming season  at this hour of the afternoon the days work of tramping the rounds of the agents offices is over past you as you ramble distractedly through the mossy halls flit audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tagends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adams apples gather in doorways and talk of booth farreaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan  the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet poppingat reasonable and salubrious intervalsof beerbottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easilythe comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred  miss darmandes room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the washstand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the exleading ladys collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends  at one of these photographs she looked twice or thrice as she darned and smiled friendlily  id like to know where lee is just this minute she said halfaloud  if you had been privileged to view the photograph thus flattered you would have thought at the first glance that you saw the picture of a manypetalled white flower blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness  you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heelsoverhead turn in her wistariaentwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cameras inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below  you saw too amid the blackclothed mainly masculine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the brilliant aërial token  forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutesa song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a stepladder and featherduster but when the blossomdecked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdonthen it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single manor presumably soand indorsed the specialty that made miss rays name a favorite in the bookingoffices  at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly announced to her dear friend miss darmande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more  seventeen minutes after miss lynnette darmande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door  doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy handbag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travelstained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yardlong flying ends gray walkingsuit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters  when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins  the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catechetical that distinguishes the greetings of their unprofessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in foreign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads  ive got the hallroom two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didnt know you were here till they told me  ive been in since the last of april said lynnette and im going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in elizabeth i thought youd quit the stage lee tell me about yourself  rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss darmandes wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfortable as though the deepest armchairs embraced them  im going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then tomorrow ill strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four oclock this afternoon that id ever listen to that leaveyournameandaddress rot of the booking bunch again id have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce ive got enough softcoal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn  miss darmande opened a door of the washstand and took out a bottle  theres nearly a pint of manhattan theres a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but  oh pass the bottle save the glass for company thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months  yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of menof the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to usits a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motorcar to the billposters who want to call us by our front names  and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stagedoor kind and the managers friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us theyre beasts and i hate em  i tell you lynn its the girls like us on the stage that ought to be pitied its girls from good homes that are honestly ambitious and work hard to rise in the profession but never do get there you hear a lot of sympathy sloshed around on chorus girls and their fifteen dollars a week piffle there aint a sorrow in the chorus that a lobster cannot heal  if theres any tears to shed let em fall for the actress that gets a salary of from thirty to fortyfive dollars a week for taking a leading part in a bum show she knows shell never do any better but she hangs on for years hoping for the chance i that never comes  and the fool plays we have to work in having another girl roll you around the stage by the hind legs in a wheelbarrow chorus in a musical comedy is dignified drama compared with the idiotic things ive had to do in the thirtycenters  but what i hated most was the menthe men leering and blathering at you across tables trying to buy you with würzburger or extra dry according to their estimate of your price and the men in the audiences clapping yelling snarling crowding writhing gloatinglike a lot of wild beasts with their eyes fixed on you ready to eat you up if you come in reach of their claws oh how i hate em  well im not telling you much about myself am i lynn  i had two hundred dollars saved up and i cut the stage the first of the summer i went over on long island and found the sweetest little village that ever was called soundport right on the water i was going to spend the summer there and study up on elocution and try to get a class in the fall there was an old widow lady with a cottage near the beach who sometimes rented a room or two just for company and she took me in she had another boarder toothe reverend arthur lyle  yes he was the headliner youre on lynn ill tell you all of it in a minute its only a oneact play  the first time he walked on lynn i felt myself going the first lines he spoke he had me he was different from the men in audiences he was tall and slim and you never heard him come in the room but you felt him he had a face like a picture of a knightlike one of that round table bunchand a voice like a cello solo and his manners  lynn if youd take john drew in his best drawingroom scene and compare the two youd have john arrested for disturbing the peace  ill spare you the particulars but in less than a month arthur and i were engaged he preached at a little onenight stand of a methodist church there was to be a parsonage the size of a lunchwagon and hens and honeysuckles when we were married arthur used to preach to me a good deal about heaven but he never could get my mind quite off those honeysuckles and hens  no i didnt tell him id been on the stage i hated the business and all that went with it id cut it out forever and i didnt see any use of stirring things up i was a good girl and i didnt have anything to confess except being an elocutionist and that was about all the strain my conscience would stand  oh i tell you lynn i was happy i sang in the choir and attended the sewing society and recited that annie laurie thing with the whistling stunt in it in a manner bordering upon the professional as the weekly village paper reported it and arthur and i went rowing and walking in the woods and clamming and that poky little village seemed to me the best place in the world id have been happy to live there always too if  but one morning old mrs gurley the widow lady got gossipy while i was helping her string beans on the back porch and began to gush information as folks who rent out their rooms usually do mr lyle was her idea of a saint on earthas he was mine too she went over all his virtues and graces and wound up by telling me that arthur had had an extremely romantic loveaffair not long before that had ended unhappily she didnt seem to be on to the details but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard he was paler and thinner she said and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study  several times says she ive seen him gloomerin over that box of evenings and he always locks it up right away if anybody comes into the room  well you can imagine how long it was before i got arthur by the wrist and led him down stage and hissed in his ear  that same afternoon we were lazying around in a boat among the waterlilies at the edge of the bay  arthur says i you never told me youd had another loveaffair but mrs gurley did i went on to let him know i knew i hate to hear a man lie  before you came says he looking me frankly in the eye there was a previous affectiona strong one since you know of it i will be perfectly candid with you  i am waiting says i  my dear ida says arthurof course i went by my real name while i was in soundportthis former affection was a spiritual one in fact although the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldnt let that come between us  was she pretty i asked  she was very beautiful said arthur  did you see her often i asked  something like a dozen times says he  always from a distance says i  always from quite a distance says he  and you loved her i asked  she seemed my ideal of beauty and graceand soul says arthur  and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her  a memento says arthur that i have treasured  did she send it to you  it came to me from her says he  in a roundabout way i asked  somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct  why didnt you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different  she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past youre not going to be jealous are you  jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it  and it did lynnif you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing id ever heard of think of a man loving a woman hed never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men id always known come at you with either diamonds knockoutdrops or a raise of salaryand their idealswell well say no more  yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldnt be jealous of that faraway divinity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did  about four oclock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone  in passing by arthurs study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where hed forgotten em well i guess were all to the mrs bluebeard now and then aint we lynn i made up my mind id have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it wasit was just curiosity  while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud shed dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her hed cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world  i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gents collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid  i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a sidecomb put on my hat and went in and gave the old ladys foot a kick id tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthurs sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then  stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghosts about to walk im going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk  i handed her the money  dear me miss crosby says she is anything wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be  youre damn right says i some of em are but you cant say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the humanrace question  and then i caught the fourthirtyeight softcoal unlimited and here i am  you didnt tell me what was in the box lee said miss darmande anxiously  one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn
