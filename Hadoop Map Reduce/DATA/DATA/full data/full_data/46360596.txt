inexpressibles gave a ball they borrowed a sevenpounder from the gunners and wreathed it with laurels and made the dancingfloor plateglass and provided a supper the like of which had never been eaten before and set two sentries at the door of the room to hold the trays of programmecards my friend private mulvaney was one of the sentries because he was the tallest man in the regiment when the dance was fairly started the sentries were released and private mulvaney went to curry favour with the mess sergeant in charge of the supper whether the mess sergeant gave or mulvaney took i cannot say all that i am certain of is that at suppertime i found mulvaney with private ortheris twothirds of a ham a loaf of bread half a patedefoiegras and two magnums of champagne sitting on the roof of my

he found ut too sweet for to spit out eyah he was a tricky man an a liar by natur some are born so he was wan i knew he was over his belt in money borrowed from natives besides a lot av other matthers which in regard for your presince sorr i will oblitherate a little av fwhat i knew the colonel knew for he wud have none av him an that im thinkin by fwhat happened aftherwards the captn knew  wan day bein mortial idle or they wud never ha thried ut the rigmint gave amshure theatricalsorfcers an orfcers ladies youve seen the likes time an agin sorr an poor fun tis for them that sit in the back row an stamp wid their boots for the honour av the rigmint i was told off for to shif the scenes haulin up this an draggin down that light work ut was wid lashins av beer and the gurl that dhressed the orfcers ladiesbut she died in aggra twelve years gone an my tongues gettin the betther av me they was actin a play thing called sweethearts which you may ha heard av an the colonels daughter she was a ladys maid the captn was a boy called broomspread broom was his name in the play thin i saw ut come out in the actinfwhat i niver saw before an that was that he was no gentleman they was too much together thim two awhishperin behind the scenes i shifted an some av what they said i heard for i was deathblue death an ivyon the combcuttin he was iverlastinly oppressing her to fall in wid some sneakin schame av his an she was thryin to stand out against him but not as though she was set in her will i wonder now in thim days that my ears did not grow a yard on me head wid listnin but i looked straight forninst me an hauled up this an dragged down that such as was my duty an the orfcers ladies sez one to another thinkin i was out av listenreach fwhat an obligin young man is this corpril mulvaney i was a corpril then i was rejuced aftherwards but no matther i was a corpril wanst  well this sweethearts business wint on like most amshure theatricals an barrin fwhat i suspicioned twasnt till the dhressrehearsal that i saw for certain that thim twohe the blackguard an she no wiser than she should ha beenhad put up an evasion  a what said i  evasion fwhat you call an elopemint evasion i calls it bekaze exceptin whin tis right an natural an proper tis wrong an dhirty to steal a mans wan child she not knowin her own mind there was a sargint in the commssariat who set my face upon evasions ill tell you about that  stick to the bloomin captains mulvaney said ortheris commssariat sargints is low  mulvaney accepted the amendment and went on  now i knew that the colonel was no fool any more than me for i was hild the smartest man in the rigmint an the colonel was the best orfcer commandin in asia so fwhat he said an i said was a mortial truth we knew that the captn was bad but for reasons which i have already oblitherated i knew more than me colonel i wud ha rolled out his face wid the butt av my gun before permittin av him to steal the gurl saints knew av he wud ha married her and av he didnt she wud be in great tormint an the divil av a scandal but i niver sthruck niver raised me hand on my shuperior orfcer an that was a merricle now i come to considher it  mulvaney the dawns risin said ortheris an were no nearer ome than we was at the beginnin lend me your pouch mines all dust  mulvaney pitched his pouch over and filled his pipe afresh  so the dhressrehearsal came to an end an bekaze i was curious i stayed behind whin the sceneshiftin was ended an i shud ha been in barricks lyin as flat as a toad under a painted cottage thing they was

station wid the gurls kit at the end av the first piece twas the kit that flusthered me for i knew for a captn to go trapesing about the impire wid the lord knew what av a truso on his arrum was

colonels daughter an you was blazin copped when you tried to wash in the fort ditch  that said mulvaney finishing the champagne is a shuparfluous an impertnint observation     of those called  footnote 1895  we were wallowing through the china seas in a dense fog the horn blowing every two minutes for the benefit of the fishery craft that crowded the waterways from the bridge the focsle was invisible from the handwheel at the stern the captains cabin the fog held possession of everythingthe pearly white fog once or twice when it tried to lift we saw a glimpse of the oily sea the flitting vision of a junks sail spread in the vain hope of catching the breeze or the buoys of a line of nets somewhere close to us lay the land but it might have been the kurile islands for aught we knew very early in the morning there passed us not a cableslength away but as unseen as the spirits of the dead a steamer of the same line as ours she howled melodiously in answer to our bellowing and passed on  suppose she had hit us said a man from saigon then we should have gone down answered the chief officer sweetly  beastly thing to go down in a fog said a young gentleman who was travelling for pleasure chokes a man both ways y know we were comfortably gathered in the smokingroom the weather being too cold to venture on the deck conversation naturally turned upon accidents of fog the horn tooting significantly in the pauses between the tales i heard of the wreck of the eric the cutting down of the strathnairn within half a mile of harbour and the carrying away of the bow plates of the sigismund outside sandy hook  it is astonishing said the man from saigon how many true stories are put down as sea yarns it makes a man almost shrink from telling an anecdote  oh please dont shrink on our account said the smokingroom with one voice  its not my own story said the man from saigon a fellow on a massageries boat told it me he had been third officer of a sort on a geordie trampone of those lumbering dishbottomed coalbarges where the machinery is tied up with a string and the plates are rivetted with putty the way he told his tale was this the tramp had been creeping along some sea or other with a chart ten years old and the haziest sort of chronometers when she got into a fogjust such a fog as we have now  here the smokingroom turned round as one man and looked through the windows  in the mans own words just when the fog was thickest the engines broke down they had been doing this for some weeks and we were too weary to care i went forward of the bridge and leaned over the side wondering where i should ever get something that i could call a ship and whether the old hulk would fall to pieces as she lay the fog was as thick as any london one but as white as steam while they were tinkering at the engines below i heard a voice in the fog about twenty yards from the ships side calling out can you climb on board if we throw you a rope that startled me because i fancied we were going to be run down the next minute by a ship engaged in rescuing a man overboard i shouted for the engineroom whistle and it whistled about five minutes but never the sound of a ship could we hear the ships boy came forward with some biscuit for me as he put it into my hand i heard the voice in the fog crying out about throwing us a rope this time it was the boy that yelled ship on us and off went the whistle again while the men in the engineroomit generally took the ships crew to repair the hespas enginestumbled upon deck to know what we were doing i told them about the hail and we listened in the smother of the fog for the sound of a screw we listened for ten minutes then we blew the whistle for another ten then the crew began to call the ships boy a fool meaning that the third mate was no better when they were going down below i heard the hail the third time so did the ships boy there you are i said it is not twenty yards from us the engineer sings out i heard it too are you all asleep then the crew began to swear at the engineer and what with discussion argument and a little swearingfor there is not much discipline on board a trampwe raised such a row that our skipper came aft to enquire i the engineer and the ships boy stuck to our tale voices or no voices said the captain youd better patch the old engines up and see if youve got enough steam to whistle with ive a notion that weve got into rather too crowded ways  the engineer stayed on deck while the men went down below the skipper hadnt got back to the chartroom before i saw thirty feet of bowsprit hanging over the break of the focsle thirty feet of bowsprit sir doesnt belong to anything that sails the seas except a sailingship or a manofwar i speculated quite a long time with my hands on the bulwarks as to whether our friend was soft wood or steel plated it would not have made much difference to us anyway but i felt there was more honour in being rammed you know then i knew all about it it was a ram we opened out i am not exaggeratingwe opened out sir like a cardboard box the other ship cut us twothirds through a little behind the break of the focsle our decks split up lengthways the mizzenmast bounded out of its place and we heeled over then the other ship blew a foghorn i remember thinking as i took water from the port bulwark that this was rather ostentatious after she had done all the mischief after that i was a mile and a half under sea trying to go to sleep as hard as i could some one caught hold of my hair and waked me up i was hanging to what was left of one of our boats under the lee of a large english ironclad there were two men with me the three of us began to yell a man on the ship sings out can you climb on board if we throw you a rope they werent going to let down a fine new manofwars boat to pick up three halfdrowned rats we accepted the invitation we climbedi the engineer and the ships boy about half an hour later the fog cleared entirely except for the half of the boat away in the offing there was neither stick nor string on the sea to show that the hespa had been cut down  and what do you think of that now said the man from saigon     private learoyds story  and he told a tale     chronicles of gautama buddha  far from the haunts of company officers who insist upon kitinspections far from keennosed sergeants who sniff

wherein ortheris whistling softly moved surgeonwise among the captives of his craft at the bottom of the well when learoyd sat in the niche giving sage counsel on the management of tykes and mulvaney

an awful thing has happened my friend private mulvaney who went home in the serapis timeexpired not very long ago has come back to india as a civilian it was all dinah shadds fault she could not stand the poky little lodgings and she missed her servant abdullah more than words could tell the fact was that the mulvaneys had been out here too long and had lost touch of england  mulvaney knew a contractor on one of the new central india lines and wrote to him for some sort of work the contractor said that if mulvaney could pay the passage he would give him command of a gang of coolies for old sakes sake the pay was eightyfive rupees a month and dinah shadd said that if terence did not accept she would make his life a basted purgathory therefore the mulvaneys came out as civilians which was a great and terrible fall though mulvaney tried to disguise it by saying that he was kernel on the railway line an a consequinshal man  he wrote me an invitation on a toolindent form to visit him and i came down to the funny little construction bungalow at the side of the line dinah shadd had planted peas about and about and nature had spread all manner of green stuff round the place there was no change in mulvaney except the change of clothing which was deplorable but could not be helped he was standing upon his trolly haranguing a gangman and his shoulders were as well drilled and his big thick chin was as cleanshaven as ever  im a civilian now said mulvaney cud you tell that i was iver a martial man dont answer sorr av youre strainin betune a compliment an a lie theres no houldin

to call on me an thats more than hell iver do for you onless you run get out an go on pilin up the earth quick till sundown  when we three were comfortably settled under the big sisham in front of the bungalow and the first rush of questions and answers about privates ortheris and learoyd and old times and places had died away mulvaney said reflectivelyglory be theres no prade tomorrow an no bunheaded corprilbhoy to give you his lip an yit i dont know tis harrd to be something ye niver were an niver meant to be an all the ould days shut up along wid your papers eyah im growin rusty an tis the will av god that a man mustnt serve his quane for time an all  he helped himself to a fresh peg and sighed furiously  let your beard grow mulvaney said i and then you wont be troubled with those notions youll be a real civilian  dinah shadd had told me in the drawingroom of her desire to coax mulvaney into letting his beard grow twas so civilianlike said poor dinah who hated her husbands hankering for his old life  dinah shadd youre a dishgrace to an honust clanescraped man said mulvaney without replying to me grow a beard on your own chin darlint and lave my razors alone theyre all

nonsense aboutabout fwhats much better forgotten he bein a civilian now an you niver was aught else can you not let the arrmy rest tis not good for terence  i took refuge by mulvaney for dinah shadd

privit i tell ye wid privit mulvaneys best obedience that but for me the last timeexpired wud be still pullin hair on their way to the sea  he threw himself back in the chair chuckled and was silent  mrs mulvaney i said please take up the whiskey and dont let him have it until he has told the story  dinah shadd dexterously whipped the bottle away saying at the same time tis nothing to be proud av and thus captured by the enemy mulvaney spake  twas on chuseday week i was behaderin round wid the gangs on the bankmintive taught the hoppers how to kape step an stop screechinwhin a headgangman

to the ould rigmintthree fingersstandin up  and we drank     the wreck of the visigoth  footnote 1895         eternal father strong to save         whose arm hath bound the restless wave         who bidst the mighty ocean keep         its own appointed limits deep  the lady passengers were trying the wheezy old harmonium in front of the cuddy because it was sunday night in the patch of darkness near the wheelgrating sat the captain and the end of his cheroot burned like a headlamp there was neither breath nor motion upon the waters through which the screw was thudding they spread dull silver under the haze of the moonlight till they joined the low coast of malacca away to the eastward the voices of the singers at the harmonium were held down by the awnings and came to us with force         oh hear us when we cry to thee         for those in peril on the sea  it was as though the little congregation were afraid of the vastness of the sea but a laugh followed and some one said shall we take it through again a little quicker then the captain told the story of just such a night lowering his voice for fear of disturbing the music and the minds of the passengers  she was the visigothfive hundred tons or it may have been sixin the coasting trade one of the best steamers and best found on the kutchkasauli line she wasnt six years old when the thing happened on just such a night as this with an oily smooth sea under brilliant starlight about a hundred miles from land to this day no one knows really what the matter was she was so small that she could not have struck even a log in the water without every soul on board feeling the jar and even if she had struck something it wouldnt have made her go down as she did i was fourth officer then we had about seven saloon passengers including the captains wife and another woman and perhaps five hundred deckpassengers going up the coast to a shrine on just such a night as this when she was ripping through the level sea at a level nine knots an hour the man on the bridge whoever it was saw that she was sinking at the head sinking by the head as she went along that was the only warning we got she began to sink as she went along of course the captain was told and he sent me to wake up the saloon passengers and tell them to come on deck sounds a curious sort of message that to deliver on a dead still night the people tumbled up in their dressinggowns and pyjamas and wouldnt believe me we were just sinking as fast as we could and i had to tell em that then the deckpassengers got wind of it and all hell woke up along the decks  the rule in these little affairs is to get your saloon passengers off first then to fill the boats with the balance and afterwardsgod help the extras thats all i was getting the starboard stern boatthe mailboataway it hung as it might be over yonder and as i came along from the cuddy the deckpassengers hung round me shoving their moneybelts into my hand taking off their noserings and earrings and thrusting em upon me to buy just one chance for life if i hadnt been so desperately busy i should have thought it horrible i put biscuits and water into the boat and got the two ladies in one of em was the captains wife she had to be put in by main force youve no notion how women can struggle the other woman was the wife of an officer going to meet her husband and there were a couple of passengers beside the lascars the captain said he was going to stay with the ship you see the rule in these affairs i believe is that the captain has to bow gracefully from the bridge and go down i havent had a ship under my charge wrecked yet when that comes ill have to do like the others after the boats were away and i saw that there was nothing to be got by waiting i jumped overboard exactly as i might have vaulted over into a flat green field and struck out for the mailboat another officer did the same thing but he went for a boat full of natives and they whacked him on the chest with oars so he had some difficulty in climbing in  it was as well that i reached the mailboat there was a compass in it but the idiots had managed to fill the boat half full of water somehow or another and none of the crew seemed to know what was required of them then the visigoth went down and took every one with herships generally do that the corpses dont cumber the sea for some time  what did i do i kept all the boats together and headed into the track of the coasting steamers the aggravating thing was the thought that we were close to land as far as a big steamer was concerned and in the middle of eternity as far as regarded a little boat the sea looks hugeous big from a boat at night         oh christ whose voice the waters heard         and hushed their ravings at thy word         who walkedst on the foaming deep         and calm amidst its rage did keep         oh hear us when we cry to thee         for those in peril on the sea  sang the passengers cheerily  that harmonium is disgracefully out of tune said the captain the sea air affects their insides well as i was saying we settled down in the boat the captains wife was unconscious she lay in the bottom of the boat and moaned i was glad she wasnt threshing about the boat but what i did think was wrong was the way the two men passengers behaved they were useless with funkout and out fear they lay in the boat and did nothing fetched a groan now and again to show they were alive but that was all but the other woman was a jewel damn it it was worth being shipwrecked to have that woman in the boat she was awfully handsome and as brave as she was lovely she helped me bail out the boat and she worked like a man  so we kicked about the sea from midnight till seven the next evening and then we saw a steamer illill give you anything im wearing to hoist as a signal of distress said the woman but i had no need to ask her for the steamer picked us up and took us back to bombay i forgot to tell you that when the day broke i couldnt recognise the captains wifewidow i mean she had changed in the night as if fire had gone over her i met her a long time afterwards and even then she hadnt forgiven me for putting her into the boat and obeying the captains orders but the husband of the other womanhes in the armywrote me no end of a letter of thanks i dont suppose he considered that the way his wife behaved was enough to make any decent man do all he could the other fellows who lay in the bottom of the boat and groaned ive never met dont want to shouldnt be civil to em if i did and thats how the visigoth went down for no assignable reason with eighty bags of mail five hundred souls and not a single packet insured on just such a night as this         oh trinity of love and power         our brethren shield in that dread hour         from rock and tempest fire and foe         protect them wheresoer they go         thus evermore shall rise to thee         glad hymns of praise by land and sea  strikes me theyll go on singing that hymn all night imperfect sort of doctrine in the last lines dont you think they might have run in an extra verse specifying sudden collapselike the visigoths im going on to the bridge now goodnight said the captain  and i was left alone with the steady thud thud of the screw and the gentle creaking of the boats at the davits  that made me shudder     the solid muldoon         did ye see john malone wid his shinin brandnew hat        did ye see how he walked like a grand aristocrat        there was flags an banners wavin high an dhress and

learoyds jock and ortheriss blue rotboth mongrel rampur hounds chiefly ribs and teeth it lasted for twenty happy howling minutes and then blue rot collapsed and ortheris paid learoyd three rupees and we were all very thirsty a dogfight is a most heating entertainment quite apart from the shouting because rampurs fight over a couple of acres of ground later when the sound of beltbadges clicking against the necks of beerbottles had died away conversation drifted from dog to manfights of all kinds humans resemble reddeer in some respects any talk of fighting seems to wake up a sort of imp in their breasts and they bell one to the other exactly like challenging bucks this is noticeable even in men who consider themselves superior to privates of the line it shows the refining influence of civilisation and the march of progress  tale provoked tale and each tale more beer even dreamy learoyds eyes began to brighten and he unburdened himself of a long history in which a trip to malham cove a girl at pateley brigg a ganger himself and a pair of clogs were mixed in drawling tangle  an so ah coots yead oppen from t chin to t hair an he was abed for t matter o a month concluded learoyd

maraudin hathen tis the only cutty i iver loved handle her tinder or ill chuck you acrost the nullah if that poipe was brukah give her back to me sorr  ortheris had passed the treasure to my hand it

place was the main gate of fort amara most desolate and least desirable of all fortresses in india what i was doing there at that hour is a question which only concerns mgrath the sergeant of the guard and the men on the gate  slape said mulvaney is a shuparfluous necessity this gyardll shtay lively till relieved he himself was stripped to the waist learoyd on the next bedstead was dripping from the skinful of water which ortheris clad only in white trousers had just sluiced over his shoulders and a fourth private was muttering uneasily as he dozed openmouthed in the glare of the great guardlantern the heat under the bricked archway was terrifying  the worrst night that iver i remimber eyah is all hell loose this tide said mulvaney a puff of burning wind lashed through the wicketgate like a wave of the sea and ortheris swore  are ye more heasy jock he said to learoyd put yer ead between your legs itll go orf in a minute  ah dont care ah would not care but ma heart is plaayin tivvytivvy on ma ribs let me die oh leave me die groaned the huge yorkshireman who was feeling the heat acutely being of fleshly build  the sleeper under the lantern roused for a moment and raised himself on his elbowdie and be damned then he said im damned and i cant die  whos that i whispered for the voice was new to me  gentleman born said mulvaney corpril wan year sargint nex redhot on his cmission but dhrinks like a fish hell be gone before the cowld weathers here so  he slipped his boot and with the naked toe just touched the trigger of his martini ortheris misunderstood the movement and the next instant the irishmans rifle was dashed aside while ortheris stood before him his eyes blazing with reproof  you said ortheris my gawd you if it was you wot would we do  kape quiet little man said mulvaney putting him aside but very gently tis not me nor will ut be me whoile dinah shadds here i was but showin something  learoyd bowed on his bedstead groaned and the gentlemanranker sighed in his sleep ortheris took mulvaneys tendered pouch and we three smoked gravely for a space while the dustdevils danced on the glacis and scoured the redhot plain  pop said ortheris wiping his forehead  dont tantalise wid talkin av dhrink or ill shtuff you into your own breechblock anfire you off grunted mulvaney  ortheris chuckled and from a niche in the veranda produced six bottles of gingerade  where did ye get ut ye machiavel said mulvaney tis no bazar pop  ow do hi know wot the orfcers drink answered ortheris arst the messman  yell have a disthrict

learoyd half mad with the fear of death presaged in the swelling veins in his neck was begging his maker to strike him dead and fighting for more air between his prayers a second time ortheris

theres nobbut watter i ma bones let me die  the hollow of the arch gave back learoyds broken whisper in a bass boom mulvaney looked at me hopelessly but i remembered how the madness of despair had once fallen upon ortheris that weary weary afternoon on the banks of the khemi river and how it had been exorcised by the skilful magician mulvaney  talk terence i said or we shall have learoyd slinging loose and hell be worse than ortheris was talk hell answer to your voice  almost before ortheris had deftly thrown all the rifles of the guard on mulvaneys bedstead the irishmans voice was uplifted as that of one in the middle of a story and turning to me he said  in barricks or out of it as you say sorr an oirish rigmint is the divil an more tis only fit for a young man wid eddicated

kyart for you sorr said mulvaney diving hastily into his accoutrements come up to the top av the fort an well pershue our invistigations into mgraths shtable the relieved guard strolled round the main bastion on its way to the swimmingbath and learoyd grew almost talkative ortheris looked into the fort ditch and across the plain ho its weary waitin for maary he hummed but id like to kill some more bloomin paythans before my times up war bloody war north east south and west  amen said learoyd slowly  fwhats here said mulvaney checking at a blur of white by the foot of the old sentrybox he stooped and touched it its norahnorah mtaggart why nonie darlin fwhat are ye doin out av your mothers bed at this time  the twoyearold child of sergeant mtaggart must have wandered for a breath of cool air to the very verge of the parapet of the fort ditch her tiny nightshift was gathered into a wisp round her neck and she moaned in her sleep see there said mulvaney poor lamb look at the heatrash on the innocint skin av her tis hardcrool hard even for us fwhat must it be for these wake up nonie your mother will be woild about you begad the child might ha fallen into the ditch  he picked her up in the growing light and set her on his shoulder and her fair curls touched the grizzled stubble of his temples ortheris and learoyd followed snapping their fingers while norah smiled at them a sleepy smile then carolled mulvaney clear as a lark dancing the baby on his arm    if any young man should marry you   say nothin about the joke   that iver ye slep in a sinthrybox   wrapped up in a soldiers cloak  though on my sowl nonie he said gravely there was not much cloak about you niver mind you wont dhress like this ten years to come kiss your friends an run along to your mother  nonie set down close to the married quarters nodded with the quiet obedience of the soldiers child but ere she pattered off over the flagged path held up her lips to be kissed by the three musketeers ortheris wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and swore sentimentally learoyd turned pink and the two walked away together the yorkshireman lifted up his voice and gave in thunder the chorus of the sentrybox while ortheris piped at his side  bin to a bloomin singsong you two said the artilleryman who was taking his cartridge down to the morning gun youre over merry for these dashed days    i bid ye take care o the brat said he   for it comes of a noble race  learoyd bellowed the voices died out in the swimmingbath  oh terence i said dropping into mulvaneys speech when we were alone its you that have the tongue  he looked at me wearily his eyes were sunk in his head and his face was drawn and white eyah said he ive blandandhered thim through the night somehow but can thim that helps others help thimselves answer me that sorr  and over the bastions of fort amara broke the pitiless day     in the matter of a private        hurrah hurrah a soldiers life for me       shout boys shout for it makes you jolly and free               the ramrod corps  people who have seen say that one of the quaintest spectacles of human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls school it starts without warning generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils a girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control then she throws up her head and cries honk honk honk like a wild goose and tears mix with the laughter if the mistress be wise she will rap out something severe at this point to check matters if she be tenderhearted and send for a drink of water the chances are largely in favour of another girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing thus the trouble spreads and may end in half of what answers to the lower sixth of a boys school rocking and whooping together given a week of warm weather two stately promenades per diem a heavy mutton and rice meal in the middle of the day a certain amount of nagging from the teachers and a few other things some amazing effects develop at least this is what folk say who have had experience  now the mother superior of a convent and the colonel of a british infantry regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made between their respective charges but it is a fact that under certain circumstances thomas in bulk can be worked up into ditthering rippling hysteria he does not weep but he shows his trouble unmistakably and the consequences get into the newspapers and all the good people who hardly know a martini from a snider say take away the brutes ammunition  thomas isnt a brute and his business which is to look after the virtuous people demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand he doesnt wear silk stockings and he really ought to be supplied with a new adjective to help him to express his opinions but for all that he is a great man if you call him the heroic defender of the national honour one day and a brutal and licentious soldiery the next you naturally bewilder him and he looks upon you with suspicion there is nobody to speak for thomas except people who have theories to work off on him and nobody understands thomas except thomas and he does not always know what is the matter with himself  that is the prologue this is the story  corporal slane was engaged to be married to miss jhansi mkenna whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere he had his colonels permission and being popular with the men every arrangement had been made to give the wedding what private ortheris called eeklar it fell in the heart of the hot weather and after the wedding slane was going up to the hills with the bride none the less slanes grievance was that the affair would be only a hiredcarriage wedding and he felt that the eeklar of that was meagre miss mkenna did not care so much the sergeants wife was helping her to make her weddingdress and she was very busy slane was just then the only moderately contented man in barracks all the rest were more or less miserable  and they had so much to make them happy too all their work was over at eight in the morning and for the rest of the day they could lie on their backs and smoke canteenplug and swear at the punkahcoolies they enjoyed a fine full flesh meal in the middle of the day and then threw themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool enough to go out with their towny whose vocabulary contained less than six hundred words and the adjective and whose views on every conceivable question they had heard many times before  there was the canteen of course and there was the temperance room with the secondhand papers in it but a man of any profession cannot read for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in the shade running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight very few men even though they get a pannikin of flat stale muddy beer and hide it under their cots can continue drinking for six hours a day one man tried but he died and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave them something to do it was too early for the excitement of fever or cholera the men could only wait and wait and wait and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust that was a gay life  they lounged about cantonmentsit was too hot for any sort of game and almost too hot for viceand fuddled themselves in the evening and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food provided for them and the more they stoked the less exercise they took and more explosive they grew then tempers began to wear away and men fell abrooding over insults real or imaginary for they had nothing else to think of the tone of the repartees changed and instead of saying lightheartedly ill knock your silly face in men grew laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough for themselves and their enemy and that there would be more space for one of the two in another place  it may have been the devil who arranged the thing but the fact of the case is that losson had for a long time been worrying simmons in an aimless way it gave him occupation the two had their cots side by side and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other but simmons was afraid of losson and dared not challenge him to a fight he thought over the words in the hot still nights and half the hate he felt towards losson he vented on the wretched punkahcoolie  losson bought a parrot in the bazar and put it into a little cage and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well and sat on the wellcurb shouting bad language down to the parrot he taught it to say simmons ye sooor which means swine and several other things entirely unfit for publication he was a big gross man and he shook like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly simmons however shook with rage for all the room were laughing at himthe parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so human when it chattered losson used to sit swinging his fat legs on the side of the cot and ask the parrot what it thought of simmons the parrot would answer simmons ye sooor good boy losson used to say scratching the parrots head ye ear that sim and simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer i ear take eed you dont ear something one of these days  in the restless nights after he had been asleep all day fits of blind rage came upon simmons and held him till he trembled all over while he thought in how many different ways he would slay losson sometimes he would picture himself trampling the life out of the man with heavy ammunitionboots and at others smashing in his face with the butt and at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the neckbone cracked then his mouth would feel hot and fevered and he would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin  but the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under lessons right ear he noticed it first on a moonlight night and thereafter it was always before his eyes it was a fascinating roll of fat a man could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck or he could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash losson had no right to be sleek and contented and welltodo when he simmons was the butt of the room some day perhaps he would show those who laughed at the simmons ye sooor joke that he was as good as the rest and held a mans life in the crook of his forefinger when losson snored simmons hated him more bitterly than ever why should losson be able to sleep when simmons had to stay awake hour after hour tossing and turning on the tapes with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after canteen he thought over this for many many nights and the world became unprofitable to him he even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him  the heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before a sergeants wife died of heatapoplexy in the night and the rumour ran abroad that it was cholera men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp but that was a false alarm  it was late on a tuesday evening and the men were waiting in the deep double verandas for last posts when simmons went to the box at the foot of his bed took out his pipe and slammed the lid down with a bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle ordinarily speaking the men would have taken no notice but their nerves were fretted to fiddlestrings they jumped up and three or four clattered into the barrackroom only to find simmons kneeling by his box  ow its you is it they said and laughed foolishly we thought twas  simmons rose slowly if the accident had so shaken his fellows what would not the reality do  you thought it wasdid you and what makes you think he said lashing himself into madness as he went on to hell with your thinking ye dirty spies  simmons ye sooor chuckled the parrot in the veranda sleepily recognising a wellknown voice now that was absolutely all  the tension snapped simmons fell back on the armrack deliberatelythe men were at the far end of the roomand took out his rifle and packet of ammunition dont go playing the goat sim said losson put it down but there was a quaver in his voice another man stooped slipped his boot and hurled it at simmonss head the prompt answer was a shot which fired at random found its billet in lossons throat losson fell forward without a word and the others scattered  you thought it was yelled simmons youre drivin me to it i tell you youre drivin me to it get up losson an dont lie shammin thereyou an your blasted parrit that druv me to it  but there was an unaffected reality about lossons pose that showed simmons what he had done the men were still clamouring in the veranda simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the moonlight muttering ill make a night of it thirty rouns an the last for myself take you that you dogs  he dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the veranda but the bullet flew high and landed in the brickwork with a vicious phwit that made some of the younger ones turn pale it is as musketry theorists observe one thing to fire and another to be fired at  then the instinct of the chase flared up the news spread from barrack to barrack and the men doubled out intent on the capture of simmons the wild beast who was heading for the cavalry paradeground stopping now and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his pursuers  ill learn you to spy on me he shouted ill learn you to give me dorgs names come on the ole lot o you colonel john anthony deever c bhe turned towards the infantry mess and shook his rifleyou think yourself the devil of a manbut i tell you that if you put your ugly old carcass outside o that door ill make you the poorestlookin man in the army come out colonel john anthony deever c b come out and see me practiss on the rainge im the crack shot of the ole bloomin battalion in proof of which statement simmons fired at the lighted windows of the messhouse  private simmons e compny on the cavalry pradeground sir with thirty rounds said a sergeant breathlessly to the colonel shootin right and lef sir shot private losson whats to be done sir  colonel john anthony deever c b sallied out only to be saluted by a spurt of dust at his feet  pull up said the second in command i dont want my step in that way colonel hes as dangerous as a mad dog  shoot him like one then said the colonel bitterly if he wont take his chance my regiment too if it had been the towheads i could have understood  private simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge of the paradeground and was defying the regiment to come on the regiment was not anxious to comply for there is small honour in being shot by a fellowprivate only corporal slane rifle in hand threw himself down on the ground and wormed his way towards the well  dont shoot said he to the men round him like as not youll it me ill catch the beggar livin  simmons ceased shouting for a while and the noise of trapwheels could be heard across the plain major oldyne commanding the horse battery was coming back from a dinner in the civil lines was driving after his usual customthat is to say as fast as the horse could go  a orfcer a blooming spangled orfcer shrieked simmons ill make a scarecrow of that orfcer the trap stopped  whats this demanded the major of gunners you there drop your rifle  why its jerry blazes i aint got no quarrel with you jerry blazes pass frien an alls well  but jerry blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous murderer he was as his adoring battery swore long and fervently without knowledge of fear and they were surely the best judges for jerry blazes it was notorious had done his possible to kill a man each time the battery went out  he walked towards simmons with the intention of rushing him and knocking him down  dont make me do it sir said simmons i aint got nothing agin you ah you wouldthe major broke into a runtake that then  the major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder and simmons stood over him he had lost the satisfaction of killing losson in the desired way but here was a helpless body to his hand should he slip in another cartridge and blow off the head or with the butt smash in the white face he stopped to consider and a cry went up from the far side of the paradeground hes killed jerry blazes but in the shelter of the wellpillars simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire ill blow yer andsome ead off jerry blazes said simmons reflectively six an three is nine an one is ten an that leaves me another nineteen an one for myself he tugged at the string of the second packet of ammunition corporal slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank into the moonlight  i see you said simmons come a bit furder on an ill do for you  im comin said corporal slane briefly youve done a bad days work sim come out ere an come back with me  come to laughed simmons sending a cartridge home with his thumb not before ive settled you an jerry blazes  the corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the paradeground a rifle under him some of the lesscautious men in the distance shouted shoot im shoot im slane  you move and or foot slane said simmons an ill kick jerry blazes ead in and shoot you after  i aint movin said the corporal raising his head you darent it a man on is legs let go o jerry blazes an come out o that with your fistes come an it me you darent you bloomin dogshooter  i dare  you lie you mansticker you sneakin sheeny butcher you lie see there slane kicked the rifle away and stood up in the peril of his life come on now  the temptation was more than simmons could resist for the corporal in his white clothes offered a perfect mark  dont misname me shouted simmons firing as he spoke the shot missed and the shooter blind with rage threw his rifle down and rushed at slane from the protection of the well within striking distance he kicked savagely at slanes stomach but the weedy corporal knew something of simmonss weakness and knew too the deadly guard for that kick bowing forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel of the right foot was set some three inches above the inside of the left kneecap he met the blow standing on one legexactly as gonds stand when they meditateand ready for the fall that would follow there was an oath the corporal fell over to his own left as shinbone met shinbone and the private collapsed his right leg broken an inch above the ankle  pity you dont know that guard sim said slane spitting out the dust as he rose then raising his voicecome an take him orf ive bruk is leg this was not strictly true for the private had accomplished his own downfall since it is the special merit of that legguard that the harder the kick the greater the kickers discomfiture  slane walked to jerry blazes and hung over him with ostentatious anxiety while simmons weeping with pain was carried away ope you aint urt badly sir said slane the major had fainted and there was an ugly ragged hole through the top of his arm slane knelt down and murmured selp me i believe es dead well if that aint my blooming luck all over  but the major was destined to lead his battery afield for many a long day with unshaken nerve he was removed and nursed and petted into convalescence while the battery discussed the wisdom of capturing simmons and blowing him from a gun they idolised their major and his reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the army regulations  great too was the glory that fell to slanes share the gunners would have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight even the colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness and the local paper called him a hero these things did not puff him up when the major offered him money and thanks the virtuous corporal took the one and put aside the other but he had a request to make and prefaced it with many a beg y pardon sir could the major see his way to letting the slanemkenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four battery horses to pull a hired barouche the major could and so could the battery excessively so it was a gorgeous wedding                                       wot did i do it for said corporal slane for the orses o course jhansi aint a beauty to look at but i wasnt goin to ave a hired turnout jerry blazes if i adnt a wanted something sim might ha blowed jerry blazes blooming ead into hirish stew for aught id a cared  and they hanged private simmonshanged him as high as haman in hollow square of the regiment and the colonel said it was drink and the chaplain was sure it was the devil and simmons fancied it was both but he didnt know and only hoped his fate would be a warning to his companions and half a dozen intelligent publicists wrote six beautiful leading articles on the prevalence of crime in the army  but not a soul thought of comparing the bloodyminded simmons to the squawking gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens     black jack    to the wake av tim ohara   came company   all st patricks alley   was there to see         robert buchanan  as the three musketeers share their silver tobacco and liquor together as they protect each other in barracks or camp and as they rejoice together over the joy of one so do they divide their sorrows when ortheriss irrepressible tongue has brought him into cells for a season or learoyd has run amok through his kit and accoutrements or mulvaney has indulged in strong waters and under their influence reproved his commanding officer you can see the trouble in the faces of the untouched two and the rest of the regiment know that comment or jest is unsafe generally the three avoid orderly room and the corner shop that follows leaving both to the young bloods who have not sown their wild oats but there are occasions  for instance ortheris was sitting on the drawbridge of the main gate of fort amara with his hands in his pockets and his pipe bowl down in his mouth learoyd was lying at full length on the turf of the glacis kicking his heels in the air and i came round the corner and asked for mulvaney  ortheris spat into the ditch and shook his head no good seein im now said ortheris es a bloomin camel listen  i heard on the flags of the veranda opposite to the cells which are close to the guardroom a measured step that i could have identified in the tramp of an army there were twenty paces crescendo a pause and then twenty diminuendo  thats im said ortheris my gawd thats im all for a bloomin button you could see your face in an a bit o lip that a bloomin harkangel would a guv back  mulvaney was doing packdrillwas compelled that is to say to walk up and down for certain hours in full marching order with rifle bayonet ammunition knapsack and overcoat and his offence was being dirty on parade i nearly fell into the fort ditch with astonishment and wrath for mulvaney is the smartest man that ever mounted guard and would as soon think of turning out uncleanly as of dispensing with his trousers  who was the sergeant that checked him i asked  mullins o course said ortheris there aint no other man would whip im on

partly the result of innate depravity and partly of imperfectly digested board school came over the bridge and most rudely asked ortheris what he was doing  me said ortheris ow im waiting for my cmission seed it comin along yit  mullins turned purple and passed on there was the sound of a gentle chuckle from the glacis where learoyd lay  e expects to get is cmission some day explained

drawbridge and ortheris began to rise into the air lifted by a huge hand upon his collar  onything but t braass said learoyd quietly as he held the londoner over the ditch onything but t braass orthris ma son ahve got one rupee eight annas of ma own he showed two coins and replaced ortheris on the drawbridge rail  very good i said where are you going to  goin to walk im orf wen e comes outtwo miles or three or fower said ortheris  the footsteps within ceased i heard the dull thud of a knapsack falling on a bedstead followed by the rattle of arms ten minutes later mulvaney faultlessly dressed his lips tight and his face as black as a thunderstorm stalked into the sunshine on the drawbridge learoyd and ortheris sprang from my side and closed in upon him both leaning towards as horses lean upon the pole in an instant they had disappeared down the sunken road to the cantonments and i was left alone mulvaney had not seen fit to recognise me so i knew that his trouble must be heavy upon him  i climbed one of the bastions and watched the figures of the three musketeers grow smaller and smaller across the plain they were walking as fast as they could put foot to the ground and their heads were bowed they fetched a great compass round the paradeground skirted the cavalry lines and vanished in the belt of trees that fringes the low land by the river  i followed slowly and sighted themdusty sweating but still keeping up their long swinging trampon the river bank they crashed through the forest reserve headed towards the bridge of boats and presently established themselves on the bow of one of the pontoons i rode cautiously till i saw three puffs of white smoke rise and die out in the clear evening air and knew that peace had come again at the bridgehead they waved me forward with gestures of welcome  tie up your orse shouted ortheris an come on sir were all goin home in this ere bloomin boat  from the bridgehead to the forest officers bungalow is but a step the messman was there and would see that a man held my horse did the sahib require aught elsea peg or beer ritchie sahib had left half a dozen bottles of the latter but since the sahib was a friend of ritchie sahib and he the messman was a poor man  i gave my order quietly and returned to the bridge mulvaney had taken off his boots and was dabbling his toes in the water learoyd was lying on his back on the pontoon and ortheris was pretending to row with a big bamboo  im an ould fool said mulvaney reflectivelydhraggin you two out here bekaze i was undher the black

to clamber down to the pontoon might a knowd youd a got liquor out o bloomin desert sir said ortheris gracefully to me then to the messman easy with them there bottles theyre worth their weight in gold jock ye longarmed beggar get out o that an hike em down  learoyd had the basket on the pontoon in an instant and the three musketeers gathered round it with dry lips they drank my health in due and ancient form and thereafter tobacco tasted sweeter than ever they absorbed all the beer and disposed themselves in picturesque attitudes to admire the setting sunno man speaking for a while  mulvaneys head dropped upon his chest and we thought that he was asleep  what on earth did you come so far for i whispered to ortheris  to walk im orf o course when es been checked we allus walks im

very bad tummy and a blue funk so far he asked me at once if it was cholera and i told him not to be a fool that soothed him  curtiss poor devil the funk does half the business in a man of that build  anthony lighting a cheroot i firmly believe the funk will kill him if he stays down you know the amount of trouble hes been giving fewton for the last three weeks hes doing his very best to frighten himself into the grave  general chorus poor little devil why doesnt he get away  anthony cant he has his leave all right but hes so dipped he cant take it and i dont think his name on paper would raise four annas thats in confidence though  mackesy all the station knows it  anthony i suppose i shall have to die here he said squirming all across the bed hes quite made up his mind to kingdom come and i know he has nothing more than a wetweather tummy if he could only keep a hand on himself  blayne thats bad thats very bad poor little miggy good little chap too i say  anthony what do you

married in a few weeks markyn told me at the judges this evening its pukka  anthony you dont say so holy moses therell be a shine in the tents of kedar  curtiss regiment cut up rough think you  anthony dont know anything about the regiment  mackesy it is bigamy then  anthony maybe do you mean to say that you men have forgotten or is there more charity in the world than i thought  doone you dont look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret you bloat explain  anthony mrs herriott  blayne after a long pause to the room generally its my notion that we are a set of fools  mackesy nonsense that business was knocked on the head last season why young mallard  anthony mallard was a candlestick paraded as such think awhile recollect last season and the talk then mallard or no mallard did gaddy ever talk to any other woman  curtiss theres something in that it was slightly noticeable now you come to mention it but shes at naini tal and hes at simla  anthony he had to go to simla to look after a globetrotter relative of hisa person with a title uncle or aunt  blayne and there he got engaged no law prevents a man growing tired of a woman  anthony except that he mustnt do it till the woman is tired of him and the herriott woman was not that  curtiss she may be now two months of naini tal work wonders  doone curious thing how some women carry a fate with them there was a mrs deegie in the central provinces whose men invariably fell away and got married it became a regular proverb with us when i was down there i remember three men desperately devoted to her and they all one after another took wives  curtiss thats odd now i should have thought that mrs deegies influence would have led them to take other mens wives it ought to have made them afraid of the judgment of providence  anthony mrs herriott will make gaddy afraid of something more than the judgment of providence i fancy  blayne supposing things are as you say hell be a fool to face her hell sit tight at simla  anthony shouldnt be a bit surprised if he went off to naini to explain hes an unaccountable sort of man and shes likely to be a more than unaccountable woman  doone what makes you take her character away so confidently  anthony primum tempus gaddy was her first and a woman doesnt allow her first man to drop away without expostulation she justifies the first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is for ever and ever consequently  blayne consequently we are sitting here till past one oclock talking scandal like a set of station cats anthony its all your fault we were perfectly respectable till you came in go to bed im off goodnight all  curtiss past one its past two by jove and heres the khit coming for the late charge just heavens one two three four five rupees to pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is no better than she should be im ashamed of myself go to bed you slanderous villains and if im sent to beora tomorrow be prepared to hear im dead before paying my card account     the tents of kedar    only why should it be with pain at all   why must i twixt the leaves of coronal      put any kiss of pardon on thy brow   why should the other women know so much   and talk togethersuch the look and such   the smile he used to love with then as now             any wife to any husband  scenea naini tal dinner for

gadsbys bungalow in the plains time 11 a m on a sunday morning captain gadsby in his shirtsleeves is bending over a complete set of hussars equipment from saddle to picketingrope which is neatly spread over the floor of his study he is smoking an unclean briar and his forehead is puckered with thought  capt g to himself fingering a headstall jacks an ass theres enough brass on this to load a

afraid you wouldnt pussydont you think that jam will burn or whatever it is that jam does when its not looked after by a clever little housekeeper  mrs g i thought you said hyder could attend to it i left him in the veranda stirringwhen i hurt myself so  capt g his eye returning to the equipment pooor little womanthree pounds four and seven is three eleven and that can be cut down to two eight

while this tobacco will hang in your dress and saddlery doesnt interest you  mrs g everything you do interests me pip  capt g yes i know i know dear ill tell you all about it some day when ive put a head on this thing in the meantime  mrs g im to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child  capt g noo i dont mean that exactly but you see i shall be tramping up and down shifting these things to and fro and i shall be in your way dont you think so  mrs g cant i lift them about let me try reaches forward to troopers saddle  capt g good gracious child dont touch it youll hurt yourself picking up saddle little girls arent expected to handle numdahs now where would you like it put holds saddle above his head  mrs g a break in her voice nowhere pip how good you areand how strong oh whats that ugly red streak inside your arm  capt g lowering saddle quickly nothing its a mark of sorts aside and jacks coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried  mrs g i know its a mark but ive never seen it before it runs all up the arm what is it  capt g a cutif you want to know  mrs g want to know of course i do i cant have my husband cut to pieces in this way how did it come was it an accident tell me pip  capt g grimly no twasnt an accident i got itfrom a manin afghanistan  mrs g in action oh pip and you never told me  capt g id forgotten all about it  mrs g hold up your arm what a horrid ugly scar are you sure it doesnt hurt now how did the man give it you  capt g desperately looking at his watch with a knife i came downold van loo did thats to sayand fell on my leg so i couldnt run and then this man came up and began chopping at me as i sprawled  mrs g oh dont dont thats enoughwell what happened  capt g i couldnt get to my holster and mafflin came round the corner and stopped the performance  mrs g how hes such a lazy man i dont believe he did  capt g dont you i dont think the man had much doubt about it jack cut his head off  mrs g cuthisheadoff with one blow as they say in the books  capt g im not sure i was too interested in myself to know much about it anyhow the head was off and jack was punching old van loo in the ribs to make him get up now you know all about it dear and now  mrs g you want me to go of course you never told me about this though ive been married to you for ever so long and you never would have told me if i hadnt found out and you never do tell me anything about yourself or what you do or what you take an interest in  capt g darling im always with you arent i  mrs g always in my pocket you were going to say i know you are but you are always thinking away from me  capt g trying to hide a smile am i i wasnt aware of it im awfly sorry  mrs g piteously oh dont make fun of me pip you know what i mean when you are reading one of those things about cavalry by that idiotic princewhy doesnt he be a prince instead of a stableboy  capt g prince kraft a stableboyoh my aunt never mind dear you were going to say  mrs g it doesnt matter you dont care for what i say onlyonly you get up and walk about the room staring in front of you and then mafflin comes in to dinner and after im in the drawingroom i can hear you and him talking and talking and talking about things i cant understand andoh i get so tired and feel so lonelyi dont want to complain and be a trouble pip but i doindeed i do  capt g my poor darling i never thought of that why dont you ask some nice people in to dinner  mrs g nice people where am i to find them horrid frumps and if i did i shouldnt be amused you know i only want you  capt g and you have me surely sweetheart  mrs g i have not pip why dont you take me into your life  capt g more than i do that would be difficult dear  mrs g yes i suppose it wouldto you im no help to youno companion to you and you like to have it so  capt g arent you a little unreasonable pussy  mrs g stamping her foot im the most reasonable woman in the worldwhen im treated properly  capt g and since when have i been treating you improperly  mrs g alwaysand since the beginning you know you have  capt g i dont but im willing to be convinced  mrs g pointing to saddlery there  capt g how do you mean  mrs g what does all that mean why am i not to be told is it so precious  capt g i forget its exact government value just at present it means that it is a great deal too heavy  mrs g then why do you touch it  capt g to make it lighter see here little love ive one notion and jack has another but we are both agreed that all this equipment is about thirty pounds too heavy the thing is how to cut it down without weakening any part of it and at the same time allowing the trooper to carry everything he wants for his own comfortsocks and shirts and things of that kind  mrs g why doesnt he pack them in a little trunk  capt g kissing her oh you darling pack them in a little trunk indeed hussars dont carry trunks and its a most important thing to make the horse do all the carrying  mrs g but why need you bother about it youre not a trooper  capt g no but i command a few score of him and equipment is nearly everything in these days  mrs g more than me  capt g stupid of course not but its a matter that im tremendously interested in because if i or jack or i and jack work out some sort of lighter saddlery and all that its possible that we may get it adopted  mrs g how  capt g sanctioned at home where they will make a sealed patterna pattern that all the saddlers must copyand so it will be used by all the regiments  mrs g and that interests you  capt g its part of my profession yknow and my profession is a good deal to me everything in a soldiers equipment is important and if we can improve that equipment so much the better for the soldiers and for us  mrsg whos us  capt g jack and i only jacks notions are too radical whats that big sigh for minnie  mrs g oh nothingand youve kept all this a secret from me why  capt g not a secret exactly dear i didnt say anything about it to you because i didnt think it would amuse you  mrs g and am i only made to be amused  capt g no of course i merely mean that it couldnt interest you  mrs g its your work andand if youd let me id count all these things up if they are too heavy you know by how much they are too heavy and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of lightness and  capt g i have got both scales somewhere in my head but its hard to tell how light you can make a headstall for instance until youve actually had a model made  mrs g but if you read out the list i could copy it down and pin it up there just above your table wouldnt that do  capt g it would be awfly nice dear but it would be giving you trouble for nothing i cant work that way i go by rule of thumb i know the present scale of weights and the other onethe one that im trying to work towill shift and vary so much that i couldnt be certain even if i wrote it down  mrs g im so sorry i thought i might help is there anything else that i could be of use in  capt g looking round the room i cant think of anything youre always helping me you know  mrs g am i how  capt g you are you of course and as long as youre near mei cant explain exactly but its in the air  mrs g and thats why you wanted to send me away  capt g thats only when im trying to do workgrubby work like this  mrs g mafflins better then isnt he  capt g rashly of course he is jack and i have been thinking along the same groove for two or three years about this equipment its our hobby and it may really be useful some day  mrs g after a pause and thats all that you have away from me  capt g it isnt very far away from you now take care the oil on that bit doesnt come off on your dress  mrs g i wishi wish so much that i could really help you i believe i couldif i left the room but thats not what i mean  capt g aside give me patience i wish she would go aloud i assure you you cant do anything for me minnie and i must really settle down to this wheres my pouch  mrs g crossing to writingtable here you are bear what a mess you keep your table in  capt g dont touch it theres a method in my madness though you mightnt think of it  mrs g at table i want to look do you keep accounts pip  capt g bending over saddlery of a sort are you rummaging among the troop papers be careful  mrs g why i shant disturb anything good gracious i had no idea that you had anything to do with so many sick horses  capt g wish i hadnt but they insist on falling sick minnie if i were you i really should not investigate those papers you may come across something that you wont like  mrs g why will you always treat me like a child i know im not displacing the horrid things  capt g resignedly very well then dont blame me if anything happens play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery slipping hand into trouserspocket oh the deuce  mrs g her back to g whats that for  capt g nothing aside theres not much in it but i wish id torn it up  mrs g turning over contents of table i know youll hate me for this but i do want to see what your work is like a pause pip what are farcybuds  capt g hah would you really like to know they arent pretty things  mrs g this journal of veterinary science says they are of absorbing interest tell me  capt g aside it may turn her attention         gives a long and designedly loathsome account of        glanders and farcy  mrs g oh thats enough dont go on  capt g but you wanted to knowthen these things suppurate and matterate and spread  mrs g pip youre making me sick youre a horrid disgusting schoolboy  capt g on his knees among the bridles you asked to be told its not my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors  mrs g why didnt you sayno  capt g good heavens child have you come in here simply to bully me  mrs g i bully you how could i youre so strong hysterically strong enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me there to cry arent you  capt g it seems to me that youre an irrational little baby are you quite well  mrs g do i look ill returning to table who is your lady friend with the big gray envelope and the fat monogram outside  capt g aside then it wasnt locked up confound it aloud god made her therefore let her pass for a woman you remember what farcybuds are like  mrs g showing envelope this has nothing to do with them im going to open it may i  capt g certainly if you want to id sooner you didnt though i dont ask to look at your letters to the deercourt girl  mrs g youd better not sir takes letter from envelope now may i look if you say no i shall cry  capt g youve never cried in my knowledge of you and i dont believe you could  mrs g i feel very like it today pip dont be hard on me reads letter it begins in the middle without any dear captain gadsby or anything how funny  capt g aside no its not dear captain gadsby or anything now how funny  mrs g what a strange letter reads and so the moth has come too near the candle at last and has been singed intoshall i say respectability i congratulate him and hope he will be as happy as he deserves to be what does that mean is she congratulating you about our marriage  capt g yes i suppose so  mrs g still reading letter she seems to be a particular friend of yours  capt g yes she was an excellent matron of sortsa mrs herriottwife of a colonel herriott i used to know some of her people at home long agobefore i came out  mrs g some colonels wives are youngas young as me i knew one who was younger  capt g then it couldnt have been mrs herriott she was old enough to have been your mother dear  mrs g i remember now mrs scargill was talking about her at the duffins tennis before you came for me on tuesday captain mafflin said she was a dear old woman do you know i think mafflin is a very clumsy man with his feet  capt g aside good old jack aloud why dear  mrs g he had put his cup down on the ground then and he literally stepped into it some of the tea spirted over my dressthe gray one i meant to tell you about it before  capt g aside there are the makings of a strategist about jack though his methods are coarse aloud youd better get a new dress then aside let us pray that that will turn her  mrs g oh it isnt stained in the least i only thought that id tell you returning to letter what an extraordinary person reads but need i remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of wardshipwhat in the world is a charge of wardshipwhich as you yourself know may end in consequences  capt g aside its safest to let em see everything as they come across it but seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule aloud i told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging my table  mrs g absently what does the woman mean she goes on talking about consequencesalmost inevitable consequences with a capital cfor half a page flushing scarlet oh good gracious how abominable  capt g promptly do you think so doesnt it show a sort of motherly interest in us aside thank heaven harry always wrapped her meaning up safely aloud is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter darling  mrs g its impertinentits simply horrid what right has this woman to write in this way to you she oughtnt to  capt g when you write to the deercourt girl i notice that you generally fill three or four sheets cant you let an old woman babble on paper once in a way she means well  mrs g i dont care she shouldnt write and if she did you ought to have shown me her letter  capt g cant you understand why i kept it to myself or must i explain at lengthas i explained the farcybuds  mrs g furiously pip i hate you this is as bad as those idiotic saddlebags on the floor never mind whether it would please me or not you ought to have given it to me to read  capt g it comes to the same thing you took it yourself  mrs g yes but if i hadnt taken it you wouldnt have said a word i think this harriet herriottits like a name in a bookis an interfering old thing  capt g aside so long as you thoroughly understand that she is old i dont much care what you think aloud very good dear would you like to write and tell her so shes seven thousand miles away  mrs g i dont want to have anything to do with her but you ought to have told me turning to last page of letter and she patronises me too ive never seen her reads i do not know how the world stands with you in all human probability i shall never know but whatever i may have said before i pray for her sake more than for yours that all may be well i have learnt what misery means and i dare not wish that any one dear to you should share my knowledge  capt g good god cant you leave that letter alone or at least cant you refrain from reading it aloud ive been through it once put it back on the desk do you hear me  mrs g irresolutely i

gaddy andi dont like you any the better for it  g never mind that she wants england and the butcha would be all the better for it im going to chuck you dont understand  m hotly i understand this one hundred and thirtyseven new horses to be licked into shape somehow before luck comes round again a hairyheeled draft wholl give more trouble than the horses a camp next cold weather for a certainty ourselves the first on the roster the russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes notice and you the best of us all backing out of it all think a little gaddy you wont do it  g hang it a man has some duties towards his family i suppose  m i remember a man though who told me the night after amdheran when we were picketed under jagai and hed left his swordby the way did you ever pay ranken for that swordin an utmanzais headthat man told me that hed stick by me and the pinks as long as he lived i dont blame him for not sticking by meim not much of a manbut i do blame him for not sticking by the pink hussars  g uneasily we were little more than boys then cant you see jack how things stand tisnt as if we were serving for our bread weve all of us more or less got the filthy lucre im luckier than some perhaps theres no call for me to serve on  m none in the world for you or for us except the regimental if you dont choose to answer to that of course  g dont be too hard on a man you know that a lot of us only take up the thing for a few years and then go back to town and catch on with the rest  m not lots and they arent some of us  g and then there are ones affairs at home to be consideredmy place and the rents and all that i dont suppose my father can last much longer and that means the title and so on  m fraid you wont be entered in the stud book correctly unless you go home take six months then and come out in october if i could slay off a brother or two i spose i should be a marquis of sorts any fool can be that but it needs men gaddymen like youto lead flanking squadrons properly dont you delude yourself into the belief that youre going home to take your place and prance about among pinknosed kabuli dowagers you arent built that way i know better  g a man has a right to live his life as happily as he can you arent married  m nopraise be to providence and the one or two women who have had the good sense to jawab me  g then you dont know what it is to go into your own room and see your wifes head on the pillow and when everything else is safe and the house shut up for the night to wonder whether the roofbeams wont give and kill her  m aside revelations first and second aloud soo i knew a man who got squiffy at our mess once and confided to me that he never helped his wife on to her horse without praying that shed break her neck before she came back all husbands arent alike you see  g what on earth has that to do with my case the man must ha been mad or his wife as bad as they make em  m aside no fault of yours if either werent all you say youve forgotten the tune when you were insane about the herriott woman you always were a good hand at forgetting aloud not more mad than men who go to the other extreme be reasonable gaddy your roofbeams are sound enough  g that was only a way of speaking ive been uneasy and worried about the wife ever since that awful business three years agowheni nearly lost her can you wonder  m oh a shell never falls twice in the same place youve paid your toll to misfortunewhy should your wife be picked out more than anybody elses  g i can talk just as reasonably as you can but you dont understandyou dont understand and then theres the butcha deuce knows where the ayah takes him to sit in the evening he has a bit of a cough havent you noticed it  m bosh the brigadiers jumping out of his skin with pure condition hes got a muzzle like a roseleaf and the chest of a twoyearold whats demoralised you  g funk thats the long and the short of it funk  m but what is there to funk  g everything its ghastly  m ah i see         you dont want to fight          and by jingo when we do        youve got the kid youve got the wife          youve got the money too  thats about the case eh  g i suppose thats it but its not for myself its because of them at least i think it is  m are you sure looking at the matter in a coldblooded light the wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight she has an ancestral home to go to money and the brigadier to carry on the illustrious name  g then it is for myself or because they are part of me you dont see it my lifes so good so pleasant as it is that i want to make it quite safe cant you understand  m perfectly shelterpit for the orfcers charger as they say in the line  g and i have everything to my hand to make it so im sick of the strain and the worry for their sakes out here and there isnt a single real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether itll only cost mejack i hope youll never know the shame that ive been going through for the past six months  m hold on there i dont wish to be told every man has his moods and tenses sometimes  g laughing bitterly has he what do you call craning over to see where your nearfore lands  m in my case it means that i have been on the considerable bend and have come to parade with a head and a hand it passes in three strides  g lowering voice it never passes with me jack im always thinking about it phil gadsby funking a fall on parade sweet picture isnt it draw it for me  m gravely heaven forbid a man like you cant be as bad as that a fall is no nice thing but one never gives it a thought  g doesnt one wait till youve got a wife and a youngster of your own and then youll know how the roar of the squadron behind you turns you cold all up the back  m aside and this man led at amdheran after bagaldeasin went under and we were all mixed up together and he came out of the show dripping like a butcher aloud skittles the men can always open out and you can always pick your way more or less we havent the dust to bother us as the men have and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man  g neveras long as he can see but did they open out for poor errington  m oh this is childish  g i know it is worse than that i dont care youve ridden van loo is he the sort of brute to pick his wayspecially when were coming up in column of troop with any pace on  m once in a blue moon do we gallop in column of troop and then only to save time arent three lengths enough for you  g yesquite enough they just allow for the full development of the smash im talking like a cur i know but i tell you that for the past three months ive felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of my back every time that ive led  m but gaddy this is awful  g isnt it lovely isnt it royal a captain of the pink hussars watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing colonel of a black regiment  m you never did  g once only he squelched like a mussuck and the troopsergeantmajor cocked his eye at me you know old haffys eye i was afraid to do it again  m i should think so that was the best way to rupture old van loos tummy and make him crumple you up you knew that  g i didnt care it took the edge off him  m took the edge off him gaddy youyouyou mustnt you know think of the men  g thats another thing i am afraid of dyou spose they know  m lets hope not but theyre deadly quick to spot skrimlittle things of that kind see here old man send the wife home for the hot weather and come to kashmir with me well start a boat on the dal or cross the rhotangshoot ibex or loafwhich you please only come youre a bit off your oats and youre talking nonsense look at the colonelswagbellied rascal that he is he has a wife and no end of a bowwindow of his own can any one of us ride round himchalkstones and all i cant and i think i can shove a crock along a bit  g some men are different i havent the nerve lord help me i havent the nerve ive taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well under the wallets i cant help it im so afraid of anything happening to me on my soul i ought to be broke in front of the squadron for cowardice  m ugly word that i should never have the courage to own up  g i meant to lie about my reasons when i began butive got out of the habit of lying to you old man jack you wontbut i know you wont  m of course not half aloud the pinks are paying dearly for their pride  g eh whaat  m dont you know the men have called mrs gadsby the pride of the pink hussars ever since she came to us  g tisnt her fault dont think that its all mine  m what does she say  g i havent exactly put it before her shes the best little woman in the world jack and all thatbut she wouldnt counsel a man to stick to his calling if it came between him and her at least i think  m never mind dont tell her what you told me go on the peerage and landedgentry tack  g shed see through it shes five times cleverer than i am  m aside then shell accept the sacrifice and think a little bit worse of him for the rest of her days  g absently i say do you despise me  m queer way of putting it have you ever been asked that question think a minute what answer used you to give  g so bad as that im not entitled to expect anything more but its a bit hard when ones best friend turns round and  m so i have found but you will have consolationsbailiffs and drains and liquid manure and the primrose league and perhaps if youre lucky the colonelcy of a yeomanry cavalry regimentall uniform and no riding i believe how old are you  g thirtythree i know its  m at forty youll be a fool of a jp landlord at fifty youll own a bathchair and the brigadier if he takes after you will be fluttering the dovecotes ofwhats the particular dunghill youre going to also mrs gadsby will be fat  g limply this is rather more than a joke  m dyou think so isnt cutting the service a joke it generally takes a man fifty years to arrive at it youre quite right though it is more than a joke youve managed it in thirtythree  g dont make me feel worse than i do will it satisfy you if i own that i am a shirker a skrimshanker and a coward  m it will not because im the only man in the world who can talk to you like this without being knocked down you mustnt take all that ive said to heart in this way i only spokea lot of it at leastout of pure selfishness because becauseoh damn it all old mani dont know what i shall do without you of course youve got the money and the place and all thatand there are two very good reasons why you should take care of yourself  g

familybound to think erhmm if i wasnt a younger son id go toobe shot if i wouldnt  g thank you jack its a kind lie but its the blackest youve told for some time i know what im doing and im going into

gehenna or up to the throne        he travels the fastest who travels alone         white hands cling to the tightened rein          slipping the spur from the booted heel        tenderest voices cry turn again          red lips tarnish the scabbarded steel        high hopes faint on a warm hearthstone        he travels the fastest who travels alone         one may fall but he falls by himself          falls by himself with himself to blame        one may attain and to him is the pelf          loot of the city in gold of fame        plunder of earth shall be all his own        who travels the

put dust on my headand i am an afridi the horses have been marched footsore from the valley to this place and my eyes are dim and my body aches for the want of sleep and my heart is dried up with sorrow and shame but as it was my shame so by god the dispenser of justiceby allahalmumitit shall be my own revenge  we have spoken together with naked hearts before this and our hands have dipped into the same dish and thou hast been to me as a brother therefore i pay thee back with lies and ingratitudeas a pathan listen now when the grief of the soul is too heavy for endurance it may be a little eased by speech and moreover the mind of a true man is as a well and the pebble of confession dropped therein sinks and is no more seen from the valley have i come on foot league by league with a fire in my chest like the fire of the pit and why hast thou then so quickly forgotten our customs among this folk who sell their wives and their daughters for silver come back with me to the north and be among men once more come back when this matter is accomplished and i call for thee the bloom of the peachorchards is upon all the valley and here is only dust and a great stink there is a pleasant wind among the mulberry trees and the streams are bright with snowwater and the caravans go up and the caravans go down and a hundred fires sparkle in the gut of the pass and tentpeg answers hammernose and packhorse squeals to packhorse across the drift smoke of the evening it is good in the north now come back with me let us return to our own people come                                       whence is my sorrow does a man tear out his heart and make fritters thereof over a slow fire for aught other than a woman do not laugh friend of mine for your time will also be a woman of the abazai was she and i took her to wife to staunch the feud between our village and the men of ghor i am no longer young the lime has touched my beard true i had no need of the wedding nay but i loved her what saith rahman into whose heart love enters there is folly and naught else by a glance of the eye she hath blinded thee and by the eyelids and the fringe of the eyelids taken thee into the captivity without ransom and naught else dost thou remember that song at the sheeproasting in the pindi camp among the uzbegs of the amir  the abazai are dogs and their women the servants of sin there was a lover of her own people but of that her father told me naught my friend curse for me in your prayers as i curse at each praying from the fakr to the isha the name of daoud shah abazai whose head is still upon his neck whose hands are still upon his wrists who has done me dishonour who has made my name a laughingstock among the women of little malikand  i went into hindustan at the end of two monthsto cherat i was gone twelve days only but i had said that i would be fifteen days absent this i did to try her for it is written trust not the incapable coming up the gorge alone in the falling of the light i heard the voice of a man singing at the door of my house and it was the voice of daoud shah and the song that he sang was dray wara yow deeall three are one it was as though a heelrope had been slipped round my heart and all the devils were drawing it tight past endurance i crept silently up the hillroad but the fuse of my matchlock was wetted with the rain and i could not slay daoud shah from afar moreover it was in my mind to kill the woman also thus he sang sitting outside my house and anon the woman opened the door and i came nearer crawling on my belly among the rocks i had only my knife to my hand but a stone slipped under my foot and the two looked down the hillside and he leaving his matchlock fled from my anger because he was afraid for the life that was in him but the woman moved not till i stood in front of her crying o woman what is this that thou hast done and she void of fear though she knew my thought laughed saying it is a little thing i loved him and thou art a dog and cattlethief coming by night strike and i being still blinded by her beauty for o my friend the women of the abazai are very fair said hast thou no fear and she answered nonebut only the fear that i do not die then said i have no fear and she bowed her head and i smote it off at the neckbone so that it leaped between my feet thereafter the rage of our people came upon me and i hacked off the breasts that the men of little malikand might know the crime and cast the body into the watercourse that flows to the kabul river dray wara yow dee dray wara yow dee the body without the head the soul without light and my own darkling heartall three are oneall three are one  that night making no halt i went to ghor and demanded news of daoud shah men said he is gone to pubbi for horses what wouldst thou of him there is peace between the villages i made answer aye the peace of treachery and the love that the devil atala bore to gurel so i fired thrice into the gate and laughed and went my way  in those hours brother and friend of my hearts heart the moon and the stars were as blood above me and in my mouth was the taste of dry earth also i broke no bread and my drink was the rain of the valley of ghor upon my face  at pubbi i found mahbub ali the writer sitting upon his charpoy and gave up my arms according to your law but i was not grieved for it was in my heart that i should kill daoud shah with my bare hands thusas a man strips a bunch of raisins mahbub ali said daoud shah has even now gone hotfoot to peshawur and he will pick up his horses upon the road to delhi for it is said that the bombay tramway company are buying horses there by the truckload eight horses to the truck and that was a true saying  then i saw that the hunting would be no little thing for the man was gone into your borders to save himself against my wrath and shall he save himself so am i not alive though he run northward to the dora and the snow or southerly to the black water i will follow him as a lover follows the footsteps of his mistress and coming upon him i will take him tenderlyaho so tenderlyin my arms saying well hast thou done and well shalt thou be repaid and out of that embrace daoud shah shall not go forth with the breath in his nostrils auggrh where is the pitcher i am as thirsty as a mothermare in the first month  your law what is your law to me when the horses fight on the runs do they regard the boundary pillars or do the kites of ali musjid forbear because the carrion lies under the shadow of ghor kuttri the matter began across the border it shall finish where god pleases here in my own country or in hell all three are one  listen now sharer of the sorrow of my heart and i will tell of the hunting i followed to peshawur from pubbi and i went to and fro about the streets of peshawur like a houseless dog seeking for my enemy once i thought i saw him washing his mouth in the conduit in the big square but when i came up he was gone it may be that it was he and seeing my face he had fled  a girl of the bazar said that he would go to nowshera i said o hearts heart does daoud shah visit thee and she said even so i said i would fain see him for we be friends parted for two years hide me i pray here in the shadow of the window shutter and i will wait for his coming and the girl said o pathan look into my eyes and i turned leaning upon her breast and looked into her eyes swearing that i spoke the very truth of god but she answered never friend waited friend with such eyes lie to god and the prophet but to a woman ye cannot lie get hence there shall be no harm befall daoud shah by cause of me  i would have strangled that girl but for the fear of your police and thus the hunting would have come to naught therefore i only laughed and departed and she leaned over the windowbar in the night and mocked me down the street her name is jamun when i have made my account with the man i will return to peshawur andher lovers shall desire her no more for her beautys sake she shall not be jamun but ak the cripple among trees ho ho ak shall she be  at peshawur i bought the horses and grapes and the almonds and dried fruits that the reason of my wanderings might be open to the government and that there might be no hindrance upon the road but when i came to nowshera he was gone and i knew not where to go i stayed one day at nowshera and in the night a voice spoke in my ears as i slept among the horses all night it flew round my head and would not cease from whispering i was upon my belly sleeping as the devils sleep and it may have been that the voice was the voice of a devil it said go south and thou shalt come upon daoud shah listen my brother and chiefest among friendslisten is the tale a long one think how it was long to me i have trodden every league of the road from pubbi to this place and from nowshera my guide was only the voice and the lust of vengeance  to the uttock i went but that was no hindrance to me ho ho a man may turn the word twice even in his trouble the uttock was no uttock obstacle to me and i heard the voice above the noise of the waters beating on the big rock saying go to the right so i went to pindigheb and in those days my sleep was taken from me utterly and the head of the woman of the abazai was before me night and day even as it had fallen between my feet dray wara yow dee dray wara yow dee fire ashes and my couch all three are oneall three are one  now i was far from the winter path of the dealers who had gone to sialkot and so south by the rail and the big road to the line of cantonments but there was a sahib in camp at pindigheb who bought from me a white mare at a good price and told me that one daoud shah had passed to shahpur with horses then i saw that the warning of the voice was true and made swift to come to the salt hills the jhelum was in flood but i could not wait and in the crossing a bay stallion was washed down and drowned herein was god hard to menot in respect of the beast of that i had no carebut in this snatching while i was upon the right bank urging the horses into the water daoud shah was upon the left foralghias alghiasthe hoofs of my mare scattered the hot ashes of his fires when we came up the hither bank in the light of morning but he had fled his feet were made swift by the terror of death and i went south from shahpur as the kite flies i dared not turn aside lest i should miss my vengeancewhich is my right from shahpur i skirted by the jhelum for i thought that he would avoid the desert of the rechna but presently at sahiwal i turned away upon the road to jhang samundri and gugera till upon a night the mottled mare breasted the fence of the rail that turns to montgomery and that place was okara and the head of the woman of the abazai lay upon the sand between my feet  thence i went to fazilka and they said that i was mad to bring starved horses there the voice was with me and i was not mad but only wearied because i could not find daoud shah it was written that i should not find him at rania nor bahadurgarh and i came into delhi from the west and there also i found him not my friend i have seen many strange things in my wanderings i have seen devils rioting across the rechna as the stallions riot in spring i have heard the djinns calling to each other from holes in the sand and i have seen them pass before my face there are no devils say the sahibs they are very wise but they do not know all things about devils orhorses ho ho i say to you who are laughing at my misery that i have seen the devils at high noon whooping and leaping on the shoals of the chenab and was i afraid my brother when the desire of a man is set upon one thing alone he fears neither god nor man nor devil if my vengeance failed i would splinter the gates of paradise with the butt of my gun or i would cut my way into hell with my knife and i would call upon those who govern there for the body of daoud shah what love so deep as hate  do not speak i know the thought in your heart is the white of this eye clouded how does the blood beat at the wrist there is no madness in my flesh but only the vehemence of the desire that has eaten me up listen  south of delhi i knew not the country at all therefore i cannot say where i went but i passed through many cities i knew only that it was laid upon me to go south when the horses could march no more i threw myself upon the earth and waited till the day there was no sleep with me in that journeying and that was a heavy burden dost thou know brother of mine the evil of wakefulness that cannot breakwhen the bones are sore for lack of sleep and the skin of the temples twitches with weariness and yetthere is no sleepthere is no sleep dray wara yow dee dray wara yow dee the eye of the sun the eye of the moon and my own unrestful eyesall three are oneall three are one  there was a city the name whereof i have forgotten and there the voice called all night that was ten days ago it has cheated me afresh  i have come hither from a place called hamirpur and behold it is my fate that i should meet with thee to my comfort and the increase of friendship this is a good omen by the joy of looking upon thy face the weariness has gone from my feet and the sorrow of my so long travel is forgotten also my heart is peaceful for i know that the end is near  it may be that i shall find daoud shah in this city going northward since a hillman will ever head back to his hills when the spring warns and shall he see those hills of our country surely i shall overtake him surely my vengeance is safe surely god hath him in the hollow of his hand against my claiming there shall no harm befall daoud shah till i come for i would fain kill him quick and whole with the life sticking firm in his body a pomegranate is sweetest when the cloves break away unwilling from the rind let it be in the daytime that i may see his face and my delight may be crowned  and when i have accomplished the matter and my honour is made clean i shall return thanks unto god the holder of the scale of the law and i shall sleep from the night through the day and into the night again i shall sleep and no dream shall trouble me  and now o my brother the tale is all told ahi ahi alghias ahi     the judgment of dungara  see the pale martyr with his shirt on fireprinters error  they tell the tale even now among the groves of the berbulda hill and for corroboration point to the roofless and windowless missionhouse the great god dungara the god of things as they are most terrible oneeyed bearing the red elephant tusk did it all and he who refuses to believe in dungara will assuredly be smitten by the madness of yatthe madness that fell upon the sons and the daughters of the buria kol when they turned aside from dungara and put on clothes so says athon daze who is high priest of the shrine and warden of the red elephant tusk but if you ask the assistant collector and agent in charge of the buria kol he will laughnot because he bears any malice against missions but because he himself saw the vengeance of dungara executed upon the spiritual children of the reverend justus krenk pastor of the tubingen mission and upon lotta his virtuous wife  transcribers note the e in athon daze has an acute accent  yet if ever a man merited good treatment of the gods it was the reverend justus one time of heidelberg who on the faith of a call went into the wilderness and took the blonde blueeyed lotta with him we will these heathen now by idolatrous practices so darkened better make said justus in the early days of his career yes he added with conviction they shall be good and shall with their hands to work learn for all good christians must work and upon a stipend more modest even than that of an english layreader justus krenk kept house beyond kamala and the gorge of malair beyond the berbulda river close to the foot of the blue hill of panth on whose summit stands the temple of dungarain the heart of the country of the buria kolthe naked goodtempered timid shameless lazy buria kol  do you know what life at a mission outpost means try to imagine a loneliness exceeding that of the smallest station to which government has ever sent youisolation that weighs upon the waking eyelids and drives you by force headlong into the labours of the day there is no post there is no one of your own colour to speak to there are no roads there is indeed food to keep you alive but it is not pleasant to eat and whatever of good or beauty or interest there is in your life must come from yourself and the grace that may be planted in you  in the morning with a patter of soft feet the converts the doubtful and the open scoffers troop up to the veranda you must be infinitely kind and patient and above all clearsighted for you deal with the simplicity of childhood the experience of man and the subtlety of the savage your congregation have a hundred material wants to be considered and it is for you as you believe in your personal responsibility to your maker to pick out of the clamouring crowd any grain of spirituality that may lie therein if to the cure of souls you add that of bodies your task will be all the more difficult for the sick and the maimed will profess any and every creed for the sake of healing and will laugh at you because you are simple enough to believe them  as the day wears and the impetus of the morning dies away there will come upon you an overwhelming sense of the uselessness of your toil this must be striven against and the only spur in your side will be the belief that you are playing against the devil for the living soul it is a great a joyous belief but he who can hold it unwavering for four and twenty consecutive hours must be blessed with an abundantly strong physique and equable nerve  ask the gray heads of the bannockburn medical crusade what manner of life their preachers lead speak to the racine gospel agency those lean americans whose boast is that they go where no englishman dare follow get a pastor of the tubingen mission to talk of his experiencesif you can you will be referred to the printed reports but these contain no mention of the men who have lost youth and health all that a man may lose except faith in the wilds of english maidens who have gone forth and died in the feverstricken jungle of the panth hills knowing from the first that death was almost a certainty few pastors will tell you of these things any more than they will speak of that young david of st bees who set apart for the lords work broke down in utter desolation and returned half distraught to the head mission crying there is no god but i have walked with the devil  the reports are silent here because heroism failure doubt despair and selfabnegation on the part of a mere cultured white man are things of no weight as compared to the saving of one halfhuman soul from a fantastic faith in woodspirits goblins of the rock and riverfiends  and gallio the assistant collector of the country side cared for none of these things he had been long in the district and the buria kol loved him and brought him offerings of speared fish orchids from the dim moist heart of the forests and as much game as he could eat in return he gave them quinine and with athon daze the high priest controlled their simple policies  when you have been some years in the country said gallio at the krenks table you grow to find one creed as good as another ill give you all the assistance in my power of course but dont hurt my buria kol they are a good people and they trust me  i will them the word of the lord teach said justus his round face beaming with enthusiasm and i will assuredly to their prejudices no wrong hastily without thinking make but o my friend this in the mind impartialityofcreedjudgmentbelooking is very bad  heighho said gallio i have their bodies and the district to see to but you can try what you can do for their souls only dont behave as your predecessor did or im afraid that i cant guarantee your life  and that said lotta sturdily handing him a cup of tea  he went up to the temple of dungarato be sure he was new to the countryand began hammering old dungara over the head with an umbrella so the buria kol turned out and hammered him rather savagely i was in the district and he sent a runner to me with a note saying persecuted for the lords sake send wing of regiment the nearest troops were about two hundred miles off but i guessed what he had been doing i rode to panth and talked to old athon daze like a father telling him that a man of his wisdom ought to have known that the sahib had sunstroke and was mad you never saw a people more sorry in your life athon daze apologised sent wood and milk and fowls and all sorts of things and i gave five rupees to the shrine and told macnamara that he had been injudicious he said that i had bowed down in the house of rimmon but if he had only just gone over the brow of the hill and insulted palin deo the idol of the suria kol he would have been impaled on a charred bamboo long before i could have done anything and then i should have had to have hanged some of the poor brutes be gentle with them padribut i dont think youll do much  not i said justus but my master we will with the little children begin many of them will be sickthat is so after the children the mothers and then the men but i would greatly that you were in internal sympathies with us prefer  gallio departed to risk his life in mending the rotten bamboo bridges of his people in killing a too persistent tiger here or there in sleeping out in the reeking jungle or in tracking the suria kol raiders who had taken a few heads from their brethren of the buria clan he was a knockkneed shambling young man naturally devoid of creed or reverence with a longing for absolute power which his undesirable district gratified  no one wants my post he used to say grimly and my collector only pokes his nose in when hes quite certain that there is no fever im monarch of all i survey and athon daze is my viceroy  because gallio prided himself on his supreme disregard of human lifethough he never extended the theory beyond his ownhe naturally rode forty miles to the mission with a tiny brown girlbaby on his saddlebow  here is something for you padri said he the kols leave their surplus children to die dont see why they shouldnt but you may rear this one i picked it up beyond the berbulda fork ive a notion that the mother has been following me through the woods ever since  it is the first of the fold said justus and lotta caught up the screaming morsel to her bosom and hushed it craftily while as a wolf hangs in the field matui who had borne it and in accordance with the law of her tribe had exposed it to die panted weary and footsore in the bamboobrake watching the house with hungry mothereyes what would the omnipotent assistant collector do would the little man in the black coat eat her daughter alive as athon daze said was the custom of all men in black coats  matui waited among the bamboos through the long night and in the morning there came forth a fair white woman the like of whom matui had never seen and in her arms was matuis daughter clad in spotless raiment lotta knew little of the tongue of the buria kol but when mother calls to mother speech is easy to follow by the hands stretched timidly to the hem of her gown by the passionate gutturals and the longing eyes lotta understood with whom she had to deal so matui took her child againwould be a servant even a slave to this wonderful white woman for her own tribe would recognise her no more and lotta wept with her exhaustively after the german fashion which includes much blowing of the nose  first the child then the mother and last the man and to the glory of god all said justus the hopeful and the man came with a bow and arrows very angry indeed for there was no one to cook for him  but the tale of the mission is a long one and i have no space to show how justus forgetful of his injudicious predecessor grievously smote moto the husband of matui for his brutality how moto was startled but being released from the fear of instant death took heart and became the faithful ally and first convert of justus how the little gathering grew to the huge disgust of athon daze how the priest of the god of things as they are argued subtilely with the priest of the god of things as they should be and was worsted how the dues of the temple of dungara fell away in fowls and fish and honeycomb how lotta lightened the curse of eve among the women and how justus did his best to introduce the curse of adam how the buria kol rebelled at this saying that their god was an idle god and how justus partially overcame their scruples against work and taught them that the black earth was rich in other produce than pignuts only  all these things belong to the history of many months and throughout those months the whitehaired athon daze meditated revenge for the tribal neglect of dungara with savage cunning he feigned friendship towards justus even hinting at his own conversion but to the congregation of dungara he said darkly they of the padris flock have put on clothes and worship a busy god therefore dungara will afflict them grieviously till they throw themselves howling into the waters of the berbulda at night the red elephant tusk boomed and groaned among the hills and the faithful waked and said the god of things as they are matures revenge against the backsliders be merciful dungara to us thy children and give us all their crops  late in the cold weather the collector and his wife came into the buria kol country go and look at krenks mission said gallio he is doing good work in his own way and i think hed be pleased if you opened the bamboo chapel that he has managed to run up at any rate youll see a civilised buria kol  great was the stir in the mission now he and the gracious lady will that we have done good work with their own eyes see andyeswe will him our converts in all their new clothes by their own hands constructed exhibit it will a great day befor the lord always said justus and lotta said amen  justus had in his quiet way felt jealous of the basel weaving mission his own converts being unhandy but athon daze had latterly induced some of them to hackle the glossy silky fibres of a plant that grew plenteously on the panth hills it yielded a cloth white and smooth almost as the tappa of the south seas and that day the converts were to wear for the first time clothes made therefrom justus was proud of his work  they shall in white clothes clothed to meet the collector and his wellborn lady come down singing now thank we all our god then he will the chapel open andyeseven gallio to believe will begin stand so my children two by two andlotta why do they thus themselves bescratch it is not seemly to wriggle nala my child the collector will be here and be pained  the collector his wife and gallio climbed the hill to the missionstation the converts were drawn up in two lines a shining band nearly forty strong hah said the collector whose acquisitive bent of mind led him to believe that he had fostered the institution from the first advancing i see by leaps and bounds  never was truer word spoken the mission was advancing exactly as he had saidat first by little hops and shuffles of shamefaced uneasiness but soon by the leaps of flystung horses and the bounds of maddened kangaroos from the hill of panth the red elephant tusk delivered a dry and anguished blare the ranks of the converts wavered broke and scattered with yells and shrieks of pain while justus and lotta stood horrorstricken  it is the judgment of dungara shouted a voice i burn i burn to the river or we die  the mob wheeled and headed for the rocks that overhung the berbulda writhing stamping twisting and shedding its garments as it ran pursued by the thunder of the trumpet of dungara justus and lotta fled to the collector almost in tears  i cannot understand yesterday panted justus they had the ten commandmentswhat is this praise the lord all good spirits by land and by sea nala oh shame  with a bound and a scream there alighted on the rocks above their heads nala once the pride of the mission a maiden of fourteen summers good docile and virtuousnow naked as the dawn and spitting like a wildcat  was it for this she raved hurling her petticoat at justus was it for this i left my people and dungarafor the fires of your bad place blind ape little earthworm dried fish that you are you said that i should never burn o dungara i burn now i burn now have mercy god of things as they are  she turned and flung herself into the berbulda and the trumpet of dungara bellowed jubilantly the last of the converts of the tubingen mission had put a quarter of a mile of rapid river between herself and her teachers  yesterday gulped justus she taught in the school abcdoh it is the work of satan  but gallio was curiously regarding the maidens petticoat where it had fallen at his feet he felt its texture drew back his shirtsleeve beyond the deep tan of his wrist and pressed a fold of the cloth against the flesh a blotch of angry red rose on the white skin  ah said gallio calmly i thought so  what is it said justus  i should call it the shirt of nessus butwhere did you get the fibre of this cloth from  athon daze said justus he showed the boys how it should manufactured be  the old fox do you know that he has given you the nilgiri nettlescorpiongirardenia heterophyllato work up no wonder they squirmed why it stings even when they make bridgeropes of it unless its soaked for six weeks the cunning brute it would take about half an hour to burn through their thick hides and then  gallio burst into laughter but lotta was weeping in the arms of the collectors wife and justus had covered his face with his hands  girardenia heterophylla repeated gallio krenk why didnt you tell me i could have saved you this woven fire anybody but a naked kol would have known it and if im a judge of their ways youll never get them back  he looked across the river to where the converts were still wallowing and wailing in the shallows and the laughter died out of his eyes for he saw that the tubingen mission to the buria kol was dead  never again though they hung mournfully round the deserted school for three months could lotta or justus coax back even the most promising of their flock no the end of conversion was the fire of the bad placefire that ran through the limbs and gnawed into the bones who dare a second time tempt the anger of dungara let the little man and his wife go elsewhere the buria kol would have none of them an unofficial message to athon daze that if a hair of their heads were touched athon daze and the priests of dungara would be hanged by gallio at the temple shrine protected justus and lotta from the stumpy poisoned arrows of the buria kol but neither fish nor fowl honeycomb salt nor young pig were brought to their doors any more and alas man cannot live by grace alone if meat be wanting  let us go mine wife said justus there is no good here and the lord has willed that some other man shall the work takein good timein his own good time we will go away and i willyessome botany bestudy  if any one is anxious to convert the buria kol afresh there lies at least the core of a missionhouse under the hill of panth but the chapel and school have long since fallen back into jungle     at howli thana  his own shoe his own headnative proverb  as a messenger if the heart of the presence be moved to so great favour and on six rupees yes sahib for i have three little children whose stomachs are always empty and corn is now but forty pounds to the rupee i will make so clever a messenger that you shall all day long be pleased with me and at the end of the year bestow a turban i know all the roads of the station and many other things aha sahib i am clever give me service i was aforetime in the police a bad character now without doubt an enemy has told this tale never was i a scamp i am a man of clean heart and all my words are true they knew this when i was in the police they said afzal khan is a true speaker in whose words men may trust i am a delhi pathan sahiball delhi pathans are good men you have seen delhi yes it is true that there be many scamps among the delhi pathans how wise is the sahib nothing is hid from his eyes and he will make me his messenger and i will take all his notes secretly and without ostentation nay sahib god is my witness that i meant no evil i have long desired to serve under a true sahiba virtuous sahib many young sahibs are as devils unchained with these sahibs i would take no servicenot though all the stomachs of my little children were crying for bread  why am i not still in the police i will speak true talk an evil came to the thanato ram baksh the havildar and maula baksh and juggut ram and bhim singh and suruj bul ram baksh is in the jail for a space and so also is maula baksh  it was at the thana of howli on the road that leads to gokralseetarun wherein are many dacoits we were all brave menrustums wherefore we were sent to that thana which was eight miles from the next thana all day and all night we watched for dacoits why does the sahib laugh nay i will make a confession the dacoits were too clever and seeing this we made no further trouble it was in the hot weather what can a man do in the hot days is the sahib who is so strongis he even vigorous in that hour we made an arrangement with the dacoits for the sake of peace that was the work of the havildar who was fat ho ho sahib he is now getting thin in the jail among the carpets the havildar said give us no trouble and we will give you no trouble at the end of the reaping send us a man to lead before the judge a man of infirm mind against whom the trumpedup case will break down thus we shall save our honour to this talk the dacoits agreed and we had no trouble at the thana and could eat melons in peace sitting upon our charpoys all day long sweet as sugarcane are the melons of howli  now there was an assistant commissionera stunt sahib in that district called yunkum sahib aha he was hardhard even as is the sahib who without doubt will give me the shadow of his protection many eyes had yunkum sahib and moved quickly through his district men called him the tiger of gokralseetarun because he would arrive unannounced and make his kill and before sunset would be giving trouble to the tehsildars thirty miles away no one knew the comings or the goings of yunkum sahib he had no camp and when his horse was weary he rode upon a devilcarriage i do not know its name but the sahib sat in the midst of three silver wheels that made no creaking and drave them with his legs prancing like a beanfed horsethus a shadow of a hawk upon the fields was not more without noise than the devilcarriage of yunkum sahib it was here it was there it was gone and the rapport was made and there was trouble ask the tehsildar of rohestri how the henstealing came to be known sahib  it fell upon a night that we of the thana slept according to custom upon our charpoys having eaten the evening meal and drunk tobacco when we awoke in the morning behold of our six rifles not one remained also the big policebook that was in the havildars charge was gone seeing these things we were very much afraid thinking on our parts that the dacoits regardless of honour had come by night and put us to shame then said ram baksh the havildar be silent the business is an evil business but it may yet go well let us make the case complete bring a kid and my tulwar see you not now o fools a kick for a horse but a word is enough for a man  we of the thana perceiving quickly what was in the mind of the havildar and greatly fearing that the service would be lost made haste to take the kid into the inner room and attended to the words of the havildar twenty dacoits came said the havildar and we taking his words repeated after him according to custom there was a great fight said the havildar and of us no man escaped unhurt the bars of the window were broken suruj bul see thou to that and o men put speed into your work for a runner must go with the news to the tiger of gokralseetarun thereon suruj bul leaning with his shoulder brake in the bars of the window and i beating her with a whip made the havildars mare skip among the melonbeds till they were much trodden with hoofprints  these things being made i returned to the thana and the goat was slain and certain portions of the walls were blackened with fire and each man dipped his clothes a little into the blood of the goat know o sahib that a wound made by man upon his own body can by those skilled be easily discerned from a wound wrought by another man therefore the havildar taking his tulwar smote one of us lightly on the forearm in the fat and another on the leg and a third on the back of the hand thus dealt he with all of us till the blood came and suruj bul more eager than the others took out much hair o sahib never was so perfect an arrangement yea even i would have sworn that the thana had been treated as we said there was smoke and breaking and blood and trampled earth  ride now maula baksh said the havildarto the house of the stunt sahib and carry the news of the dacoity do you also o afzal khan run there and take heed that you are mired with sweat and dust on your incoming the blood will be dry on the clothes i will stay and send a straight report to the dipty sahib and we will catch certain that ye know of villagers so that all may be ready against the dipty sahibs arrival  thus maula baksh rode and i ran hanging on the stirrup and together we came in an evil plight before the tiger of gokralseetarun in the rohestri tehsil our tale was long and correct sahib for we gave even the names of the dacoits and the issue of the fight and besought him to come but the tiger made no sign and only smiled after the manner of sahibs when they have a wickedness in their hearts swear ye to the rapport said he and we said thy servants swear the blood of the fight is but newly dry upon us judge thou if it be the blood of the servants of the presence or not and he said i see ye have done well but he did not call for his horse or his devilcarriage and scour the land as was his custom he said rest now and eat bread for ye be wearied men i will wait the coming of the dipty sahib  now it is the order that the havildar of the thana should send a straight report of all dacoities to the dipty sahib at noon came he a fat man and an old and overbearing withal but we of the thana had no fear of his anger dreading more the silences of the tiger of gokralseetarun with him came ram baksh the havildar and the others guarding ten men of the village of howliall men evil affected towards the police of the sirkar as prisoners they came the irons upon their hands crying for mercyimam baksh the farmer who had denied his wife to the havildar and others illconditioned rascals against whom we of the thane bore spite it was well done and the havildar was proud but the dipty sahib was angry with the stunt for lack of zeal and said damdam after the custom of the english people and extolled the havildar yunkum sahib lay still in his long chair have the men sworn said yunkum sahib aye and captured ten evildoers said the dipty sahib there be more abroad in your charge take horseride and go in the name of the sirkar truly there be more evildoers abroad said yunkum sahib but there is no need of a horse come all men with me  i saw the mark of a string on the temples of imam baksh does the presence know the torture of the cold draw i saw also the face of the tiger of gokralseetarun the evil smile was upon it and i stood back ready for what might befall well it was sahib that i did this thing yunkum sahib unlocked the door of his bathroom and smiled anew within lay the six rifles and the big policebook of the thana of howli he had come by night in the devilcarriage that is noiseless as a ghoul and moving among us asleep had taken away both the guns and the book twice had he come to the thana taking each time three rifles the liver of the havildar was turned to water and he fell scrabbling in the dirt about the boots of yunkum sahib cryinghave mercy  and i sahib i am a delhi pathan and a young man with little children the havildars mare was in the compound i ran to her and rode the black wrath of the sirkar was behind me and i knew not whither to go till she dropped and died i rode the red mare and by the blessing of god who is without doubt on the side of all just men i escaped but the havildar and the rest are now in jail  i am a scamp it is as the presence pleases god will make the presence a lord and give him a rich memsahib as fair as a peri to wife and many strong sons if he makes me his orderly the mercy of heaven be upon the sahib yes i will only go to the bazar and bring my children to these sopalacelike quarters and thenthe presence is my father and my mother and i afzal khan am his slave  ohe sirdarji i also am of the household of the sahib     gemini  great is the justice of the white mangreater the power of a lie         native proverb  this is your english justice protector of the poor look at my back and loins which are beaten with sticksheavy sticks i am a poor man and there is no justice in courts  there were two of us and we were born of one birth but i swear to you that i was born the first and ram dass is the younger by three full breaths the astrologer said so and it is written in my horoscopethe horoscope of durga dass  but we were alikei and my brother who is a beast without honourso alike that none knew together or apart which was durga dass i am a mahajun of pali in marwar and an honest man this is true talk when we were men we left our fathers house in pali and went to the punjab where all the people are mudheads and sons of asses we took shop together in isser jangi and my brothernear the big well where the governors camp draws water but ram dass who is without truth made quarrel with me and we were divided he took his books and his pots and his mark and became a bunniaa moneylenderin the long street of isser jang near the gateway of the road that goes to montgomery it was not my fault that we pulled each others turbans i am a mahajun of pali and i always speak true talk ram dass was the thief and the liar  now no man not even the little children could at one glance see which was ram dass and which was durga dass but all the people of isser jangmay they die without sonssaid that we were thieves they used much bad talk but i took money on their bedsteads and their cookingpots and the standing crop and the calf unborn from the well in the big square to the gate of the montgomery road they were fools these peopleunfit to cut the toenails of a marwari from pali i lent money to them all a little very little onlyhere a pice and there a pice god is my witness that i am a poor man the money is all with ram dassmay his sons turn christian and his daughter be a burning fire and a shame in the house from generation to generation may she die unwed and be the mother of a multitude of bastards let the light go out in the house of ram dass my brother this i pray daily twicewith offerings and charms  thus the trouble began we divided the town of isser jang between usi and my brother there was a landholder beyond the gates living but one short mile out on the road that leads to montgomery and his name was muhammad shah son of a nawab he was a great devil and drank wine so long as there were women in his house and wine and money for the marriagefeasts he was merry and wiped his mouth ram dass lent him the money a lakh or half a lakhhow do i knowand so long as the money was lent the landholder cared not what he signed  the people of isser jang were my portion and the landholder and the outtown was the portion of ram dass for so we had arranged i was the poor man for the people of isser jang were without wealth i did what i could but ram dass had only to wait without the door of the landholders gardencourt and to lend him the money taking the bonds from the hand of the steward  in the autumn of the year after the lending ram dass said to the landholder pay me my money but the landholder gave him abuse but ram dass went into the courts with the papers and the bondsall correctand took out decrees against the landholder and the name of the government was across the stamps of the decrees ram dass took field by field and mangotree by mangotree and well by well putting in his own mendebtors of the outtown of isser jangto cultivate the crops so he crept up across the land for he had the papers and the name of the government was across the stamps till his men held the crops for him on all sides of the big white house of the landholder it was well done but when the landholder saw these things he was very angry and cursed ram dass after the manner of the muhammadans  and thus the landholder was angry but ram dass laughed and claimed more fields as was written upon the bonds this was in the month of phagun i took my horse and went out to speak to the man who makes lacbangles upon the road that leads to montgomery because he owed me a debt there was in front of me upon his horse my brother ram dass and when he saw me he turned aside into the high crops because there was hatred between us and i went forward till i came to the orangebushes by the landholders house the bats were flying and the evening smoke was low down upon the land here met me four menswashbucklers and muhammadanswith their faces bound up laying hold of my horses bridle and crying out this is ram dass beat me they beat with their stavesheavy staves bound about with wire at the end such weapons as those swine of punjabis usetill having cried for mercy i fell down senseless but these shameless ones still beat me saying o ram dass this is your interestwell weighed and counted into your hand ram dass i cried aloud that i was not ram dass but durga dass his brother yet they only beat me the more and when i could make no more outcry they left me but i saw their faces there was elahi baksh who runs by the side of the landholders white horse and nur ali the keeper of the door and wajib ali the very strong cook and abdul latif the messengerall of the household of the landholder these things i can swear on the cows tail if need be butahi ahiit has been already sworn and i am a poor man whose honour is lost  when these four had gone away laughing my brother ram dass came out of the crops and mourned over me as one dead but i opened my eyes and prayed him to get me water when i had drunk he carried me on his back and by byways brought me into the town of isser jang my heart was turned to ram dass my brother in that hour because of his kindness and i lost my enmity  but a snake is a snake till it is dead and a liar is a liar till the judgment of the gods takes hold of his heel i was wrong in that i trusted my brotherthe son of my mother  when we had come to his house and i was a little restored i told him my tale and he said without doubt it is me whom they would have beaten but the law courts are open and there is the justice of the sirkar above all and to the law courts do thou go when this sickness is overpast  now when we two had left pali in the old years there fell a famine that ran from jeysulmir to gurgaon and touched gogunda in the south at that time the sister of my father came away and lived with us in isser jang for a man must above all see that his folk do not die of want when the quarrel between us twain came about the sister of my fathera lean shedog without teethsaid that ram dass had the right and went with him into her handsbecause she knew medicines and many curesram dass my brother put me faint with the beating and much bruised even to the pouring of blood from the mouth when i had two days sickness the fever came upon me and i set aside the fever to the account written in my mind against the landholder  the punjabis of isser jang are all the sons of belial and a sheass but they are very good witnesses bearing testimony unshakingly whatever the pleaders may say i would purchase witnesses by the score and each man should give evidence not only against nur ali wajib ali abdul latif and elahi baksh but against the landholder saying that he upon his white horse had called his men to beat me and further that they had robbed me of two hundred rupees for the latter testimony i would remit a little of the debt of the man who sold the lacbangles and he should say that he had put the money into my hands and had seen the robbery from afar but being afraid had run away this plan i told to my brother ram dass and he said that the arrangement was good and bade me take comfort and make swift work to be abroad again my heart was opened to my brother in my sickness and i told him the names of those whom i would call as witnessesall men in my debt but of that the magistrate sahib could have no knowledge nor the landholder the fever stayed with me and after the fever i was taken with colic and gripings very terrible in that day i thought that my end was at hand but i know now that she who gave me the medicines the sister of my fathera widow with a widows hearthad brought about my second sickness ram dass my brother said that my house was shut and locked and brought me the big doorkey and my books together with all the moneys that were in my houseeven the money that was buried under the floor for i was in great fear lest thieves should break in and dig i speak true talk there was but very little money in the house perhaps ten rupeesperhaps twenty how can i tell god is my witness that i am a poor man  one night when i had told ram dass all that was in my heart of the lawsuit that i would bring against the landholder and ram dass had said that he had made the arrangements with the witnesses giving me their names written i was taken with a new great sickness and they put me on the bed when i was a little recoveredi cannot tell how many days afterwardsi made enquiry for ram dass and the sister of my father said that he had gone to montgomery upon a lawsuit i took medicine and slept very heavily without waking when my eyes were opened there was a great stillness in the house of ram dass and none answered when i callednot even the sister of my father this filled me with fear for i knew not what had happened  taking a stick in my hand i went out slowly till i came to the great square by the well and my heart was hot in me against the landholder because of the pain of every step i took  i called for jowar singh the carpenter whose name was first upon the list of those who should bear evidence against the landholder saying are all things ready and do you know what should be said  jowar singh answered what is this and whence do you come durga dass  i said from my bed where i have so long lain sick because of the landholder where is ram dass my brother who was to have made the arrangement for the witnesses surely you and yours know these things  then jowar singh said what has this to do with us o liar i have borne witness and i have been paid and the landholder has by the order of the court paid both the five hundred rupees that he robbed from ram dass and yet other five hundred because of the great injury he did to your brother  the well and the jujubetree above it and the square of isser jang became dark in my eyes but i leaned on my stick and said nay this is childs talk and senseless it was i who suffered at the hands of the landholder and i am come to make ready the case where is my brother ram dass  but jowar singh shook his head and a woman cried what lie is here what quarrel had the landholder with you bunnia it is only a shameless one and one without faith who profits by his brothers smarts have these bunnias no bowels  i cried again saying by the cowby the oath of the cow by the temple of the bluethroated mahadeo i and i only was beatenbeaten to the death let your talk be straight o people of isser jang and i will pay for the witnesses and i tottered where i stood for the sickness and the pain of the beating were heavy upon me  then ram narain who has his carpet spread under the jujubetree by the well and writes all letters for the men of the town came up and said today is the one and fortieth day since the beating and since these six days the case has been judged in the court and the assistant commissioner sahib has given it for your brother ram dass allowing the robbery to which too i bore witness and all things else as the witnesses said there were many witnesses and twice ram dass became senseless in the court because of his wounds and the stunt sahibthe baba stunt sahibgave him a chair before all the pleaders why do you howl durga dass these things fell as i have said was it not so  and jowar singh said that is truth i was there and there was a red cushion in the chair  and ram narain said great shame has come upon the landholder because of this judgment and fearing his anger ram dass and all his house have gone back to pali ram dass told us that you also had gone first the enmity being healed between you to open a shop in pali indeed it were well for you that you go even now for the landholder has sworn that if he catch any one of your house he will hang him by the heels from the wellbeam and swinging him to and fro will beat him with staves till the blood runs from his ears what i have said in respect to the case is true as these men here can testifyeven to the five hundred rupees  i said was it five hundred and kirpa ram the jat said five hundred for i bore witness also  and i groaned for it had been in my heart to have said two hundred only  then a new fear came upon me and my bowels turned to water and running swiftly to the house of ram dass i sought for my books and my money in the great wooden chest under my bedstead there remained nothing not even a cowries value all had been taken by the devil who said he was my brother i went to my own house also and opened the boards of the shutters but there also was nothing save the rats among the grainbaskets in that hour my senses left me and tearing my clothes i ran to the wellplace crying out for the justice of the english on my brother ram dass and in my madness telling all that the books were lost when men saw that i would have jumped down the well they believed the truth of my talk more especially because upon my back and bosom were still the marks of the staves of the landholder  jowar singh the carpenter withstood me and turning me in his handsfor he is a very strong manshowed the scars upon my body and bowed down with laughter upon the wellcurb he cried aloud so that all heard him from the wellsquare to the caravanserai of the pilgrims oho the jackals have quarrelled and the gray one has been caught in the trap in truth this man has been grievously beaten and his brother has taken the money which the court decreed oh bunnia this shall be told for years against you the jackals have quarrelled and moreover the books are burned o people indebted to durga dassand i know that ye be manythe books are burned  then all isser jang took up the cry that the books were burnedahi ahi that in my folly i had let that escape my mouthand they laughed throughout the city they gave me the abuse of the punjabi which is a terrible abuse and very hot pelting me also with sticks and cowdung till i fell down and cried for mercy  ram narain the letterwriter bade the people cease for fear that the news should get into montgomery and the policemen might come down to enquire he said using many bad words this much mercy will i do to you durga dass though there was no mercy in your dealings with my sisters son over the matter of the dun heifer has any man a pony on which he sets no store that this fellow may escape if the landholder hears that one of the twain and god knows whether he beat one or both but this man is certainly beaten be in the city there will be a murder done and then will come the police making inquisition into each mans house and eating the sweetsellers stuff all day long  kirpa ram the jat said i have a pony very sick but with beating he can be made to walk for two miles if he dies the hidesellers will have the body  then chumbo the hideseller said i will pay three annas for the body and will walk by this mans side till such time as the pony dies if it be more than two miles i will pay two annas only  kirpa ram said be it so men brought out the pony and i asked leave to draw a little water from the well because i was dried up with fear  then ram narain said here be four annas god has brought you very low durga dass and i would not send you away empty even though the matter of my sisters sons dun heifer be an open sore between us it is a long way to your own country go and if it be so willed live but above all do not take the ponys bridle for that is mine  and i went out of isser jang amid the laughing of the hugethighed jats and the hideseller walked by my side waiting for the pony to fall dead in one mile it died and being full of fear of the landholder i ran till i could run no more and came to this place  but i swear by the cow i swear by all things whereon hindus and musalmans and even the sahibs swear that i and not my brother was beaten by the landholder but the case is shut and the doors of the law courts are shut and god knows where the baba stunt sahibthe mothers milk is not yet dry upon his hairless lipis gone ahi ahi i i have no witnesses and the scars will heal and i am a poor man but on my fathers soul on the oath of a mahajun from pali i and not my brother i was beaten by the landholder  what can i do the justice of the english is as a great river having gone forward it does not return howbeit do you sahib take a pen and write clearly what i have said that the dipty sahib may see and reprove the stunt sahib who is a colt yet unlicked by the mare so young is he i and not my brother was beaten and he is gone to the westi do not know where  but above all things writeso that sahibs may read and his disgrace be accomplishedthat ram dass my brother son of purun dass mahajun of pali is a swine and a nightthief a taker of life an eater of flesh a jackalspawn without beauty or faith or cleanliness or honour     at twentytwo  narrow as the womb deep as the pit and dark as the heart of a man         sonthal miners proverb  a weaver went out to reap but stayed to unravel the cornstalks ha ha ha is there any sense in a weaver  janki meah glared at kundoo but as janki meah was blind kundoo was not impressed he had come to argue with janki meah and if chance favoured to make love to the old mans pretty young wife  this was kundoos grievance and he spoke in the name of all the five men who with janki meah composed the gang in number seven gallery of twentytwo janki meah had been blind for the thirty years during which he had served the jimahari collieries with pick and crowbar all through those thirty years he had regularly every morning before going down drawn from the overseer his allowance of lampoiljust as if he had been an eyed miner what kundoos gang resented as hundreds of gangs had resented before was janki meahs selfishness he would not add the oil to the common stock of his gang but would save and sell it  i knew these workings before you were born janki meah used to reply i dont want the light to get my coal out by and i am not going to help you the oil is mine and i intend to keep it  a strange man in many ways was janki meah the whitehaired hottempered sightless weaver who had turned pitman all day longexcept on sundays and mondays when he was usually drunkhe worked in the twentytwo shaft of the jimahari colliery as cleverly as a man with all the senses at evening he went up in the great steamhauled cage to the pitbank and there called for his ponya rusty coaldusty beast nearly as old as janki meah the pony would come to his side and janki meah would clamber on to its back and be taken at once to the plot of land which he like the other miners received from the jimahari company the pony knew that place and when after six years the company changed all the allotments to prevent the miners from acquiring proprietary rights janki meah represented with tears in his eyes that were his holding shifted he would never be able to find his way to the new one my horse only knows that place pleaded janki meah and so he was allowed to keep his land  on the strength of this concession and his accumulated oilsavings janki meah took a second wifea girl of the jolaha main stock of the meahs and singularly beautiful janki meah could not see her beauty wherefore he took her on trust and forbade her to go down the pit he had not worked for thirty years in the dark without knowing that the pit was no place for pretty women he loaded her with ornamentsnot brass or pewter but real silver onesand she rewarded him by flirting outrageously with kundoo of number seven gallery gang kundoo was really the ganghead but janki meah insisted upon all the work being entered in his own name and chose the men that he worked with customstronger even than the jimahari companydictated that janki by right of his years should manage these things and should also work despite his blindness in indian mines where they cut into the solid coal with the pick and clear it out from floor to ceiling he could come to no great harm at home where they undercut the coal and bring it down in crashing avalanches from the roof he would never have been allowed to set foot in a pit he was not a popular man because of his oilsavings but all the gangs admitted that janki knew all the khads or workings that had ever been sunk or worked since the jimahari company first started operations on the tarachunda fields  pretty little unda only knew that her old husband was a fool who could be managed she took no interest in the collieries except in so far as they swallowed up kundoo five days out of the seven and covered him with coaldust kundoo was a great workman and did his best not to get drunk because when he had saved forty rupees unda was to steal everything that she could find in jankis house and run with kundoo to a land where there were no mines and every one kept three fat bullocks and a milchbuffalo while this scheme ripened it was his custom to drop in upon janki and worry him about the oilsavings unda sat in a corner and nodded approval on the night when kundoo had quoted that objectionable proverb about weavers janki grew angry  listen you pig said he blind i am and old i am but before ever you were born i was gray among the coal even in the days when the twentytwo khad was unsunk and there were not two thousand men here i was known to have all knowledge of the pits what khad is there that i do not know from the bottom of the shaft to the end of the last drive is it the baromba khad the oldest or the twentytwo where tibus gallery runs up to number five  hear the old fool talk said kundoo nodding to unda no gallery of twentytwo will cut into five before the end of the rains we have a months solid coal before us the babuji says so  babuji pigji dogji what do these fat slugs from calcutta know he draws and draws and draws and talks and talks and talks and his maps are all wrong i janki know that this is so when a man has been shut up in the dark for thirty years god gives him knowledge the old gallery that tibus gang made is not six feet from number five  without doubt god gives the blind knowledge said kundoo with a look at unda let it be as you say i for my part do not know where lies the gallery of tibus gang but i am not a withered monkey who needs oil to grease his joints with  kundoo swung out of the hut laughing and unda giggled janki turned his sightless eyes towards his wife and swore i have land and i have sold a great deal of lampoil mused janki but i was a fool to marry this child  a week later the rains set in with a vengeance and the gangs paddled about in coalslush at the pitbanks then the big minepumps were made ready and the manager of the colliery ploughed through the wet towards the tarachunda river swelling between its soppy banks lord send that this beastly beck doesnt misbehave said the manager piously and he went to take counsel with his assistant about the pumps  but the tarachunda misbehaved very much indeed after a fall of three inches of rain in an hour it was obliged to do something it topped its bank and joined the floodwater that was hemmed between two low hills just where the embankment of the colliery main line crossed when a large part of a rainfed river and a few acres of floodwater make a dead set for a ninefoot culvert the culvert may spout its finest but the water cannot all get out the manager pranced upon one leg with excitement and his language was improper  he had reason to swear because he knew that one inch of water on land meant a pressure of one hundred tons to the acre and here were about five feet of water forming behind the railway embankment over the shallower workings of twentytwo you must understand that in a coalmine the coal nearest the surface is worked first from the central shaft that is to say the miners may clear out the stuff to within ten twenty or thirty feet of the surface and when all is worked out leave only a skin of earth upheld by some few pillars of coal in a deep mine where they know that they have any amount of material at hand men prefer to get all their mineral out at one shaft rather than make a number of little holes to tap the comparatively unimportant surfacecoal  and the manager watched the flood  the culvert spouted a ninefoot gush but the water still formed and word was sent to clear the men out of twentytwo the cages came up crammed and crammed again with the men nearest the piteye as they call the place where you can see daylight from the bottom of the main shaft all away and away up the long black galleries the flarelamps were winking and dancing like so many fireflies and the men and the women waited for the clanking rattling thundering cages to come down and fly up again but the outworkings were very far off and word could not be passed quickly though the heads of the gangs and the assistant shouted and swore and tramped and stumbled the manager kept one eye on the great troubled pool behind the embankment and prayed that the culvert would give way and let the water through in time with the other eye he watched the cages come up and saw the headmen counting the roll of the gangs with all his heart and soul he swore at the winder who controlled the iron drum that wound up the wire rope on which hung the cages  in a little time there was a downdraw in the water behind the embankmenta sucking whirlpool all yellow and yeasty the water had smashed through the skin of the earth and was pouring into the old shallow workings of twentytwo  deep down below a rush of black water caught the last gang waiting for the cage and as they clambered in the whirl was about their waists the cage reached the pitbank and the manager called the roll the gangs were all safe except gang janki gang mogul and gang rahim eighteen men with perhaps ten basketwomen who loaded the coal into the little iron carriages that ran on the tramways of the main galleries these gangs were in the outworkings threequarters of a mile away on the extreme fringe of the mine once more the cage went down but with only two englishmen in it and dropped into a swirling roaring current that had almost touched the roof of some of the lower sidegalleries one of the wooden balks with which they had propped the old workings shot past on the current just missing the cage  if we dont want our ribs knocked out wed better go said the manager we cant even save the companys props  the cage drew out of the water with a splash and a few minutes later it was officially reported that there were at least ten feet of water in the pits eye now ten feet of water there meant that all other places in the mine were flooded except such galleries as were more than ten feet above the level of the bottom of the shaft the deep workings would be full the main galleries would be full but in the high workings reached by inclines from the main roads there would be a certain amount of air cut off so to speak by the water and squeezed up by it the little scienceprimers explain how water behaves when you pour it down testtubes the flooding of twentytwo was an illustration on a large scale   by the holy grove what has happened to the air it was a sonthal gangman of gang mogul in number nine gallery and he was driving a sixfoot way through the coal then there was a rush from the other galleries and gang janki and gang rahim stumbled up with their basketwomen  water has come in the mine they said and there is no way of getting out  i went down said jankidown the slope of my gallery and i felt the water  there has been no water in the cutting in our time clamoured the women why cannot we go away  be silent said janki long ago when my father was here water came to tenno elevencutting and there was great trouble let us get away to where the air is better  the three gangs and the basketwomen left number nine gallery and went further up number sixteen at one turn of the road they could see the pitchy black water lapping on the coal it had touched the roof of a gallery that they knew wella gallery where they used to smoke their huqas and manage their flirtations seeing this they called aloud upon their gods and the meahs who are thrice bastered muhammadans strove to recollect the name of the prophet they came to a great open square whence nearly all the coal had been extracted it was the end of the outworkings and the end of the mine  far away down the gallery a small pumpingengine used for keeping dry a deep working and fed with steam from above was throbbing faithfully they heard it cease  they have cut off the steam said kundoo hopefully they have given the order to use all the steam for the pitbank pumps they will clear out the water  if the water has reached the smokinggallery said janki all the companys pumps can do nothing for three days  it is very hot moaned jasoda the meah basketwoman there is a very bad air here because of the lamps  put them out said janki why do you want lamps the lamps were put out and the company sat still in the utter dark somebody rose quietly and began walking over the coals it was janki who was touching the walls with his hands where is the ledge he murmured to himself  sit sit said kundoo if we die we die the air is very bad  but janki still stumbled and crept and tapped with his pick upon the walls the women rose to their feet  stay all where you are without the lamps you cannot see and ii am always seeing said janki then he paused and called out oh you who have been in the cutting more than ten years what is the name of this open place i am an old man and i have forgotten  bullias room answered the sonthal who had complained of the vileness of the air  again said janki  bullias room  then i have found it said janki the name only had slipped my memory tibus gangs gallery is here  a lie said kundoo there have been no galleries in this place since my day  three paces was the depth of the ledge muttered janki without heedingandoh my poor bonesi have found it it is here up this ledge come all you one by one to the place of my voice and i will count you  there was a rush in the dark and janki felt the first mans face hit his knees as the sonthal scrambled up the ledge  who cried janki  i sunua manji  sit you down said janki who next  one by one the women and the men crawled up the ledge which ran along one side of bullias room degraded muhammadan pigeating musahr and wild sonthal janki ran his hand over them all  now follow after said he catching hold of my heel and the women catching the mens clothes he did not ask whether the men had brought their picks with them a miner black or white does not drop his pick one by one janki leading they crept into the old gallerya sixfoot way with a scant four feet from hill to roof  the air is better here said jasoda they could hear her heart beating in thick sick bumps  slowly slowly said janki i am an old man and i forget many things this is tibus gallery but where are the four bricks where they used to put their huqa fire on when the sahibs never saw slowly slowly o you people behind  they heard his hands disturbing the small coal on the floor of the gallery and then a dull sound this is one unbaked brick and this is another and another kundoo is a young manlet him come forward put a knee upon this brick and strike here when tibus gang were at dinner on the last day before the good coal ended they heard the men of five on the other side and five worked their gallery two sundays lateror it may have been one strike there kundoo but give me room to go back  kundoo doubting drove the pick but the first soft crush of the coal was a call to him he was fighting for his life and for undapretty little unda with rings on all her toesfor unda and the forty rupees the women sang the song of the pickthe terrible slow swinging melody with the muttered chorus that repeats the sliding of the loosened coal and to each cadence kundoo smote in the black dark when he could do no more sunua manji took the pick and struck for his life and his wife and his village beyond the blue hills over the tarachunda river an hour the men worked and then the women cleared away the coal  it is farther than i thought said janki the air is very bad but strike kundoo strike hard  for the fifth time kundoo took up the pick as the sonthal crawled back the song had scarcely recommenced when it was broken by a yell from kundoo that echoed down the gallery par hua par hua we are through we are through the imprisoned air in the mine shot through the opening and the women at the far end of the gallery heard the water rush through the pillars of bullias room and roar against the ledge having fulfilled the law under which it worked it rose no farther the women screamed and pressed forward the water has comewe shall be killed let us go  kundoo crawled through the gap and found himself in a propped gallery by the simple process of hitting his head against a beam  do i know the pits or do i not chuckled janki this is the number five go you out slowly giving me your names ho rahim count your gang now let us go forward each catching hold of the other as before  they formed a line in the darkness and janki led themfor a pitman in a strange pit is only one degree less liable to err than an ordinary mortal underground for the first time at last they saw a flarelamp and gangs janki mogul and rahim of twentytwo stumbled dazed into the glare of the draughtfurnace at the bottom of five janki feeling his way and the rest behind  water has come into twentytwo god knows where are the others i have brought these men from tibus gallery in our cutting making connection through the north side of the gallery take us to the cage said janki meah   at the pitbank of twentytwo some thousand people clamoured and wept and shouted one hundred menone thousand menhad been drowned in the cutting they would all go to their homes tomorrow where were their men little unda her cloth drenched with the rain stood at the pitmouth calling down the shaft for kundoo they had swung the cages clear of the mouth and her only answer was the murmur of the flood in the pits eye two hundred and sixty feet below  look after that woman shell chuck herself down the shaft in a minute shouted the manager  but he need not have troubled unda was afraid of death she wanted kundoo the assistant was watching the flood and seeing how far he could wade into it there was a lull in the water and the whirlpool had slackened the mine was full and the people at the pitbank howled  my faith we shall be lucky if we have five hundred hands on the place tomorrow said the manager  theres some chance yet of running a temporary dam across that water shove in anythingtubs and bullockcarts if you havent enough bricks make them work now if they never worked before hi you gangers make them work  little by little the crowd was broken into detachments and pushed towards the water with promises of overtime the dammaking began and when it was fairly under way the manager thought that the hour had come for the pumps there was no fresh inrush into the mine the tall red ironclamped pumpbeam rose and fell and the pumps snored and guttered and shrieked as the first water poured out of the pipe  we must run her all tonight said the manager wearily but theres no hope for the poor devils down below look here gur sahai if you are proud of your engines show me what they can do now  gur sahai grinned and nodded with his right hand upon the lever and an oilcan in his left he could do no more than he was doing but he could keep that up till the dawn were the companys pumps to be beaten by the vagaries of that troublesome tarachunda river never never and the pumps sobbed and panted never never the manager sat in the shelter of the pitbank roofing trying to dry himself by the pumpboiler fire and in the dreary dusk he saw the crowds on the dam scatter and fly  thats the end he groaned twill take us six weeks to persuade em that we havent tried to drown their mates on purpose oh for a decent rational geordie  but the flight had no panic in it men had run over from five with astounding news and the foremen could not hold their gangs together presently surrounded by a clamorous crew gangs rahim mogul and janki and ten basketwomen walked up to report themselves and pretty little unda stole away to jankis hut to prepare his evening meal  alone i found the way explained janki meah and now will the company give me pension  the simple pitfolk shouted and leaped and went back to the dam reassured in their old belief that whatever happened so great was the power of the company whose salt they ate none of them could be killed but gur sahai only bared his white teeth and kept his hand upon the lever and proved his pumps to the uttermost   i say said the assistant to the manager a week later do you recollect germinal  yes queer thing i thought of it in the cage when that balk went by why  oh this business seems to be germinal upside down janki was in my veranda all this morning telling me that kundoo had eloped with his wifeunda or anda i think her name was  hillo and those were the cattle that you risked your life to clear out of twentytwo  noi was thinking of the companys props not the companys men  sounds better to say so now but i dont believe you old fellow     in flood time    tweed said tae till   what gars ye rin sae still   till said tae tweed   though ye rin wi speed   an i rin slaw   yet where ye droon ae man   i droon twa  there is no getting over the river tonight sahib they say that a bullockcart has been washed down already and the ekka that went over a half hour before you came has not yet reached the far side is the sahib in haste i will drive the fordelephant in to show him ohe mahout there in the shed bring out ram pershad and if he will face the current good an elephant never lies sahib and ram pershad is separated from his friend kala nag

head fool was the goad made only to scratch thy own fat back with bastard strike strike what are the boulders to thee ram pershad my rustum my mountain of strength go in go in  no sahib it is useless you can hear him trumpet he is telling kala nag that he cannot come over see he has swung round and is shaking his head he is no fool he knows what the barhwi means when it is angry aha indeed thou art no fool my child salaam ram pershad bahadur take him under the trees mahout and see that he gets his spices well done thou chiefest among tuskers salaam to the sirkar and go to sleep  what is to be done the sahib must wait till the river goes down it will shrink tomorrow morning if god pleases or the day after at the latest now why does the sahib get so angry i am his servant before god i did not create this stream what can i do my hut and all that is therein is at the service of the sahib and it is beginning to rain come away my lord how will the river go down for your throwing abuse at it in the old days the english people were not thus the firecarriage has made them soft in the old days when they drave behind horses by day or by night they said naught if a river barred the way or a carriage sat down in the mud it was the will of godnot like a firecarriage which goes and goes and goes and would go though all the devils in the land hung on to its tail the firecarriage hath spoiled the english people after all what is a day lost or for that matter what are two days is the sahib going to his own wedding that he is so mad with haste ho ho ho i am an old man and see few sahibs forgive me if i have forgotten the respect that is due to them the sahib is not angry  his own wedding ho ho ho the mind of an old man is like the numahtree fruit bud blossom and the dead leaves of all the years of the past flourish together old and new and that which is gone out of remembrance all three are there sit on the bedstead sahib and drink milk orwould the sahib in truth care to drink my tobacco it is good it is the tobacco of nuklao my son who is in service there sent it to me drink then sahib if you know how to handle the tube the sahib takes it like a musalman wah wah where did he learn that his own wedding ho ho ho the sahib says that there is no wedding in the matter at all now is it likely that the sahib would speak true talk to me who am only a black man small wonder then that he is in haste thirty years have i beaten the gong at this ford but never have i seen a sahib in such haste thirty years sahib that is a very long time thirty years ago this ford was on the track of the bunjaras and i have seen two thousand packbullocks cross in one night now the rail has come and the firecarriage says buzbuzbuz and a hundred lakhs of maunds slide across that big bridge it is very wonderful but the ford is lonely now that there are no bunjaras to camp under the trees  nay do not trouble to look at the sky without it will rain till the dawn listen the boulders are talking tonight in the bed of the river hear them they would be husking your bones sahib had you tried to cross see i will shut the door and no rain can enter wahi ahi ugh thirty years on the banks of the ford an old man am i andwhere is the oil for the lamp   your pardon but because of my years i sleep no sounder than a dog and you moved to the door look then sahib look and listen a full half kos from bank to bank is the stream nowyou can see it under the starsand there are ten feet of water therein it will not shrink because of the anger in your eyes and it will not be quiet on account of your curses which is louder sahibyour voice or the voice of the river call to itperhaps it will be ashamed lie down and sleep afresh sahib i know the anger of the barhwi when there has fallen rain in the foothills i swam the flood once on a night tenfold worse than this and by the favour of god i was released from death when i had come to the very gates thereof  may i tell the tale very good talk i will fill the pipe anew  thirty years ago it was when i was a young man and had but newly come to the ford i was strong then and the bunjaras had no doubt when i said this ford is clear i have toiled all night up to my shoulderblades in running water amid a hundred bullocks mad with fear and have brought them across losing not a hoof when all was done i fetched the shivering men and they gave me for reward the pick of their cattlethe bellbullock of the drove so great was the honour in which i was held but today when the rain falls and the river rises i creep into my hut and whimper like a dog my strength is gone from me i am an old man and the firecarriage has made the ford desolate they were wont to call me the strong one of the barhwi  behold my face sahibit is the face of a monkey and my armit is the arm of an old woman i swear to you sahib that a woman has loved this face and has rested in the hollow of this arm twenty years ago sahib believe me this was true talktwenty years ago  come to the door and look across can you see a thin fire very far away down the stream that is the templefire in the shrine of hanuman of the village of pateera north under the big star is the village itself but it is hidden by a bend of the river is that far to swim sahib would you take off your clothes and adventure yet i swam to pateeranot once but many times and there are muggers in the river too  love knows no caste else why should i a musalman and the son of a musalman have sought a hindu womana widow of the hindusthe sister of the headman of pateera but it was even so they of the headmans household came on a pilgrimage to muttra when she was but newly a bride silver tires were upon the wheels of the bullockcart and silken curtains hid the woman sahib i made no haste in their conveyance for the wind parted the curtains and i saw her when they returned from pilgrimage the boy that was her husband had died and i saw her again in the bullockcart by god these hindus are fools what was it to me whether she was hindu or jainscavenger leper or whole i would have married her and made her a home by the ford the seventh of the nine bars says that a man may not marry one of the idolaters is that truth both shiahs and sunnis say that a musalman may not marry one of the idolaters is the sahib a priest then that he knows so much i will tell him something that he does not know there is neither shiah nor sunni forbidden nor idolater in love and the nine bars are but nine little fagots that the flame of love utterly burns away in truth i would have taken her but what could i do the headman would have sent his men to break my head with staves i am noti was notafraid of any five men but against half a village who can prevail  therefore it was my custom these things having been arranged between us twain to go by night to the village of pateera and there we met among the crops no man knowing aught of the matter behold now i was wont to cross here skirting the jungle to the river bend where the railway bridge is and thence across the elbow of land to pateera the light of the shrine was my guide when the nights were dark that jungle near the river is very full of snakeslittle karaits that sleep on the sandand moreover her brothers would have slain me had they found me in the crops but none knewnone knew save she and i and the blown sand of the riverbed covered the track of my feet in the hot months it was an easy thing to pass from the ford to pateera and in the first rains when the river rose slowly it was an easy thing also i set the strength of my body against the strength of the stream and nightly i ate in my hut here and drank at pateera yonder she had said that one hirnam singh a thief had sought her and he was of a village up the river but on the same bank all sikhs are dogs and they have refused in their folly that good gift of godtobacco i was ready to destroy hirnam singh that ever he had come nigh her and the more because he had sworn to her that she had a lover and that he would lie in wait and give the name to the headman unless she went away with him what curs are these sikhs  after that news i swam always with a little sharp knife in my belt and evil would it have been for a man had he stayed me i knew not the face of hirnam singh but i would have killed any who came between me and her  upon a night in the beginning of the rains i was minded to go across to pateera albeit the river was angry now the nature of the barhwi is this sahib in twenty breaths it comes down from the hills a wall three feet high and i have seen it between the lighting of a fire and the cooking of a chupatty grow from a runnel to a sister of the jumna  when i left this bank there was a shoal a half mile down and i made shift to fetch it and draw breath there ere going forward for i felt the hands of the river heavy upon my heels yet what will a young man not do for loves sake there was but little light from the stars and midway to the shoal a branch of the stinking deodar tree brushed my mouth as i swam that was a sign of heavy rain in the foothills and beyond for the deodar is a strong tree not easily shaken from the hillsides i made haste the river aiding me but ere i touched the shoal the pulse of the stream beat as it were within me and around and behold the shoal was gone and i rode high on the crest of a wave that ran from bank to bank has the sahib ever been cast into much water that fights and will not let a man use his limbs to me my head upon the water it seemed as though there were naught but water to the worlds end and the river drave me with its driftwood a man is a very little thing in the belly of a flood and this flood though i knew it not was the great flood about which men talk still my liver was dissolved and i lay like a log upon my back in the fear of death there were living things in the water crying and howling grievouslybeasts of the forest and cattle and once the voice of a man asking for help but the rain came and lashed the water white and i heard no more save the roar of the boulders below and the roar of the rain above thus i was whirled downstream wrestling for the breath in me it is very hard to die when one is young can the sahib standing here see the railway bridge look there are the lights of the mailtrain going to peshawur the bridge is now twenty feet above the river but upon that night the water was roaring against the latticework and against the lattice came i feet first but much driftwood was piled there and upon the piers and i took no great hurt only the river pressed me as a strong man presses a weaker scarcely could i take hold of the latticework and crawl to the upper boom sahib the water was foaming across the rails a foot deep judge therefore what manner of flood it must have been i could not hear i could not see i could but lie on the boom and pant for breath  after a while the rain ceased and there came out in the sky certain new washed stars and by their light i saw that there was no end to the black water as far as the eye could travel and the water had risen upon the rails there were dead beasts in the driftwood on the piers and others caught by the neck in the latticework and others not yet drowned who strove to find a foothold on the latticeworkbuffaloes and kine and wild pig and deer one or two and snakes and jackals past all counting their bodies were black upon the left side of the bridge but the smaller of them were forced through the latticework and whirled downstream  thereafter the stars died and the rain came down afresh and the river rose yet more and i felt the bridge begin to stir under me as a man stirs in his sleep ere he wakes but i was not afraid sahib i swear to you that i was not afraid though i had no power in my limbs i knew that i should not die till i had seen her once more but i was very cold and i felt that the bridge must go  there was a trembling in the water such a trembling as goes before the coming of a great wave and the bridge lifted its flank to the rush of that coming so that the right lattice dipped under water and the left rose clear on my beard sahib i am speaking gods truth as a mirzapore stoneboat careens to the wind so the barhwi bridge turned thus and in no other manner  i slid from the boom into deep water and behind me came the wave of the wrath of the river i heard its voice and the scream of the middle part of the bridge as it moved from the piers and sank and i knew no more till i rose in the middle of the great flood i put forth my hand to swim and lo it fell upon the knotted hair of the head of a man he was dead for no one but i the strong one of barhwi could have lived in that race he had been dead full two days for he rode high wallowing and was an aid to me i laughed then knowing for a surety that i should yet see her and take no harm and i twisted my fingers in the hair of the man for i was far spent and together we went down the streamhe the dead and i the living lacking that help i should have sunk the cold was in my marrow and my flesh was ribbed and sodden on my bones but he had no fear who had known the uttermost of the power of the river and i let him go where he chose at last we came into the power of a sidecurrent that set to the right bank and i strove with my feet to draw with it but the dead man swung heavily in the whirl and i feared that some branch had struck him and that he would sink the tops of the tamarisk brushed my knees so i knew we were come into floodwater above the crops and after i let down my legs and felt bottomthe ridge of a fieldand after the dead man stayed upon a knoll under a figtree and i drew my body from the water rejoicing  does the sahib know whither the backwash of the flood had borne me to the knoll which is the eastern boundarymark of the village of pateera no other place i drew the dead man up on the grass for the service that he had done me and also because i knew not whether i should need him again then i went crying thrice like a jackal to the appointed place which was near the byre of the headmans house but my love was already there weeping she feared that the flood had swept my hut at the barhwi ford when i came softly through the ankledeep water she thought it was a ghost and would have fled but i put my arms round her andi was no ghost in those days though i am an old man now  ho ho dried corn in truth maize without juice ho ho footnote i grieve to say that the warden of barhwi ford is responsible here for two very bad puns in the vernacularr k  i told her the story of the breaking of the barhwi bridge and she said that i was greater than mortal man for none may cross the barhwi in full flood and i had seen what never man had seen before hand in hand we went to the knoll where the dead lay and i showed her by what help i had made the ford she looked also upon the body under the stars for the latter end of the night was clear and hid her face in her hands crying it is the body of hirnam singh i said the swine is of more use dead than living my beloved and she said surely for he has saved the dearest life in the world to my love none the less he cannot stay here for that would bring shame upon me the body was not a gunshot from her door  then said i rolling the body with my hands god hath judged between us hirnam singh that thy blood might not be upon my head now whether i have done thee a wrong in keeping thee from the burningghat do thou and the crows settle together so i cast him adrift into the floodwater and he was drawn out to the open ever wagging his thick black beard like a priest under the pulpitboard and i saw no more of himam singh  before the breaking of the day we two parted and i moved towards such of the jungle as was not flooded with the full light i saw what i had done in the darkness and the bones of my body were loosened in my flesh for there ran two kos of raging water between the village of pateera and the trees of the far bank and in the middle the piers of the barhwi bridge showed like broken teeth in the jaw of an old man nor was there any life upon the watersneither birds nor boats but only an army of drowned thingsbullocks and horses and menand the river was redder than blood from the clay of the foothills never had i seen such a floodnever since that year have i seen the likeand o sahib no man living had done what i had done there was no return for me that day not for all the lands of the headman would i venture a second time without the shield of darkness that cloaks danger i went a kos up the river to the house of a blacksmith saying that the flood had swept me from my hut and they gave me food seven days i stayed with the blacksmith till a boat came and i returned to my house there was no trace of wall or roof or floornaught but a patch of slimy mud judge therefore sahib how far the river must have risen  it was written that i should not die either in my house or in the heart of the barhwi or under the wreck of the barhwi bridge for god sent down hirnam singh two days dead though i know not how the man died to be my buoy and support hirnam singh has been in hell these twenty years and the thought of that night must be the flower of his torment  listen sahib the river has changed its voice it is going to sleep before the dawn to which there is yet one hour with the light it will come down afresh how do i know have i been here thirty years without knowing the voice of the river as a father knows the voice of his son every moment it is talking less angrily i swear that there will be no danger for one hour or perhaps two i cannot answer for the morning be quick sahib i will call ram pershad and he will not turn back this time is the paulin tightly corded upon all the baggage ohe mahout with a mud head the elephant for the sahib and tell them on the far side that there will be no crossing after daylight  money nay sahib i am not of that kind no not even to give sweetmeats to the babyfolk my house look you is empty and i am an old man  dutt ram pershad dutt dutt dutt good luck go with you sahib     the sending of dana da  when the devil rides on your chest remember the chamar         native proverb  once upon a time some people in india made a new heaven and a new earth out of broken teacups a missing brooch or two and a hairbrush these were hidden under bushes or stuffed into holes in the hillside and an entire civil service of subordinate gods used to find or mend them again and every one said there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy several other things happened also but the religion never seemed to get much beyond its first manifestations though it added an airline postal service and orchestral effects in order to keep abreast of the tunes and choke off competition  this religion was too elastic for ordinary use it stretched itself and embraced pieces of everything that the medicinemen of all ages have manufactured it approved of and stole from freemasonry looted the latterday rosicrucians of half their pet words took any fragments of egyptian philosophy that it found in the encyclopaedia britannica annexed as many of the vedas as had been translated into french or english and talked of all the rest built in the german versions of what is left of the zend avesta encouraged white gray and black magic including spiritualism palmistry fortunetelling by cards hot chestnuts doublekernelled nuts and tallow droppings would have adopted voodoo and oboe had it known anything about them and showed itself in every way one of the most accommodating arrangements that had ever been invented since the birth of the sea  when it was in thorough working order with all the machinery down to the subscriptions complete dana da came from nowhere with nothing in his hands and wrote a chapter in its history which has hitherto been unpublished he said that his first name was dana and his second was da now setting aside dana of the new york sun dana is a bhil name and da fits no native of india unless you except the bengali de as the original spelling da is lap or finnish and dana da was neither finn chin bhil bengali lap nair gond romaney magh bokhariot kurd armenian levantine jew persian punjabi madrasi parsee nor anything else known to ethnologists he was simply dana da and declined to give further information for the sake of brevity and as roughly indicating his origin he was called the native he might have been the original old man of the mountains who is said to be the only authorised head of the teacup creed some people said that he was but dana da used to smile and deny any connection with the cult explaining that he was an independent experimenter  as i have said he came from nowhere with his hands behind his back and studied the creed for three weeks sitting at the feet of those best competent to explain its mysteries then he laughed aloud and went away but the laugh might have been either of devotion or derision  when he returned he was without money but his pride was unabated he declared that he knew more about the things in heaven and earth than those who taught him and for this contumacy was abandoned altogether  his next appearance in public life was at a big cantonment in upper india and he was then telling fortunes with the help of three leaden dice a very dirty old cloth and a little tin box of opium pills he told better fortunes when he was allowed half a bottle of whiskey but the things which he invented on the opium were quite worth the money he was in reduced circumstances among other peoples he told the fortune of an englishman who had once been interested in the simla creed but who later on had married and forgotten all his old knowledge in the study of babies and things the englishman allowed dana da to tell a fortune for charitys sake and gave him five rupees a dinner and some old clothes when he had eaten dana da professed gratitude and asked if there were anything he could do for his hostin the esoteric line  is there any one that you love said dana da the englishman loved his wife but had no desire to drag her name into the conversation he therefore shook his head  is there any one that you hate said dana da the englishman said that there were several men whom he hated deeply  very good said dana da upon whom the whiskey and the opium were beginning to tell only give me their names and i will despatch a sending to them and kill them  now a sending is a horrible arrangement first invented they say in iceland it is a thing sent by a wizard and may take any form but most generally wanders about the land in the shape of a little purple cloud till it finds the sendee and him it kills by changing into the form of a horse or a cat or a man without a face it is not strictly a native patent though chamars of the skin and hide castes can if irritated despatch a sending which sits on the breast of their enemy by night and nearly kills him very few natives care to irritate chamars for this reason  let me despatch a sending said dana da i am nearly dead now with want and drink and opium but i should like to kill a man before i die i can send a sending anywhere you choose and in any form except in the shape of a man  the englishman had no friends that he wished to kill but partly to soothe dana da whose eyes were rolling and partly to see what would be done he asked whether a modified sending could not be arranged for such a sending as should make a mans life a burden to him and yet do him no harm if this were possible he notified his willingness to give dana da ten rupees for the job  i am not what i was once said dana da and i must take the money because i am poor to what englishman shall i send it  send a sending to lone sahib said the englishman naming a man who had been most bitter in rebuking him for his apostasy from the teacup creed dana da laughed and nodded  i could have chosen no better man myself said he i will see that he finds the sending about his path and about his bed  he lay down on the hearthrug turned up the whites of his eyes shivered all over and began to snort this was magic or opium or the sending or all three when he opened his eyes he vowed that the sending had started upon the warpath and was at that moment flying up to the town where lone sahib lives  give me my ten rupees said dana da wearily and write a letter to lone sahib telling him and all who believe with him that you and a friend are using a power greater than theirs they will see that you are speaking the truth  he departed unsteadily with the promise of some more rupees if anything came of the sending  the englishman sent a letter to lone sahib couched in what he remembered of the terminology of the creed he wrote i also in the days of what you held to be my backsliding have obtained enlightenment and with enlightenment has come power then he grew so deeply mysterious that the recipient of the letter could make neither head nor tail of it and was proportionately impressed for he fancied that his friend had become a fifthrounder when a man is a fifthrounder he can do more than slade and houdin combined  lone sahib read the letter in five different fashions and was beginning a sixth interpretation when his bearer dashed in with the news that there was a cat on the bed now if there was one thing that lone sahib hated more than another it was a cat he scolded the bearer for not turning it out of the house the bearer said that he was afraid all the doors of the bedroom had been shut throughout the morning and no real cat could possibly have entered the room he would prefer not to meddle with the creature  lone sahib entered the room gingerly and there on the pillow of his bed sprawled and whimpered a wee white kitten not a jumpsome frisky little beast but a sluglike crawler with its eyes barely opened and its paws lacking strength or directiona kitten that ought to have been in a basket with its mamma lone sahib caught it by the scruff of its neck handed it over to the sweeper to be drowned and fined the bearer four annas  that evening as he was reading in his room he fancied that he saw something moving about on the hearthrug outside the circle of light from his readinglamp when the thing began to myowl he realised that it was a kittena wee white kitten nearly blind and very miserable he was seriously angry and spoke bitterly to his bearer who said that there was no kitten in the room when he brought in the lamp and real kittens of tender age generally had mothercats in attendance  if the presence will go out into the veranda and listen said the bearer he will hear no cats how therefore can the kitten on the bed and the kitten on the hearthrug be real kittens  lone sahib went out to listen and the bearer followed him but there was no sound of any one mewing for her children he returned to his room having hurled the kitten down the hillside and wrote out the incidents of the day for the benefit of his coreligionists those people were so absolutely free from superstition that they ascribed anything a little out of the common to agencies as it was their business to know all about the agencies they were on terms of almost indecent familiarity with manifestations of every kind their letters dropped from the ceilingunstampedand spirits used to squatter up and down their staircases all night but they had never come into contact with kittens lone sahib wrote out the facts noting the hour and the minute as every psychical observer is bound to do and appending the englishmans letter because it was the most mysterious document and might have had a bearing upon anything in this world or the next an outsider would have translated all the tangle thus look out you laughed at me once and now i am going to make you sit up  lone sahibs coreligionists found that meaning in it but their translation was refined and full of foursyllable words they held a sederunt and were filled with tremulous joy for in spite of their familiarity with all the other worlds and cycles they had a very human awe of things sent from ghostland they met in lone sahibs room in shrouded and sepulchral gloom and their conclave was broken up by a clinking among the photoframes on the mantelpiece a wee white kitten nearly blind was looping and writhing itself between the clock and the candlesticks that stopped all investigations or doublings here was the manifestation in the flesh it was so far as could be seen devoid of purpose but it was a manifestation of undoubted authenticity  they drafted a round robin to the englishman the backslider of old days adjuring him in the interests of the creed to explain whether there was any connection between the embodiment of some egyptian god or other i have forgotten the name and his communication they called the kitten ra or toth or tum or something and when lone sahib confessed that the first one had at his most misguided instance been drowned by the sweeper they said consolingly that in his next life he would be a bounder and not even a rounder of the lowest grade these words may not be quite correct but they accurately express the sense of the house  when the englishman received the round robinit came by posthe was startled and bewildered he sent into the bazar for dana da who read the letter and laughed that is my sending said he i told you i would work well now give me another ten rupees  but what in the world is this gibberish about egyptian gods asked the englishman  cats said dana da with a hiccough for he had discovered the englishmans whiskey bottle cats and cats and cats never was such a sending a hundred of cats now give me ten more rupees and write as i dictate  dana das letter was a curiosity it bore the englishmans signature and hinted at catsat a sending of cats the mere words on paper were creepy and uncanny to behold  what have you done though said the englishman i am as much in the dark as ever do you mean to say that you can actually send this absurd sending you talk about  judge for yourself said dana da what does that letter mean in a little time they will all be at my feet and yours and io glorywill be drugged or drunk all daylong  dana da knew his people  when a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast or puts his hand into his ulsterpocket and finds a little halfdead kitten where his gloves should be or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dressshirts or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh strapped on his saddlebow and shakes a little squawling kitten from its folds when he opens it or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt or wriggling among his boots or hanging head downwards in his tobaccojar or being mangled by his terrier in the verandawhen such a man finds one kitten neither more nor less once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be he is naturally upset when he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a manifestation an emissary an embodiment and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature he is more than upset he is actually distressed some of lone sahibs coreligionists thought that he was a highly favoured individual but many said that if he had treated the first kitten with proper respectas suited a othratumsennacherib embodimentall this trouble would have been averted they compared him to the ancient mariner but none the less they were proud of him and proud of the englishman who had sent the manifestation they did not call it a sending because icelandic magic was not in their programme  after sixteen kittens that is to say after one fortnight for there were three kittens on the first day to impress the fact of the sending the whole camp was uplifted by a letterit came flying through a windowfrom the old man of the mountainsthe head of all the creedexplaining the manifestation in the most beautiful language and soaking up all the credit of it for himself the englishman said the letter was not there at all he was a backslider without power or asceticism who couldnt even raise a table by force of volition much less project an army of kittens through space the entire arrangement said the letter was strictly orthodox worked and sanctioned by the highest authorities within the pale of the creed there was great joy at this for some of the weaker brethren seeing that an outsider who had been working on independent lines could create kittens whereas their own rulers had never gone beyond crockeryand broken at bestwere showing a desire to break line on their own trail in fact there was the promise of a schism a second round robin was drafted to the englishman beginning o scoffer and ending with a selection of curses from the rites of mizraim and memphis and the commination of jugana who was a fifthrounder upon whose name an upstart thirdrounder once traded a papal excommunication is a billetdoux compared to the commination of jugana the englishman had been proved under the hand and seal of the old man of the mountains to have appropriated virtue and pretended to have power which in reality belonged only to the supreme head naturally the round robin did not spare him  he handed the letter to dana da to translate into decent english the effect on dana da was curious at first he was furiously angry and then he laughed for five minutes  i had thought he saidthat they would have come to me in another week i would have shown that i sent the sending and they would have discrowned the old man of the mountains who has sent this sending of mine do you do nothing the time has come for me to act write as i dictate and i will put them to shame but give me ten more rupees  at dana das dictation the englishman wrote nothing less than a formal challenge to the old man of the mountains it wound up and if this manifestation be from your hand then let it go forward but if it be from my hand i will that the sending shall cease in two days time in that day there shall be twelve kittens and thenceforward none at all the people shall judge between us this was signed by dana da who added pentacles and pentagrams and a crux ansata and half a dozen swastikas and a triple tau to his name just to show that he was all he laid claim to be  the challenge was read out to the gentlemen and ladies and they remembered then that dana da had laughed at them some years ago it was officially announced that the old man of the mountains would treat the matter with contempt dana da being an independent investigator without a single round at the back of him but this did not soothe his people they wanted to see a fight they were very human for all their spirituality lone sahib who was really being worn out with kittens submitted meekly to his fate he felt that he was being kittened to prove the power of dana da as the poet says  when the stated day dawned the shower of kittens began some were white and some were tabby and all were about the same loathsome age three were on his hearthrug three in his bathroom and the other six turned up at intervals among the visitors who came to see the prophecy break down never was a more satisfactory sending on the next day there were no kittens and the next day and all the other days were kittenless and quiet the people murmured and looked to the old man of the mountains for an explanation a letter written on a palmleaf dropped from the ceiling but every one except lone sahib felt that letters were not what the occasion demanded there should have been cats there should have been catsfullgrown ones the letter proved conclusively that there had been a hitch in the psychic current which colliding with a dual identity had interfered with the percipient activity all along the main line the kittens were still going on but owing to some failure in the developing fluid they were not materialised the air was thick with letters for a few days afterwards unseen hands played gluck and beethoven on fingerbowls and clockshades but all men felt that psychic life was a mockery without materialised kittens even lone sahib shouted with the majority on this head dana das letters were very insulting and if he had then offered to lead a new departure there is no knowing what might not have happened  but dana da was dying of whiskey and opium in the englishmans godown and had small heart for honours  they have been put to shame said he never was such a sending it has killed me  nonsense said the englishman you are going to die dana da and that sort of stuff must be left behind ill admit that you have made some queer things come about tell me honestly now how was it done  give me ten more rupees said dana da faintly and if i die before i spend them bury them with me the silver was counted out while dana da was fighting with death his hand closed upon the money and he smiled a grim smile  bend low he whispered the englishman bent  bunniamissionschoolexpelledboxwallah peddlerceylon pearlmerchantall mine english educationoutcasted and made up name

man very few kittens now in the bazar ask lone sahibs sweepers wife  so saying dana da gasped and passed away into a land where if all be true there are no materialisations and the making of new creeds is discouraged  but consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all     on the city wall  then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the townwall and she dwelt upon the wall     joshua ii 15  lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world lilith was her verygreatgrandmamma and that was before the days of eve as every one knows in the west people say rude things about laluns profession and write lectures about it and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that morality may be preserved in the east where the profession is hereditary descending from mother to daughter nobody writes lectures or takes any notice and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the east to manage its own affairs  laluns real husband for even ladies of laluns profession in the east must have husbands was a big jujubetree her mamma who had married a figtree spent ten thousand rupees on laluns wedding which was blessed by fortyseven clergymen of mammas church and distributed five thousand rupees in charity to the poor and that was the custom of the land the advantages of having a jujubetree for a husband are obvious you cannot hurt his feelings and he looks imposing  laluns husband stood on the plain outside the city walls and laluns house was upon the east wall facing the river if you fell from the broad windowseat you dropped thirty feet sheer into the city ditch but if you stayed where you should and looked forth you saw all the cattle of the city being driven down to water the students of the government college playing cricket the high grass and trees that fringed the riverbank the great sand bars that ribbed the river the red tombs of dead emperors beyond the river and very far away through the blue heathaze a glint of the snows of the himalayas  wali dad used to lie in the windowseat for hours at a time watching this view he was a young muhammadan who was suffering acutely from education of the english variety and knew it his father had sent him to a missionschool to get wisdom and wali dad had absorbed more than ever his father or the missionaries intended he should when his father died wali dad was independent and spent two years experimenting with the creeds of the earth and reading books that are of no use to anybody  after he had made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the roman catholic church and the presbyterian fold at the same time the missionaries found him out and called him names but they did not understand his trouble he discovered lalun on the city wall and became the most constant of her few admirers he possessed a head that english artists at home would rave over and paint amid impossible surroundingsa face that female novelists would use with delight through nine hundred pages in reality he was only a cleanbred young muhammadan with pencilled eyebrows smallcut nostrils little feet and hands and a very tired look in his eyes by virtue of his twentytwo years he had grown a neat black beard which he stroked with pride and kept delicately scented his life seemed to be divided between borrowing books from me and making love to lalun in the windowseat he composed songs about her and some of the songs are sting to this day in the city from the street of the muttonbutchers to the coppersmiths ward  one song the prettiest of all says that the beauty of lalun was so great that it troubled the hearts of the british government and caused them to lose their peace of mind that is the way the song is sung in the streets but if you examine it carefully and know the key to the explanation you will find that there are three puns in iton beauty heart and peace of mindso that it runs by the subtlety of lalun the administration of the government was troubled and it lost such and such a man when wali dad sings that song his eyes glow like hot coals and lalun leans back among the cushions and throws bunches of jasminebuds at wali dad  but first it is necessary to explain something about the supreme government which is above all and below all and behind all gentlemen come from england spend a few weeks in india walk round this great sphinx of the plains and write books upon its ways and its works denouncing or praising it as their own ignorance prompts consequently all the world knows how the supreme government conducts itself but no one not even the supreme government knows everything about the administration of the empire year by year england sends out fresh drafts for the first fightingline which is officially called the indian civil service these die or kill themselves by overwork or are worried to death or broken in health and hope in order that the land may be protected from death and sickness famine and war and may eventually become capable of standing alone it will never stand alone but the idea is a pretty one and men are willing to die for it and yearly the work of pushing and coaxing and scolding and petting the country into good living goes forward if an advance be made all credit is given to the native while the englishmen stand back and wipe their foreheads if a failure occurs the englishmen step forward and take the blame overmuch tenderness of this kind has bred a strong belief among many natives that the native is capable of administering the country and many devout englishmen believe this also because the theory is stated in beautiful english with all the latest political colour  there be other men who though uneducated see visions and dream dreams and they too hope to administer the country in their own waythat is to say with a garnish of red sauce such men must exist among two hundred million people and if they are not attended to may cause trouble and even break the great idol called pax britannic which as the newspapers say lives between peshawur and cape comorin were the day of doom to dawn tomorrow you would find the supreme government taking measures to allay popular excitement and putting guards upon the graveyards that the dead might troop forth orderly the youngest civilian would arrest gabriel on his own responsibility if the archangel could not produce a deputy commissioners permission to make music or other noises as the license says  whence it is easy to see that mere men of the flesh who would create a tumult must fare badly at the hands of the supreme government and they do there is no outward sign of excitement there is no confusion there is no knowledge when due and sufficient reasons have been given weighed and approved the machinery moves forward and the dreamer of dreams and the seer of visions is gone from his friends and following he enjoys the hospitality of government there is no restriction upon his movements within certain limits but he must not confer any more with his brother dreamers once in every six months the supreme government assures itself that he is well and takes formal acknowledgment of his existence no one protests against this detention because the few people who know about it are in deadly fear of seeming to know him and never a single newspaper takes up his case or organises demonstrations on his behalf because the newspapers of india have got behind that lying proverb which says the pen is mightier than the sword and can walk delicately  so now you know as much as you ought about wali dad the educational mixture and the supreme government  lalun has not yet been described she would need so wali dad says a thousand pens of gold and ink scented with musk she has been variously compared to the moon the dil sagar lake a spotted quail a gazelle the sun on the desert of kutch the dawn the stars and the young bamboo these comparisons imply that she is beautiful exceedingly according to the native standards which are practically the same as those of the west her eyes are black and her hair is black and her eyebrows are black as leeches her mouth is tiny and says witty things her hands are tiny and have saved much money her feet are tiny and have trodden on the naked hearts of many men but as wali dad sings lalun is lalun and when you have said that you have only come to the beginnings of knowledge  the little house on the city wall was just big enough to hold lalun and her maid and a pussycat with a silver collar a big pink and blue cutglass chandelier hung from the ceiling of the reception room a petty nawab had given lalun the horror and she kept it for politeness sake the floor of the room was of polished chunam white as curds a latticed window of carved wood was set in one wall there was a profusion of squabby pluffy cushions and fat carpets everywhere and laluns silver huqa studded with turquoises had a special little carpet all to its shining self wali dad was nearly as permanent a fixture as the chandelier as i have said he lay in the windowseat and meditated on life and death and lalunspecially lalun the feet of the young men of the city tended to her doorways and thenretired for lalun was a particular maiden slow of speech reserved of mind and not in the least inclined to orgies which were nearly certain to end in strife if i am of no value i am unworthy of this honour said lalun if i am of value they are unworthy of me and that was a crooked sentence  in the long hot nights of latter april and may all the city seemed to assemble in laluns little white room to smoke and to talk shiahs of the grimmest and most uncompromising persuasion sufis who had lost all belief in the prophet and retained but little in god wandering hindu priests passing southward on their way to the central india fairs and other affairs pundits in black gowns with spectacles on their noses and undigested wisdom in their insides bearded headmen of the wards sikhs with all the details of the latest ecclesiastical scandal in the golden temple redeyed priests from beyond the border looking like trapped wolves and talking like ravens m as of the university very superior and very volubleall these people and more also you might find in the white room wali dad lay in the windowseat and listened to the talk  it is laluns salon said wali dad to me and it is electicis not that the word outside of a freemasons lodge i have never seen such gatherings there i dined once with a jewa yahoudi he spat into the city ditch with apologies for allowing national feelings to overcome him though i have lost every belief in the world said he and try to be proud of my losing i cannot help hating a jew lalun admits no jews here  but what in the world do all these men do i asked  the curse of our country said wali dad they talk it is like the atheniansalways hearing and telling some new thing ask the pearl and she will show you how much she knows of the news of the city and the province lalun knows everything  lalun i said at randomshe was talking to a gentleman of the kurd persuasion who had come in from godknowswherewhen does the 175th regiment go to agra  it does not go at all said lalun without turning her head they have ordered the 118th to go in its stead that regiment goes to lucknow in three months unless they give a fresh order  that is so said wali dad without a shade of doubt can you with your telegrams and your newspapers do better always hearing and telling some new thing he went on my friend has your god ever smitten a european nation for gossiping in the bazars india has gossiped for centuriesalways standing in the bazars until the soldiers go by thereforeyou are here today instead of starving in your own country and i am not a muhammadani am a producta demnition product that also i owe to you and yours that i cannot make an end to my sentence without quoting from your authors he pulled at the huqa and mourned half feelingly half in earnest for the shattered hopes of his youth wali dad was always mourning over something or otherthe country of which he despaired or the creed in which he had lost faith or the life of the english which he could by no means understand  lalun never mourned she played little songs on the sitar and to hear her sing o peacock cry again was always a fresh pleasure she knew all the songs that have ever been sung from the warsongs of the south that make the old men angry with the young men and the young men angry with the state to the lovesongs of the north where the swords whinnywhicker like angry kites in the pauses between the kisses and the passes fill with armed men and the lover is torn from his beloved and cries ai ai ai evermore she knew how to make up tobacco for the huqa so that it smelt like the gates of paradise and wafted you gently through them she could embroider strange things in gold and silver and dance softly with the moonlight when it came in at the window also she knew the hearts of men and the heart of the city and whose wives were faithful and whose untrue and more of the secrets of the government offices than are good to be set down in this place nasiban her maid said that her jewellery was worth ten thousand pounds and that some night a thief would enter and murder her for its possession but lalun said that all the city would tear that thief limb from limb and that he whoever he was knew it  so she took her sitar and sat in the windowseat and sang a song of old days that had been sung by a girl of her profession in an armed camp on the eve of a great battlethe day before the fords of the jumna ran red and sivaji fled fifty miles to delhi with a toorkh stallion at his horses tail and another lalun on his saddlebow it was what men call a mahratta laonee and it said    their warrior forces chimajee   before the peishwa led   the children of the sun and fire   behind him turned and fled  and the chorus said    with them there fought who rides so free   with a sword and turban red   the warrioryouth who earns his fee   at peril of his head  at peril of his head said wali dad in english to me thanks to your government all our heads are protected and with the educational facilities at my commandhis eyes twinkled wickedlyi might be a distinguished member of the local administration perhaps in time i might even be a member of a legislative council  dont speak english said lalun bending over her sitar afresh the chorus went out from the city wall to the blackened wall of fort amara which dominates the city no man knows the precise extent of fort amara three kings built it hundreds of years ago and they say that there are miles of underground rooms beneath its walls it is peopled with many ghosts a detachment of garrison artillery and a company of infantry in its prime it held ten thousand men and filled its ditches with corpses  at peril of his head sang lalun again and again  a head moved on one of the rampartsthe gray head of an old manand a voice rough as sharkskin on a swordhilt sent back the last line of the chorus and broke into a song that i could not understand though lalun and wali dad listened intently  what is it i asked who is it  a consistent man said wali dad he fought you in 46 when he was a warrioryouth refought you in 57 and he tried to fight you in 71 but you had learned the trick of blowing men from guns too well now he is old but he would still fight if he could  is he a wahabi then why should he answer to a mahratta laonee if he be wahabior sikh said i  i do not know said wali dad he has lost perhaps his religion perhaps he wishes to be a king perhaps he is a king i do not know his name  that is a lie wali dad if you know his career you must know his name  that is quite true i belong to a nation of liars i would rather not tell you his name think for yourself  lalun finished her song pointed to the fort and said simply khem singh  hm said wali dad if the pearl chooses to tell you the pearl is a fool  i translated to lalun who laughed i choose to tell what i choose to tell they kept khem singh in burma said she they kept him there for many years until his mind was changed in him so great was the kindness of the government finding this they sent him back to his own country that he might look upon it before he died he is an old man but when he looks upon this country his memory will come moreover there be many who remember him  he is an interesting survival said wali dad pulling at the huqa he returns to a country now full of educational and political reform but as the pearl says there are many who remember him he was once a great man there will never be any more great men in india they will all when they are boys go whoring after strange gods and they will become citizensfellowcitizensillustrious fellowcitizens what is it that the native papers call them  wali dad seemed to be in a very bad temper lalun looked out of the window and smiled into the dusthaze i went away thinking about khem singh who had once made history with a thousand followers and would have been a princeling but for the power of the supreme government aforesaid  the senior captain commanding fort amara was away on leave but the subaltern his deputy had drifted down to the club where i found him and enquired of him whether it was really true that a political prisoner had been added to the attractions of the fort the subaltern explained at great length for this was the first time that he had held command of the fort and his glory lay heavy upon him  yes said he a man was sent in to me about a week ago from down the linea thorough gentleman whoever he is of course i did all i could for him he had his two servants and some silver cookingpots and he looked for all the world like a native officer i called him subadar sahib just as well to be on the safe side yknow look here subadar sahib i said youre handed over to my authority and im supposed to guard you now i dont want to make your life hard but you must make things easy for me all the fort is at your disposal from the flagstaff to the dry ditch and i shall be happy to entertain you in any way i can but you mustnt take advantage of it give me your word that you wont try to escape subadar sahib and ill give you my word that you shall have no heavy guard put over you i thought the best way of getting at him was by going at him straight yknow and it was by jove the old man gave me his word and moved about the fort as contented as a sick crow hes a rummy chapalways asking to be told where he is and what the buildings about him are i had to sign a slip of blue paper when he turned up acknowledging receipt of his body and all that and im responsible yknow that he doesnt get away queer thing though looking after a johnnie old enough to be your grandfather isnt it come to the fort one of these days and see him  for reasons which will appear i never went to the fort while khem singh was then within its walls i knew him only as a gray head seen from laluns windowa gray head and a harsh voice but natives told me that day by day as he looked upon the fair lands round amara his memory came back to him and with it the old hatred against the government that had been nearly effaced in faroff burma so he raged up and down the west face of the fort from morning till noon and from evening till the night devising vain things in his heart and croaking warsongs when lalun sang on the city wall as he grew more acquainted with the subaltern he unburdened his old heart of some of the passions that had withered it sahib he used to say tapping his stick against the parapet when i was a young man i was one of twenty thousand horsemen who came out of the city and rode round the plain here sahib i was the leader of a hundred then of a thousand then of five thousand and nowhe pointed to his two servants but from the beginning to today i would cut the throats of all the sahibs in the land if i could hold me fast sahib lest i get away and return to those who would follow me i forgot them when i was in burma but now that i am in my own country again i remember everything  do you remember that you have given me your honour not to make your tendance a hard matter said the subaltern  yes to you only to you sahib said khem singh to you because you are of a pleasant countenance if my turn comes again sahib i will not hang you nor cut your throat  thank you said the subaltern gravely as he looked along the line of guns that could pound the city to powder in half an hour let us go into our own quarters khem singh come and talk with me after dinner  khem singh would sit on his own cushion at the subalterns feet drinking heavy scented aniseseed brandy in great gulps and telling strange stories of fort amara which had been a palace in the old days of begums and ranees tortured to deathaye in the very vaulted chamber that now served as a messroom would tell stories of sobraon that made the subalterns cheeks flush and tingle with pride of race and of the kuka rising from which so much was expected and the foreknowledge of which was shared by a hundred thousand souls but he never told tales of 57 because as he said he was the subalterns guest and 57 is a year that no man black or white cares to speak of once only when the aniseseed brandy had slightly affected his head he said sahib speaking now of a matter which lay between sobraon and the affair of the kukas it was ever a wonder to us that you stayed your hand at all and that having stayed it you did not make the land one prison now i hear from without that you do great honour to all men of our country and by your own hands are destroying the terror of your name which is your strong rock and defence this is a foolish thing will oil and water mix now in 57  i was not born then subadar sahib said the subaltern and khem singh reeled to his quarters  the subaltern would tell me of these conversations at the club and my desire to see khem singh increased but wali dad sitting in the windowseat of the house on the city wall said that it would be a cruel thing to do and lalun pretended that i preferred the society of a grizzled old sikh to hers  here is tobacco here is talk here are many friends and all the news of the city and above all here is myself i will tell you stories and sing you songs and wali dad will talk his english nonsense in your ears is that worse than watching the caged animal yonder go tomorrow then if you must but today such and such an one will be here and he will speak of wonderful things  it happened that tomorrow never came and the warm heat of the latter rains gave place to the chill of early october almost before i was aware of the flight of the year the captain commanding the fort returned from leave and took over charge of khem singh according to the laws of seniority the captain was not a nice man he called all natives niggers which besides being extreme bad form shows gross ignorance  whats the use of telling off two tommies to watch that old nigger said he  i fancy it soothes his vanity said the subaltern the men are ordered to keep well out of his way but he takes them as a tribute to his importance poor old wretch  i wont have line men taken off regular guards in this way put on a couple of native infantry  sikhs said the subaltern lifting his eyebrows  sikhs pathans dograstheyre all alike these black vermin and the captain talked to khem singh in a manner which hurt that old gentlemans feelings fifteen years before when he had been caught for the second time every one looked upon him as a sort of tiger he liked being regarded in this light but he forgot that the world goes forward in fifteen years and many subalterns are promoted to captaincies  the captainpig is in charge of the fort said khem singh to his native guard every morning and the native guard said yes subadar sahib in deference to his age and his air of distinction but they did not know who he was  in those days the gathering in laluns little white room was always large and talked more than before  the greeks said wali dad who had been borrowing my books the inhabitants of the city of athens where they were always hearing and telling some new thing rigorously secluded their womenwho were fools hence the glorious institution of the heterodox womenis it notwho were amusing and not fools all the greek philosophers delighted in their company tell me my friend how it goes now in greece and the other places upon the continent of europe are your womenfolk also fools  wali dad i said you never speak to us about your womenfolk and we never speak about ours to you that is the bar between us  yes said wali dad it is curious to think that our common meetingplace should be here in the house of a commonhow do you call her he pointed with the pipemouth to lalun  lalun is nothing but lalun i said and that was perfectly true but if you took your place in the world wali dad and gave up dreaming dreams  i might wear an english coat and trouser i might be a leading muhammadan pleader i might be received even at the commissioners tennisparties where the english stand on one side and the natives on the other in order to promote social intercourse throughout the empire hearts heart said he to lalun quicklythe sahib says that i ought to quit you  the sahib is always talking stupid talk returned lalun with a laugh in this house i am a queen and thou art a king the sahibshe put her arms above her head and thought for a momentthe sahib shall be our vizierthine and mine wali dadbecause he has said that thou shouldst leave me  wali dad laughed immoderately and i laughed too be it so said he my friend are you willing to take this lucrative government appointment lalun what shall his pay be  but lalun began to sing and for the rest of the time there was no hope of getting a sensible answer from her or wali dad when the one stopped the other began to quote persian poetry with a triple pun in every other line some of it was not strictly proper but it was all very funny and it only came to an end when a fat person in black with gold pincenez sent up his name to lalun and wali dad dragged me into the twinkling night to walk in a big rosegarden and talk heresies about religion and governments and a mans career in life  the mohurrum the great mourningfestival of the muhammadans was close at hand and the things that wali dad said about religious fanaticism would have secured his expulsion from the loosestthinking muslim sect there were the rosebushes round us the stars above us and from every quarter of the city came the boom of the big mohurrum drums you must know that the city is divided in fairly equal proportions between the hindus and the musalmans and where both creeds belong to the fighting races a big religious festival gives ample chance for trouble when they canthat is to say when the authorities are weak enough to allow itthe hindus do their best to arrange some minor feastday of their own in time to clash with the period of general mourning for the martyrs hasan and hussain the heroes of the mohurrum gilt and painted paper presentations of their tombs are borne with shouting and wailing music torches and yells through the principal thoroughfares of the city which fakements are called tazias their passage is rigorously laid down beforehand by the police and detachments of police accompany each tazia lest the hindus should throw bricks at it and the peace of the queen and the heads of her loyal subjects should thereby be broken mohurrum time in a fighting town means anxiety to all the officials because if a riot breaks out the officials and not the rioters are held responsible the former must foresee everything and while not making their precautions ridiculously elaborate must see that they are at least adequate  listen to the drums said wali dad that is the heart of the peopleempty and making much noise how think you will the mohurrum go this year i think that there will be trouble  he turned down a sidestreet and left me alone with the stars and a sleepy police patrol then i went to bed and dreamed that wali dad had sacked the city and i was made vizier with laluns silver huqa for mark of office  all day the mohurrum drums beat in the city and all day deputations of tearful hindu gentlemen besieged the deputy commissioner with assurances that they would be murdered ere next dawning by the muhammadans which said the deputy commissioner in confidence to the head of police is a pretty fair indication that the hindus are going to make emselves unpleasant i think we can arrange a little surprise for them i have given the heads of both creeds fair warning if they choose to disregard it so much the worse for them  there was a large gathering in laluns house that night but of men that i had never seen before if i except the fat gentleman in black with the gold pincenez wali dad lay in the windowseat more bitterly scornful of his faith and its manifestations than i had ever known him laluns maid was very busy cutting up and mixing tobacco for the guests we could hear the thunder of the drums as the processions accompanying each tazia marched to the central gatheringplace in the plain outside the city preparatory to their triumphant reentry and circuit within the walls all the streets seemed ablaze with torches and only fort amara was black and silent  when the noise of the drums ceased no one in the white room spoke for a time the first tazia has moved off said wali dad looking to the plain  that is very early said the man with the pincenez  it is only halfpast eight the company rose and departed  some of them were men from ladakh said lalun when the last had gone they brought me bricktea such as the russians sell and a teaurn from peshawur show me now how the english memsahibs make tea  the bricktea was abominable when it was finished wali dad suggested going into the streets i am nearly sure that there will be trouble tonight he said all the city thinks so and vox populi is vox dei as the babus say now i tell you that at the corner of the padshahi gate you will find my horse all this night if you want to go about and to see things it is a most disgraceful exhibition where is the pleasure of saying ya hasan ya hussain twenty thousand times in a night  all the processionsthere were two and twenty of themwere now well within the city walls the drums were beating afresh the crowd were howling ya hasan ya hussain and beating their breasts the brass bands were playing their loudest and at every corner where space allowed muhammadan preachers were telling the lamentable story of the death of the martyrs it was impossible to move except with the crowd for the streets were not more than twenty feet wide in the hindu quarters the shutters of all the shops were up and crossbarred as the first tazia a gorgeous erection ten feet high was borne aloft on the shoulders of a score of stout men into the semidarkness of the gully of the horsemen a brickbat crashed through its talc and tinsel sides  into thy hands o lord murmured wali dad profanely as a yell went up from behind and a native officer of police jammed his horse through the crowd another brickbat followed and the tazia staggered and swayed where it had stopped  go on in the name of the sirkar go forward shouted the policeman but there was an ugly cracking and splintering of shutters and the crowd halted with oaths and growlings before the house whence the brickbat had been thrown  then without any warning broke the stormnot only in the gully of the horsemen but in half a dozen other places the tazias rocked like ships at sea the long poletorches dipped and rose round them while the men shouted the hindus are dishonouring the tazias strike strike into their temples for the faith the six or eight policemen with each tazia drew their batons and struck as long as they could in the hope of forcing the mob forward but they were overpowered and as contingents of hindus poured into the streets the fight became general half a mile away where the tazias were yet untouched the drums and the shrieks of ya hasanl ya hussain continued but not for long the priests at the corners of the streets knocked the legs from the bedsteads that supported their pulpits and smote for the faith while stones fell from the silent houses upon friend and foe and the packed streets bellowed din din din a tazia caught fire and was dropped for a flaming barrier between hindu and musalman at the corner of the gully then the crowd surged forward and wali dad drew me close to the stone pillar of a well  it was intended from the beginning he shouted in my ear with more heat than blank unbelief should be guilty of the bricks were carried up to the houses beforehand these swine of hindus we shall be gutting kine in their temples tonight  tazia after tazia some burning others torn to pieces hurried past us and the mob with them howling shrieking and striking at the house doors in their flight at last we saw the reason of the rush hugonin the assistant district superintendent of police a boy of twenty had got together thirty constables and was forcing the crowd through the streets his old gray policehorse showed no sign of uneasiness as it was spurred breaston into the crowd and the long dogwhip with which he had armed himself was never still  they know we havent enough police to hold em he cried as he passed me mopping a cut on his face they know we havent arent any of the men from the club coming down to help get on you sons of burnt fathers the dogwhip cracked across the writhing backs and the constables smote afresh with baton and gunbutt with these passed the lights and the shouting and wali dad began to swear under his breath from fort amara shot up a single rocket then two side by side it was the signal for troops  petitt the deputy commissioner covered with dust and sweat but calm and gently smiling cantered up the cleanswept street in rear of the main body of the rioters no one killed yet he shouted ill keep em on the run till dawn dont let em halt hugonin trot em about till the troops come  the science of the defence lay solely in keeping the mob on the move if they had breathingspace they would halt and fire a house and then the work of restoring order would be more difficult to say the least of it flames have the same effect on a crowd as blood has on a wild beast  word had reached the club and men in eveningdress were beginning to show themselves and lend a hand in heading off and breaking up the shouting masses with stirrupleathers whips or chancefound staves they were not very often attacked for the rioters had sense enough to know that the death of a european would not mean one hanging but many and possibly the appearance of the thricedreaded artillery the clamour in the city redoubled the hindus had descended into the streets in real earnest and ere long the mob returned it was a strange sight there were no taziasonly their riven platformsand there were no police here and there a city dignitary hindu or muhammadan was vainly imploring his coreligionists to keep quiet and behave themselvesadvice for which his white beard was pulled then a native officer of police unhorsed but still using his spurs with effect would be borne along warning all the crowd of the danger of insulting the government everywhere men struck aimlessly with sticks grasping each other by the throat howling and foaming with rage or beat with their bare hands on the doors of the houses  it is a lucky thing that they are fighting with natural weapons i said to wali dad else we should have half the city killed  i turned as i spoke and looked at his face his nostrils were distended his eyes were fixed and he was smiting himself softly on the breast the crowd poured by with renewed riota gang of musalmans hardpressed by some hundred hindu fanatics wali dad left my side with an oath and shouting ya hasan ya hussain plunged into the thick of the fight where i lost sight of him  i fled by a side alley to the padshahi gate where i found wali dads house and thence rode to the fort once outside the city wall the tumult sank to a dull roar very impressive under the stars and reflecting great credit on the fifty thousand angry ablebodied men who were making it the troops who at the deputy commissioners instance had been ordered to rendezvous quietly near the fort showed no signs of being impressed two companies of native infantry a squadron of native cavalry and a company of british infantry were kicking their heels in the shadow of the east face waiting for orders to march in i am sorry to say that they were all pleased unholily pleased at the chance of what they called a little fun the senior officers to be sure grumbled at having been kept out of bed and the english troops pretended to be sulky but there was joy in the hearts of all the subalterns and whispers ran up and down the line no ballcartridgewhat a beastly shame dyou think the beggars will really stand up to us hope i shall meet my moneylender there i owe him more than i can afford oh they wont let us even unsheathe swords hurrah up goes the fourth rocket fall in there  the garrison artillery who to the last cherished a wild hope that they might be allowed to bombard the city at a hundred yards range lined the parapet above the east gateway and cheered themselves hoarse as the british infantry doubled along the road to the main gate of the city the cavalry cantered on to the padshahi gate and the native infantry marched slowly to the gate of the butchers the surprise was intended to be of a distinctly unpleasant nature and to come on top of the defeat of the police who had been just able to keep the muhammadans from firing the houses of a few leading hindus the bulk of the riot lay in the north and northwest wards the east and southeast were by this time dark and silent and i rode hastily to laluns house for i wished to tell her to send some one in search of wali dad the house was unlighted but the door was open and i climbed upstairs in the darkness one small lamp in the white room showed lalun and her maid leaning half out of the window breathing heavily and evidently pulling at something that refused to come  thou art latevery late gasped lalun without turning her head help us now o fool if thou hast not spent thy strength howling among the tazias pull nasiban and i can do no more o sahib is it you the hindus have been hunting an old muhammadan round the ditch with clubs if they find him again they will kill him help us to pull him up  i put my hands to the long red silk waistcloth that was hanging out of the window and we three pulled and pulled with all the strength at our command there was something very heavy at the end and it swore in an unknown tongue as it kicked against the city wall  pull oh pull said lalun at the last a pair of brown hands grasped the windowsill and a venerable muhammadan tumbled upon the floor very much out of breath his jaws were tied up his turban had fallen over one eye and he was dusty and angry  lalun hid her face in her hands for an instant and said something about wali dad that i could not catch  then to my extreme gratification she threw her arms round my neck and murmured pretty things i was in no haste to stop her and nasiban being a handmaiden of tact turned to the big jewelchest that stands in the corner of the white room and rummaged among the contents the muhammadan sat on the floor and glared  one service more sahib since thou hast come so opportunely said lalun wilt thouit is very nice to be thoued by laluntake this old man across the citythe troops are everywhere and they might hurt him for he is oldto the kumharsen gate there i think he may find a carriage to take him to his house he is a friend of mine and thou artmore than a friendtherefore i ask this  nasiban bent over the old man tucked something into his belt and i raised him up and led him into the streets  in crossing from the east to the west of the city there was no chance of avoiding the troops and the crowd long before i reached the gully of the horsemen i heard the shouts of the british infantry crying cheeringly hutt ye beggars hutt ye devils get along go forward there then followed the ringing of riflebutts and shrieks of pain the troops were banging the bare toes of the mob with their gunbuttsfor not a bayonet had been fixed my companion mumbled and jabbered as we walked on until we were carried back by the crowd and had to force our way to the troops i caught him by the wrist and felt a bangle therethe iron bangle of the sikhsbut i had no suspicions for lalun had only ten minutes before put her arms round me thrice we were carried back by the crowd and when we made our way past the british infantry it was to meet the sikh cavalry driving another mob before them with the butts of their lances  what are these dogs said the old man  sikhs of the cavalry father i said and we edged our way up the line of horses two abreast and found the deputy commissioner his helmet smashed on his head surrounded by a knot of men who had come down from the club as amateur constables and had helped the police mightily  well keep em on the run till dawn said petitt whos your villainous friend  i had only time to say the protection of the sirkar when a fresh crowd flying before the native infantry carried us a hundred yards nearer to the kumharsen gate and petitt was swept away like a shadow  i do not knowi cannot seethis is all new to me moaned my companion how many troops are there in the city  perhaps five hundred i said  a lakh of men beaten by five hundredand sikhs among them surely surely i am an old man butthe kumharsen gate is new who pulled down the stone lions where is the conduit sahib i am a very old man and alas ii cannot stand he dropped in the shadow of the kumharsen gate where there was no disturbance a fat gentleman wearing gold pincenez came out of the darkness  you are most kind to my old friend he said suavely he is a landholder of akala he should not be in a big city when there is religious excitement but i have a carriage here you are quite truly kind will you help me to put him into the carriage it is very late  we bundled the old man into a hired victoria that stood close to the gate and i turned back to the house on the city wall the troops were driving the people to and fro while the police shouted to your houses get to your houses and the dogwhip of the assistant district superintendent cracked remorselessly terrorstricken bunnias clung to the stirrups of the cavalry crying that their houses had been robbed which was a lie and the burly sikh horsemen patted them on the shoulder and bade them return to those houses lest a worse thing should happen parties of five or six british soldiers joining arms swept down the sidegullies their rifles on their backs stamping with shouting and song upon the toes of hindu and musalman never was religious enthusiasm more systematically squashed and never were poor breakers of the peace more utterly weary and footsore they were routed out of holes and corners from behind wellpillars and byres and bidden to go to their houses if they had no houses to go to so much the worse for their toes  on returning to laluns door i stumbled over a man at the threshold he was sobbing hysterically and his arms flapped like the wings of a goose it was wali dad agnostic and unbeliever shoeless turbanless and frothing at the mouth the flesh on his chest bruised and bleeding from the vehemence with which he had smitten himself a broken torchhandle lay by his side and his quivering lips murmured ya hasan ya hussain as i stooped over him i pushed him a few steps up the staircase threw a pebble at laluns city window and hurried home  most of the streets were very still and the cold wind that comes before the dawn whistled down them in the centre of the square of the mosque a man was bending over a corpse the skull had been smashed in by gunbutt or bamboostave  it is expedient that one man should die for the people said petitt grimly raising the shapeless head these brutes were beginning to show their teeth too much  and from afar we could hear the soldiers singing two lovely black eyes as they drove the remnant of the rioters within doors   of course you can guess what happened i was not so clever when the news went abroad that khem singh had escaped from the fort i did not since i was then living this story not writing it connect myself or lalun or the fat gentleman with the gold pincenez with his disappearance nor did it strike me that wali dad was the man who should have convoyed him across the city or that laluns arms round my neck were put there to hide the money that nasiban gave to khem singh and that lalun had used me and my white face as even a better safeguard than wali dad who proved himself so untrustworthy all that i knew at the time was that when fort amara was taken up with the riots khem singh profited by the confusion to get away and that his two sikh guards also escaped  but later on i received full enlightenment and so did khem singh he fled to those who knew him in the old days but many of them were dead and more were changed and all knew something of the wrath of the government he went to the young men but the glamour of his name had passed away and they were entering native regiments of government offices and khem singh could give them neither pension decorations nor influencenothing but a glorious death with their backs to the mouth of a gun he wrote letters and made promises and the letters fell into bad hands and a wholly insignificant subordinate officer of police tracked them down and gained promotion thereby moreover khem singh was old and aniseseed brandy was scarce and he had left his silver cookingpots in fort amara with his nice warm bedding and the gentleman with the gold pincenez was told by those who had employed him that khem singh as a popular leader was not worth the money paid  great is the mercy of these fools of english said khem singh when the situation was put before him i will go back to fort amara of my own free will and gain honour give me good clothes to return in  so at his own time khem singh knocked at the wicketgate of the fort and walked to the captain and the subaltern who were nearly grayheaded on account of correspondence that daily arrived from simla marked private  i have come back captain sahib said khem singh  put no more guards over me it is no good out yonder  a week later i saw him for the first time to my knowledge and he made as though there were an understanding between us  it was well done sahib said he and greatly i admired your astuteness in thus boldly facing the troops when i whom they would have doubtless torn to pieces was with you now there is a man in fort ooltagarh whom a bold man could with ease help to escape this is the position of the fort as i draw it on the sand  but i was thinking how i had become laluns vizier after all
