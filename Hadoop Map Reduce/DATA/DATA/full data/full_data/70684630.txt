70684630	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume vii      book viii  crownprince reprieved life at custrin  november 1730february 1732     chapter i  chaplain muller waits on the crownprince  friedrichs feelings at this juncture are not made known to us by himself in the least or credibly by others in any considerable degree as indeed in these confused prussian historybooks copulent in nugatory pedantisms and learned marinestores all that is human remains distressingly obscure to us so seldom and then only as through endless clouds of everwhirling idle dust can we catch the smallest direct feature of the young man and of his real demeanor or meaning on the present or other occasions but it is evident this last phenomenon fell upon him like an overwhelming cataract crushed him down under the immensity of sorrow confusion and despair his own death not a theory now but probably a near facta welcome one in wild moments and then anon so unwelcome frustrate bankrupt chargeable with a friends lost life sure enough he for one is what is to become of him whither is he to turn thoroughly beaten foiled in all his enterprises proud young soul as he was the ruling powers be they just be they unjust have proved too hard for him we hear of tragic vestiges still traceable of friedrich belonging to this time texts of scripture quoted by him pencilsketches of his drawing expressive of a mind dwelling in golgothas and pathetically not defiantly contemplating the very worst  chaplain muller of the gensdarmes being found a pious and intelligent man has his orders not to return at once from custrin but to stay there and deal with the prince on that horrible predestination topic and his other unexampled backslidings which have ended so muller stayed accordingly for a couple of weeks intensely busy on the predestination topic and generally in assuaging and mutually mollifying paternal majesty and afflicted son in all which he had good success and especially on the predestination point was triumphantly successful muller left a little book in record of his procedures there which had it not been bound over to the official tone might have told us something his correspondence with the king during those two weeks has likewise been mostly printed forster i 376379 and is of course still more officialteaching us next to nothing except poor friedrich wilhelms profoundly devotional mood anxieties about the claws of satan and the like which we were glad to hear of above in muller otherwise is small help for us  but fifty years afterwards there was alive a son of this mullers an innocent country parson not wanting in sense and with much simplicity and veracity who was fished out by nicolai and set to recalling what his father used to say of this adventure much the grandest of his life in muller juniors letter of reminiscences to nicolai we find some details got from his father which are worth gleaning  when my father first attempted by royal order to bring the crownprince to acknowledgment and repentance of the fault committed crownprince gave this excuse or explanation as his father could not endure the sight of him he had meant to get out of the way of his displeasure and go to a court with which his father was in friendship and relationshipclearly indicating england think the mullers junior and senior  for proof that the intention was towards england this other circumstance serves that the one confidantherr van keith if i mistake not no you dont mistake had already bespoken a ship for passage outhere is something still more unexpected  my father used to say he found an excellent knowledge and conviction of the truths of religion in the crownprince by the princes arrangement my father who at first lodged with the commandant had to take up his quarters in the room right above the prince who daily often as early as six in the morning rapped on the ceiling for him to come down and then they would dispute and discuss sometimes halfdays long about the different tenets of the christian sectsand my father said the prince was perfectly at home in the polemic doctrines of the reformed calvinistic church even to the minutest points as my father brought him proofs from scripture the prince asked him one time how he could keep chapter and verse so exactly in his memory father drew from his pocket a little handconcordance and showed it him as one help this he had to leave with the prince for some days on getting it back he found inside on the flyleaf sketched in pencilwhat is rather notable to historythe figure of a man on his knees with two swords hanging crosswise over his head and at the bottom these words of psalm seventythird verses 25 26 whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire besides thee my flesh and my heart fainteth and faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion foreverpoor friedrich this is a very unexpected pensketch on his part but an undeniable one betokening abstruse nightthoughts and forebodings in the present juncture  whoever considers this fine knowledge of religion and reflects on the peculiar character and genius of the young herr which was ever struggling towards light and clearness for at that time he had not become indifferent to religion he often prayed with my father on his kneeswill find that it was morally impossible this young prince could have thought as some foolish persons have asserted of throwing himself into the arms of papal superstition seeking help at vienna marrying an austrian archduchess and i know not what or allow the intrigues of catholic priests tooh no herr muller nobody but very foolish persons could imagine such a thing of this young herr  when my father herr von kattes execution being ended hastened to the crownprince he finds him miserably ill sehr alterirt advises him to take a coolingpowder in water both which materials were ready on the table this he presses on him but the prince always shakes his head suspects poison you think hereupon my father takes from his pocket a paper in which he carried coolingpowder for his own use shakes out a portion of it into his hand and so into his mouth and now the crownprince grips at my fathers powder and takes that privately to be made away with death resolved upon in some way thinks the desperate young man nicolai anekdoten vi 183189  that scene of kattes execution and of the princes and other peoples position in regard to it has never yet been humanly set forth otherwise the response had been different not humanly set forthand so was only barked at as by the infinitude of little dogs in all countries and could never yet be responded to in austere vox humana deep as a de profundis terrible as a chorus of aeschylusfor in effect that is rather the character of it had the barking once pleased to cease king of prussia cannot sleep writes dickens the officers sit up with him every night and in his slumbers he raves and talks of spirits and apparitions despatch 3d october 1730 we saw him ghostlike in the nighttime gliding about seeking shelter with feekin against ghosts ginkel by daylight saw him now clad in thunderous tornado and anon in sorrowful fog here farther on is a new itemand joined to it and the others a remarkable old one  in regard to wilhelminas marriage and whether a father cannot give his daughter in wedlock to whom he pleases there have been eight divines consulted four lutheran four reformed calvinist who all but one he of the garrison church a rhadamanthine fellow in serge have answered no your majesty it is remarkable that his majesty has not gone to bed sober for this month past dickens 9th and 19th december 1730  what seckendorf and grumkow thought of all these phenomena they have done their job too well they are all for mercy lean with their whole weight that wayin black qualms one of them withal thinking tremulously to himself what if his now majesty were to die upon us in the interim     chapter ii  crownprince to repent and not perish  in regard to friedrich the courtmartial needs no amendment from the king the sentence on friedrich a lieutenantcolonel guilty of desertion is from president and all members except two death as by law the two who dissented invoking royal clemency and pardon were majorgenerals by rankschwerin as some write one of them or if not schwerin then linger and for certain donhoftwo worthy gentlemen not known to any of my readers nor to me except as names the rest are all coldly of opinion that the military code says death other codes and considerations may say this and that which it is not in their province to touch upon this is what the military code says and they leave it there  the junius brutus of a royal majesty had answered in his own heart grimly well then but his councillors old dessauer grumkow seckendorf one and all interpose vehemently prince of the empire your majesty not a lieutenantcolonel only must not cannotnay good old buddenbrock in the fire of still unsuccessful pleading tore open his waistcoat if your majesty requires blood take mine that other you shall never get so long as i can speak foreign courts interpose sweden the dutch the english in a circuitous way round by vienna to wit finally the kaiser himself sends an autograph date 11th october 1730 forster i 380 for poor queen sophie has applied even to seckendorf will be friends with grumkow himself and in her despair is knocking at every door junius brutus is said to have had paternal affections withal friedrich wilhelm alone against the whispers of his own heart and the voices of all men yields at last in this cause to seckendorf who has chalked out a milder didactic plan of treatment still rigorous enough his letter to the king 1st november 1730 in forster i 375 376 he at last admits that such plan is perhaps good that the kaisers letter has turned the scale with him and the didactic method not the beheading one shall be tried that donhof and schwerin with their talk of mercy with their eyes upon the rising sun as is evident have done themselves no good and shall perhaps find it so one day but that at any rate friedrichs life is spared kattes execution shall suffice in that kind repentance prostrate submission and amendmentthese may do yet more for the prodigal if he will in heart return these points some time before the 8th of november we find to be as good as settled  the unhappy prodigal is in no condition to resist farther chaplain muller had introduced himself with kattes dying admonition to the crownprince to repent and submit chaplain muller with his wholesome coolingpowders with his ghostly counsels and considerations of temporal and eternal naturewe saw how he prospered almost beyond hope even on predestination and the real nature of election by free grace all is coming right or come reports muller the chaplains reports friedrich wilhelms grimly mollified responses on the same they are written and in confused form have been printed but shall be spared the english reader and grumkow has been out at custrin preaching to the same purport from other texts grumkow with the thought ever present to him what if friedrich wilhelm should die is naturally an eloquent preacher enough it has been settled perhaps before the day of kattes death or at the latest three days after it as we can see that if the prince will and can with free conscience take an oath no mental reservation mark you of contrite repentance of perfect prostrate submission and purpose of future entire obedience and conformity to the paternal mind in all things gnadenwahl includedthe paternal mind may possibly relax his durance a little and put him gradually on proof again kings letter to muller 8th november forster i 379  towards which issue as chaplain muller reports the crownprince is visibly gravitating with all his weight and will the very gnadenwahl is settled the young soul truly a lover of truth your majesty taps on his ceiling my floor being overhead before the winter sun rises as a signal that i must come down to him so eager to have error and darkness purged away believes himself as i believe him ready to undertake that oath desires however to see it first that he may maturely study every clause of itsay you verily so answers majesty and may my ursine heart flow out again and blubber gratefully over a sinner saved a poor son plucked as brand from the burninggod the most high give his blessing on it then concludes the paternal majesty and as he often by wondrous guidances strange paths and thorny steps will bring men into the kingdom of christ so may our divine redeemer help that this prodigal son be brought into his communion that his godless heart be beaten till it is softened and changed and so he be snatched from the claws of satan this grant us the almighty god and father for our lord jesus christ and his passion and deaths sake ameni am for the rest your wellaffectioned king friedrich wilhelm wusterhausen 8th november 1730 forster i 379     crownprince begins a new course  it was monday 6th november when poor katte died within a fortnight on the second sunday after there has a select commission grumkow borck buddenbrock with three other soldiers and the privy councillor thulmeyer come out to custrin there and then sunday november 19th nicolai exactest of men only that documents were occasionally less accessible in his time gives anekdoten vi 187 saturday november 25th as the day of the oath but no doubt the later inquirers preuss i 56 and others have found him wrong in this small instance these seven with due solemnity administer the oath terms of oath conceivable by readers friedrich being found ready he signs the oath as well as audibly swears it whereupon his sword is restored to him and his prisondoor opened he steps forth to the town church with his commissioners takes the sacrament listens with all custrin to an illusive sermon on the subject text happily chosen preacher handling it well text was psalm seventyseventh verse eleventh tenth of our english version and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the host high or as luthers version more intelligibly gives it this i have to suffer the right hand of the most high can change all preacher not muller but another rose gradually into didactic pathos prince and all custrin were weeping or near weeping at the close of the business preuss i 56  straight from church the prince is conducted not to the fortress but to a certain town mansion which he is to call his own henceforth under conditions an erring prince half liberated and mercifully put on proof again his first act here is to write of his own composition or helped by some official hand this letter to his allserenest papa which must be introduced though except to readers of german who know the dere theiro allerdurchlauchtigster and strange pipeclay solemnity of the courtstyle it is like to be in great part lost in any translation  custrin 19th november 1730  allserenest and allgraciousest

occasion to a just wrath and aversion against me with the allobedientest respect i submit myself wholly to the grace of my most allgracious father and beg him most allgraciously to pardon me as it is not so much the withdrawal of my liberty in a sad arrest malheureusen arrest as my own thoughts of the fault i have committed that have brought me to reason who with allobedientest respect and

berlin posen und bromberg 1838 p 3  this new house of friedrichs in the little town of custrin he finds arranged for him on rigorously thrifty principles yet as a real household of his own and even in the form of a court with hofmarschall kammerjunkers and the other adjunctscourt reduced to its simplest expression as the french say and probably the cheapest that was ever set up hafmarschall courtmarshal is one wolden a civilian official here the kammerjunkers are rohwedel and natzmer matzmer junior son of a distinguished feldmarschall a goodhearted but foolish forward young fellow says wilhelmina the failure of a coxcomb petitmaitre manque for example once strolling about in a solemn kaisers soiree in vienna he found in some quiet corner the young duke of lorraine franz who it is thought will be the divine maria theresas husband and kaiser himself one day foolish natzmer found this noble young gentleman in a remote corner of the soiree went up nothing loath to speak graciosities and insipidities to him the noble young gentleman yawned as was too natural a wide long yawn and in an insipid familiar manner foolish natzmer wilhelmina and the berlin circles know it put his finger into the noble young gentlemans mouth and insipidly wagged it there sir you seem to forget where you are said the noble young gentleman and closing his mouth with emphasis turned away but happily took no farther notice wilhelmina i 310 this is all we yet know of the history of natzmer whose heedless ways and slapdash speculations tinted with natural ingenuity and goodhumor are not unattractive to the prince  hofmarschall and these two kammerjunkers are of the lawyer species men intended for official business in which the prince himself is now to be occupied the prince has four lackeys two pages one valet he wears his sword but has no swordtash porte epee much less an officers uniform a mere prince put upon his good behavior again not yet a soldier of the prussian army only hoping to become so again he wears a lightgray dress hechtgrauer pikegray frock with narrow silver cordings and must recover his uniform by proving himself gradually a new man  for there is along with the new household a new employment laid out for him in custrin and it shall be seen what figure he makes in that first of all he is to sit in the domanenkammer or government board here as youngest rath no other career permitted let him learn economics and the way of managing domain lands a very principal item of the royal revenues in this country humble work but useful which he had better see well how he will do two elder raths are appointed to instruct him in the economic sciences and practices if he show faculty and diligencewhich in fact he turns out to do in a superior degree having every motive to try  this kind of life lasted with him for the next fifteen months all through the year 1731 and farther and must have been a very singular and was probably a highly instructive year to him not in the domain sciences alone he is left wholly to himself all his fellowcreatures as it were are watching him hundredeyed argus or the ear of dionysius that is to say tobaccoparliament with its spies and reportersno stirring of his finger can escape it here he has much suspicion to encounter papa looking always sadly askance sadly incredulous upon him he is in correspondence with grumkow takes much advice from grumkow our promptergeneral president in the dionysiusear and not an illwisher farther professes much thankfulness to grumkow now and henceforth thank you for flinging me out of the sixstory window and catching me by the coatskirtsleft altogether to himself as we said has in the whole universe nothing that will save him but his own good sense his own power of discovering what is what and of doing what will be behooveful therein  he is to quit his french literatures and pernicious practices one and all his very flute most innocent princess as he used to call his flute in old days is denied him ever since he came to custrinbut by degrees he privately gets her back and consorts much with her wails forth in beautiful adagios emotions for which there is no other utterance at present he has liberty of custrin and the neighborhood out of custrin he is not to lodge any night without leave had of the commandant let him walk warily and in good earnest study to become a new creature useful for something in the domain sciences and otherwise     chapter iii  wilhelmina is to wed the prince of baireuth  crownprince friedrich being settled so far his majesty takes up the case of wilhelmina the other ravelled skein lying on hand wilhelmina has been prisoner in her apartment at berlin all this while it is proper wilhelmina be disposed of either in wedlock filially obedient to the royal mind or in some much sterner way within four walls it is whispered if disobedient  poor wilhelmina never thought of disobeying her parents only which of them to obey king looks towards the prince of baireuth again agreed on before those hurlyburlies now past queen looks far otherwards queen sophie still desperately believes in the english match for wilhelmina and has subterranean correspondences with that court refusing to see that the negotiation is extinct there grumkow himself so overvictorious in his late task is now heeling towards england sincere in his wish to be well with us thinks dickens grumkow solaces her majesty with delusive hopes in the english quarter be firm child trust in my management only swear to me on your eternal salvation that never on any compulsion will you marry another than the prince of walesgive me that oath wilhelmina i 314 such was queen sophies last proposal to wilhelminanight of the 27th of january 1731 as is computableher majesty to leave for potsdam on the morrow they wept much together that night but wilhelmina dexterously evaded the oath on a religious ground prince of baireuth whom papa may like or may not like has never yet personally made appearance who or what will make appearance or how things can or will turn except a bad road is terribly a mystery to wilhelmina  what with chagrin and confinement what with bad diet for the very diet is bad quality and quantity alike unspeakable wilhelmina sees herself reduced to a skeleton no company but her faithful sonsfeld no employment but her books and musicstruggles however still to keep heart one day it is in february 1731 as i compute they are sitting her sonsfeld and she at their sad mess of socalled dinner in their remote upper story of the berlin schloss tramp of sentries the one thing audible and were looking mournfully at one another with nothing to eat but a soup of salt and water and a ragout of old bones full of hairs and slopperies nothing else that was its real quality whatever fine name they might give it says the vehement princess we heard a sharp tapping at the window and started up in surprise to see what it could be it was a raven carrying in its beak a bit of bread which it left on the windowsill and flew away ib i 316  tears came into our eyes at this adventure are we become as hebrew elijahs then so that the wild ravens have to bring us food truth is there was nothing miraculous as wilhelmina found by and by it was a tame ravennot the soul of old george i which lives at isleworth on good pensions but the pet raven of a certain margravine which lost its way among the intricate roofs here but the incident was touching well exclaimed wilhelmina in the roman histories i am now reading it is often said those creatures betoken good luck all berlin such the appetite for gossip and such the famine of it in berlin at present talked of this minute event and the french colonyold protestant colony practical considerate peoplewere so struck by it they brought baskets of comfortable things to us and left them daily as if by accident on some neutral ground where the maid could pick them up sentries refusing to see unless compelled which fine procedure has attached wilhelmina to the french nation ever since as a dexterous useful people and has given her a disposition to help them where she could  the omen of the raven did not at once bring good luck however it did chance to be the turningpoint solstice of this long greenland winter after which amid storms and alarms daylight came steadily nearer storms and alarms for there came rumors of quarrels out at potsdam quarrels on the old score between the royal spouses there and frightful messages through one eversmann an insolent royal lackey about wedding weissenfels about imprisonment for life and other hard things through all which wilhelmina studied to keep her poor head steady and answer with dignity yet discreetly on the other hand her sisters are permitted to visit her and perceptible assuagements come at length on the 11th of may there came solemn deputation borck grumkow thulmeyer in it old real friends and pretended new which set poor wilhelmina wringing her hands having had a letter from mamma overnight but did bring about a solution it was friday 11th of may a day of crisis in wilhelminas history queen commanding one thing king another and the hour of decision come  entering announcing themselves with dreadful solemnity these gentlemen grumkow the spokesman in soft phrase but with strict clearness made it apparent to her that marry she mustthe hereditary prince of baireuthand without the consent of both her parents which was unattainable at present but peremptorily under the command of one of them whose vote was the supreme do this or even say that you will do it whisper some of the wellaffected his majestys paternal favor will return upon you like pent watersand the queen will surely reconcile herself or perhaps turn it all her own way yet whisper the wellaffected refuse to do it her majesty your royal brother you yourself royal highness god only knows what the unheardof issue will be for you all do it let us advise you you must you mustwilhelmina wrung her hands ran distractedly to and fro the wellaffected whispering to her the others conversing at a window at length she did it will marry whom her allgracious papa appoints never wished or meant the least disobedience hopes beyond all things his paternal love will now return and make everybody blessedand oh reconcile mamma to me ye wellaffected adds shebravissimo answer they her majesty for certain will reconcile herself crownprince get back from custrin and all will be well wilhelmina i 327333  friedrich wilhelm was overjoyed queen sophie dorothee was in despair with his majesty who wept like a paternal bear on reembracing wilhelmina the obedient some days hence it became a settled point and was indicated to wilhelmina as such that the crownprince would on her actual wedding probably get back from custrin but her majestys reconcilementthis was very slow to follow her majesty was still in flames of ire at their next interview and poor wilhelmina fainted on approaching to kiss her hand disgraced vanquished and my enemies triumphing said her majesty and vented her wrath on wilhelmina and fell ill so soon as there was leisure ill like to die and said why pretend to weep when it is you that have killed meand indeed was altogether hard bitter upon the poor princess a chief sorrow to her in these trying months can there be such wrath in celestial minds venting itself so unreasonablyat present there is no leisure for illness grand visitors in quantity have come and are coming and the court is brilliant exceedinglyhis majesty blazing out into the due magnificence which was very great on this occasion domestic matters looking up with him again the serenities of brunswick are here young and old much liked by friedrich wilhelm and almost reckoned family peopleever since their eldest son was affianced to the princess charlotte here last visit they made to princess charlotte wilhelminas second juniormischievous coquettish creature she though very pretty and insinuating who seems to think her intended rather a phlegmatic young gentleman as wilhelmina gradually discovers then there is old duke eberhard ludwig of wurtemberg whom we saw at ludwigsburg last year in an intricate condition with his female world and otherwise he too announces himselfaccording to promise then given old duke eberhard ludwig comes stays three weeks in great splendor of welcomepoor old gentleman his one son is now dead and things are getting earnest with him on his return home this time he finds according to order the foul witch gravenitz duly cleared away reinstates his injured duchess with the due feelings better late than never and dies in a year or two still childless  these are among the high guests at berlin and there are plenty of others whom we do not name magnificent dining with sixandtwenty blackamoors highcolored creatures marching up the grand staircase round the table round it and then down again melodious doing janizary music if you happen to prefer that kindtrained creatures these blackamoors all got when boys and set to cymballing and fifing betimes adds my authority fassmann p 726 c dining boarhunting if the boar be huntable especially reviewing fail not in those fine summer days  one evening it is sunday 27th of may latish while the high guests with queen and wilhelmina are just passing in to supper kings majesty having gone to bed at seven to be well astir for the review tomorrow a sound of wheels is heard in the court modest travellingequipage rolls up into the inner court to the foot of the grand staircase there whither only princes comewho can it be the queen sends to inquire heavens it is the hereditary prince of baireuth medusas head never produced such effect as did this bit of news queen sat petrified and i by reflex was petrified too wilhelmina passed the miserablest night no wink of sleep and felt quite ill in the morningin dread too of papas rough jestsand wretched enough she had begged much last night to be excused from the review but that could not be i must go said the queen after reflection and you with me which they didand diversified the pomp and circumstance of mockwar by a small unexpected scene  queen princess and the proper dames had by his majestys order to pass before the line princess in much trouble with three caps huddled on me to conceal myself poor soul margraf of schwedt at the head of his regiment looked swollen with rage high hopes gone in this mannerand saluted us with eyes turned away as for his mother the dessau margravine in high colors she was blue in the face all day lines passed and salutations done her majesty and dames withdrew to the safe distance to look onsuch a show for pomp and circumstance wilhelmina owns as could not be equalled in the world such wheeling rhythmic coalescing and unfolding accurate as clockwork far and wide swift big column here hitting swift big column there at the appointed place and moment with their volleyings and trumpeting bright uniforms and streamers and fieldmusicin equipment and manoeuvre perfect all to the meanest drummer or black kettledrummersupreme drillsergeant playing on the thing as on his huge piano several square miles in area comes of the old dessauer all this of the equal step of the abstruse meditations upon tactics in that rough head of his very pretty indeedbut in the mean while an official steps up cap in hand approaches the queens carriage says he is ordered to introduce his highness the prince of baireuth prince comes up accordingly a personable young fellow intelligentlooking selfpossessed makes obeisance to her majesty who answers in frosty politeness andand wilhelmina faint fasting sleepless all night fairly falls aswoon could not be helped and the whole world saw it and guy dickens and the diplomatists wrote home about it and there rose rumor and gossip enough dickens of 2d june 1731 in pathetic terms wilhelmina i 341 without pathos but that was the naked truth of it hot weather agitation want of sleep want of food not aversion to the hereditary prince nothing of that rather the contrary indeed and on better acquaintance much the contrary for he proved a very rational honorable and eligible young prince modest honest with abundance of sense and spirit kind too and good hot temper well kept temper hot not harsh quietly holds his own in all circles good discourse in him too and sharp repartee if requisitethough he stammered somewhat in speaking submissive wilhelmina feels that one might easily have had a worse husband what glories for you in england the queen used to say to her in old times he is a prince that frederick who has a good heart and whose genius is very small rather ugly than handsome slightly out of shape even un peu contrefait but provided you have the complaisance to suffer his debaucheries you will quite govern him and you will be more king than he when once his father is dead only see what a part you will play it will be you that decide on the weal or woe of europe and give law to the nation wilhelmina i 143in a manner which wilhelmina did not think a celestial prospect even then who knows but of all the offers she had four or three crowned heads among them this final modest honest one may be intrinsically the best take your portion if inevitable and be thankful  the betrothal follows in about a week sunday 3d june 1731 with great magnificence in presence of the high guests and all the world and wilhelmina is the affianced bride of friedrich of baireuthand that enormous doublemarriage tragicomedy of much ado about nothing is at last ended courage friends all things do end  the high guests hereupon go their ways again and the court of berlin one cannot but suppose collapses as after a great effort finished do not friedrich wilhelm and innumerable personsthe readers and the writer of this history includedfeel a stone rolled off their heartsit is now and not till now that queen sophie falls sick and like to die and reproaches wilhelmina with killing her friedrich wilhelm hopes confidently not waits out at potsdam for a few days till this killing danger pass then departs with double impetuosity for preussen and despatch of public business such a mountain of domestic business being victoriously got under  poor king his life this long while has been a series of earthquakes and titanic convulsions narrow miss he has had of pulling down his house about his ears and burying self son wife family and fortunes under the ruinheapa monument to remote posterity never was such an enchanted dance of wellintentioned royal bear with poetic temperament piped to by two blackartists for the kaisers and pragmatic sanctions sake let tobaccoparliament also rejoice for truly the play was growing dangerous of late king and parliament we may suppose return to public business with double vigor     chapter iv  criminal justice in preussen and elsewhere  not that his majesty while at the deepest in domestic intricacies ever neglects public business this very summer he is raising hussar squadrons bent to introduce the hussar kind of soldiery into his armya good deal of horsebreaking and new sabreexercise needed for that object fassmann pp 417 418 the affairs of the reich have at no moment been out of his eye glad to see the kaiser edging round to the seapowers again and things coming into their old posture in spite of that sad treaty of seville  nay for the last two years while the domestic volcanoes were at their worst his majesty has been extensively dealing with a new question which has risen that of the salzburg protestants concerning which we shall hear more anon far and wide in the diets and elsewhere he has been diligently piously and with solid judgment handling this question of the poor salzburgers and has even stored up moneys in intended solace of them for he foresees what the end will bemoneys which it appears about this time a certain official over in preussen has been peculating in the end of june his majesty sets off to preussen on the usual inspection tour which we should not mention were it not in regard to that same official and to something very rhadamanthine and particular which befell him significant of what his majesty can do in the way of prompt justice     case of schlubhut  the konigsberg domainboard kriegsund domanenkammer had fallen awry in various points of late several things known to be outatelbows in that country the kammer raths evidently lax at their post for which reason they have been sharply questioned and shaken by the collar so to speak nay there is one rath a socalled nobleman of those parts by name schlubhut who has been found actually defaulting peculating from that pious hoard intended for the salzburgers he is proved and confesses to have put into his own scandalous purse no less than 11000 thalers some say 30000 almost 5000 pounds which belonged to the public treasury and the salzburg protestants these things especially this latter unheardof schlubhut thing the supreme court at berlin criminalcollegium have been sitting on for some time and in regard to schlubhut they have brought out a result which friedrich wilhelm not a little admires at schlubhut clearly guilty of the defamation say they but he has moneys landed properties let him refund principal and interest and have say three or four years imprisonment by way of memento years imprisonment refund is theft in the highest quarters a thing to be let off for refunding growls his majesty and will not confirm this sentence of his criminalcollegium but leaves it till he get to the spot and see with his own eyes schlubhut in arrest or mild confinement all

schlubhut summoned to private interview with his majesty carries his head higher than could be looked for is very sorry knows not how it happened meant always to refund will refund to the last penny and make all goodrefund does he er know what stealing means then how the commonest convicted private thief finds the gallows his portion much more a public magistrate convicted of theft is he aware that he in a very especial manner deserves hanging thenschlubhut looks offended dignity conscious of rank if also of quasitheft es ist nicht manier it is not the polite thing to hang a prussian nobleman on those light terms answers schlubhut high mannered at the wrong time i can and will pay the money backnobleman money back i will none of his scoundrelly money to strait prison with this schurkeand thither he goes accordingly unhappiest of mortals to be conscious of rank not at the right place when about to steal the money but at the wrong when answering to rhadamanthus on it  and there sure enough schlubhut lies in his prison on the schlossplatz or castle square of konigsberg all night and hears close by the domanenkammer which is in the same square domanenkammer where his office used to be a terrible sound of carpentering go onunhappiest of prussian noblemen and in the morning see a high gallows built close in upon the domainkammer looking into the very windows of itand there sure enough the unfortunate schlubhut dies the thiefs death few hours hence speaking or thinking what no man reports to me death was certain for him inevitable as fate and so he vibrates there admonitory to the other raths for dayssome say for weekstill by humble petition they got the gallows removed the stumps of it sawed close by the stones were long after visible in that

benekendorf himself a member of the criminalcollegium in later times and from him in all the books is recorded another interference somewhat in the comic vein which also we may give undisputed fact again totally without precision or details not even datable except that on study we perceive it may have been before this schlubhuts execution and after the criminalcollegium had committed their error about himmust have been while this of schlubhut was still vividly in mind here is the unprecise but indubitable fact as the prussian dryasdust has left us his smear of it  one morning early might be before schlubhut was hanged and while only sentence of imprisonment and restitution lay on him general graf von donhof colonel of a musketeer regiment favorite old soldierwho did vote on the mild side in that courtmartial on the crownprince lately but i hope has been forgiven by his majesty being much esteemed by him these long years pastthis donhof early one morning calls upon the king with a grimly lamenting air what is wrong herr generalyour majesty my best musketeer an excellent soldier and of good inches fell into a mistake latelybad company getting round the poor fellow they he among them slipt into a house and stole something trifle and without violence pay is but three halfpence your majesty and the devil tempts men well the criminalcollegium have condemned him to be hanged an excellent soldier and of good inches for that one fault nobleman schlubhut was to make restitution they decreed that was their decree on schlubhut one of their own set and this poor soldier six feet three your majesty is to dance on the top of nothing for a threehalfpenny matterso would donhof represent the thingfact being says my dryasdust it was a case of housebreaking with theft to the value of 6000 thalers and this musketeer the ringleaderwell but was schlubhut sentenced to hanging do you keep two weights and two measures in that criminalcollegium of yours then  friedrich wilhelm feels this sad contrast very much the more as the soldier is his own chattel withal and of superlative inches friedrich wilhelm flames up into wrath sends off swift messengers to bring these judges one and all instantly into his presence the judges are still in their dressinggowns shaving breakfasting they make what haste they can so soon as the first three or four are reported to be in the anteroom friedrich wilhelm in extreme impatience has them called in starts discoursing with them upon the two weights and two measures apologies subterfuges do but provoke him farther it is not long till he starts up growling terribly ihr schurken ye scoundrels how could you and smites down upon the crowns of them with the royal cudgel itself fancy the hurryscurry the unforensic attitudes and pleadings royal cudgel rains blows right and left blood is drawn crowns cracked crowns nearly broken and several judges lost a few teeth and had their noses battered before they could get out the second relay

weights in their lawcourt hence forththis is an actual scene of date berlin 1731 or thereby unusual in the annals of themis of which no constitutional country can hope to see the fellow were the need never so pressingi wish his majesty had been a thought more equal when he was so rhadamanthine schlubhut he hanged schlubhut being only schlubhuts chattel this musketeer his majestys own chattel he did not hang but set him shouldering arms again after some preliminary dusting  his majesty was always excessively severe on defalcations any chancellor with his exchequerbills gone wrong would have fared ill in that country one treasury dignitary named wilke who had dealt in tall recruits as a kind of bytrade and played foul in some slight measure the king was clear for hanging his poor wife galloped to potsdam shrieking mercy upon which friedrich wilhelm had him whipt by the hangman and stuck for life into spandau still more tragicalwas poor hesses case hesse some domain rath out at konigsberg concerned with moneys was found with accountbooks in a state of confusion and several thousands short when the outcome was cleared up what has become of these thousands sir poor old hesse could not tell god is my witness no penny of them eyer stuck to me asseverated poor old hesse but where they are my accountbooks are in such a statealas and my poor old memory is not what it was they brought him to berlin in the end they actually hanged the poor old souland then afterwards in his dusty lumberrooms hidden in pots stuffed into this nook and that most or all of the money was found forster ii 269 c c date and document exist for all these cases though my dryasdust gives none and the cases are indubitable very rhadamanthine indeed the soft quality of mercyah yes it is beautiful and blessed when permissible though thriceaccursed when not but it is on the hard quality of justice first of all that empires are built up and beneficent and lasting things become achievable to mankind in this world     skipper jenkins in the gulf of florida  a couple of weeks before schlubhuts death the english newspapers are somewhat astirin the way of narrative merely as yet ship rebecca captain robert jenkins master has arrived in the port of london with a strange story in her logbook of which after due sifting this is accurately the substance  london 23d27th june 1731 captain jenkins left this port with the rebecca several months ago sailed to jamaica for a cargo of sugar he took in his cargo at jamaica put to sea again 6th april 1731 and proceeded on the voyage homewards with indifferent winds for the first fortnight april 20th with no wind or none that would suit he was hanging about in the entrance of the gulf of florida not far from the havanaalmost too near it i should think but these baffling windsnot far from the havana when a spanish guardacosta hove in sight came down on jenkins and furiously boarded him scoundrel what do you want contrabanding in these seas jamaica say you sugar likely let us see your logwood hides spanish piecesofeight and broke in upon jenkins ship and person in a most extraordinary manner tore up his hatches plunged down seeking logwood hides piecesofeight found nonenot the least trace of contraband on board of jenkins they brought up his quadrants sextants however likewise his stock of tallow candles they shook and rummaged him and all things for piecesofeight furiously advised him cutlass in hand to confess guilt they slashed the head of jenkins his left ear almost off order had been given scalp himbut as he had no hair they omitted that merely brought away the wig and slashedstill no confession nor any piecesofeight they hung him up to the yardarmactual neckhalter but it seems to have been tarry and did not runstill no confession they hoisted him higher tied his cabinboy to his feet neckhalter then became awfully stringent upon jenkins had not the cabinboy without head to speak of slipt through noose being tarry which was a sensible relief to jenkins before very death they lowered jenkins confess scoundrel then scoundrel could not confess spoke of british majestys flag peaceable english subject on the high seasbritish majesty high seas answered they and again hoisted thrice over they tried jenkins in this manner at the yardarm once with cabinboy at his feet never had man such a day outrageous whiskerando cutthroats tossing him about his poor rebecca and him at such rate sun getting low and not the least trace of contraband found they made a last assault on jenkins clutched the bloody slit ear of him tore it mercilessly off flung it in his face carry that to your king and tell him of it then went their way taking jenkinss tallow candles and the best of his sextants with them so that he could hardly work his passage home again for want of latitudesand has lost in goods 112 pounds not to speak of his ear strictly true all this ships company if required will testify on their oath daily journal and the other london newspapers 12th17th june os 1731 coxes walpole i 579 560 indistinct and needing correction  these surely are singular facts calculated to awaken a maritime public careful of its honor which they didafter about eight years as the reader will see for the present there are growlings in the coffeehouses and thursday 28th june say the newspapers this day captain jenkins with his owners ear in his pocket i hope went out to hampton court to lay the matter before his grace of newcastle please your grace it is hardly three months since the illustrious treaty of vienna was signed dutch and we leading in the termagant of spain and nothing but halcyon weather to be looked for on that side grace of newcastle anxious to avoid trouble with spain answers i can only fancy what and nothing was done upon jenkins and his ear      the spaniards own they did a witty thing      who cropt our ears and sent them to the king                       pope date not given me  may keep it in cotton if he like shall have a better ship for some solacement this is the first emergence of jenkins and his ear upon negligent mankind he and it will marvellously reemerge one day     baby carlos gets his apanage  but in regard to that treaty of vienna seventh and last of the travailthroes for baby carloss apanage let the too oblivious reader accept the following extract to keep him on a level with public events as they are pleased to denominate themselves  by that dreadful treaty of seville cardinal fleury and the spaniards should have joined with england and coerced the kaiser vi et armis to admit spanish garrisons instead of neutral into parma and piacenza and so secure baby carlos his heritage there which all nature was in travail till he got war in italy to a certainty said all the newspapers after seville and crownprince friedrich we saw was running off to have a stroke in said warinevitable as the kaiser still obstinately refused and the english and great george their king were ready nevertheless no war came old fleury not wanting war wanting only to fish out something useful for himselflorraine how welcome and indeed the smallest contributions are welcomeold fleury manoeuvred hung back till the spaniards and termagant elizabeth lost all patience and the very english were weary and getting auspicious whereupon the kaiser edged round to the seapowers again or they to him and comfortable asyouwere was got accomplished much to the joy of friedrich wilhelm and others here are some of the dates to these sublime phenomena  march 16th 1731 treaty of vienna england and the kaiser coalescing again into comfortable asyouwere treaty done by robinson sir thomas ultimately earl of grantham whom we shall often hear of in time coming was confirmed and enlarged by a kind of second edition 22d july 1731 dutch joining spain itself acceding and all being now right which could hardly have been expected  for before the first edition of that treaty and while robinson at vienna was still laboring like hercules in itthe poor duke of parma died died and no vestige of a spanish garrison yet there to induct baby carlos according to old bargain on the contrary the kaiser himself took possessiontill once the dukes widow who declares herself in the familyway be brought to bed if of a son of course he must have the duchies if of a daughter only then carlos shall get them let not robinson fear the due months ran but neither son nor daughter came and the treaty of vienna first edition and also second was signed and october 20th 1731 spanish garrisons no longer an  but a bodily fact 6000 strong convoyed by the british fleet came into leghorn and proceeded to lodge themselves in the longlitigated parma and piacenzaand in fine the day after christmas blessed be heaven  december 26th baby carlos in highest person came in baby carlos more power to him got the duchies and we hope there was an end no young gentleman ever had such a pother to make among his fellowcreatures about a little heritable property if baby carloss performance in it be anything in proportion he will be a supereminent sovereign  there is still some haggle about tuscany the duke of which is old and heirless last of the medici as he proved baby carlos would much like to have tuscany too but that is a fief of the empire and might easily be better disposed of thinks the kaiser a more or less uncertain point that of tuscany as many points are last of the medici complained in a polite manner that they were parting his clothes before he had put them off however having no strength he did not attempt resistance but politely composed himself well then scholl ii 219221 coxes walpole i 346 coxes house of austria london 1854 iii 151 do readers need to be informed that this same baby carlos came to be king of naples and even ultimately to be carlos iii of spain leaving a younger son to be king of naples ancestor of the now majesty there  and thus after such diplomatic earthquakes and travail of nature there is at last birth the seventh travailthroe has been successful in some measure successful here actually is baby carloss apanage there probably by favor of heaven and of the seapowers will the kaisers pragmatic sanction be one day treaty of seville most imminent of all those dreadful imminencies of war has passed off as they all did peaceably adjusts itself into treaty of vienna a termagant as it were sated a kaiser hopeful to be so pragmatic sanction and all for the seapowers and everybody mere halcyon weather henceforthnot extending to the gulf of florida and captain jenkins as would seem robinson who did the thingan expert man bred to business as old horace walpoles secretary at soissons and elsewhere and now come to act on his own scoreregards this treaty of vienna which indeed had its multiform difficulties as a thing to immortalize a man  crownprince has long since by papas order written to the kaiser to thank imperial majesty for that beneficent intercession which has proved the saving of his life as papa inculcates we must now see a little how the saved crownprince is getting on in his eclipsed state among the domain sciences at custrin     chapter v  interview of majesty and crownprince at custrin  ever since the end of november last year crownprince friedrich in the eclipsed state at custrin has been prosecuting his probationary course in the domain sciences and otherwise with all the patience diligence and dexterity he could it is false what one reads in some foolish books that friedrich neglected the functions assigned him as assessor in the kriegsund domanenkammer that would not have been the safe course for him the truth still evident is he set himself with diligence to learn the friedrichwilhelm methods of administering domains and the art of finance in general especially of prussian finance the best extant then or sincefinance police administrative businessand profited well by the raths appointed as tutors to him in the respective branches one hille was his financetutor whose kompendium drawn up and made use of on this occasion has been printed in our time and is said to be in brief compass a highly instructive piece throwing clear light on the exemplary friedrichwilhelm methods preuss i 59 n these the prince did actually learn and also practise all his lifeessentially following his fathers methods say the authoritieswith great advantage to himself when the time came  solid nicolai hunted diligently after traces of him in the assessor business here and found some order from papa to make report upon the glassworks of the neumark autograph signatures to common reports one or two and some traditions of his having had a hand in planning certain farmbuildings still standing in those partsbut as the kammer records of custrin and custrin itself were utterly burnt by the russians in 1758 such traces had mostly vanished thirty years before nicolais time nicolai anekdoten vi 193 enough have turned up since in the form of correspondence with the king and otherwise and it is certain the crownprince did plan farmbuildingsboth carzig and himmelstadt carzig now called friedrichsfelde in consequence see map dim mossy steadings which pious antiquarianism can pilgrim to if it likes were built or rebuilt by himand it is remarkable withal how thoroughly instructed friedrich wilhelm shows himself in such matters and how paternally delighted to receive such proposals of improvement introducible at the said carzig and himmelstadt and to find young graceless so diligent and his ideas even good forster ii 390 387 391 perhaps a momentary glance into those affairs may be permitted farther on  the princes life in this his eclipsed state is one of constraint anxiety continual liability but after the first months are well over it begins to be more supportable than we should think he is fixed to the little town cannot be absent any night without leave from the commandant which however and the various similar restrictions are more formal than real an amiable crownprince no soul in custrin but would run by night or by day to serve him he drives and rides about in that green peaty country on domain business on visits on permissible amusement pretty much at his own modest discretion a green flat region made of peat and sand human industry needing to be always busy on it raised causeways with incessant bridges black sedgy ditch on this hand and that many meres muddy pools stagnant or flowing waters everywhere big muddy oder of yellowishdrab color coming from the south big black warta warthe from the polish fens in the east the black and yellow refusing to mingle for some miles nothing of the picturesque in this country but a good deal of the useful of the improvable by economic science and more of fine productions in it too of the floral and still more interesting sorts than you would suspect at first sight friedrichs worst pinch was his dreadful straitness of income checking ones noble tendencies on every hand but the gentry of the district privately subscribed gifts for him se cotisirent says wilhelmina and one way and other he contrived to make ends meet munchow his president in the kammer next to whom sits friedrich kings place standing always ready but empty there is heartily his friend the munchows are diligent in getting up balls rural gayeties for him so the hillesnay hille severe finance tutor has a mamsell hille whom it is pleasant to dance with preuss i 59 nor indeed is she the only fascinating specimen or flower of loveliness in those peaty regions as we shall see on the whole his royal highness after the first paroxysms of royal suspicion are over and forgiveness beginning to seem possible to the royal mind has a supportable time of it and possesses his soul in patience in activity and hope  unpermitted things once for all he must avoid to do perhaps he will gradually discover that many of them were foolish things better not done he walks warily to this all things continually admonish we trace in him some real desire to be wise to do and learn what is useful if he can here but the grand problem which is reality itself to him is always to regain favor with papa and this papa being what he is gives a twist to all other problems the young man may have for they must all shape themselves by this and introduces something of artificialnot properly of hypocritical for that too is fatal if found outbut of calculated reticent of halfsincere on the sons part an inevitable feature plentifully visible in their correspondence now and henceforth corresponding with papa and his grumkow and watched at every step by such an argus as the tobaccoparliament real frankness of speech is not quite the recommendable thing apparent frankness may be the safer besides mastery in the domain sciences i perceive the crownprince had to study here another art useful to him in after life the art of wearing among his fellowcreatures a polite cloakofdarkness gradually he becomes master of it as few are a man politely impregnable to the intrusion of human curiosity able to look cheerily into the very eyes of men and talk in a social way face to face and yet continue intrinsically invisible to them an art no less essential to royalty than that of the domain sciences itself andif at all consummately done and with a scorn of mendacity for help as in this casea difficult art it is the chief feature in the two or three thousand letters we yet have of friedrichs to all manner of correspondents letters written with the gracefulest flowing rapidity polite affablerefusing to give you the least glimpse into his real inner man or tell you any particular you might impertinently wish to know  as the history of friedrich in this custrin epoch and indeed in all epochs and parts is still little other than a whirlpool of simmering confusions dust mainly and sibylline papershreds in the pages of poor dryasdust perhaps we cannot do better than snatch a shred or two of the partly legible kind or capable of being made legible out of that hideous caldron pin them down at their proper dates and try if the reader can by such means catch a glimpse of the thing with his own eyes here is shred first a piece in grumkows hand  this treats of a very grand incident which forms an era or turningpoint in the custrin life majesty has actually after hopes long held out of such a thing looked in upon the prodigal at custrin in testimony of possible pardon in the distancesees him again for the first time since that scene at wesel with the drawn sword after year and day grumkow for behoof of seckendorf and the vienna people has drawn a rough protocol of it and here it is snatched from the dustwhirlwinds and faithfully presented to the english reader his majesty is travelling towards sonnenburg on some grand knightofmalta ceremony there and halts at custrin for a couple of hours as he passes     grumkows protokoll of the 15th august 1731 or summary of what took place at custrin that day  his majesty arrived at custrin yesterday gestern monday 15thhour not mentioned and proceeded at once to the government house with an attendance of several hundred persons majorgeneral lepel commandant of custrin colonel derschau and myself are immediately sent for to his majestys apartment there privycouncillor walden princes hofmarschall a solid legal man is ordered by his majesty to bring the crownprince over from his house who accordingly in a few minutes attended by rohwedel and natzmer the two kammerjunkers entered the room where his majesty and we were  so soon as his majesty turning round had sight of him the crownprince fell at his feet having bidden him rise his majesty said with a severe mien  you will now bethink yourself what passed year and day ago and how scandalously you saw fit to behave yourself and what a godless enterprise you took in hand as i have had you about me from the beginning and must know you well i did all in the world that was in my power by kindness and by harshness to make an honorable man of you as i rather suspected your evil purpose i treated you in the harshest and sharpest way in the saxon camp at radewitz in those gala days in hopes you would consider yourself and take another line of conduct would confess your faults to me and beg forgiveness but all in vain you grew ever more stiffnecked when a young man gets into follies with women one may try to overlook it as the fault of his age but to do with forethought basenesses lacheteen and ugly actions that is unpardonable you thought to carry it through with your headstrong humor but hark ye my lad hore mein kerl if thou wert sixty or seventy instead of eighteen thou couldst not cross my resolutions it would take a bigger man to do that my lad and as up to this date bis dato i have managed to sustain myself against any comer there will be methods found of bringing thee to reason too  how have not i on all occasions meant honorably by you last time i got wind of your debts how did i as a father admonish you to tell me all i would pay all you were only to tell me the truth whereupon you said there were still two thousand thalers beyond the sum named i paid these also at once and fancied i had made peace with you and then it was found by and by you owed many thousands more and as you now knew you could not pay it was as good as if the money had been stolennot to reckon how the french vermin montholieu and partner cheated you with their new loans pfuinothing touched me so much continues his majesty verging towards the pathetic as that you had not any trust in me all this that i was doing for aggrandizement of the house the army and finances could only be for you if you made yourself worthy of it i here declare i have done all things to gain your friendshipand all has been in vain at which words the crownprince with a very sorrowful gesture threw himself at his majestys feettears presumably in both their eyes by this time  was it not your intention to go to england asked his majesty farther on the prince answered jathen hear what the consequences would have been your mother would have got into the greatest misery i could not but have suspected she was the author of the business your sister i would have cast for life into a place where she never would have seen sun and moon again then on with my army into hanover and burn and ravage yes if it had cost me life land and people your thoughtless and godless conduct see what it was leading to i intended to employ you in all manner of business civil military but how after such an action could i show the face of you to my officers soldiers and other servantsthe one way of repairing all this is that you seek regardless of your very life in comparison to make the fault good again at which words the crownprince mournfully threw himself at his royal majestys feet begging to be put upon the hardest proofs he would endure all things so as to recover his majestys grace and esteem  whereupon the king asked him was it thou that temptedst katte or did katte tempt thee the crownprince without hesitation answered i tempted himi am glad to hear the truth from you at any rate  the dialogue now branches out into complex general form out of which intent upon abridging we gather the following points king loquitur  how do you like your custrin life still as much aversion to wusterhausen and to wearing your shroud sterbekittel name for the tight uniform you would now be so glad of and think quite other than a shroud as you called it princes answer wantinglikely enough my company does not suit you i have no french manners and cannot bring out bonmots in the petitmaitre way and truly regard all that as a thing to be flung to the dogs i am a german prince and mean to live and die in that character but you can now say what you have got by your caprices and obstinate heart hating everything that i liked and if i distinguished any one despising him if an officer was put in arrest you took to lamenting about him your real friends who intended your good you hated and calumniated those that flattered you and encouraged your bad purpose you caressed you see what that has come to in berlin in all prussia for some time back nobody asks after you whether you are in the world or not and were it not one or the other coming from custrin who reports you as playing tennis and wearing french hairbags nobody would know whether you were alive or dead  hard sayings to which the princes answers if there were any beyond mournful gestures are not given we come now upon predestination or the gnadenwahl and learn with real interest not of the laughing sort alone how his majesty in the most conclusive way set forth the horrible results of that absolutedecree notion which makes out god to be the author of sin and that jesus christ died only for some upon which the crownprince vowed and declared hoch und theuer he was now wholly of his majestys orthodox opinion  the king now thoroughly moved expresses satisfaction at the orthodoxy and adds with enthusiasm when godless fellows about you speak against your duties to god the king and your country fall instantly on your knees and pray with your whole soul to jesus christ to deliver you from such wickedness and lead you on better ways and if it come in earnest from your heart jesus who would have all men saved will not leave you unheard no and so may god in his mercy aid you poor son fritz and as for me in hopes the time coming will show fruits i forgive you what is pastto which the crownprince answered with monosyllables with many tears kissing his majestys feetand as the kings eyes were not dry he withdrew into another room revolving many things in his altered soul  it being his majestys birthday 4th august by old style 15th by new fortythird birthday the prince all bewept and in emotion followed his father and again falling prostrate testified such heartfelt joy gratitude and affection over this blessed anniversary as quite touched the heart of papa who at last clasped him in his arms poor soul after all and hurried out to avoid blubbering quite aloud he stept into his carriage intending for sonnenburg chiefly by water this evening where a serene cousin one of the schwedt margraves head knight of malta has his establishment  the crownprince followed his majesty out and in the presence of many hundred people kissed his majestys feet again linen gaiters not dayandmartin shoes and was again embraced by his majesty who said behave well as i see you mean and i will take care of you which threw the crownprince into such an ecstasy of joy as no pen can express and so the carriages rolled awaytowards the knightsofmalta business and palace of the head knight of malta in the first place forster iii 5054  these are the main points says grumkow reporting next day and the reader must interpret them as he can a crownprince with excellent histrionic talents thinks the reader well a certain exaggeration immensity of wish becoming itself enthusiasm somewhat of that but that is by no means the whole or even the main part of the phenomenon o reader this crownprince has a real affection to his father as we shall in time convince ourselves say at lowest a crownprince loyal to fact able to recognize overwhelming fact and aware that he must surrender thereto surrender once made the element much clears itself papas side of the question getting fairly stated for the first time sure enough papa is gods vicegerent in several undeniable respects most important some of them better try if we can obey papa  dim old fassmann yields a spark or twoas

undecipherable to the reader and me would throw light on the point     schulenburgs three letters to grumkow on visits to the crownprince during the custrin time  the reader knows lieutenantgeneral schulenburg stiff little military gentleman of grave years nephew of the maypole emerita who is called duchess of kendal in england had a horse shot under him at malplaquet battlings and experiences

off he has just been at vienna september 1731 militairlexikon iii 433 on some business quasidiplomatic probably which can remain unknown to us and has reported upon it or otherwise finished it off at berlinwhence rapidly home to landsberg again on the way homewards and after getting home he writes these three letters offhand and in all privacy and of course with a business sincerity to grumkowlittle thinking they would one day get printed and wander into these latitudes to be scanned and scrutinized undoubtedly an intricate crabbed document to us but then an indubitable one crownprince schulenburg himself and the actual figure of time and place are here mirrored for us with a business sincerity in the mind of schulenburgas from an accidental patch of water ruffled bogwater in sad twilight and with sedges and twigs intervening but under these conditions we do look with our own eyes  could not one by any conceivable method interpret into legibility this abstruse dull document and so pick out here and there a glimpse actual facetoface view of crownprince friedrich in his lightgray frock with the narrow silver tresses in his eclipsed condition there in the custrin region all is very mysterious about him his inward opinion about all manner of matters from the gnadenwahl to the late doublemarriage question even his outward manner of life in its fleshandblood physiognomywe search in vain through tons of dusty lucubration totally without interest to catch here and there the corner of a feature of it let us try schulenburg we shall know at any rate that to grumkow in the autumn 1731 these words were luculent and significant consciously they tell us something of young friedrich unconsciously a good deal of lieutenantgeneral schulenburg who with his strict theologies his military stiffnesses his reticent pipeclayed rigorous and yet human ways is worth looking at as an antique species extinct in our time he is just home from vienna

excellency again before i left berlin i set off between seven and eight in the morning yesterday and got to custrin seventy miles or so before seven at night but the prince had gone that day to the bailliage of himmelstadt up the warta country eastward some fiveandthirty miles much preparatory digging and stubbing there and he slept at massin circuitous road back where he shot a few stags this morning as i was told he might probably dine at kammin still nearer custrin twelve miles from it half that distance east of zorndorfmark that o reader see map with madam colonel schoning i drove thither he had arrived there a moment before me and who is madam schoning lady of kammin herepatience reader  i found him much grown an air of health and gayety about him he caressed me greatly me gracieusa fort afterwards questioned me about my way of life in vienna and asked if i had diverted myself well there i told him what business had been the occasion of my journey and that this rather than amusements had occupied me for the rest that there had been great affluence of company and no lack of diversions he spoke a long time to madam de wreech   wrochem schulenburg calls her young wife

on the elector palatines mistress crotchety old gentleman never out of quarrels with heidelberg protestants heirs of julich and berg and in general with an unreasonable world whom we saw at mannheim last year has a mistresselector valatines mistress called taxis crownprince said i should like to know what that good old gentleman does with a mistress i answered that the fashion had come so much in vogue princes did not think they were princes unless they had mistresses and that i was amazed at the facility of women how they could shut their eyes on the sad reverse of fortune nearly inevitable for themand instanced the example of madam gravenitz  gravenitz example lately fallen out at wurtemberg as we predicted prayers of the country deliver us from evil are now answered there gravenitz

toujours un lavement a ses trousses  there were other subjects touched upon and i always endeavored to deduce something of moral instruction from them being a military gentleman of the old school  among other things he said he liked the great world and was charmed to observe the ridiculous weak side of some people that is excellent said i if one profit by it oneself but if it is only for amusement such a motive is worth little we should rather look out for our own ridiculous weak side on rising hofmarschall wolden said to me without much sincerity you have done well to preach a little morality to him the prince went to a window and beckoned me thither  you have learned nothing of what is to become of me said he i answered it is supposed your royal highness will return to berlin when the marriage wilhelminas takes place but as to what will come next i have heard nothing but as your highness has friends they will not fail to do their endeavor and m de grumkow has told me he would try to persuade the king to give you a regiment in order that your highness might have something to do it seemed as if that would give him pleasure i then took the liberty of saying monseigneur the most at present depends on yourselfhow so asked he i answered it is only by showing good conduct and proofs of real wisdom and worth that the kings entire favor can be gained first of all to fear godand in fact i launched now into a moral preachment or discursive dialogue of great length much needing to have the skirts of it tucked up in a way of faithful abridgment for behoof of poor english readers as follows  schulenburg if your highness behave well the king will accord what you want but it is absolutely necessary to begin by thatprince i do nothing that can displease the kingschulenburg it would be a little soon yet but i speak of the future your highness the grand thing i recommend is to fear god everybody says you have the sentiments of an honest man excellent that for a beginning but without the fear of god your highness the passions stifle the finest sentiments must lead a life clear of reproach and more particularly on the chapter of women need not imagine you can do the least thing without the kings knowing it if your highness take the bad road he will wish to correct it the end will be he will bring you back to live beside him which will not be very agreeableprince hmph noschulenburg of the ruin to health i do not speak iprince pooh one is young one is not master of thatand in fact on this delicate chapter which runs to some length prince answers as wildish young fellows will quizzing my grave self with glances even at his majesty on alleged old peccadilloes of ours which allegations or inferences i rebutted with emphasis but i confess though i employed all my rhetoric his mind did not seem to alter and it will be a miracle if he change on this head alas general cant be helped i fear  he said he was not afraid of anything so much as of living constantly beside the kingschulenburg arm yourself with patience monseigneur if that happen god has given you sense enough persevere to use it faithfully on all occasions you will gain the good graces of the kingprince impossible beyond my power indeed said he and made a thousand objectionsschulenburg your highness is like one that will not learn a trade because you do not already know it begin you will certainly never know it otherwise before rising in the morning form a plan for your dayin fact be moral oh be moral  his highness now got upon the marriages talked of for him an important point for the young man he spoke hopefully rather of the marriage with the princess of mecklenburgniece of the late czar peter the great daughter of that unhappy duke who is in quarrel with his ritters and a trouble to all his neighbors and to us among the number readers recollect that young ladys serene mother and a meeting she once had with her uncle peterat magdeburg a dozen years ago in a public drawingroom with alcove near anecdote not lightly to be printed in human types nor repeated where not necessary the mother is now dead father still up to the eyes in puddle and trouble but as for the young lady herself she is niece to the now czarina anne by law of primogeniture heiress of all the russias something of a match truly  but there will be difficulties your highness to change your religion for one thingprince wont by any meansschulenburg and give up the succession to prussiaprince a right fool if i didschulenburg then this marriage comes to nothingthereupon next he said if the kaiser is so strong for us let him give me his second daughter lucky franz of lorraine is to get the firstschulenburg are you seriousprince why not with a duchy or two it would do very wellschulenburg no duchies possible under the pragmatic sanction your highness besides your change of religionprince oh as to that neverthen this marriage also comes to nothing of the english and their doublemarriage and their hotham brabble he spoke lightly as of an extinct matterin terms your excellency will like  but said i since you speak so much of marriages i suppose you wish to be marriedprince no but if the king absolutely will have it i will marry to obey him after that i will shove my wife into the corner planterai la ma femme and live after my own fancyschulenburg horrible to think of for in the first place your highness is it not written in the law of god adulterers shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven and in the second place and in the third and fourth placeto all which he answered as wild young fellows do especially if you force marriage on them i can perceive if he marries it will only be to have more liberty than now it is certain if he had his elbows free he would strike out sen donnerait a gauche he said to me several times i am young i want to profit by my youth a questionable young fellow herr general especially if you force marriage on him  this conversation done continues the general he set to talking with the madam wreech and her complexion of lily and rose but he did not stay long drove off about five dinner at the stroke of twelve in those countries inviting me to see him again at custrin which i promised  and so the prince is off in the autumn sunset driving down the peaty hollow of the warta through unpicturesque country which produces wreechs and incomparable flowers nevertheless yes and if he look a six miles to the right there is the smoke of the evening kettles from zorndorf rising into the sky and across the river a twenty miles to the left is kunersdorf poor sleepy sandy hamlets where nettles of the devil are to be plucked one day  the beautiful wreech drove off to tamsel her fine house i to this wretched tavern where a couple of hours after that conversation i began writing it all down and have nothing else to do for the night your excellencys most moral stiffnecked pipeclayed and extremely obedient  von schulenbubg  forster iii 6571  this young man may be orthodox on predestination and outwardly growing all that a papa could wish but here are strange heterodoxies here is plenty of mutinous capricious fire in the interior of him herr general in fact a young man unfortunately situated already become solitary in creation has not except himself a friend in the world available just now tempestuous papa storms one way tempestuous mamma nature another and between the outsids and the inside there are inconsistencies enough  concerning the fair wreech of tamsel with her complexion of lily and rose there ensued by and by much whispering and rumoring underbreath which has survived in the apocryphal anecdotebooks not in too distinct a form here from first hand are three words which we may take to be the essence of the whole grumkow reporting in a sordid occasionally smutty spy manner to his seckendorf from berlin eight or ten months hence has this casual expression he king friedrich wilhelm told me in confidence that wreech the colonels wife isto p r princeroyal and that wreech vowed he would not own it for his and his majesty in secret is rather pleased adds the smutty spy grumkow to seckendorf

another child in this world domestic tamsel had to allay itself as it best could and the fair wreech became much a stranger to friedrichsurprisingly so to friedrich the king as perhaps we may see

vacant on the gossiping points cautiously official both these we go now to the second letter and the thirdfrom landsberg about a fortnight later  no 2 to his excellency shovelful of titles von grumkow in berlin  landsberg 19th october 1731  the day before yesterday that is wednesday 17th october i received an order to have only fifty horse at that post andorder which shows us that there has fallen out some recruiting squabble on the polish frontier hereabouts that the polack gentlemen have seized certain corporals of ours but are about restoring them order and affair which we shall omit corporals will be got back but as these polack gentlemen will see by the course taken that we have no great stomach for biting i fancy they will grow more insolent then ware who tries to recruit there for the future  on the same day i was apprised from custrin that the princeroyal had resolved on an excursion to carzig and thence to the bailliage of himmelstadt digging and stubbing now on foot at himmelstadt too which is but a couple of miles demimille german from this that there would be a little hunt between the two bailliages and that if i chose to come i might and the prince would dine with mewhich i did and so here again thursday 18th october 1731 in those remote wartaoder countries is a glimpse of his royal highness at first hand schulenburg continues not even taking a new paragraph which indeed he never does  they had shut up a couple of spiesser young roes and some stags in the old wreck of a saugarten boarpark between carzig and himmelstadt fast ruinirten saugarten he calls it daintily throwing in a touch of german here the prince shot one or two of them and his companions the like but it does not seem as if this amusement were much to his taste he went on to himmelstadt and at noon he arrived here in my poor domicile at landsberg  at one oclock we went to table and sat till four he spoke only of very indifferent things except saying to me do you know the king has promised 400000 crowns 60000 pounds towards disengaging those bailliages of the margraf of baireuthsold margraf bailliages pawned to raise ready cash readers remember what interminable lawpleading there was till friedrich wilhelm put it into a liquid state pay me back the moneys then supra pp 161163400000 thalers to the old margraf in case his prince wilhelminas now bridegroom have a son by my sister i answered i had heard nothing of itbut said he that is a great deal of money and some hundred thousands more have gone the like road to anspach who never will be able to repay for all is much in disorder at anspach give the margraf his heronhunt chasse au heron he cares for nothing and his people pluck him at no allowance i said that if these princes would regulate their expenditure they might little by little pay off their debts that i had been told at vienna the baireuth bailliages were mortgaged on very low terms those who now held them making eight or ten per cent of their moneythat the margraf ought to make an effort and so on i saw very well that these loans the king makes are not to his mind  directly on rising from table he went away excusing himself to me that he could not pass the night here that the king would not like his sleeping in the town besides that he had still several things to complete in a report he was sending off to his majesty he went to nassin and slept there for my own share i did not press him to remain what i did was rather in the way of form there were with him president munchow civil gentleman whom we know an engineer captain reger and the three gentlemen of his court wolden rohwedel katzmer who once twirled his finger in a certain mouth the insipid fellow   map goes heremissing   he is no great eater but i observed he likes the small dishes petits plats and the high tastes he does not care for fish though i had very fine trouts he never touched them he does not take brown soup soupe au bouillon it did not seem to me he cared for wine he tastes at all the wines but commonly stands by burgundy with water  i introduced to him all the officers of my regiment who are here he received them in the style of a king en roi plenty of quiet pride in him herr general it is certain he feels what he is born to and if ever he get to it will stand on the top of it as to me i mean to keep myself retired and shall see of him as little as i can i perceive well he does not like advice especially when administered in the way of preachment by stiff old military gentlemen of the allwise stampand does not take pleasure except with people inferior to him in mind his first aim is to find out the ridiculous side of every one and he loves to banter and quiz it is a fault in a prince he ought to know peoples faults and not to make them known to anybody whateverwhich we perceive is not quite the method with private gentlemen of the allwise type  i speak to your excellency as a friend and assure you he is a prince who has talent but who will be the slave of his passions se fera dominer par ses passionsnot a felicitous prophecy herr general and will like nobody but such as encourage him therein for me i think all princes are cast in the same mould there is only a more and a less  at parting he embraced me twice and said i am sorry i cannot stay longer but another time i will profit better wolden one of the three told me he could not describe how wellintentioned for your excellency the princeroyal is cunning dog who says often to wolden doubtless guessing it will be resaid if i cannot show him my gratitude i will his posterityprofoundly obliged to the grumkow kindred first and lasti remain your excellencys most pipeclayed  von schulenburg  forster iii 7173  and so after survey of the spademen at carzig and himmelstadt where colonel wreech by the way is amtshauptmann official headman after shooting a spiesser or two and dining and talking in this sort his royal highness goes to sleep at massin and ends one day of his then life we proceed to letter no 3  a day or two after no 2 it would appear his majesty who is commonly at wusterhausen hunting in this season has been rapidly out to crossen in these landsberg regions to south within a days drive of landsberg rapidly looking after something grumkow and another official attending himother official truchsess is truchsess von

whom we saw last year at bonn richest pluralist of the church whom doubtless our poor readers have forgotten again mention of him and also considerable sulky humor of the majestysopposition kind on schulenburgs part for which reason and generally as a poor direct reflex of time and placereflex by ruffled bogwater through sedges and in twilight dim but indubitablewe give the letter though the prince is little spoken of in it   no 3 to the excellency grumkow as above in berlin  landsberg 22d october monday 1731  monsieuri trust your excellency made your journey to crossen with all the satisfaction imaginable had i been warned sooner i would have come not only to see the king but for your excellencys sake and truchsesss but i received your excellencys letter only yesterday morning

borders if such things would make any impression on the spirit of our master but they do not theyin short this recruiting system is delirious thinks the stiff schulenburg and scruples not to say so though not in his place in parliament or even tobaccoparliament for there is a majestys opposition in all lands and times we ruin the country says the honorable member sending annually millions of money out of it for a set of vagabond fellows gens a sac et a corde who will never do us the least service one sees clearly it is the hand of god darkening some peoples understanding otherwise it might be possible their eyes would open one time or anothera stiff pipeclayed gentleman of great wisdom with plenty of sulphur burning in the heart of him the rest of his letter is all in the opposition strain almost as if from his place in parliament only far briefer than is usual within these walls and winds up with a glance at victor amadeuss strange feat or rather at the sons feat done upon victor over in sardinia preceded by this interjectionary sentence on a prince nearer home  as to the princeroyal depend on it he will do whatever is required of him marry anybody you like c if you give him more elbowroom for that is whither he aimsnot a bad stroke that of the king of sardiniagrand news of the day at that time now somewhat forgotten and requiring a word from us  old king

majesty say his new ministers is and will continue king not a bad stroke of him thinks schulenburgespecially if his father meant to play him the same trick that is clap him in prison not a bad strokewhich perhaps there is another that could imitate if his papa gave him the opportunity but this papa will take good care and the queen will not forget the sardinian business when he talks again

contemporary glimpses of a young man that has become historical and of the scene he lived in and with these three accidental utterances as if they which are alone left had been the sum of all he said in the world let the lieutenantgeneral withdraw now into silence he will turn up twice again after half a score of years once in a nobler than talking attitude the closeharnessed stalwart slightly atrabiliar military gentleman of the old prussian school  these glimpses of the crownprince reflected on us in this manner are not very luculent to the readerlight being indifferent and mirror none of the bestbut some features do gleam forth good and not so good which with others coming may gradually coalesce into something conceivable a prince clearly of much spirit and not without petulance abundant fire much of it shining and burning irregularly at present being sore held down from without and anomalously situated pride enough thinks schulenburg capricious petulance enoughlikely to go into a reign of the passions if we live as will be seen  wilhelmina was betrothed in june last wilhelmina a bride these six months continues to be much tormented by mamma but the bridegroom prince of baireuth is gradually recommending himself to persons of judgment to wilhelmina among others one day he narrowly missed an unheardof accident a foolish servant at some boarhunt gave him a loaded piece on the halfcock halfcock slipped in the handling bullet grazed his majestys very temple was felt twitching the hair thereye heavens whereupon impertinent remarks from some of the dessau people allies of schwedt and the margravine in high colors which were well answered by the prince and noiselessly but severely checked by a wellbred king wilhelmina i 356 king has given the prince of baireuth a regiment and likes him tolerably though the young man will not always drink as could be wished wedding in spite of clouds from her majesty is coming steadily on     his majestys building operations  this year says fassmann the building operations both in berlin and stettinin stettin where new fortifications are completed in berlin where gradually whole new quarters are getting builtwere exceedingly pushed forward ausserst poussirt alas yes this too is a questionable memorable feature of his majestys reign late majesty old king friedrich i wishfulas others had been for the growth of berlin laid out a new quarter and called it friedrichs stadt scraggy boggy ground planned out into streets friedrichs strasse the chief street with here and there a house standing lonesomely prophetic on it but it is this present majesty friedrich wilhelm that gets the plan executed and the friedrichs strasse actually built not always in a soft or spontaneous manner friedrich wilhelm was the aedile of his country as well as the drillsergeant berlin city did not rise of its own accord or on the principle of leavealone any more than the prussian army itself wreck and rubbish friedrich wilhelm will not leave alone in any kind but is intent by all chances to sweep them from the face of the earth that something useful seemly to the royal mind may stand there instead hence these building operations in the friedrich street and elsewhere so exceedingly pushed forward  the number of scraggy waste places he swept clear first and last and built tight human dwellings upon is almost uncountable a common gift from him as from his son after him to a man in favor was that of a new good housean excellent gift or if the man is himself able to build majesty will help him incite him timber enough is in the royal forests stone lime are in the royal quarries scraggy waste is abundant why should any man of the least industry or private capital live in a bad house by degrees the pressure of his majesty upon private men to build with encouragement became considerable became excessive irresistible and was much complained of in these years now come old colonel derschau is the kings agent at berlin in this matter a hard stiff man squeezes men all manner of men with the least capital till they build  nussler for example whom we once saw at hanover managing a certain contested heritage for

knows substantial clear ashlar street miles or halfmiles long straight as a linefriedrich wilhelm found it scrag and quagmire and left it what the tourist sees by these hard methods thus herr privycouncillor klinggraf too nusslers next neighbor he did not want to build far from it but was obliged on worse terms than nussler you have such work founding your housefor the nusslerklinggraf spot was a fishpool and carps were dug up in foundingsuch piles bound platform of solid beams 4000 thalers gone before the first stone is laid and in fact the house must be built honestly or it will be worse for the house and you cost me 12000 thalers 1800 pounds in all and is worth perhaps 2000 sorrowfully ejaculates nussler when the job is over still worse with privycouncillor klinggraf his house the next to nusslers is worth mere nothing to him when built a soapboiler offers him 800 thalers 120 pounds for it and nussler to avoid suffocation purchases it himself of klinggraf for that sum derschau with his slow screwmachinery is very formidableand busching knows it for a fact that respectable berlin persons used to run out of the way of burgermeister koch and him when either of them turned up on the streets  these things were heavy to bear truly yes where is the liberty of private capital or liberty of almost any kind on those terms liberty to annihilate rubbish and chaos under known conditions you may have but not the least liberty to keep them about you though never so fond of doing it what shall we say nussler and the soapboiler do both live in houses more human than they once had berlin itself and some other things did not spring from freetrade berlin city would to this day have been a place of scrubs the berlin a mere appellative noun to that effect had freetrade always been the rule there i am sorry his majesty transgresses the limitsand we my friends if we can make our chaos into cosmos by firing parliamentary eloquence into it and bombarding it with bluebooks we will much triumph over his majesty one day  thus are the building operations exceedingly pushed forward the ear of jenkins torn off and victor amadeus locked in ward while our crownprince in the eclipsed state is inspected by a sage in pipeclay and wilhelminas wedding is coming on     chapter vi  wilhelminas wedding  tuesday 20th november 1731 wilhelminas weddingday arrived after a brideship of eight months and that young ladys troublesome romance more happily than might have been expected did at last wind itself up mammas unreasonable humors continued more or less but these also must now end old wooers and outlooks the four or three crowned headsthey lie far over the horizon faded out of ones very thoughts all these charles xii peter ii are dead weissenfels is not but might as well be prince fred not yet wedded elsewhere is doing french madrigals in leicester house tending forwards the west wickham set of politicians the pittlyttelton set stands ill with father and mother and will not come to much august the dilapidatedstrong is deep in polish troubles in antikaiser politics in drinkingboutshis greattoe never mended never will mend gone to the spectral state all these here blooming with life in its cheeks is the one practical fact our good hereditary prince of baireuthprivately our fate all alongwhich we will welcome cheerfully and be thankful to heaven that we have not died in getting it decided for us  wedding was of great magnificence berlin palace and all things and creatures at their brightest the brunswickbeverns here and other high guests no end of pompous ceremonials solemnities and splendorsthe very train of ones gown was twelve yards long eschewing all which the reader shall commodiously conceive it all by two samples we have picked out for him one sample of a person high guest present one of an apartment where the sublimities went on  the duchess dowager of sachsenmeiningen who has come to honor us on this occasion a very large lady verging towards sixty she is the person a living elderly daughter of the great elector himself halfsister to the late king halfaunt to friedrich wilhelm widow now of her third husband a singular phenomenon to look upon for a moment through wilhelminas satirical spectacles one of her three husbands christian ernst of baireuth margraf there while the present line was but expectant had been a kind of welshuncle to the prince now bridegroom so that she has a double right to be here she had found the secret of totally ruining baireuth says wilhelmina baireuth and courland as well where her first wedlock wasperhaps meiningen was done to her hand here is the portrait of my grandaunt dashed off in very high colors not by a flattering pencil  it is said she was very fond of pleasing in her youth one saw as much still by her affected manners she would have made an excellent actress to play fantastic parts of that kind her flaming red countenance her shape of such monstrous extent that she could hardly walk gave her the air of a female bacchus she took care to expose to view hera part of her person large but no longer beautifuland continually kept patting it with her hands to attract attention thither though sixty gonefiftyseven in point of factshe was tricked out like a girl hair done in ribbonlocks marronnes all filled with gewgaws of rosepink color which was the prevailing tint in her complexion and so loaded with colored jewels you would have taken her for the rainbow wilhelmina i 375  this charming old lady daughter of the grosse kurfurst and so very fat and rubicund had a son once he too is mentionable in his wayas a milestone parish milestone in the obscure chronology of those parts her first husband was the duke of courland to him she brought an heir who became duke in his turnand was the final duke last of the kettler or native line of dukes there the kettlers had been teutsch ritters commandants in courland they picked up that country for their own behoof when the ritterdom went down and this was the last of them he married anne of russia with the big cheek czar peters niece who is since become czarina and died shortly after twenty years ago with tears doubtless from the poor rosepink mother far away in baireuth and childless otherwise and also in a sense to the sorrow of courland which was hereby left vacant a prey to enterprising neighbors and on those terms it was that saxons moritz our dissolute friend who will be marechal de saxe one day made his clutch at courland backed by moneys of the french actress rumor of which still floats vaguely about moritz might have succeeded could he have done the first part of the feat fallen in love with swolncheeked anne dowager there but he could not could only pretend it courland therefore now that the swolncheek is become czarina falls to one bieren a born courlander who could last kettler annes husband died leaving only an old uncle fallen into papistry and other futility who till his death some twenty years after had to reside abroad and be nominal merely 1711 moritzs attempt with adrienne lecouvreurs cash was 1726 anne became sovereign of all the russias on her poor cousin peter iis death 1730 bieren biron as he tried to write himself being of poor birth did not get installed till 1737 and had he and courland both several tumbles after that before getting to stable equilibriumwe hurry to the grand apartment in berlin schloss and glance rapidly with wilhelmina in an abridged form how magnificent it is  royal apartment third floor of the palace at berlin one must say few things equal it in the world from the outer saloon or antechamber called salle des suisses where the halberdier and valet people wait you pass through six grand rooms into a saloon magnificently decorated thence through two rooms more and so into what they call the picturegallery a room ninety feet long all this is in a line grand all this but still only common in comparison from the picturegallery you turn to right or left is not said nor does it matter into a suite of fourteen great rooms each more splendid than the other lustre from the ceiling of the first room for example is of solid silver weighs in pounds avoirdupois i know not what but in silver coin 10000 crowns ceilings painted as by correggio wallmirrors between each pair of windows are twelve feet high and their piers trumeaux are of massive silver in front of each mirror table can be laid for twelve twelve serenities may dine there flanked by their mirror enjoying the correggiosities above and the practical sublimities all round and this is but the first of the fourteen and you go on increasing in superbness till for example in the last or superlative saloon you find a lustre weighing 50000 crowns the globe of it big enough to hold a child of eight years and the branches gueridons of it i forget how many feet or fathoms in extent silver to the heart nay the musicbalcony is of silver wearied fiddler lays his elbow on balustrades of that precious metal seldom if ever was seen the like in this superlative saloon the nuptial benediction was given wilhelmina i 381 nicolai ii 881  old king friedrich the expensive herr it was he that did the furnishing and correggiopainting of these sublime rooms but this of the masses of wrought silver this was done by friedrich wilhelmincited thereto by what he saw at dresden in august the strongs establishment and reflecting too that silver is silver whether you keep it in barrels in a coined form or work it into chandeliers mirrorframes and musicbalconiesthese things we should not have mentioned except to say that the massive silver did prove a hoard available in after times against a rainy day massive silver well mixed with copper first was all melted down stamped into current coins native and foreign and sent wandering over the world before a certain prince got through his sevenyears wars and other pinches that are ahead  in fine wilhelminas wedding was magnificent though one had rubs too and mamma was rather severe hair went all wrong by dint of overdressing and hung on ones face like a boys crownroyal they had put as indeed was proper on ones head hair was in twentyfour locks the size of your arm such was the queens order gown was of clothofsilver trimmed with spanish goldlace avec un point despagne dor train twelve yards longone was like to sink to the earth in such equipment courage my princessin fact the wedding went beautifully off with dances and sublimities slow solemn torchdance to conclude with in those unparalleled upper rooms grandaunt meiningen and many other stars and rainbows witnessing even the margravine of schwedt in her high colors was compelled to be there such variegated splendor such a dancing of the constellations sublunary berlin and all the world on tiptoe round it slow torchdance winding it up melted into the shades of midnight for this time and there was silence in berlin  but on the following nights there were balls of a less solemn character far pleasanter for dancing purposes it is to these to one of these that we direct the attention of all readers friday 23d there was again ball and royal evening partygrand apartment so called immense ball seven hundred couples all people of condition there were four quadrilles or dancing places in the big sea of qualityfigures each at its due distance in the grand suite of rooms wilhelmina presides in quadrille number one place assigned her was in the room called picturegallery queen and all the principalities were with wilhelmina she is to lead off their quadrille and take charge of it which she did with her accustomed fire and elasticityand was circling there on the light fantastic toe time six in the evening when grumkow whom she had been dunning for his bargain about friedrich the day before came up  i liked dancing says she and was taking advantage of my chances grumkow came up and interrupted me in the middle of a minuet eh mon dieu madame said grumkow you seem to have got bit by the tarantula dont you see those strangers who have just come in i stopt short and looking all round i noticed at last a young man dressed in gray whom i did not know go then embrace the priuceroyal there he is before you said grumkow all the blood in my body went topsyturvy for joy o heaven my brother cried i but i dont see him where is he in gods name let me see him grumkow led me to the young man in gray coming near i recognized him though with difficulty he had grown amazingly stouter prodigieusement engraisse shortened about the neck his face too had much changed and was no longer so beautiful as it had been i sprang upon him with open arms sautai au cou i was in such a state i could speak nothing but broken exclamations i wept i laughed like one gone delirious in my life i have never felt so lively a joy  the first sane step was to throw myself at the feet of the king king said are you content with me you see i have kept my word i took my brother by the hand and entreated the king to restore him his friendship this scene was so touching it drew tears from the eyes of everybody i then approached the queen she was obliged to embrace me the king being close opposite but i remarked that her joy was only affectedwhy then o princess guess if you can the female humors of her majesty  i turned to my brother again i gave him a thousand caresses and said the tenderest things to him to all which he remained cold as ice and answered only in monosyllables i presented the prince my husband to whom he did not say one word i was astonished at this fashion of procedure but i laid the blame of it on the king who was observing us and who i judged might be intimidating my brother but even his countenance surprised me he wore a proud air and seemed to look down on everybody  a muchchanged crownprince what can be the meaning of it neither king nor he appeared at supper they were supping elsewhere with a select circle and the whisper ran among us his majesty was treating him with great friendliness at which the queen contrary to hope could not conceal her secret pique in fact says wilhelmina again too hard on mamma she did not love her children except as they served her ambitious views the fact that it was i and not she who had achieved the princes deliverance was painful to her majesty alas yes in some degree  ball having recommenced grumkow whispered to me that the king was pleased with my frank kind ways to my brother and not pleased with my brothers cold way of returning it does he simulate and mean still to deceive me or is that all the thanks he has for wilhelmina thinks his majesty go on with your sincerity madam and for gods sake admonish the crownprince to avoid finessing crownprince when i did in some interval of the dance report this of grumkow and say why so changed and cold then brother of my heart answered that he was still the same and that he had his reasons for what he did wilhelmina continues and cannot understand her crownprince at all  next morning by the kings order he paid me a visit the prince my husband was polite enough to withdraw and left me and sousfeld alone with him he gave me a recital of his misfortunes i communicated mine to himand how i had at last bargained to get him free again by my compliance he appeared much discountenanced at this last part of my narrative he returned thanks for the obligations i had laid on himwith some caressings which evidently did not proceed from the heart to break this conversation he started some indifferent topic and under pretence of seeing my apartment moved into the next room where the prince my husband was him he ran over with his eyes from head to foot for some time then after some constrained civilities to him went his way what to make of all this madam sonsfeld shrugged her shoulders no end of madam sousfelds astonishment at such a crownprince  alas yes poor wilhelmina a crownprince got into terrible cognizance of facts since we last met him perhaps already sees not only what a height of place is cut out for him in this world but also in a dim way what a solitude of soul if he will maintain his height top of the frozen schreckhornhave you well considered such a position and even the way thither is dangerous is terrible in this case be not too hard upon your crownprince for it is certain he loves you to the last  captain dickens who alone of all the excellencies was not at the weddingand never had believed it would be a wedding but only a rumor to bring england roundduly chronicles this happy reappearance of the princeroyal about six yesterday evening as the company was dancingto the great joy and surprise of the whale courtand adds this morning the prince came to the public parade where crowds of people of all ranks flocked to see his royal highness and gave the most open demonstrations of pleasure despatch 24th november 1731  wilhelmina these noisy tumults not all of them delightful once done gets out of the perplexed hurlyburly home towards still baireuth shortly after newyear 11th january 1732 wilhelmina ii 20 berlin was become as odious to me as it had once been dear i flattered myself that renouncing grandeurs i might lead a soft and tranquil life in my new home and begin a happier year than the one that had just ended mamma was still perverse but on the edge of departure wilhelmina contrived to get a word of her father and privately open her heart to him poor father after all that has come and gone  my discourse produced its effect he melted into tears could not answer me for sobs he explained his thoughts by his embracings of me making an effort at length he said i am in despair that i did not know thee they had told me such horrible tales i hated thee as much as i now love thee if i had addressed myself direct to thee i should have escaped much trouble and thou too but they hindered me from speaking said thou wert illnatured as the devil and wouldst drive me to extremities i wanted to avoid thy mother by her intriguings is in part the cause of the misfortunes of the family i have been deceived and duped on every side but my hands are tied and though my heart is torn in pieces i must leave these iniquities unpunishedthe queens intentions were always good urged wilhelmina let us not enter into that detail answered he what is past is past i will try to forget it and assured wilhelmina that she was the dearest to him of the family and that he would do great things for her stillonly part of which came to effect in the sequel i am too sad of heart to take leave of you concluded he embrace your husband on my part i am so overcome that i must not see him wilhelmina ii 4 who dates 11th january 1732 and so they rolled away  crownprince was back to custrin again many weeks before back to custrin but under totally changed omens his history after that first emergence in wilhelminas dance 23d november about six pm and appearance at parade on the morrow saturday morning had been as follows monday november 26th there was again grand ball and the prince there not in gray this time next day the old dessauer and all the higher officers in berlin petitioned let us have him in the army again your majesty majesty consented and so friday 30th there was grand dinner at seckendorfs crownprince there in soldiers uniform again a completely pardoned youth his uniform is of the goltz regiment infantry goltz regiment which lies at ruppinat and about in that moory country to the northeast some thirty or forty miles from berlinwhither his destination now is  crownprince had to resume his kammer work at custrin and see the buildings at carzig for a three months longer till some arrangements in the regiment goltz were perfected and finishing improvements given to it but on the last day of february 29th 1732 being leapyear his royal highnesss commission to be colonel commandant of said regiment is made out and he proceeds in discharge of the same to ruppin where his men lie and so puts off the pikegray coat and puts on the military blue one preuss i 69never to quit it again as turned out  ruppin is a little town in that northwest fehrbellin region regiment goltz had lain in detached quarters hitherto but is now to lie at ruppin the first battalion of it there and the rest within reach here in ruppin itself or ultimately at reinsberg in the neighborhood was friedrichs abode for the next eight years habitual residence with transient excursions chiefly to berlin in carnival time or on other great occasions and always strictly on leave his employment being that of colonel of foot a thing requiring continual vigilance and industry in that country least of all to be neglected in any point by one in his circumstances he did his military duties to a perfection satisfactory even to papa and achieved on his own score many other duties and improvements for which papa had less value these eight years it is always understood were among the most important of his life to him   end of book viii
