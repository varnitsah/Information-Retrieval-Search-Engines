barrett moultonbarrett at the age of nine engraved by g cooke from a drawing by charles hayter london published by smith elder  co 15 waterloo place     prefatory note   in a recent memoir of elizabeth barrett browning by john h ingram it is observed that such essays on her personal history as have appeared either in england or elsewhere are replete with mistakes or misstatements for these he proposes to substitute a correct if short memoir but kindly and appreciative as may be mr ingrams performance there occur not a few passages in it equally mistaken and misstated  1 elizabeth the eldest daughter of edward moulton barrett was born in london on the 4th of march 1809 elizabeth was born march 6 1806 at coxhoe hall county of durham the residence of her fathera before she was eleven she composed an epic on marathon she was then fourteen  2 it is said that mr barrett was a man of intellect and culture and therefore able to direct his daughters education but be that so or not he obtained for her the tutorial assistance of the wellknown greek scholar hugh stuart boyd  who was also a writer of fluent verse and his influence and instruction doubtless confirmed miss barrett in her poetical aspirations mr boyd early deprived of sight from overstudy resided at malvern and cared for little else than greek literature especially that of the fathers he was about or over fifty stooped a good deal and was nearly bald his daily habit was to sit for hours before a table treating it as a piano with his fingers and reciting greekhis memory for which was such that on a folio column of his favourite st gregory being read to him he would repeat it without missing a syllable elizabeth then residing in herefordshire visited him frequently partly from her own love of greek and partly from a desire for the congenial society of one to whom her attendance might be helpful there was nothing in the least tutorial in this relationmerely the natural feeling of a girl for a blind and disabled scholar in whose pursuits she took interest her knowledge of greek was originally due to a preference for sharing with her brother edward in the instruction of his scottish tutor mr mswiney rather than in that of her own governess mrs orme and at such lessons she constantly assisted until her brothers departure for the charter housewhere he had thackeray for a schoolfellow in point of fact she was selftaught in almost every respect mr boyd was no writer of fluent verse though he published an unimportant volume and the literary sympathies of the friends were exclusively bestowed on greek  3 edward the eldest of the family was elizabeths younger by nearly two years he and his companions perished not just off teignmouth but in babbicombe bay the bodies drifted up channel and were recovered three days after  4 her fathers fortune was considerably augmented by his accession to the property of his only brother richard for many years speaker of the house of assembly at jamaica mr edward moulton by the will of his grandfather was directed to affix the name of barrett to that of moulton upon succeeding to the estates in jamaica richard was his cousin and by his death mr barrett did not acquire a shilling his only brother was samuel sometime mp for richmond he had also a sister who died young the fulllength portrait of whom by sir thomas lawrence the first exhibited by that painter is in the possession of octavius moultonbarrett at westover near calbourne in the isle of wight with respect to the semitropical taste of mr barrett so characterised in the memoir it may be mentioned that on the early death of his father he was brought from jamaica to england when a very young child as a ward of the late chief baron lord abinger then mr scarlett whom he frequently accompanied in his postchaise when on circuit he was sent to harrow but received there so savage a punishment for a supposed offence burning the toast by the youth whose fag he had become that he was withdrawn from the school by his mother and the delinquent was expelled at the age of sixteen he was sent by mr scarlett to cambridge and thence for an early marriage went to northumberland after purchasing the estate in herefordshire he gave himself up assiduously to the usual duties and occupations of a country gentlemanfarmed largely was an active magistrate became for a year high sheriff and in all county contests busied himself as a liberal he had a fine taste for landscapegardening planted considerably loved treesalmost as much as his friend the early correspondent of his daughter sir uvedale priceand for their sake discontinued keeping deer in the park  many other particulars concerning other people in other biographical memoirs which have appeared in england or elsewhere for some years past are similarly mistaken and misstated but they seem better left without notice by anybody

thought will be of the time far off when i was a child and wrote verses and when i dedicated them to you who were my public and my critic of all that such a recollection implies of saddest and sweetest to both of us it would become neither of us to speak before the world nor would it be possible for us to speak of it to one another with voices that did not falter enough that what is in my heart when i write thus will be fully known to yours  and my desire is that you who are a witness how if this art of poetry had been a less earnest object to me it must have fallen from exhausted hands before this daythat you who have shared with me in things bitter and sweet softening or enhancing them every daythat you who hold with me over all sense of loss and transiency one hope by one namemay accept from me the inscription of these volumes the exponents of a few years of an existence which has been sustained and comforted by you as well as given somewhat more fainthearted than i used to be it is my fancy thus to seem to return to a visible personal dependence on you as if indeed i were a child again to conjure your beloved image between myself and the public so as to be sure of one smileand to satisfy my heart while i sanctify my ambition by associating with the great pursuit of my life its tenderest and holiest affection                                                       your                                                             e b b   london 50 wimpole street             1844     preface  to the first collected edition of mrs brownings poems   the collection here offered to the public consists of poems which have been written in the interim between the period of the publication of my seraphim and the present variously coloured or perhaps shadowed by the life of which they are the natural expressionand with the exception of a few contributions to english or american periodicals are printed now for the first time  as the first poem of this collection the drama of exile is the longest and most important work to me which i ever trusted into the current of publication i may be pardoned for entreating the readers attention to the fact that i decided on publishing it after considerable hesitation and doubt the subject of the drama rather fastened on me than was chosen and the form approaching the model of the greek tragedy shaped itself under my hand rather by force of pleasure than of design but when the excitement of composition had subsided i felt afraid of my position my subject was the new and strange experience of the fallen humanity as it went forth from paradise into the wilderness with a peculiar reference to eves allotted grief which considering that selfsacrifice belonged to her womanhood and the consciousness of originating the fall to her offenceappeared to me imperfectly apprehended hitherto and more expressible by a woman than a man there was room at least for lyrical emotion in those first steps into the wildernessin that first sense of desolation after wrathin that first audible gathering of the recriminating groan of the whole creationin that first darkening of the hills from the recoiling feet of angelsand in that first silence of the voice of god and i took pleasure in driving in like a pile stroke upon stroke the idea of exileadmitting lucifer as an extreme adam to represent the ultimate tendencies of sin and lossthat it might be strong to bear up the contrary idea of the heavenly love and purity but when all was done i felt afraid as i said before of my position i had promised my own prudence to shut close the gates of eden between milton and myself so that none might say i dared to walk in his footsteps he should be within i thought with his adam and eve unfallen or fallingand i without with my exilesi also an exile it would not do the subject and his glory covering it swept through the gates and i stood full in it against my will and contrary to my vowtill i shrank back fearing almost desponding hesitating to venture even a passing association with our great poet before the face of the public whether at last i took courage for the venture by a sudden revival of that love of manuscript which should be classed by moral philosophers among the natural affections or by the encouraging voice of a dear friend it is not interesting to the reader to inquire neither could the fact affect the question since i bear of course my own responsibilities for the rest milton is too high and i am too low to render it necessary for me to disavow any rash emulation of his divine faculty on his own ground while enough individuality will be granted i hope to my poem to rescue me from that imputation of plagiarism which should be too servile a thing for every sincere thinker after all and at the worst i have only attempted in respect to milton what the greek dramatists achieved lawfully in respect to homer they constructed dramas on trojan ground they raised on the buskin and even clasped with the sock the feet of homeric heroes yet they neither imitated their homer nor emasculated him the agamemnon of Æschylus who died in the bath did no harm to nor suffered any harm from the agamemnon of homer who bearded achilles to this analogythe more favourable to me from the obvious exception in it that homers subject was his own possibly by creationwhereas miltons was his own by illustration onlyi appeal to this analogynot to this comparison be it understoodi appeal for the analogy of the stronger may apply to the weaker and the reader may have patience with the weakest while she suggests the application  on a graver point i must take leave to touch in further reference to my dramatic poem the divine saviour is represented in vision towards the close speaking and transfigured and it has been hinted to me that the introduction may give offence in quarters where i should be most reluctant to give any a reproach of the same class relating to the frequent recurrence of a great name in my pages has already filled me with regret how shall i answer these things frankly in any case when the old mysteries represented the holiest being in a rude familiar fashion and the people gazed on with the faith of children in their earnest eyes the critics of a succeeding age who rejoiced in congreve cried out profane yet andreinis mystery suggested miltons epic and milton the most reverent of poets doubting whether to throw his work into the epic form or the dramatic left on the latter basis a rough groundplan in which his intention of introducing the heavenly love among the persons of his drama is extant to the present day but the tendency of the present day is to sunder the daily life from the spiritual creedto separate the worshipping from the acting manand by no means to live by faith there is a feeling abroad which appears to me i say it with deference nearer to superstition than to religion that there should be no touching of holy vessels except by consecrated fingers nor any naming of holy names except in consecrated places as if life were not a continual sacrament to man since christ brake the daily bread of it in his hands as if the name of god did not build a church by the very naming of it as if the word god were not everywhere in his creation and at every moment in his eternity an appropriate word as if it could be uttered unfitly if devoutly i appeal on these points which i will not argue from the conventions of the christian to his devout heart and i beseech him generously to believe of me that i have done that in reverence from which through reverence he might have abstained and that where he might have been driven to silence by the principle of adoration i by the very same principle have been hurried into speech  it should have been observed in another placethe fact however being sufficiently obvious throughout the dramathat the time is from the evening into the night if it should be objected that i have lengthened my twilight too much for the east i might hasten to answer that we know nothing of the length of mornings or evenings before the flood and that i cannot for my own part believe in an eden without the longest of purple twilights the evening erev of genesis signifies a mingling and approaches the meaning of our twilight analytically apart from which considerations my exiles are surrounded in the scene described by supernatural appearances and the shadows that approach them are not only of the night  the next longest poem to the drama of exile in the collection is the vision of poets in which i have endeavoured to indicate the necessary relations of genius to suffering and selfsacrifice in the eyes of the living generation the poet is at once a richer and poorer man than he used to be he wears better broadcloth but speaks no more oracles and the evil of this social incrustation over a great idea is eating deeper and more fatally into our literature than either readers or writers may apprehend fully i have attempted to express in this poem my view of the mission of the poet of the selfabnegation implied in it of the great work involved in it of the duty and glory of what balzac has beautifully and truly called la patience angélique du génie and of the obvious truth above all that if knowledge is power suffering should be acceptable as a part of knowledge it is enough to say of the other poems that scarcely one of them is unambitious of an object and a significance  since my seraphim was received by the public with more kindness than its writer had counted on i dare not rely on having put away the faults with which that volume abounded and was mildly reproached something indeed i may hope to have retrieved because some progress in mind and in art every active thinker and honest writer must consciously or unconsciously make with the progress of existence and experience and in some sortsince we learn in suffering what we teach in songmy songs may be fitter to teach but if it were not presumptuous language on the lips of one to whom life is more than usually uncertain my favourite wish for this work would be that it be received by the public as a step in the right track towards a future indication of more value and acceptability i would fain do betterand i feel as if i might do better i aspire to do better it is no new form of the nympholepsy of poetry that my ideal should fly before meand if i cry out too hopefully at sight of the white vesture receding between the cypresses let me be blamed gently if justly in any case while my poems are full of faultsas i go forward to my critics and confessthey have my heart and life in themthey are not empty shells if it must be said of me that i have contributed immemorable verses to the many rejected by the age it cannot at least be said that i have done so in a light and irresponsible spirit poetry has been as serious a thing to me as life itself and life has been a very serious thing there has been no playing at skittles for me in either i never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry nor leisure for the hour of the poet i have done my work so far as worknot as mere hand and head work apart from the personal beingbut as the completest expression of that being to which i could attainand as work i offer it to the publicfeeling its shortcomings more deeply than any of my readers because measured from the height of my aspirationbut feeling also that the reverence and sincerity with which the work was done should give it some protection with the reverent and sincere    london 50 wimpole street             1844     advertisement   this edition including my earlier and later writings i have endeavoured to render as little unworthy as possible of the indulgence of the public several poems i would willingly have withdrawn if it were not almost impossible to extricate what has been once caught and involved in the machinery of the press the alternative is a request to the generous reader that he may use the weakness of those earlier verses which no subsequent revision has succeeded in strengthening less as a reproach to the writer than as a means of marking some progress in her other attempts                                                                e b b   london 1856     contents                                                                     page

gazed upon the face of god   this morning for a moment thou hadst known   that only pity fitly can chastise   hate but avenges    lucifer        as it is i know   something of pity when i reeled in heaven   and my sword grew too heavy for my grasp   stabbing through matter which it could not pierce   so much as the first shell oftoward the throne   when i fell back downstaring up as i fell   the lightnings holding open my scathed lids   and that thought of the infinite of god   hurled after to precipitate descent   when countless angel faces still and stern   pressed out upon me from the level heavens   adown the abysmal spaces and i fell   trampled down by your stillness and struck blind   by the sight within your eyestwas then i knew   how ye could pity my kind angelhood    gabriel alas discrowned one by the truth in me   which god keeps in me i would give away   allsave that truth and his love keeping it   to lead thee home again into the light   and hear thy voice chant with the morning stars   when their rays tremble round them with much song   sung in more gladness    lucifer                 sing my morning star   last beautiful last heavenly that i loved   if i could drench thy golden locks with tears   what were it to this angel    gabriel                   what love is   and now i have named god    lucifer                    yet gabriel   by the lie in me which i keep myself   thourt a false swearer were it otherwise   what dost thou here vouchsafing tender thoughts   to that earthangel or earthdemonwhich   thou and i have not solved the problem yet   enough to arguethat fallen adam there   that redclay and a breathwho must forsooth   live in a new apocalypse of sense   with beauty and music waving in his trees   and running in his rivers to make glad   his soul made perfectis it not for hope   a hope within thee deeper than thy truth   of finally conducting him and his   to fill the vacant thrones of me and mine   which affront heaven with their vacuity    gabriel angel there are no vacant thrones in heaven   to suit thy empty words glory and life   fulfil their own depletions and if god   sighed you far from him his next breath drew in   a compensative splendour up the vast   flushing the starry arteries    lucifer                 what a change   so let the vacant thrones and gardens too   fill as may please youand be pitiful   as ye translate that word to the dethroned   and exiled man or angel the fact stands   that i the rebel the cast out and down   am here and will not go while there along   the light to which ye flash the desert out   flies your adopted adam your redclay   in two kinds both being flawed why what is this   whose work is this whose hand was in the work   against whose hand in this last strife methinks   i am not a fallen angel    gabriel                 dost thou know   aught of those exiles    lucifer                ay i know they have fled   silent all day along the wilderness   i know they wear for burden on their backs   the thought of a shut gate of paradise   and faces of the marshalled cherubim   shining against not for them and i know   they dare not look in one anothers face   as if each were a cherub    gabriel                 dost thou know   aught of their future    lucifer              only as much as this   that evil will increase and multiply   without a benediction    gabriel                nothing more    lucifer why so the angels taunt what should be more    gabriel god is more    lucifer               proving what    gabriel                             that he is god   and capable of saving lucifer   i charge thee by the solitude he kept   ere he createdleave the earth to god    lucifer my foot is on the earth firm as my sin    gabriel i charge thee by the memory of heaven   ere any sin was doneleave earth to god    lucifer my sin is on the earth to reign thereon    gabriel i charge thee by the choral song we sang   when up against the white shore of our feet   the depths of the creation swelled and brake   and the new worlds the beaded foam and flower   of all that coil roared outward into space   on thunderedgesleave the earth to god    lucifer my woe is on the earth to curse thereby    gabriel i charge thee by that mournful morning star   which trembles     lucifer             enough spoken as the pine   in norland forest drops its weight of snows   by a nights growth so growing toward my ends   i drop thy counsels farewell gabriel   watch out thy service i achieve my will   and peradventure in the after years   when thoughtful men shall bend their spacious brows   upon the storm and strife seen everywhere   to ruffle their smooth manhood and break up   with lurid lights of intermittent hope   their human fear and wrongthey may

contemplation     opened into ministration    chorus     then upon our axle turning       of great joy to sympathy     we sang out the morning       broadening up the sky         or we drew         our music through   the noontides hush and heat and shine   informed with our intense divine     interrupted vital notes       palpitating hither thither       burning out into the æther     sensible

beauteous from the creant word   which thrilled behind us god himself being moved   when that august work of a perfect shape   his dignities of sovran angelhood   swept out into the universedivine   with thunderous movements earnest looks of gods   and silversolemn clash of cymbal wings   whereof was i in motion and in form   a part not poorest and yetyet perhaps   this beauty which i speak of is not here   as gods voice is not here nor even my crown   i do not know what is this thought or thing   which i call beauty is it thought or thing   is it a thought accepted for a thing   or both or neithera pretexta word   its meaning flutters in me like a flame   under my own breath my perceptions reel   for evermore around it and fall off   as if it too were holy    eve              which it

colourless   is nothing to the eyethat pinetree there   without its black and green being all a blank   so without love is beauty undiscerned   in man or angel angel rather ask   what love is in thee what love moves to thee   and what collateral love moves on with thee   then shalt thou know if thou art beautiful    lucifer love what is love i lose it beauty and love   i darken to the image

benediction at this hour   not a star pricketh the flat gloom of heaven   but girdling close our nether wilderness   the zodiacfigures of the earth loom slow   drawn out as suiteth with the place and

who are under and not over us   be satisfied with god if not with us   and pass out from our presence in such peace   as we have left you to enjoy revenge   such as the heavens have made you verily

tears which are impure   grant me such pardoning grace as can go forth   from clean volitions toward a spotted will   from the wronged to the wronger this and no more   i do not ask more i am ware indeed   that absolute pardon is impossible   from you to me by reason of my sin   and that i cannot evermore as once   with worthy acceptation of pure joy   behold the trances of the holy hills   beneath the leaning stars or watch the vales   dewpallid with their morning ecstasy   or hear the winds make pastoral peace between   two grassy uplandsand the riverwells   work out their bubbling mysteries underground   and all the birds sing till for joy of song   they lift their trembling wings as if to heave   the toomuch weight of music from their heart   and float it up the æther i am ware   that these things i can no more apprehend   with a pure organ into a full delight   the sense of beauty and of melody   being no more aided in me by the sense   of personal adjustment to those heights   of what i see wellformed or hear welltuned   but rather coupled darkly and made ashamed   by my percipiency of sin and fall   in melancholy of humiliant thoughts   but oh fair dreadful spiritsalbeit this   your accusation must confront my soul   and your pathetic utterance and full gaze   must evermore subdue mebe content   conquer me gentlyas if pitying me   not to say loving let my tears fall thick   as watering dews of eden unreproached   and when your tongues reprove me make me smooth   not ruffledsmooth and still with your reproof   and peradventure better while more sad   for look to it sweet spirits look well to it   it will not be amiss in you who kept   the law of your own righteousness and keep   the right of your own griefs to mourn themselves   to pity me twice fallen from that and this   from joy of place and also right of wail   i wail being not for meonly i sin   look to it o sweet spirits                                  for was i not   at that last

 the lady of the world princess of life   mistress of feast and favour could i touch   a rose with my white hand but it became   redder at once could i walk leisurely   along our swarded garden but the grass   tracked me with greenness could i stand aside   a moment underneath a corneltree   but all the leaves did tremble as alive   with songs of fifty birds who were made glad   because i stood there could i turn to look   with these twain eyes of mine now weeping fast   now good for only weepingupon man   angel or beast or bird but each rejoiced   because i looked on him alas alas   and is not this much woe to cry alas   speaking of joy and is not this more shame   to have made the woe myself from all that joy   to have stretched my hand and plucked it from the tree   and chosen it for fruit nay is not this   still most despairto have halved that bitter fruit   and ruined so the sweetest friend i have   turning the greatest to mine enemy    adam i will not hear thee speak so hearken

extreme reproach   lest passionate in anguish she fling down   beneath your trampling feet gods gift to us   of sovranty by reason and freewill   sinning against the province of the soul   to rule the soulless reverence her estate   and pass out from her presence with no words    eve o dearest heart have patience with my heart   o spirits have patience stead of reverence   and let me speak for not being innocent   it little doth become me to be proud   and i am prescient by the very hope   and promise set upon me that henceforth   only my gentleness shall make me great   my humbleness exalt me awful spirits   be witness that i stand in your reproof   but one suns length off from my happiness   happy as i have said to look around   clear to look upand now i need not speak   ye see me what i

halfsheathed in primal woods and glittering   in spasms of awful sunshine at that hour   a lion couched part raised upon his paws   with his calm massive face turned full on thine   and his mane listening when the ended curse   left silence in the world right suddenly   he sprang up rampant and stood straight and stiff   as if the new reality of death   were dashed against his eyes and roared so fierce   such thick carnivorous passion in his throat   tearing a passage through the wrath and fear   and roared so wild and smote from all the hills   such fast keen echoes crumbling down the vales   precipitatelythat the forest beasts   one after one did mutter a response   of savage and of sorrowful complaint   which trailed along the gorges then at once   he fell back and rolled crashing from the height   into the dusk of pines    adam                  it might have been   i heard the curse alone    earth spirits          i wail i wail    lucifer that lion is the type of what

thy manners since   a new king rules the gods if words like these   harsh words and trenchant thou wilt fling abroad   zeus haply though he sit so far and high   may hear thee do it and so this wrath

preparing still   to swell the account of grief with other griefs   than what are borne beseech thee use me then   for counsel do not spurn against the pricks   seeing that who reigns reigns by cruelty   instead of right and now i go from hence   and will endeavour if a power of mine   can break thy fetters through for theebe calm   and smooth thy words from passion knowest thou not   of perfect knowledge thou who knowest too much   that where the tongue wags ruin never lags    prometheus i gratulate thee who hast shared and dared   all things with me except their penalty   enough so leave these thoughts it cannot be   that thou shouldst move him he may not be moved   and thou beware of sorrow on this road    oceanus ay ever wiser for anothers use   than thine the event and not the prophecy   attests it to me yet where now i rush   thy wisdom hath no power to drag me back   because i glory glory to go hence   and win for thee deliverance from thy pangs   as a free gift from zeus    prometheus             why there again   i give thee gratulation and applause   thou lackest no goodwill but as for deeds   do nought twere all done vainly helping nought   whatever thou

and black now the moon shines    a broader glory you may see   the trees grow rarer presently   the air blows up more fresh and free    until they come from dark to light   and from the forest to the sight   of the large heavenheart bare with night    a fiery throb in every star   those burning arteries that are   the conduits of gods life afar    a wild brown moorland underneath   and four pools breaking up the heath   with white low gleamings blank as death    beside the first pool near the wood   a dead tree in set horror stood   peeled and disjointed stark as rood    since thunderstricken years ago   fixed in the spectral strain and throe   wherewith it struggled from the blow    a monumental tree alone   that will not bend in storms nor groan   but break off sudden like a stone    its lifeless shadow lies oblique   upon the pool where javelinlike   the starrays quiver while they strike    drink said the lady very still   be holy and cold he did her will   and drank the starry water chill    the next pool they came near unto   was bare of trees there only grew   straight flags and lilies just a few    which sullen on the water sate   and leant their faces on the flat   as weary of the starlightstate    drink said the lady grave and slow   worlds use behoveth thee to know   he drank the bitter wave below    the third pool girt with thorny bushes   and flaunting weeds and reeds and rushes   that winds sang through in mournful gushes    was whitely smeared in many a round   by a slow slime the starlight swound   over the ghastly light it found    drink said the lady sad and slow   worlds love behoveth thee to know   he looked to her commanding so    her brow was troubled but her eye   struck clear to his soul for all reply   he drank the water suddenly    then with a deathly sickness passed   beside the fourth pool and the last   where weights of shadow were downcast    from yew and alder and rank trails   of nightshade clasping the trunkscales   and flung across the intervals    from yew to yew who dares to stoop   where those dank branches overdroop   into his heart the chill strikes up    he hears a silent gliding coil   the snakes strain hard against the soil   his foot slips in their slimy oil    and toads seem crawling on his hand   and clinging bats but dimly scanned   full in his face their wings expand    a paleness took the poets cheek   must i drink here he seemed to seek   the ladys will with utterance meek    ay ay she said it so must be   and this time she spake cheerfully   behoves thee know worlds cruelty    he bowed his forehead till his mouth   curved in the wave and drank unloth   as if from rivers of the south    his lips sobbed through the water rank   his heart paused in him while he drank   his brain beat heartlike rose and sank    and he swooned backward to a dream   wherein he lay twixt gloom and gleam   with death and life at each extreme    and spiritual thunders born of soul   not cloud did leap from mystic pole   and oer him roll and counterroll    crushing their echoes reboant   with their own wheels did heaven so grant   his spirit a sign of covenant    at last came silence a slow kiss   did crown his forehead after this   his eyelids flew back for the bliss    the lady stood beside his head   smiling a thought with hair dispread   the moonshine seemed dishevellèd    in her sleek tresses manifold

eddied through speech rise up be strong   and learn how right avenges wrong    the poet rose up on his feet   he stood before an altar set   for sacrament with vessels meet    and mystic altarlights which shine   as if their flames were crystalline   carved flames that would not shrink or pine    the altar filled the central place   of a great church and toward its face   long aisles did shoot and interlace    and from it a continuous mist   of incense round the edges kissed   by a yellow light of amethyst    wound upward slowly and throbbingly   cloud within cloud right silverly   cloud above cloud victoriously    broke full against the archèd roof   and thence refracting eddied off   and floated through the marble woof    of many a finewrought architrave   then poising its white masses brave   swept solemnly down aisle and nave    where now in dark and now in light   the countless columns glimmering white   seemed leading out to the infinite    plunged halfway up the shaft they showed   in that pale shifting incensecloud   which flowed them by and overflowed    till mist and marble seemed to blend   and the whole temple at the end   with its own incense to distend    the arches like a giants bow   to bend and slackenand below   the nichèd saints to come and go    alone amid the shifting scene   that central altar stood serene   in its clear steadfast tapersheen    then first the poet was aware   of a chief angel standing there   before that altar in the glare    his eyes were dreadful for you saw   that they saw god his lips and jaw   grandmade and strong as sinais law    they could enunciate and refrain   from vibratory afterpain   and his brows height was sovereign    on the vast background of his wings   rises his image and he flings   from each plumed arc pale glitterings    and fiery flakes as beateth more   or less the angelheart before   and round him upon roof and floor    edging with fire the shifting fumes   while at his side twixt lights and glooms   the phantasm of an organ booms    extending from which instrument   and angel right and leftway bent   the poets sight grew sentient    of a strange company around   and toward the altar pale and bound   with bay above the eyes profound    deathful their faces were and yet   the power of life was in them set   never forgot nor to forget    sublime significance of mouth   dilated nostril

sounds    now hearken then the poet gazed   upon the angel gloriousfaced   whose hand majestically raised    floated across the organkeys   like a pale moon oer murmuring seas   with no touch but with influences    then rose and fell with swell and swound   of shapeless noises wandering round   a concord which at last they found    those mystic keys the tones were mixed   dim faint and thrilled and throbbed betwixt   the incomplete and the unfixed    and therein mighty minds were heard   in mighty musings inly stirred   and struggling outward for a word    until these surges having run   this way and that gave out as one   an aphroditè of sweet tune    a harmony that finding vent   upward in grand ascension went   winged to a heavenly argument    up upward like a saint who strips   the shroud back from his eyes and lips   and rises in apocalypse    a harmony sublime and plain   which cleft as flying swan the rain   throwing the drops off with a strain    of her white wing those undertones   of perplext chords and soared at once   and struck out from the starry thrones    their several silver octaves as   it passed to god the music was   of divine stature strong to pass    and those who heard it understood   something of life in spirit and blood   something of natures fair and good    and while it sounded those great souls   did thrill as racers at the goals   and burn in all their aureoles    but she the lady as vapourbound   stood calmly in the joy of sound   like nature with the showers around    and when it ceased the blood which fell   again alone grew audible   tolling the silence as a bell    the sovran angel lifted high   his hand and spake out sovranly   tried poets hearken and reply    give me true answers if we grant   that not to suffer is to want   the conscience of the jubilant    if ignorance of anguish is   but ignorance and mortals miss   far prospects by a level bliss    if as two colours must be viewed   in a visible image mortals should   need good and evil to see good    if to speak nobly comprehends   to feel profoundlyif the ends   of power and suffering nature blends    if poets on the tripod must   writhe like the pythian to make just   their oracles and merit trust    if every vatic word that sweeps   to change the world must pale their lips   and leave their own souls in eclipse    if to search deep the universe   must pierce the searcher with the curse   because that bolt in mans reverse    was shot to the heart o the wood and lies   wedged deepest in the bestif eyes   that look for visions and surprise    from influent angels must shut down   their eyelids first to sun and moon   the head asleep upon a stone    if one who did redeem you back   by his own loss from final wrack   did consecrate by touch and track    those temporal sorrows till the taste   of brackish waters of the waste   is salt with tears he dropt too fast    if all the crowns of earth must wound   with prickings of the thorns he found   if saddest sighs swell sweetest sound    what say ye unto thisrefuse   this baptism in salt waterchoose   calm breasts mute lips and labour loose    or o ye gifted givers ye   who give your liberal

sounded like amen   said by a choir of mourning men   an affirmation full of pain    and patienceay of glorying   and adoration as a king   might seal an oath for governing    then said the angeland his face   lightened abroad until the place   grew larger for a moments space    the long aisles flashing out in light   and nave and transept columns white   and arches crossed being clear to sight    as if the roof were off and all   stood in the noonsunlo i call   to other hearts as liberal    this pedal strikes out in the air   my instrument has room to bear   still fuller strains and perfecter    herein is room and shall be room   while time lasts for new hearts to come   consummating while they consume    what living man will bring a gift   of his own heart and help to lift   the tunethe race is to the swift    so asked the angel straight the while   a company came up the aisle   with measured step and sorted smile    cleaving the incenseclouds that rise   with winking unaccustomed eyes   and lovelocks smelling sweet of spice    one bore his head above the rest   as if the world were dispossessed   and one did pillow chin on breast    right languid an as he should faint   one shook his curls across his paint   and moralized on worldly taint    one slanting up his face did wink   the salt rheum to the eyelids brink   to thinko gods ornot to think    some trod out stealthily and slow   as if the sun would fall in snow   if they walked to instead of fro    and some with conscious ambling free   did shake their bells right daintily   on hand and foot for harmony    and some composing sudden sighs   in attitudes of pointdevice   rehearsed impromptu agonies    and when this company drew near   the spirits crowned it might appear   submitted to a ghastly fear    as a sane eye in masterpassion   constrains a maniac to the fashion   of hideous maniac imitation    in the least gestethe dropping low   o the lid the wrinkling of the brow   exaggerate with mock and mow    so mastered was that company   by the crowned vision utterly   swayed to a maniac mockery    one dulled his eyeballs as they ached   with homers forehead though he lacked   an inch of any and one racked    his lower lip with restless tooth   as pindars rushing words forsooth   were pent behind it one his smooth    pink cheeks did rumple passionate   like Æschylus and tried to prate   on trolling tongue of fate and fate    one set her eyes like sapphosor   any light womans one forbore   like dante or any man as poor    in mirth to let a smile undo   his hardshut lips and one that drew   sour humours from his mother blew    his sunken cheeks out to the size   of most unnatural jollities   because anacreon looked jestwise    so with the rest it was a sight   a great worldlaughter would requite   or great worldwrath with equal right    out came a speaker from that crowd   to speak for all in sleek and proud   exordial periods while he bowed    his knee before the angelthus   o angel who hast called for us   we bring thee service emulous    fit service from sufficient soul   handservice to receive worlds dole   lipservice in worlds ear to roll    adjusted concords soft enow   to hear the winecups passing through   and not too grave to spoil the show    thou certes when thou askest more   o sapient angel leanest oer   the windowsill of metaphor    to give our hearts up fie that rage   barbaric antedates the age   it is not done on any stage    because your scald or gleeman went   with seven or ninestringed instrument   upon his backmust ours be bent    we are not

speaker would have said   poising between his smiles fairfed   each separate phrase till finishèd    but all the foreheads of those born   and dead true poets flashed with scorn   betwixt the bay leaves round them worn    ay jetted such brave fire that they   the newcome shrank and paled away   like leaden ashes when the day    strikes on the hearth a spiritblast   a presence known by power at last   took them up mutely they had passed    and he our pilgrimpoet saw   only their places in deep awe   what time the angels smile did draw    his gazing upward smiling on   the angel in the angel shone   revealing glory in benison    till ripened in the light which shut   the poet in his spirit mute   dropped sudden as a perfect fruit    he fell before the angels feet   saying if what is true is sweet   in something i may compass it    for where my worthiness is poor   my will stands richly at the door   to pay shortcomings evermore    accept me therefore not for price   and not for pride my sacrifice   is tendered for my soul is nice    and will beat down those dusty seeds   of bearded corn if she succeeds   in soaring while the covey feeds    i soar i am drawn up like the lark   to

loose   in tears and blood if so he choose   mine inward music out to use    i only would be spentin pain   and loss perchance but not in vain   upon the sweetness of that strain    only project beyond the bound   of mine own life so lost and found   my voice and live on in its sound    only embrace and be embraced   by fiery ends whereby to waste   and light gods future with my past    the angels smile grew more divine   the mortal speaking ay its shine   swelled fuller like a choirnote fine    till the broad glory round his brow   did vibrate with the light below   but what he said i do not know    nor know i if the man who prayed   rose up accepted unforbade   from the churchfloor where he was laid    nor if a listening life did run   through the kingpoets one by one   rejoicing in a worthy son    my soul which might have seen grew blind   by what it looked on i can find   no certain count of things behind    i saw alone dim white and grand   as in a dream the angels hand   stretched forth in gesture of command    straight through the haze and so as erst   a strain more noble than the first   mused in the organ and outburst    with giant march from floor to roof   rose the full notes now parted off   in pauses massively aloof    like measured thunders now rejoined   in concords of mysterious kind   which fused together sense and mind    now flashing sharp on sharp along   exultant in a mounting throng   now dying off to a low song    fed upon minors wavelike sounds   reeddying into silver rounds   enlarging liberty with bounds    and every rhythm that seemed to close   survived in confluent underflows   symphonious with the next that rose    thus the whole strain being multiplied   and greatened with its glorified   wings shot abroad from side to side    waved backward as a wind might wave   a brocken mist and with as brave   wild roaring arch and architrave    aisle transept column marble wall   then swelling outward prodigal   of aspiration beyond thrall    soared and drew up with it the whole   of this said vision as a soul   is raised by a thought and as a scroll    of bright devices is unrolled   still upward with a gradual gold   so rose the vision manifold    angel and organ and the round   of spirits solemnized and crowned   while the freed clouds of incense wound    ascending following in their track   and glimmering faintly like the rack   o the moon in her own light cast back    and as that solemn dream withdrew   the ladys kiss did fall anew   cold on the poets brow as dew    and that same kiss which bound him first   beyond the senses now reversed   its own law and most subtly pierced    his spirit with the sense of things   sensual and present vanishings   of glory with Æolian wings    struck him and passed the ladys face   did melt back in the chrysopras   of the orient morning sky that was    yet clear of lark and there and so   she melted as a star might do   still smiling as she melted slow    smiling so slow he seemed to see   her smile the last thing gloriously   beyond her far as memory    then he looked round he was alone   he lay before the breaking sun   as jacob at the bethel stone    and thoughts entangled skein being wound   he knew the moorland of his swound   and the pale pools that smeared the ground    the far woodpines like offing ships   the fourth pools yew anear him drips   worlds cruelty attaints his lips    and still he tastes it bitter still   through all that glorious possible   he had the sight of present ill    yet rising calmly up and slowly   with such a cheer as scorneth folly   a mild delightsome melancholy    he journeyed homeward through the wood   and prayed along the solitude   betwixt the pines o god my god    the golden mornings open flowings   did sway the trees to murmurous bowings   in metric chant of blessed poems    and passing homeward through the wood   he prayed along the solitude   thou poetgod art great and good    and though we must have and have had   right reason to be earthly sad   thou poetgod art great and glad   conclusion    life treads on life and heart on heart   we press too close in church and mart   to keep a dream or grave apart    and i was ware of walking down   that same green forest where had gone   the poetpilgrim one by one    i traced his footsteps from the east   a red and tender radiance pressed   through the near trees until i guessed    the sun behind shone full and round   while up the leafiness profound   a wind scarce old enough for sound    stood ready to blow on me when   i turned that way and now and then   the birds sang and brake off again    to shake their pretty feathers dry   of the dew sliding droppingly   from the leafedges and apply    back to their song twixt dew and bird   so sweet a silence ministered   god seemed to use it for a word    yet morning souls did leap and run   in all things as the least had won   a joyous insight of the sun    and no one looking round the wood   could help confessing as he stood   this poetgod is glad and good    but hark a distant sound that grows   a heaving sinking of the boughs   a rustling murmur not of those    a breezy noise which is not breeze   and whiteclad children by degrees   steal out in troops among the trees    fair little children morningbright   with faces grave yet soft to sight   expressive of restrained delight    some plucked the palmboughs within reach   and others leapt up high to catch   the upper boughs and shake from each    a rain of dew till wetted so   the child who held the branch let go   and it swang backward with a flow    of faster drippings then i knew   the children laughed but the laugh flew   from its own chirrup as might do    a frightened songbird and a child   who seemed the chief said very mild   hush keep this morning undefiled    his eyes rebuked them from calm spheres   his soul upon his brow appears   in waiting for more holy years    i called the child to me and said   what are your palms for to be spread   he answered on a poet dead    the poet died last month and now   the world which had been somewhat slow   in honouring his living brow    commands the palms they must be strown   on his new marble very soon   in a procession of the town    i sighed and said did he foresee   any such honour verily   i cannot tell you answered he    but this i know i fain would lay   my own head down another day   as he didwith the fame away    a lily a friends hand had plucked   lay by his deathbed which he looked   as deep down as a bee had sucked    then turning to the lattice gazed   oer hill and river and upraised   his eyes illumined and amazed    with the worlds beauty up to god   reoffering on their iris broad   the images of things bestowed    by the chief poet god he cried   be praised for anguish which has tried   for beauty which has satisfied    for this worlds presence half within   and half without methought and scene   this sense of being and having been    i thank thee that my soul hath room   for thy grand world both guests may come   beauty to soulbody to tomb    i am content to be so weak   put strength into the words i speak   and i am strong in what i seek    i am content to be so bare   before the archers everywhere   my wounds being stroked by heavenly air    i laid my soul before thy feet   that images of fair and sweet   should walk to other men on it    i am content to feel the step   of each pure image let those keep   to mandragore who care to sleep    i am content to touch the brink   of the other goblet and i think   my bitter drink a wholesome drink    because my portion was assigned   wholesome and bitter thou art kind   and i am blessed to my mind    gifted for giving i receive   the maythorn and its scent outgive   i grieve not that i once did grieve    in my large joy of sight and touch   beyond what others count for such   i am content to suffer much    i knowis all the mourner saith   knowledge by suffering entereth   and life is perfected by death    the child spake nobly strange to hear   his infantine soft accents clear   charged with high meanings did appear    and fair to see his form and face   winged out with whiteness and pure grace   from the green darkness of the place    behind his head a palmtree grew   an orient beam which pierced it through   transversely on his forehead drew    the figure of a palmbranch brown   traced on its brightness up and down   in fine fair linesa shadowcrown    guido might paint his angels so   a little angel taught to go   with holy words to saints below    such innocence of action yet   significance of object met   in his whole bearing strong and sweet    and all the children the whole band   did round in rosy reverence stand   each with a palmbough in his hand    and so he died i whispered nay   not so the childish voice did say   that poet turned him first to pray    in silence and god heard the rest   twixt the suns footsteps down the west   then he called one who loved him best    yea he called softly through the room   his voice was weak yet tendercome   he said come nearer let the bloom    of life grow over undenied   this bridge of death which is not wide   i shall be soon at the other side    come kiss me so the one in truth   who loved him bestin love not ruth   bowed down and kissed him mouth to mouth    and in that kiss of love was won   lifes manumission all was done   the mouth that kissed last kissed alone    but in the former confluent kiss   the same was sealed i think by his   to words of truth and uprightness    the childs voice trembled his lips shook   like a rose leaning oer a brook   which vibrates though it is not struck    and who i asked a little moved   yet curiouseyed was this that loved   and kissed him last as it behoved    i softly said the child and then   i said he louder once again   his son my rank is among men    and now that men exalt his name   i come to gather palms with them   that holy love may hallow fame    he did not die alone nor should   his memory live so mid these rude   worldpraisersa worse solitude    me a voice calleth to that tomb   where these are strewing branch and bloom   saying come nearer and i come    glory to god resumèd he   and his eyes smiled for victory   oer their own tears which i could see    fallen on the palm down cheek and chin   that poet now has entered in   the place of rest which is not sin    and while he rests his songs in troops   walk up and down our earthly slopes   companioned by diviner hopes    but thou i murmured to engage   the childs speech fartherhast an age   too tender for this orphanage    glory to godto god he saith   knowledge by suffering entereth   and life is perfected by death     the poets vow                          o be wiser thou instructed that true knowledge leads to love                                      wordsworth     the poets vow   part the first  showing wherefore the vow was made     i    eve is a twofold mystery     the stillness earth doth keep   the motion wherewith human hearts     do each to either leap   as if all souls between the poles     felt parting comes in sleep     ii    the rowers lift their oars to view     each other in the sea   the landsmen watch the rocking boats     in a pleasant company   while up the hill go gladlier still     dear friends by two and three     iii    the peasants wife hath looked without     her cottage door and smiled   for there the peasant drops his spade     to clasp his youngest child   which hath no speech but its hand can reach     and stroke his forehead mild     iv    a poet sate that eventide     within his hall alone   as silent as its ancient lords     in the coffined place of stone   when the bat hath shrunk from the praying monk     and the praying monk is gone     v    nor wore the dead a stiller face     beneath the cerements roll   his lips refusing out in words     their mystic thoughts to dole   his steadfast eye burnt inwardly     as burning out his soul     vi    you would not think that brow could eer     ungentle moods express   yet seemed it in this troubled world     too calm for gentleness   when the very star that shines from far     shines trembling neertheless     vii    it lacked all need the softening light     which other brows supply   we should conjoin the scathèd trunks     of our humanity   that each leafless spray entwining may     look softer gainst the sky     viii    none gazed within the poets face     the poet gazed in none   he threw a lonely shadow straight     before the moon and sun   affronting natures heavendwelling creatures     with wrong to nature done     ix    because this poet daringly     the nature at his heart   and that quick tune along his veins     he could not change by art   had vowed his blood of brotherhood     to a stagnant place apart     x    he did not vow in fear or wrath     or griefs fantastic whim   but weights and shows of sensual things     too closely crossing him   on his souls eyelid the pressure slid     and made its vision dim     xi    and darkening in the dark he strove     twixt earth and sea and sky   to lose in shadow wave and cloud     his brothers haunting cry   the winds were welcome as they swept   gods fiveday work he would accept     but let the rest go by     xii    he cried o touching patient earth     that weepest in thy glee   whom god created very good     and very mournful we   thy voice of moan doth reach his throne     as abels rose from thee     xiii    poor crystal sky with stars astray     mad winds that howling go   from east to west perplexèd seas     that stagger from their blow   o motion wild o wave defiled     our curse hath made you so     xiv    we and our curse do i partake     the desiccating sin   have i the apple at my lips     the moneylust within   do i human stand with the wounding hand     to the blasting heart akin     xv    thou solemn pathos of all things     for solemn joy designed   behold submissive to your cause     a holy wrath i find   and for your sake the bondage break     that knits me to my kind     xvi    hear me forswear mans sympathies     his pleasant yea and no   his riot on the piteous earth    whereon his thistles grow   his changing lovewith stars above     his pridewith graves below     xvii    hear me forswear his roof by night     his bread and salt by day   his talkings at the woodfire hearth     his greetings by the way   his answering looks his systemed books     all man for aye and aye     xviii    that so my purged once human heart     from all the human rent   may gather strength to pledge and drink     your wine of wonderment   while you pardon me all blessingly     the woe mine adam sent     xix    and i shall feel your unseen looks     innumerous constant deep   and soft as haunted adam once     though sadder round me creep   as slumbering men have mystic ken     of watchers on their sleep     xx    and ever when i lift my brow     at evening to the sun   no voice of woman or of child     recording day is done   your silences shall a love express     more deep than such an one   part the second  showing to whom the vow was declared     i    the poets vow was inly sworn     the poets vow was told   he shared among his crowding friends     the silver and the gold   they clasping bland his gifthis hand     in a somewhat slacker hold     ii    they wended forth the crowding friends     with farewells smooth and kind   they wended forth the solaced friends     and left but twain behind   one loved him true as brothers do     and one was rosalind     iii    he said my friends have wended forth     with farewells smooth and kind   mine oldest friend my plighted bride     ye need not stay behind   friend wed my fair bride for my sake   and let my lands ancestral make     a dower for rosalind     iv    and when beside your wassail board     ye bless your social lot   i charge you that the giver be     in all his gifts forgot   or alone of all his words recall     the lastlament me not     v    she looked upon him silently     with her large doubting eyes   like a child that never knew but love     whom words of wrath surprise   till the rose did break from either cheek     and the sudden tears did rise     vi    she looked upon him mournfully     while her large eyes were grown   yet larger with the steady tears     till all his purpose known   she turnèd slow as she would go     the tears were shaken down     vii    she turnèd slow as she would go     then quickly turned again   and gazing in his face to seek     some little touch of pain   i thought she saidbut shook her head     she tried that speech in vain     viii    i thoughtbut i am half a child     and very sage art thou   the teachings of the heaven and earth     should keep us soft and low   they have drawn my tears in early years     or ere i weptas now     ix    but now that in thy face i read     their cruel homily   before their beauty i would fain     untouched unsoftened be   if i indeed could look on even   the senseless loveless earth and heaven     as thou canst look on me     x    and couldest thou as coldly view     thy childhoods far abode   where little feet kept time with thine     along the dewy sod   and thy mothers look from holy book     rose like a thought of god     xi    o brothercalled so ere her last     betrothing words were said   o fellowwatcher in her room     with hushèd voice and tread   rememberest thou how hand in hand   o friend o lover we did stand     and knew that she was dead     xii    i will not live sir rolands bride     that dower i will not hold   i tread below my feet that go     these parchments bought and sold   the tears i weep are mine to keep     and worthier than thy gold     xiii    the poet and sir roland stood     alone each turned to each   till roland brake the silence left     by that softthrobbing speech   poor heart he cried it vainly tried     the distant heart to reach     xiv    and thou o distant sinful heart     that climbest up so high   to wrap and blind thee with the snows     that cause to dream and die   what blessing can from lips of man     approach thee with his sigh     xv    ay what from earthcreate for man     and moaning in his moan   ay what from starsrevealed to man     and mannamed one by one   ay more what blessing can be given   where the spirits seven do show in heaven     a man upon the throne     xvi    a man on earth he wandered once     all meek and undefiled   and those who loved him said he wept     none ever said he smiled   yet there might have been a smile unseen   when he bowed his holy face i ween     to bless that happy child     xvii    and now he pleadeth up in heaven     for our humanities   till the ruddy light on seraphs wings     in pale emotion dies   they can better bear their godheads glare     than the pathos of his eyes     xviii    i will go pray our god today     to teach thee how to scan   his work divine for human use     since earth on axle ran   to teach thee to discern as plain   his grief divine the blooddrops stain     he left there man for man     xix    so for the bloods sake shed by him     whom angels god declare   tears like it moist and warm with love     thy reverent eyes shall wear   to see i the face of adams race     the nature god doth share     xx    i heard the poet said thy voice     as dimly as thy breath   the sound was like the noise of life     to one anear his death   or of waves that fail to stir the pale     sere leaf they roll beneath     xxi    and still between the sound and me     white creatures like a mist   did interfloat confusedly     mysterious shapes unwist   across my heart and across my brow   i felt them droop like wreaths of snow     to still the pulse they kist     xxii    the castle and its lands are thine     the poorsit shall be done   go man to love i go to live     in courland hall alone   the bats along the ceilings cling   the lizards in the floors do run   and storms and years have worn and reft   the stain by human builders left     in working at the stone   part the third  showing how the vow was kept     i    he dwelt alone and sun and moon     were witness that he made   rejection of his humanness     until they seemed to fade   his face did so for he did grow     of his own soul afraid     ii    the selfpoised god may dwell alone     with inward glorying   but gods chief angel waiteth for     a brothers voice to sing   and a lonely creature of sinful nature     it is an awful thing     iii    an awful thing that feared itself     while many years did roll   a lonely man a feeble man     a part beneath the whole   he bore by day he bore by night   that pressure of gods infinite     upon his finite soul     iv    the poet at his lattice sate     and downward lookèd he   three christians wended by to prayers     with mute ones in their ee   each turned above a face of love     and called him to the far chapèlle   with voice more tuneful than its bell     but still they wended three     v    there journeyed by a bridal pomp     a bridegroom and his dame   he speaketh low for happiness     she blusheth red for shame   but never a tone of benison     from out the lattice came     vi    a little child with inward song     no louder noise to dare   stood near the wall to see at play     the lizards green and rare   unblessed the while for his childish smile     which cometh unaware   part the fourth  showing how rosalind fared by the keeping of the vow     i    in deathsheets lieth rosalind     as white and still as they   and the old nurse that watched her bed     rose up with welladay   and oped the casement to let in   the sun and that sweet doubtful din   which droppeth from the grass and bough   sans wind and bird none knoweth how     to cheer her as she lay     ii    the old nurse started when she saw     her sudden look of woe   but the quick wan tremblings round her mouth     in a meek smile did go   and calm she said when i am dead     dear nurse it shall be so     iii    till then shut out those sights and sounds     and pray god pardon me   that i without this pain no more     his blessed works can see   and lean beside me loving nurse   that thou mayst hear ere i am worse     what thy last love should be     iv    the loving nurse leant over her     as white she lay beneath   the old eyes searching dim with life     the young ones dim with death   to read their look if sound forsook     the trying trembling breath     v    when all this feeble breath is done     and i on bier am laid   my tresses smoothed for never a feast     my body in shroud arrayed   uplift each palm in a saintly calm     as if that still i prayed     vi    and heap beneath mine head the flowers     you stoop so low to pull   the little white flowers from the wood     which grow there in the cool   which he and i in childhoods games   went plucking knowing not their names     and filled thine apron full     vii    weep not i weep not death is strong     the eyes of death are dry   but lay this scroll upon my breast     when hushed its heavings lie   and wait awhile for the corpses smile     which shineth presently     viii    and when it shineth straightway call     thy youngest children dear   and bid them gently carry me     all barefaced on the bier   but bid them pass my kirkyard grass     that waveth long anear     ix    and up the bank where i used to sit     and dream what life would be   along the brook with its sunny look     akin to living glee   oer the windy hill through the forest still     let them gently carry me     x    and through the piny forest still     and down the open moorland   round where the sea beats mistily     and blindly on the foreland   and let them chant that hymn i know   bearing me soft bearing me slow     to the ancient hall of courland     xi    and when withal they near the hall     in silence let them lay   my bier before the bolted door     and leave it for a day   for i have vowed though i am proud   to go there as a guest in shroud     and not be turned away     xii    the old nurse looked within her eyes     whose mutual look was gone   the old nurse stooped upon her mouth     whose answering voice was done   and nought she heard till a little bird     upon the casements woodbine swinging   broke out into a loud sweet singing     for joy o the summer sun   alack alackshe watched no more     with head on knee she wailèd sore   and the little bird sang oer and oer     for joy o the summer sun   part the fifth  showing how the vow was broken     i    the poet oped his bolted door     the midnight sky to view   a spiritfeel was in the air   which seemed to touch his spirit bare     whenever his breath he drew   and the stars a liquid softness had   as alone their holiness forbade     their falling with the dew     ii    they shine upon the steadfast hills     upon the swinging tide   upon the narrow track of beach     and the murmuring pebbles pied   they shine on every lovely place   they shine upon the corpses face     as it were fair beside     iii    it lay before him humanlike     yet so unlike a thing   more awful in its shrouded pomp     than any crownèd king   all calm and cold as it did hold     some secret glorying     iv    a heavier weight than of its clay     clung to his heart and knee   as if those folded palms could strike     he staggered groaningly   and then oerhung without a groan   the meek close mouth that smiled alone     whose speech the scroll must be                                          the words of rosalinds scroll    i left thee last a child at heart     a woman scarce in years   i come to thee a solemn corpse     which neither feels nor fears   i have no breath to use in sighs   they laid the deadweights on mine eyes     to seal them safe from tears    look on me with thine own calm look     i meet it calm as thou   no look of thine can change this smile     or break thy sinful vow   i tell thee that my poor scorned heart   is of thine earththine earth a part     it cannot vex thee now    but out alas these words are writ     by a living loving one   adown whose cheeks the proofs of life     the warm quick tears do run   ah let the unloving corpse control   thy scorn back from the loving soul     whose place of rest is won    i have prayed for thee with bursting sob     when passions course was free   i have prayed for thee with silent lips     in the anguish none could see   they whispered oft she sleepeth soft     but i only prayed for thee    go to i pray for thee no more     the corpses tongue is still   its folded fingers point to heaven     but point there stiff and chill   no farther wrong no farther woe   hath license from the sin below     its tranquil heart to thrill    i charge thee by the livings prayer     and the deads silentness   to wring from out thy soul a cry     which god shall hear and bless   lest heavens own palm droop in my hand   and pale among the saints i stand     a saint companionless                                          v    bow lower down before the throne     triumphant rosalind   he boweth on thy corpse his face     and weepeth as the blind   twas a dread sight to see them so   for the senseless corpse rocked to and fro     with the wail of his living mind     vi    but dreader sight could such be seen     his inward mind did lie   whose longsubjected humanness     gave out its lioncry   and fiercely rent its tenement     in a mortal agony     vii    i tell you friends had you heard his wail     twould haunt you in court and mart   and in merry feast until you set     your cup down to depart   that weeping wild of a reckless child     from a proud mans broken heart     viii    o broken heart o broken vow     that wore so proud a feature   god grasping as a thunderbolt     the mans rejected nature   smote him therewith i the presence high   of his so worshipped earth and sky   that looked on all indifferently     a wailing human creature     ix    a human creature found too weak     to bear his human pain   may heavens dear grace have spoken peace      to his dying heart and brain   for when they came at dawn of day   to lift the ladys corpse away     her bier was holding twain     x    they dug beneath the kirkyard grass     for born one dwelling deep   to which when years had mossed the stone   sir roland brought his

upon this human dust asleep   and hold it in thy constant ken   that gods own unity compresses     one into one the human many   and that his everlastingness is     the bond which is not loosed by any
