13863098	odd craft  by ww jacobs    lawyer quince  lawyer quince so called by his neighbours in little haven from his readiness at all times to place at their disposal the legal lore he had acquired from a few old books while following his useful occupation of making boots sat in a kind of wooden hutch at the side of his cottage plying his trade  the london coach had gone by in a cloud of dust some three hours before and since then the wide village street had slumbered almost undisturbed in the sunshine  illustration lawyer quince  hearing footsteps and the sound of voices raised in dispute caused him to look up from his work  mr rose of holly farm hogg the miller and one or two neighbours of lesser degree appeared to be in earnest debate over some point of unusual difficulty  lawyer quince took a pinch of snuff and bent to his work again  mr rose was one of the very few who openly questioned his legal knowledge and his gibes concerning it were only too frequent  moreover he had a taste for practical joking which to a grave man was sometimes offensive  well here he be said mr hogg to the farmer as the group halted in front of the hutch  now ask lawyer quince and see whether i aint told you true  im willing to abide by what he says  mr quince put down his hammer and brushing a little snuff from his coat leaned back in his chair and eyed them with grave confidence  its like this said the farmer  young pascoe has been hanging round after my girl celia though i told her she wasnt to have nothing to do with him  half an hour ago i was going to put my pony in its stable when i see a young man sitting there waiting  well  said mr quince after a pause  hes there yet said the farmer  i locked him in and hogg here says that ive got the right to keep him locked up there as long as i like  i say its agin the law but hogg he says no  i say his folks would come and try to break open my stable but hogg says if they do i can have the law of em for damaging my property  so you can interposed mr hogg firmly  you see whether lawyer quince dont say im right  mr quince frowned and in order to think more deeply closed his eyes taking advantage of this three of his auditors with remarkable unanimity each closed one  its your stable said mr quince opening his eyes and speaking with great deliberation and you have a right to lock it up when you like  there you are said mr hogg what did i tell you  if anybodys there thats got no business there thats his lookout continued mr quince  you didnt induce him to go in  certainly not replied the farmer  i told him he can keep him there as long as he likes said the jubilant mr hogg and pass him in bread and water through the winder its got bars to it  yes said mr quince nodding he can do that  as for his folks knocking the place about if you like to tie up one or two of them nasty savage dogs of yours to the stable well its your stable and you can fasten your dogs to it if you like  and youve generally got a man about the yard  mr hogg smacked his thigh in ecstasy  but began the farmer  thats the law said the autocratic mr quince sharply  o course if you think you know more about it than i do ive nothing more to say  i dont want to do nothing i could get into trouble for murmured mr rose  you cant get into trouble by doing as i tell you said the shoemaker impatiently  however to be quite on the safe side if i was in your place i should lose the key  lose the key  said the farmer blankly  lose the key repeated the shoemaker his eyes watering with intense appreciation of his own resourcefulness  you can find it any time you want to you know  keep him there till he promises to give up your daughter and tell him that as soon as he does youll have a hunt for the key  mr rose regarded him with what the shoemaker easily understood to be speechless admiration  iim glad i came to you said the farmer at last  youre welcome said the shoemaker loftily  im always ready to give advice to them as require it  and good advice it is said the smiling mr hogg  why dont you behave yourself joe garnham  he demanded turning fiercely on a listener  mr garnham whose eyes were watering with emotion attempted to explain but becoming hysterical thrust a huge red handkerchief to his mouth and was led away by a friend  mr quince regarded his departure with mild disdain  little things please little minds he remarked  so they do said mr hogg  i never thoughtwhats the matter with you george askew  mr askew turning his back on him threw up his hands with a helpless gesture and followed in the wake of mr garnham  mr hogg appeared to be about to apologise and then suddenly altering his mind made a hasty and unceremonious exit accompanied by the farmer  mr quince raised his eyebrows and then after a long and meditative pinch of snuff resumed his work  the sun went down and the light faded slowly distant voices sounded close on the still evening air snatches of hoarse laughter jarred upon his ears  it was clear that the story of the imprisoned swain was giving pleasure to little haven  he rose at last from his chair and stretching his long gaunt frame removed his leather apron and after a wash at the pump went into the house  supper was laid and he gazed with approval on the homemade sausage rolls the piece of cold pork and the cheese which awaited his onslaught  we wont wait for ned said mrs quince as she brought in a jug of ale and placed it by her husbands elbow  mr quince nodded and filled his glass  youve been giving more advice i hear said mrs quince  her husband who was very busy nodded again  it wouldnt make no difference to young pascoes chance anyway said mrs quince thoughtfully  mr quince continued his labours  why  he inquired at last  his wife smiled and tossed her head  young pascoes no chance against our ned she said swelling with maternal pride  eh  said the shoemaker laying down his knife and fork  our ned  they are as fond of each other as they can be said mrs quince though i dont suppose farmer rosell care for it not but what our neds as good as he is  is ned up there now  demanded the shoemaker turning pale as the mirthful face of mr garnham suddenly occurred to him  sure to be tittered his wife  and to think o poor young pascoe shut up in that stable while hes courting celia  mr quince took up his knife and fork again but his appetite had gone whoever might be paying attention to miss rose at that moment he felt quite certain that it was not mr ned quince and he trembled with anger as he saw the absurd situation into which the humorous mr rose had led him  for years little haven had accepted his decisions as final and boasted of his sharpness to neighbouring hamlets and many a cottager had brought his boots to be mended a whole week before their time for the sake of an interview  he moved his chair from the table and smoked a pipe  then he rose and putting a couple of formidable lawbooks under his arm walked slowly down the road in the direction of holly farm  the road was very quiet and the white swan usually full at this hour was almost deserted but if any doubts as to the identity of the prisoner lingered in his mind they were speedily dissipated by the behaviour of the few customers who crowded to the door to see him pass  a hum of voices fell on his ear as he approached the farm half the male and a goodly proportion of the female population of little haven were leaning against the fence or standing in little knots in the road while a few of higher social status stood in the farmyard itself  come down to have a look at the prisoner  inquired the farmer who was standing surrounded by a little group of admirers  illustration come down to have a look at the prisoner inquired the farmer  i came down to see you about that advice i gave you this afternoon said mr quince  ah  said the other  i was busy when you came continued mr quince in a voice of easy unconcern and i gave you advice from memory  looking up the subject after youd gone i found that i was wrong  you dont say so said the farmer uneasily  if ive done wrong im only doing what you told me i could do  mistakes will happen with the best of us said the shoemaker loudly for the benefit of one or two murmurers  ive known a man to marry a woman for her money before now and find out afterward that she hadnt got any  one unit of the group detached itself and wandered listlessly toward the gate  well i hope i aint done nothing wrong said mr rose anxiously you gave me the advice theres men here as can prove it  i dont want to do nothing agin the law  what had i better do  well if i was you said mr quince concealing his satisfaction with difficulty i should let him out at once and beg his pardon and say you hope hell do nothing about it  ill put in a word for you if you like with old pascoe  mr rose coughed and eyed him queerly  youre a briton he said warmly  ill go and let him out at once  he strode off to the stable despite the protests of mr hogg and standing by the door appeared to be deep in thought then he came back slowly feeling in his pockets as he walked  william he said turning toward mr hogg i spose you didnt happen to notice where i put that key  that i didnt said mr hogg his face clearing suddenly  i had it in my hand not half an hour ago said the agitated mr rose thrusting one hand into his trouserpocket and groping  it cant be far  mr quince attempted to speak and failing blew his nose violently  my memory aint what it used to be said the farmer  howsomever i dare say itll turn up in a day or two  youyoud better force the door suggested mr quince struggling to preserve an air of judicial calm  no no said mr rose i aint going to damage my property like that i can lock my stabledoor and unlock it when i like if people get in there as have no business there its their lookout  thats law said mr hogg ill eat my hat if it aint  do you mean to tell me youve really lost the key demanded mr quince eyeing the farmer sternly  seems like it said mr rose  however he wont come to no hurt ill put in some bread and water for him same as you advised me to  mr quince mastered his wrath by an effort and with no sign of discomposure moved away without making any reference to the identity of the unfortunate in the stable  goodnight said the farmer and thank you for coming and giving me the fresh advice  it aint everybody that ud ha taken the trouble if i hadnt lost that key  the shoemaker scowled and with the two fat books under his arm passed the listening neighbours with the air of a thoughtful man out for an evening stroll  once inside his house however his manner changed the attitude of mrs quince demanding at any rate a show of concern  its no good talking he said at last  ned shouldnt have gone there and as for going to law about it i shant do any such thing i should never hear the end of it  i shall just go on as usual as if nothing had happened and when rose is tired of keeping him there he must let him out  ill bide my time  mrs quince subsided into vague mutterings as to what she would do if she were a man coupled with sundry aspersions upon the character looks and family connections of farmer rose which somewhat consoled her for being what she was  he has always made jokes about your advice she said at length and now everybodyll think hes right  i shant be able to look anybody in the face  i should have seen through it at once if it had been me  im going down to give him a bit o my mind  you stay where you are said mr quince sharply and mind you are not to talk about it to anybody  farmer rose ud like nothing better than to see us upset about it  i aint done with him yet  you wait  mrs quince having no option waited but nothing happened  the following day found ned quince still a prisoner and considering the circumstances remarkably cheerful  he declined pointblank to renounce his preposterous attentions and said that living on the premises he felt half like a soninlaw already  he also complimented the farmer upon the quality of his bread  the next morning found him still unsubdued and under interrogation from the farmer he admitted that he liked it and said that the feeling of being at home was growing upon him  if youre satisfied i am said mr rose grimly  ill keep you here till you promise mind that  its a noblemans life said ned peeping through the window and im beginning to like you as much as my real father  i dont want none o yer impudence said the farmer reddening  illustration none o yer impudence said the farmer  youll like me better when youve had me here a little longer said ned i shall grow on you  why not be reasonable and make up your mind to it  celia and i have  im going to send celia away on saturday said mr rose make yourself happy and comfortable in here till then  if youd like another crust o bread or an extra half pint o water youve only got to mention it  when shes gone ill have a hunt for that key so as you can go back to your father and help him to understand his lawbooks better  he strode off with the air of a conqueror and having occasion to go to the village looked in at the shoemakers window as he passed and smiled broadly  for years little haven had regarded mr quince with awe as being far too dangerous a man for the lay mind to tamper with and at one stroke the farmer had revealed the hollowness of his pretensions  only that morning the wife of a labourer had called and asked him to hurry the mending of a pair of boots  she was a voluble woman and having overcome her preliminary nervousness more than hinted that if he gave less time to the law and more to his trade it would be better for himself and everybody else  miss rose accepted her lot in a spirit of dutiful resignation and on saturday morning after her fathers admonition not to forget that the coach left the white swan at two sharp set off to pay a few farewell visits  by halfpast twelve she had finished and lawyer quince becoming conscious of a shadow on his work looked up to see her standing before the window  he replied to a bewitching smile with a short nod and became intent upon his work again  for a short time celia lingered then to his astonishment she opened the gate and walked past the side of the house into the garden  with growing astonishment he observed her enter his toolshed and close the door behind her  for ten minutes he worked on and then curiosity getting the better of him he walked slowly to the toolshed and opening the door a little way peeped in  it was a small shed crowded with agricultural implements  the floor was occupied by an upturned wheelbarrow and sitting on the barrow with her soft cheek leaning against the wall sat miss rose fast asleep  mr quince coughed several times each cough being louder than the last and then treading softly was about to return to the workshop when the girl stirred and muttered in her sleep at first she was unintelligible then he distinctly caught the words idiot and blockhead  shes dreaming of somebody said mr quince to himself with conviction  wonder who it is  cant seea thingunderhisnose murmured the fair sleeper  celia  said mr quince sharply  celia  he took a hoe from the wall and prodded her gently with the handle  a singularly vicious expression marred the soft features but that was all  celia  said the shoemaker who feared sunstroke  fancy if hehada moments common sense murmured celia drowsily and lockedthe door  lawyer quince dropped the hoe with a clatter and stood regarding her openmouthed  he was a careful man with his property and the stout door boasted a good lock  he sped to the house on tiptoe and taking the key from its nail on the kitchen dresser returned to the shed and after another puzzled glance at the sleeping girl locked her in  for half an hour he sat in silent enjoyment of the situationenjoyment which would have been increased if he could have seen mr rose standing at the gate of holly farm casting anxious glances up and down the road celias luggage had gone down to the white swan and an excellent cold luncheon was awaiting her attention in the livingroom  halfpast one came and no celia and five minutes later two farm labourers and a boy lumbered off in different directions in search of the missing girl with instructions that she was to go straight to the white swan to meet the coach  the farmer himself walked down to the inn turning over in his mind a heated lecture composed for the occasion but the coach came and after a cheerful bustle and the consumption of sundry mugs of beer sped on its way again  he returned home in silent consternation seeking in vain for a satisfactory explanation of the mystery  for a robust young woman to disappear in broad daylight and leave no trace behind her was extraordinary  then a sudden sinking sensation in the region of the waistcoat and an idea occurred simultaneously  he walked down to the village again the idea growing steadily all the way  lawyer quince was hard at work as usual as he passed  he went by the window three times and gazed wistfully at the cottage  coming to the conclusion at last that two heads were better than one in such a business he walked on to the mill and sought mr hogg  thats what it is said the miller as he breathed his suspicions i thought all along lawyer quince would have the laugh of you  hes wonderful deep now lets go to work cautious like  try and look as if nothing had happened  illustration i thought all along lawyer quince would have the laugh of you  mr rose tried  try agin said the miller with some severity  get the red out o your face and let your eyes go back and dont look as though youre going to bite somebody  mr rose swallowed an angry retort and with an attempt at careless ease sauntered up the road with the miller to the shoemakers  lawyer quince was still busy and looked up inquiringly as they passed before him  i spose said the diplomatic mr hogg who was well acquainted with his neighbours tidy and methodical habitsi spose you couldnt lend me your barrow for half an hour  the wheels off mine  mr quince hesitated and then favoured him with a glance intended to remind him of his scurvy behaviour three days before  you can have it he said at last rising  mr hogg pinched his friend in his excitement and both watched mr quince with bated breath as he took long slow strides toward the toolshed  he tried the door and then went into the house and even before his reappearance both gentlemen knew only too well what was about to happen  red was all too poor a word to apply to mr roses countenance as the shoemaker came toward them feeling in his waistcoat pocket with hooked fingers and thumb while mr hoggs expressive features were twisted into an appearance of rosy appreciation  did you want the barrow very particular inquired the shoemaker in a regretful voice  very particular said mr hogg  mr quince went through the performance of feeling in all his pockets and then stood meditatively rubbing his chin  the doors locked he said slowly and what ive done with that there key  you open that door vociferated mr rose else ill break it in youve got my daughter in that shed and im going to have her out  your daughter said mr quince with an air of faint surprise  what should she be doing in my shed  you let her out stormed mr rose trying to push past him  dont trespass on my premises said lawyer quince interposing his long gaunt frame  if you want that door opened youll have to wait till my boy ned comes home  i expect he knows where to find the key  mr roses hands fell limply by his side and his tongue turning prudish refused its office  he turned and stared at mr hogg in silent consternation  never known him to be beaten yet said that admiring weathercock  neds been away three days said the shoemaker but i expect him home soon  mr rose made a strange noise in his throat and then accepting his defeat set off at a rapid pace in the direction of home  in a marvellously short space of time considering his age and figure he was seen returning with ned quince flushed and dishevelled walking by his side  here he is said the farmer  now wheres that key  lawyer quince took his son by the arm and led him into the house from whence they almost immediately emerged with ned waving the key  i thought it wasnt far said the sapient mr hogg  ned put the key in the lock and flinging the door open revealed celia rose blinking and confused in the sudden sunshine  she drew back as she saw her father and began to cry with considerable fervour  how did you get in that shed miss  demanded her parent stamping  illustration how did you get in that shed demanded her parent  miss rose trembled  ii went there she sobbed  i didnt want to go away  well youd better stay there shouted the overwrought mr rose ive done with you  a girl that ud turn against her own father ii  he drove his right fist into his left palm and stamped out into the road lawyer quince and mr hogg after a moments hesitation followed  the laughs agin you farmer said the latter gentleman taking his arm  mr rose shook him off  better make the best of it continued the peacemaker  shes a girl to be proud of said lawyer quince keeping pace with the farmer on the other side  shes got a head thats worth yours and mine put together with hoggs thrown in as a little makeweight  and heres the white swan said mr hogg who had a hazy idea of a compliment and all of us as dry as a bone  why not all go in and have a glass to shut folks mouths  and cry quits said the shoemaker  and let bygones be bygones said mr hogg taking the farmers arm again  mr rose stopped and shook his head obstinately and then under the skilful pilotage of mr hogg was steered in the direction of the hospitable doors of the white swan  he made a last bid for liberty on the step and then disappeared inside  lawyer quince brought up the rear
