sir samuel shepherd  this curious tract respecting perhaps the only subject of legal enquiry which has escaped being investigated by his skill and illustrated by his genius  is respectfully inscribed by his affectionate friend and much obliged humble servant  walter scott  15th feb 1831     introduction   although the giving information concerning the unfair manner in which they were dismissed from life is popularly alleged to have been a frequent reason why departed spirits revisit the nether world it is yet only in a play of the witty comedian foote that the reader will find their appearance become the subject of formal and very ingenious pleadings in his farce called the orators the celebrated cocklane ghost is indicted by the name of fanny the phantom for that contrary to the kings peace it did annoy assault and terrify divers persons residing in cocklane and elsewhere in the county of middlesex the senior counsel objects to his client pleading to the indictment unless she is tried by her equals in rank and therefore he moves the indictment be quashed unless a jury of ghosts be first had and obtained to this it is replied that although fanny the phantom had originally a right to a jury of ghosts yet in taking upon her to knock to flutter and to scratch she did by condescending to operations proper to humanity wave her privileges as a ghost and must consent to be tried in the ordinary manner it occurs to the justice who tries the case that there will be difficulty in impanelling a jury of ghosts and he doubts how twelve spirits who have no body at all can be said to take a corporal oath as required by law unless indeed as in the case of the peerage the prisoner may be tried upon her honour at length the counsel for the prosecution furnishes the list of ghosts for the selection of the jury being the most celebrated apparitions of modern times namely sir george villiers the evil genius of brutus the ghost of banquo and the phantom of mrs veal the counsel for the prosecution objects to a woman and the court dissolves under the facetious order that if the phantom should plead pregnancy mrs veal will be admitted upon the jury of matrons  this admirable foolery is carried by the english aristophanes nearly as far as it will go yet it is very contrary to the belief of those who conceive that injured spirits are often the means of procuring redress for wrongs committed upon their mortal frames to find how seldom in any country an allusion hath been made to such evidence in a court of justice although according to their belief such instances must have frequently occurred one or two cases of such apparitionevidence our researches have detected  it is a popular story that an evidence for the crown began to tell the substance of an alleged conversation with the ghost of a murdered man in which he laid his death to the accused person at the bar stop said the judge with becoming gravity this will not do the evidence of the ghost is excellent none can speak with a clearer cause of knowledge to any thing which befell him during life but he must be sworn in usual form call the ghost in open court and if he appears the jury and i will give all weight to his evidence but in case he does not come forward he cannot be heard as now proposed through the medium of a third party it will readily be conceived that the ghost failed to appear and the accusation was dismissed  in the french causes célèbres et interessantes is one entitled le spectre ou lillusion réprouvé reported by guyot de pittaval vol xii edition la haye 1749 in which a countryman prosecutes a tradesman named auguier for about twenty thousand francs said to have been lent to the tradesman it was pretended that the loan was to account of the proceeds of a treasure which mirabel the peasant had discovered by means of a ghost or spirit and had transferred to the said auguier that he might convert it into cash for him the case had some resemblance to that of fanny the phantom the defendant urged the impossibility of the original discovery of the treasure by the spirit to the prosecutor but the defence was repelled by the influence of the principal judge and on a charge so ridiculous auguier narrowly escaped the torture at length though with hesitation the prosecutor was nonsuited upon the ground that if his own story was true the treasure by the ancient laws of france belonged to the crown so that the ghostseer though he had nearly occasioned the defendant to be put to the question profited in the end nothing by his motion  this is something like a decision of the great frederick of prussia one of his soldiers a catholic pretended peculiar sanctity and an especial devotion to a particular image of the virgin mary which richly decorated with ornaments by the zeal of her worshippers was placed in a chapel in one of the churches of the city where her votary was quartered the soldier acquired such familiarity with the object of his devotion and was so much confided in by the priests that he watched for and found an opportunity of possessing himself of a valuable diamond necklace belonging to the madonna although the defendant was taken in the manner he had the impudence knowing the case was to be heard by the king to say that the madonna herself had voluntarily presented him with her necklace observing that as her good and faithful votary he had better apply it to his necessities than that it should remain useless in her custody  the king happy of the opportunity of tormenting the priests demanded of them whether there was a possibility that the soldiers defence might be true their faith obliged them to grant that the story was possible while they exhausted themselves on the improbabilities which attended it nevertheless said the king since it is possible we must in absence of proof receive it as true in the first instance all i can do to check an imprudent generosity of the saints in future is to publish an edict or public order that all soldiers in my service who shall accept any gift from the virgin or any saint whatever shall eo ipso incur the penalty of death  amongst english trials there is only mention of a ghost in a very incidental manner in that of john cole fourth year of william and mary state trials vol xii the case is a species of supplement to that of the wellknown trial of henry harrison which precedes it in the same collection of which the following is the summary  a respectable doctor of medicine clenche had the misfortune to offend a haughty violent and imperious woman of indifferent character named vanwinckle to whom he had lent money and who he wished to repay it a hackneycoach with two men in it took up the physician by night as they pretended to carry him to visit a patient but on the road they strangled him with a handkerchief having a coal or some such hard substance placed against their victims windpipe and escaped from the coach one henry harrison a man of loose life connected with this mrs vanwinckle the borrower of the money was tried convicted and executed on pretty clear evidence yet he died denying the crime charged the case being of a shocking nature of course interested the feelings of the common people and another person was accused as an accessory the principal evidence against whom was founded on this story  a woman called millward pretended that she had seen the ghost of her deceased husband who told her that one john cole had assisted him the ghost in the murder of dr clenche cole was brought to trial accordingly but the charge was totally despised both by judge and jury and produced no effect whatever in obtaining conviction  such being the general case with respect to apparitions really alluded to or quoted in formal evidence in courts of justice an evidence of that kind gravely given and received in the high court of justiciary in scotland has some title to be considered as a curiosity  the editors connexion with it is of an old standing since shortly after he was called to the bar in 1792 it was pointed out to him by robert mintosh esq one of the counsel in the case then and long after remarkable for the interest which he took and the management which he possessed in the prolix and complicated affairs of the york building company  the cause of the trial bloody and sad enough in its own nature was one of the acts of violence which were the natural consequences of the civil war in 1745  it was about three years after the battle of culloden that this poor man sergeant davis was quartered with a small military party in an uncommonly wild part of the highlands near the country of the farquharsons as it is called and adjacent to that which is now the property of the earl of fife a more waste tract of mountain and bog rocks and ravines extending from dubrach to glenshee without habitations of any kind until you reach glenclunie is scarce to be met with in scotland a more fit locality therefore for a deed of murder could hardly be pointed out nor one which could tend more to agitate superstitious feelings the hill of christie on which the murder was actually committed is a local name which is probably known in the country though the editor has been unable to discover it more specially but it certainly forms part of the ridge to which the general description applies davis was attached to the country where he had his residence by the great plenty of sport which it afforded and when dispatched upon duty across these mountains he usually went at some distance from his men and followed his game without regarding the hints thrown out about danger from the country people to this he was exposed not only from his being intrusted with the odious office of depriving the people of their arms and national dress but still more from his usually carrying about with him a stock of money and valuables considerable for the time and period and enough of itself to be a temptation to his murder  on the 28th day of september the sergeant set forth along with a party which was to communicate with a separate party of english soldiers at glenshee but when daviss men came to the place of rendezvous their commander was not with them and the privates could only say that they had heard the report of his gun after he had parted from them on his solitary sport in short sergeant arthur davis was seen no more in this life and his remains were long sought for in vain at length a native of the country named mpherson made it known to more than one person that the spirit of the unfortunate huntsman had appeared to him and told him he had been murdered by two highlanders natives of the country named duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bane macdonald proofs accumulated and a person was even found to bear witness that lying in concealment upon the hill of christie the spot where poor davis was killed he and another man now dead saw the crime committed with their own eyes a girl whom clerk afterwards married was nearly at the same time seen in possession of two valuable rings which the sergeant used to have about his person lastly the counsel and agent of the prisoners were convinced of their guilt yet notwithstanding all these suspicious circumstances the panels were ultimately acquitted by the jury  this was chiefly owing to the ridicule thrown upon the story by the incident of the ghost which was enhanced seemingly if not in reality by the ghostseer stating the spirit to have spoken as good gaelic as he had ever heard in lochaberpretty well answered mr mintosh for the ghost of an english sergeant this was indeed no sound jest for there was nothing more ridiculous in a ghost speaking a language which he did not understand when in the body than there was in his appearing at all but still the counsel had a right to seize upon whatever could benefit his clients and there is no doubt that this observation rendered the evidence of the spectre yet more ridiculous in short it is probable that the ghost of sergeant davis had he actually been to devise how to prevent these two men from being executed for his own murder could hardly have contrived a better mode than by the apparition in the manner which was sworn to  the most rational supposition seems to be that the crime had come to mpherson the ghostseers knowledge by ordinary means of which there is some evidence but desiring to have a reason for communicating it which could not be objected to by the people of the country he had invented this machinery of the ghost whose commands according to highland belief were not to be disobeyed if such were his motives his legend though it seemed to set his own tongue at liberty upon the subject yet it impressed on his evidence the fate of cassandras prophecies that however true it should not have the fortune to be believed  abbotsford 18th march 1830     trial of  duncan terig alias clerk

the indictment raised against them thereanent which indictment maketh mention that whereas by the laws of god and of this and all other well governed realms murder or homicide is a most atrocious crime and severely punishable especially committed with an intent to rob the person murdered and that by persons of bad fame and character who are habite and repute thieves yet true it is and of verity that they and each of them or one or other of them are guilty actors or art and part of the foresaid crime aggravated as aforesaid in so far as the deceast arthur davies serjeant in the regiment of foot commanded by general guise being in the year one thousand seven hundred and fortynine quartered or lodged alongst with a party of men or soldiers belonging to the said regiment in dubrach or glendee in braemar in the parish of  and sheriffdom of aberdeen he the said arthur davies did upon the twentyeighth day september one thousand seven hundred and fortynine or upon one or other of the days of that month or of the month of august immediately preceding or october immediately following go from thence to a hill in braemar commonly called christie at the head of glenconie in the parish of  and sheriffdom aforesaid as also that same day both of them the said duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bain macdonald went from the house of john grant in altalaat armed with guns and muskets pretending when they went from thence that they were going to shoot or hunt deer upon the said hill to which place both of them having accordingly gone and there meeting with the said arthur davies each or one or other of them did on the said twentyeighth of september 1749 or upon one or other of the days of that month or of the months aforesaid cruelly and barbarously fire a loaded gun or guns at him which were in their hands whereby he was mortally wounded and of which wounds he died on the said hill immediately or soon thereafter where his dead body remained concealed for sometime and was afterwards found together with a hat having a silver button on it with the letters a r d marked on it likeas soon after the said arthur davies was murdered each of the said two panels being persons of bad fame and character and who were habite and repute thieves were by the general voice of the country reputed to have perpetrated the said murder and to have robbed and taken from him a silver watch two gold rings and a purse of gold which it was known or believed in the country he generally wore or carried about him which said opinion or belief of the neighbourhood that both of them had been guilty of the said murder and robbery has been since that time rendered the more credible particularly with respect to him the said duncan clerk in so far as although he was not possesst of any visible funds or effects which could enable him to stock a farm before the period of the said murder yet soon thereafter he took and obtained a lease from lord bracco of a farm called the craggan for which he was bound to pay thirty pounds scots of yearly rent as also thereafter he obtained a lease of the farm of gleney from  farquharson of inverey for which at present he was bound to pay a yearly rent or tack duty of one hundred and five merks scots as appears from the judicial declaration of him the said duncan clerk to be hereafter more particularly taken notice of and both of the said panels having been apprehended in the year one thousand seven hundred and fiftythree for being guilty of the foresaid murder and upon the twentythird day of january last one thousand seven hundred and fiftyfour years brought into the presence of the right honourable alexander fraser of strichen and hugh dalrymple of drummore two of the lords commissioners of justiciary each of them gave different and contradictory accounts of themselves in so far as the said duncan clerk did then acknowledge in presence of the said judges that he was on the hill of gleneye alongst with the said alexander bain macdonald both armed as above set forth on the day the said arthur davies was amissing that the said alexander macdonald fired a shot at some deer but that about ten oclock the said duncan clerk parted with him on the hill and came back to his fathers house to which likewise the said alexander macdonald came the same evening where he lodged or stayed all night as also a paper containing a list of debts beginning with the words i duncan clerk in gleneye was put in perth jail and ending angus macdonald 12 sh now marked on the back with the name and sirname of the said lord drummore being exhibited to him the said duncan clerk he acknowledged the same to be his handwriting and that it contains a list of debts due to him when he was imprisoned as is at more length to be seen in his said confession or declaration signed by him and the said lord drummore likeas he the said alexander bain macdonald did upon the twentythird day of january last one thousand seven hundred and fiftyfour years in presence of the said judges acknowledge and declare that one year while he was lord braccos forrester he went with the said duncan clerk to the hill of gleneye to search for deer where he fired at them but that about nine or ten oclock in the forenoon duncan clerk went home to his fathers house and thereafter the said alexander macdonald returned to his own house in allanquoich where he staid all that night not seeing the said duncan clerk more that day as is at more length to be seen in his said confession or declaration signed by the said lord drummore he having declared he could not write both which confessions or declarations with the list of debts above specified said to be due to him the said duncan clerk as also the hat mentioned to be found in summer one thousand seven hundred and fifty in the hill of gleneye are all now lodged in the hands of the clerk to the court of justiciary before which they are to be tried that they may see the same at least time and place aforesaid the said arthur davies was murdered or bereaved of his life and they and each of them or one or other of them are guilty actor or art and part of the said murder aggravated as above set furth all which or part thereof being found proven by the verdict of an assize before the lords justice general justice clerk and commissioners of justiciary he the said duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bain macdonald ought to be punished with the pains of law to the terror of others to commit the like in time coming            signed           alex home ad     pursuers      william grant of prestongrange esq his majesties advocate      mr patrick haldane and     mr alexander home     both his majesties solicitors      mr robert dundas advocate   procurators in defence      mr alexander lockhart     mr robert mintosh     advocates   the libel being openly read in court and the panels interrogate thereupon they both denied the same and referred their defences to their lawiers  lockhart c for the panel denying the libel or any guilt or accession of the panels to the murder charged pled that the panels were persons of good fame and reputation and that as no cause of malice in them against serjeant davies was alleged so the circumstances founded on in the indictment though they were true were not in any sort sufficient to infer a proof of the panels guilt and further the panels would be able to prove a true and warrantable cause for going to the hill libelled on in arms and that they went openly and avowedly and that in the circumstances they were in it was impossible they could have any wicked design against or expect to have an opportunity of executing such a design against serjeant davies that they were not so much as suspected of murdering him at the time of his being amissing or for several months thereafter when many different accounts were given and suspicions raised and entertained concerning that matter they also objected and alleged for the panels that as murder was the only crime charged against them in this indictment no vague or general allegation of robbery or other crime or accusation against their characters could be allowed to go to the knowledge of an assize though they were noways apprehensive of the consequences of it other than from the false and malicious reports raised and propagated against them since their commitment for the foresaid crime and the panels had great reason to complain of the undue delays in bringing them to trial for this offence in so far as after they were committed for the same in september last and had taken out letters of intimation and upon expiry of the days had also obtained letters of liberation they were again committed upon a new warrant for alleged theft upon which new commitment they raised new letters of intimation and when the sixty days were just expiring they were served with an indictment for the theft which was fixed to within a few days of the expiry of the forty days allowed by law and then allowed to drop and after all there was again a new warrant of commitment obtained against them for wearing the highland dress and last of all they were served with this indictment all which steps plainly show the oppression they have met with which the panels do by no means lay to the charge of the prosecutor but are willing to allow the same to be owing to the malicious information of some private informer which they hope to be able to make appear if they were allowed an exculpatory proof and that very undue means had been used both before and since the citation of the witnesses to influence them to give evidence against the panels in this matter and the panels amongst many other things for their exculpation would be able to prove that after they returned from the hill upon the day upon which the serjeant is said to have been murdered he the serjeant was seen with his party in that hill so that it is impossible the panels could be the perpetrators of the murder  lord advocate c answered that as the defence resolved altogether into a denial of the libel it was sufficient for him to say that according to the information he had received such facts and circumstances would come out upon proof as would be sufficient to convince the jury of the panels guilt that it was not meant that the circumstances libelled were sufficient without others to connect with them the only intention of libelling upon these circumstances being to show the panels what written evidence was to be adduced against them that he does not oppose the panels being allowed a proof of every fact and circumstance that may tend to their exculpation that as to the delay complained of the prosecutor can for himself say that it is owing to no intention of his to oppress the panels he had early information of the murder charged upon and was very willing and desirous it might come to light the panels were at last accused and committed for it by the general voice of the country and though at first the proof against them did not appear so pregnant yet it was hoped and was the general expectation of all in that part that the murder would be brought to light this was the reason of continuing the panels in confinement and now that the prosecutor was ready to go on to trial he hoped their lordships would find the indictment relevant and remit the panels to the knowledge of an assize allowing them at the same time a proof of every circumstance that may appear necessary for their exculpation  the lords justice clerk and commissioners of justiciary having considered the indictment pursued at the instance of william grant of prestongrange esq his majesties advocate for his majesties interest against duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bain macdonald both now prisoners in the tolbooth of edinburgh panels with the foresaid debate thereupon they find the said indictment relevant to infer the pains of law but allow the panels to prove all facts and circumstances that may tend to elide the indictment or exculpate them or either of them from the guilt of the crime therein libelled and remit the panels with the indictment as found relevant to the knowledge of an assize            signed           ch areskine ipd  the lords continue the diet at the instance of his majesties advocate against the said two panels till

no objection to the contrary  the panels and their procurators admitted the two judicial declarations libelled on were emitted by them before the two judges therein named and the said panels both now judicially adhere to the same with this variation for alexander bain macdonald that it was a mistake in his said declaration where it is said that he went home to the house in allanquoich where he staid that night and did not see duncan clerk any more that day after they parted on the hill the true fact being that he did not go home to the house in allanquoich where he resided till the night thereafter and in the evening of that night went to the house of duncan clerks father where he found duncan clerk and staid all night and that the reason of his former mistake was that he by himself went again to the hills upon the twentyninth in quest of the deer which he had wounded the preceding day and returned to his own house the evening of the said twentyninth and this admission is signed

years who being solemnly sworn purged of malice and partial council and interrogate depones that she was married for the space of ten months to serjeant davies the day he was missing and that in summer seventeen hundred and fortynine her husband with eight private men under his command marched from aberdeen to dubrach in braemar in the shire of aberdeen which was assigned to him as his station and that there was another party of the same regiment whose headquarters was at aberdeen stationed at the spittle of glenlee within eight miles of dubrach under the command of a corporal that the two parties did meet twice aweek in patrol about half way between the foresaid two places that her husband was a keen sportsman and used to go out ashooting or fishing generally every day and when he went along with the party on patrol sent the men home and followed his sport and on other occasions went out ashooting by himself alone that her husband was a sober man a good manager and had saved money to the value of about fifteen guineas and a half which he had in gold and kept in a green silk purse which he inclosed within a leather purse along with any silver he had that besides this gold he generally wore a silver watch in his pocket and two gold rings upon one of his fingers one of which was of pale yellow gold and had a little lump of gold raised upon it in the form of a seal with a gold stamp on the inside of the ring and a weaved line like a worm round the upper side of the plate that the other was a plain gold ring which the deponent had got from david holland her first husband with the letters d h on the inside and had this posie on it when this you see remember me that the said david holland was paymasterserjeant in general guises regiment and further depones that the said serjeant davies commonly wore a pair of large silver buckles in his shoes marked also with the same letters d h in the inside which likewise had belonged to her said former husband as also wore silver kneebuckles and had two dozen silver buttons upon a doublebreasted vest made of stript lutstring that he frequently had about him a folding penknife that had a brown tortoiseshell handle and a plate upon the end of it on which was cut a naked boy or some such device with which he often sealed his letters that one day when he was dressing some hooks while the deponent was by she observed that he was cutting his hat with his penknife and she went towards him and asked him what he meant by cutting his hat to which he answered that he was cutting his name upon it to which the deponent replied she could not see what he could mean by putting his name upon a thing of no value and pulled it out of his hand in a jocular way but he followed her and took the hat from her and she observed that the a was then cut out in the hat and after he got it she saw him cut out the letter d which he did in a hurry and which the deponent believed was occasioned by the toying that was between them concerning this matter for when she observed it she said to him you have made a pretty sort of work of it by having misplaced the letters to which he answered that it was her fault having caused him do it in a hurry and the hat now upon the table and which is lying in the clerks hands and referred to in the indictment being shown to her depones that to the best of her judgment and belief that is the hat above mentioned depones that she never has seen neither the said serjeant the gold purse or silver purse above mentioned nor the buckles for his shoes and knees watch or penknife since he marched from his quarters with the party at the time at which he is supposed to have been murdered depones that on thursday being the day immediately preceding michaelmas being the twentyeighth of september one thousand seven hundred and fortynine her husband went out very early in the morning from dubrach and that four men of the party under his command soon after followed him in order to meet the patrol from glenshye and in the afternoon before four oclock the four men returned to dubrach and acquainted the deponent that they had seen and heard him fire a shot as they believed at tarmatans but that he did not join company with them that at the place appointed they met with a corporal and a party from glenshee and then retired home depones that her husband never returned that she has never met with any body that saw him after the party returned from the foresaid place excepting the corporal that that day commanded the party from glenshee who told her that after the forementioned party from dubrach had gone away from the foresaid appointed place serjeant davies came up to him all alone upon which the corporal told him he thought it was very unreasonable in him to venture upon the hill by himself as for his part he was not without fear even when he had his party of four men along with him to which serjeant davies answered that when he had his arms and ammunition about him he did not fear any body he could meet depones that her husband serjeant davies made no secret of his having the gold above mentioned but upon the many different occasions he had to pay and receive money he used to take out his purse and show the gold and that even when he was playing with children he would frequently take out his purse and rattle it for their diversion from which it was generally known by all the neighbourhood that the serjeant was worth money and carried it about him depones that from the second day after the serjeant and party went from dubrach as aforesaid when the deponent found he did not return she did believe and does believe at this day that he was murdered for that he and she lived together in as great amity and love as any couple could do that ever were married and that he never was in use to stay away a night from her and that it was not possible he could be under any temptation to desert as he was much esteemed and beloved by all his officers and had good reason to believe he would have been promoted to the rank of serjeantmajor upon the first vacancy depones that when her husband went away from dubrach on the morning of the twentyeighth of september aforesaid he was dressed in a blue surtout coat with a stripped silk vest and teiken breeches and brown stockings that he had in his purse fifteen guineas and a half in gold a crown piece and three shillings in silver his silver watch in his pocket with a silver seal at it his silver buckles in his shoes and his silver buttons on his waistcoat and the above mentioned rings on his fingers and being asked how she came to know all these things were on him or about him when he went away as aforesaid depones that she was privy and knew every thing that related to his money and the night before the said twentyeighth of september the serjeant from braemar had come to dubrach and in the deponents presence had given some money which was gold to serjeant davies who gave him silver that he had by him for it to pay the party and upon occasion of this she saw the quantity of gold above mentioned which was in her husbands possession and that she saw the vest with the buttons and rings on his fingers and also the watch before he went away he having in her presence put on the teiken drawers above mentioned desired from her somewhat to keep the watch dry upon which she gave him a piece of cloth the said drawers being a little damp in which he wrapt it and put it into his pocket depones that he had dark mousecoloured hair tied up with a black silk ribband behind and wore a hat with a silver lace and silver button marked with the letters d a on the outside of the crown of the hat and the deponent verily believes that the hat now shown to her and above referred to is the hat he took out with him depones that he wore that day a pair of brogues which he had bespoke to be made so as they could fit buckles and not to be tied with latches conform to the common use of that country that these brogues the deponent saw when they were first brought home from glenshee depones that a gun now exhibited and shown to the deponent is the gun which her husband serjeant davies received in a present from lieutenant brydon of the same regiment with him and the gun which he always used when he went ashooting and which he carried out with him in the morning of the twentyeighth of september one thousand seven hundred and fortynine aforesaid that the stock of the gun is altered about the butt and a plate that was on the buttend is taken away and the wood pared but that she knows the barrel by a cross rent that is in it a little above the middle and which her husband told her had been occasioned by his firing a shot when the gun was overloaded and the ball had stuck at that part of the barrel when he was loading her depones that from the time her husband was quartered at dubrach in the month of june to the foresaid twentyeighth of september one thousand seven hundred and fortynine he was never absent a night from his command at dubrach except one that he went to the doctor of the regiment to take his advice about a strain and he returned next morning depones that upon the monday after the serjeant was believed to be murdered the country was raised to make search for the body but it was not found and that she spoke to one of the prisoners clerk whom she took to be a particular friend to try if he could find the body but it was not found that afterwards the deponent went to the garrison in braemar and from that to the regiment and being interrogate for the panels whether her husband had received any information before the party marched out upon the day above mentioned that there were people in arms in that country where he was stationed depones that her husband was stationed there as she believes because it was said that severals of the highlanders had not delivered up their arms since the rebellion and wore the highland garb but that she knows nothing of any particular information he had about that time except that about the beginning of harvest on a sunday afternoon a woman who said she had been in the hill came in where the serjeant and the deponent were sitting at dinner and said that she had seen two men in highland clothes and armed lying at the mouth of a cave who seemed to be herding two cows which she saw and upon her coming near them consulted among themselves whether they should not bind her lest she should return and advertise serjeant davies and his party but however she had got away and had come immediately to give notice to the serjeant and his party whereupon he and a party of six men went up in quest of them but found nobody neither did the deponent hear any more of that matter afterwards causa scientiæ patet and this is truth as she shall answer to god and declares she cannot write            signed           ch areskine   donald farquharson in glendee married man who being solemnly sworn purged of malice and partial council and interrogate depones that in summer one thousand seven hundred and fortynine arthur davies late serjeant in general guises regiment was with a serjeants command of soldiers stationed in dubrach in glendee in braemar in aberdeenshire and the serjeant with his wife the preceding witness stayed in the house of michael farquharson the deponents father where the deponent also stayed depones that the serjeant was a sober well behaving man very civil to the country and so far as the deponent knew had the goodwill of the country that he was a good manager of his money and the deponent has seen with him a good deal of gold which he commonly kept in a long purse either blue or green the deponent does not remember which and he had also another purse in which he kept his silver that he had a silver watch with a seal hanging at it and silver buckles in his shoes and knees of his breeches that the deponent has seen two vests with him one with a white stripe and the other of a roes skin and that he had a set of silver buttons for a vest which he used with the one or other as he had occasion that he had also two rings which he told the deponent were gold the one of them a large coarse ring with a knob on the one side of it either of the shape of a seal or a heart the deponent does not remember which depones that when serjeant davies went ashooting or fishing he was commonly dressed in one of the above vests and a blue meet upper coat or surtout with highland brogues which he had purchased for the purpose and had caused to be made so as to be tied with silver buckles depones that on the above gold ring with the knob there was upon the upper side of the knob some scores that the deponent did not understand the meaning of depones that the serjeant was wont frequently to take out his purse either in paying or receiving money or some time even in playing with children and that when he went ahunting or shooting he always wore a laced hat with a silver button depones that the last time the deponent saw him was on wednesday the twentyseventh day of september one thousand seven hundred and fortynine the deponent having gone that day to the fair at kirkmichael eighteen miles from his fathers house and did not return till saturday thereafter depones that at his return passing by the house where the soldiers were quartered one of them named patrick ogilvie asked the deponent whether he had seen serjeant davies at the fair and the deponent having answerd that he did not see him and that certainly he had not been there or he would have seen him ogilvie then said he was afraid of him for that he had gone away upon the thursday to meet a patrol from glenshee and had not yet returned that they supposed he had gone with that patrol to the fair but that since he was not there he suspected he had been murdered and the deponent never saw him alive since that time depones that the captain of that command to whom the serjeant belonged hearing that he was amissing sent a party of men on the sunday to dubrach to search for his body and went with them for three or four following days but without any success depones that in the month of june seventeen hundred and fifty the deponent was told by the people in his fathers house that alexander macpherson alias mgillas had been there inquiring for him and wanted much to see him and desired the deponent would go to his masters sheilling in glenconie about two miles distance from dubrach and that he wanted much to speak to him that after some days the deponent went to him when macpherson told him that he was greatly troubled with an apparition the ghost of the deceased serjeant davies who insisted that he should bury his bones and that he having declined to bury them the ghost insisted that he should apply to the deponent saying that he was sure donald farquharson would help to bury his bones that the deponent could not believe that he had seen such an apparition upon which macpherson desired him to go along with him and he would show him the bones and the place where he had found them that the deponent went along with him which he did the rather that he thought it might possibly be true and if it was he did not know but the apparition might trouble himself depones that they accordingly found the bones in a peatmoss where peats had been casten above ground and near to the top of a hill that the place was distant from dubrach between two and three miles between glenchristie and glenconie and about half a mile from the road the patroling parties commonly take from dubrach to glenshee that the spot where the body was lying had the surface of the ground entire and no peats had been casten there that the flesh had been mostly consumed from the bones and the head separated from the body and the hair lying by itself separated from the head and depones that the hair was of the same colour with the serjeants hair a mouse colour that they also found some blue cloth all torn in rags some of it under the body and some of it lying by the body and it appeared to the deponent to be of the same kind of cloth with that of the blue coat that the serjeant commonly wore when he went ashooting depones that the bones were not all lying together but were scattered asunder particularly some of the joints of his arms and one of his legs and that some of them were scattered at the distance of several yards depones that macpherson told him that when he first found the bones which was about eight days before that they were lying farther off under a bank and he drew them out with his staff depones that they also found a pair of brogues which appeared to the deponent to be of the same kind with what the serjeant wore only with this difference that the taggs for the buckles were cut away which seemed to have been done with a knife depones that he asked macpherson whether the apparition had told him by whom he had been murdered that macpherson said he had asked the question and the apparition answered that if he had not asked him he would have power to have told him that the deponent also asked him if the apparition had given him any orders about carrying his bones to a churchyard depones that macpherson said he had given no answer and thereupon they agreed to bury him in that place and accordingly they dug a hole in the moss with the shaft of a shovel that macpherson had and buried the bones there and laid a part of the blue cloth under the bones and a part of it above it and covered all with some turfs that they had tore up from the moss and being showed a fusee depones that one day the serjeant and the deponent went out adeerhunting and the serjeant in loading his gun which was either a french or a spanish piece happened to put in a ball that was too large for the bore so that he could not with the ramrod drive it down to the powder that the deponent advised him to go to his fathers sheilling to get a stronger ramrod but the serjeant being impatient to go about his diversion fired the fusee and cracked the barrel about the middle and having examined the fusee now produced observed that the barrel is cracked about the same place and so far as appears to him may be the same barrel depones that there appears to be some alterations made upon the stock since the serjeant had it that the but was thicker than it is now and clad with iron at the end and there was also another ring for the keeping of the ramrod other than that now shown him depones that the gun was shown to the deponent on wednesday last by james growar son to donald growar in glendee who told him that he found it in the hill in sight of glenconie depones that after serjeant davies was killed or amissing as aforesaid he saw yellow rings on elizabeth downies fingers spouse to the prisoner duncan terig alias clerk one of which had a knob upon it as serjeant daviess ring also had but does not remember the shape of either of these knobs depones that he asked her whether it was gold and she said it was depones that he saw this ring upon elizabeth downies finger before she was married to the prisoner but it was then reported in the country that he was in suit of her for marriage and has at several times before and since serjeant davies was amissing seen other yellow rings upon her fingers but never saw the ring with the knob upon her finger till after the serjeant was amissing nor never saw it on her finger after she was married and being asked whether it did not strike him when he saw the ring with the knob on it upon elizabeth downies hand that it was serjeant daviess ring depones that it did not and further depones that he has known elizabeth downie change her rings every other year depones that after she was married the deponent asked her if she had a gold ring and she answered she never had one but one which was her mothers which made the deponent suppose that the said ring with the knob had been her mothers and depones that the panel her husband was in prison when he asked her this question depones that at first there was a report in the country that serjeant davies had deserted then it was supposed that he had been killed by the thieves but last of all the report was that he had been killed by the prisoners and that has continued to be the report of the country for these three years and being asked what he took to be the grounds of that report depones that he took it to be that macdonald as lord braccos forrester had a warrant for carrying guns for killing of deer and he carried clerk alongst with him and none other of the country had any warrant to carry arms but he heard that some of the people in the country suspected that the ring with the knob that he had seen on elizabeth downies finger was serjeant daviess ring and being interrogate as to the character of the two panels depones that he has heard clerk habite and repute a sheepstealer but that he never heard any thing of macdonald but that he once broke the chest of one corbie and took some money out of it depones that he never heard clerk get the character of a good deerstalker though he could shoot wild fowl depones that alexander macpherson before mentioned once served the deponents father and is accounted an honest lad but on the panels interrogatory depones that he has been charged with telling of stories and that all is not to be believed that he says though that is the general character the deponent knows no reason for it depones that duncan clerk once pursued his accusers before a sheriff court at braemar and freed himself at that time and as he heard got some mends of his accusers but what it was he knows not that the only particular act of theft he heard him accused of was the stealing of a parcel of sheep from alexander farquharson in inverey and which was the ground of the process before mentioned before the sheriff depones that the sabbath before the serjeant was amissing a woman came to the deponents fathers house and told them that coming through the hills she had seen four thieves in arms who had separated fourteen of his fathers cattle upon which the serjeant with a party went in quest of them immediately but could find none of them they having it seems gone off and left the cattle depones that upon the friday the twentyninth of september the corporal stationed at glenshee met with the deponent at the fair of kirkmichael while the deponent was buying a pair of shoes and he told the corporal that they were for serjeant davies and the corporal told him that he had parted with the serjeant the day before at the water of benow the serjeant after that was going to the hill to get a shot of the deer which water of benow is about half a miles distance from the place where the patrolling parties used to meet depones that the prisoner clerk was a common dealer in buying of sheep and cattle and the deponent has seen him both buying and paying the price and his father was reputed one of the richest tenants in invereys grounds causa scientiæ patet and this is truth as he shall answer to god            signed           donald farquharson                              p grant   alexander mpherson alias mcgillas in inverey being solemnly sworn purged of malice and partial council and interrogate aged twentysix years unmarried depones that in summer one thousand seven hundred and fifty he found lying in a moss bank in the hill of christie a human body at least the bones of a human body of which the flesh was mostly consumed and he believed it to be the body of serjeant davies because it was reported in the country that he had been murdered in that hill the year before that when he first found this body there was a bit of blue cloth upon it pretty entire which he took to be what is called english cloth he also found the hair of the deceased which was of a dark mouse colour and tied about with a black ribbon that he also observed some pieces of a stripped stuff and found also lying there a pair of brogues which had been made with latches for buckles which had been cut away by a knife that he by help of his staff brought out the body and laid it upon plain ground in doing whereof some of the bones were separated one from another depones that for some days he was in a doubt what to do but meeting with john growar in the moss he told john what he had found and john bid him tell nothing of it otherways he would complain of the deponent to john shaw of daldownie upon which the deponent resolved to prevent growars complaint and go and tell daldownie of it himself and which having accordingly done daldownie desired him to conceal the matter and go and bury the body privately as it would not be carried to a kirk unkent and that the same might hurt the country being under the suspicion of being a rebel country depones that some few days thereafter he acquainted donald farquharson the preceding witness of his having seen the body of a dead man in the hill which he took to be the body of serjeant davies that farquharson at first doubted the truth of his information till the deponent having told him that a few nights before when he was in bed a vision appeared to him as of a man clad in blue who told the deponent i am serjeant davies but that before he told him so the deponent had taken the said vision at first appearance to be a real living man a brother of donald farquharsons that the deponent rose from his bed and followed him to the door and then it was as has been told that he said he was serjeant davies who had been murdered in the hill of christie about near a year before and desired the deponent to go to the place he pointed at where he would find his bones and that he might go to donald farquharson and take his assistance to the burying of him that upon giving donald farquharson this information donald went along with him and finding the bones as he informed donald and having then buried it with the help of a spade which he the deponent had alongst with him and for putting what is above deponed upon out of doubt depones that the above vision was the occasion of his going by himself to see the dead body and which he did before he either spoke to john growar daldownie or any other body and further depones that while he was in bed another night after he had first seen the body by himself but had not buried it the vision again appeared naked and minded him to bury the body and after that he spoke to the other folks above mentioned and at last complied and buried the bones above mentioned depones that upon the visions first appearance to the deponent in his bed and after going out of the door and being told by it he was serjeant davies the deponent asked him who it was that had murdered him to which it made this answer that if the deponent had not asked him he might have told him but as he had asked him he said he either could not or would not but which of the two expressions the deponent cannot say but at the second time the vision made its appearance to him the deponent renewed the same question and then the vision answered that it was the two men now in the panel that had murdered him and being further interrogate in what manner the vision disappeared from him first and last depones that after the short interviews above mentioned the vision at both times disappeared and vanished out of his sight in the twinkling of an eye and that in describing the panels by the vision above mentioned as his murderers his words were duncan clerk and alexander macdonald depones that the conversation betwixt the deponent and the vision was in the irish language depones that several times in the harvest before the martinmas after seeing the said vision he was applied to by duncan clerk the panel then to enter home to his service at that time which accordingly he did and staid in his service just a year and he being in the hill together with duncan clerk spying a young cow desired the deponent to shoot it and tho duncan did not bid him carry it home after it should be shot yet the deponent understood that to be the purpose when duncan desired him to shoot it and which the deponent refused to do adding that it was such thoughts as these were in his head when he murdered serjeant davies upon which some angry expressions happened between duncan and the deponent but when the deponent insisted upon it that he could not deny the murder duncan fell calm and desired the deponent to say nothing of that matter and that he would be a brother to him and give him every thing he stood in need of and particularly would help him to stock a farm when he took one and the time of deponing the deponent exhibited a paper which is marked on the back by the lord examiner the deponent averring he cannot write and depones that the said paper was put in his hands by the said duncan clerk who at the time told him it was a premium of twenty pounds scots to hold his tongue of what he knew of serjeant davies depones that while the deponent was in the panel duncan clerks service and about lammas seventeen hundred and fiftyone he showed to the deponent a long green silk purse and that he showed also to the deponent the contents which were in it viz sixteen guineas in gold and some silver and being interrogate what was the occasion of showing this purse and money to the deponent depones it was one of two which he does not remember either he had come from aberdeen with money which he had got for his wool or was going to badenoch to buy sheep depones that he saw upon the finger of elizabeth downie the panel duncan clerks wife a yellow ring which she told him was gold with a plate on the outside of it in the form of a seal and that he saw it on her finger six or eight weeks before her marriage and that after her marriage she having one day taken it off her finger he saw upon the inside of it a stamp but what that stamp is he does not know and being interrogate depones that he had a suspicion that this ring was serjeant daviess ring having heard it reported in the country that serjeant davies had such a ring upon his finger when he was murdered but does not remember his having told his suspicion to any body and being further interrogate depones that since the panel duncans imprisonment the deponent was solicited by donald clerk the panel duncans brother to conceal what he knew when he came to give evidence but this was after his having first solicited the deponent to leave the country that he might not give evidence and upon the deponents saying he offered him nothing to leave the country with but then it was that donald proposed his not giving true evidence adding that of every penny donald was worth the deponent should have the half and being interrogate at the desire of the jury if ever he had asked payment of the twenty pounds contained in the abovementioned paper produced by him depones that he once did shortly after the term of payment to which duncan answered that it would be as well to let it ly in his hands to which he was satisfied and that he never asked payment of the annual rent and being further interrogate depones that before the deponent went home to the panels service at martinmas one thousand seven hundred and fifty it was well known and reported in the country that
