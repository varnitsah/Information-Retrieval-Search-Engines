baxter writer to the signet  my dear charles  it is the fate of sequels to disappoint those who have waited for them and my david having been left to kick his heels for more than a lustre in the british linen companys office must expect his late reappearance to be greeted with hoots if not with missiles yet when i remember the days of our explorations i am not without hope there should be left in our native city some seed of the elect some longlegged hotheaded youth must repeat today our dreams and wanderings of so many years ago he will relish the pleasure which should have been ours to follow among named streets and numbered houses the country walks of david balfour to identify dean and silvermills and broughton and hope park and pilrig and poor old lochendif it still be standing and the figgate whinsif there be any of them left or to push on a long holiday so far afield as gillane or the bass so perhaps his eye shall be opened to behold the series of the generations and he shall weigh with surprise his momentous and nugatory gift of life  you are stillas when first i saw as when i last addressed youin the venerable city which i must always think of as my home and i have come so far and the sights and thoughts of my youth pursue me and i see like a vision the youth of my father and of his father and the whole stream of lives flowing down there far in the north with the sound of laughter and tears to cast me out in the end as by a sudden freshet on those ultimate islands and i admire and bow my head before the romance of destiny      rls      vailima

    part i  the lord advocate                                          chapter i  a beggar on horseback   the 25th day of august 1751 about two in the afternoon i david balfour came forth of the british linen company a porter attending me with a bag of money and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors two days before and even so late as yestermorning i was like a beggarman by the wayside clad in rags brought down to my last shillings my companion a condemned traitor a price set on my own head for a crime with the news of which the country rang today i was served heir to my position in life a landed laird a bank porter by me carrying my gold recommendations in my pocket and in the words of the saying the ball directly at my foot  there were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail the first was the very difficult and deadly business i had still to handle the second the place that i was in the tall black city and the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk made a new world for me after the moorland braes the seasands and the still countrysides that i had frequented up to then the throng of the citizens in particular abashed me rankeillors son was short and small in the girth his clothes scarce held on me and it was plain i was ill qualified to strut in the front of a bankporter it was plain if i did so i should but set folk laughing and what was worse in my case set them asking questions so that i behooved to come by some clothes of my own and in the meanwhile to walk by the porters side and put my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends  at a merchants in the luckenbooths i had myself fitted out none too fine for i had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback but comely and responsible so that servants should respect me thence to an armourers where i got a plain sword to suit with my degree in life i felt safer with the weapon though for one so ignorant of defence it might be called an added danger the porter who was naturally a man of some experience judged my accoutrement to be well chosen  naething kenspeckle1 said he plain dacent claes as for the rapier nae doubt it sits wi your degree but an i had been you i would hae waired my siller bettergates than that and proposed i should buy winterhosen from a wife in the cowgateback that was a cousin of his own and made them extraordinar endurable  but i had other matters on my hand more pressing here i was in this old black city which was for all the world like a rabbitwarren not only by the number of its indwellers but the complication of its passages and holes it was indeed a place where no stranger had a chance to find a friend let be another stranger suppose him even to hit on the right close people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses he might very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door the ordinary course was to hire a lad they called a caddie who was like a guide or pilot led you where you had occasion and your errands being done brought you again where you were lodging but these caddies being always employed in the same sort of services and having it for obligation to be well informed of every house and person in the city had grown to form a brotherhood of spies and i knew from tales of mr campbells how they communicated one with another what a rage of curiosity they conceived as to their employers business and how they were like eyes and fingers to the police it would be a piece of little wisdom the way i was now placed to tack such a ferret to my tails i had three visits to make all immediately needful to my kinsman mr balfour of pilrig to stewart the writer that was appins agent and to william grant esquire of prestongrange lord advocate of scotland mr balfours was a noncommittal visit and besides pilrig being in the country i made bold to find way to it myself with the help of my two legs and a scots tongue but the rest were in a different case not only was the visit to appins agent in the midst of the cry about the appin murder dangerous in itself but it was highly inconsistent with the other i was like to have a bad enough time of it with my lord advocate grant the best of ways but to go to him hotfoot from appins agent was little likely to mend my own affairs and might prove the mere ruin of friend alans the whole thing besides gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds that was little to my fancy i determined therefore to be done at once with mr stewart and the whole jacobitical side of my business and to profit for that purpose by the guidance of the porter at my side but it chanced i had scarce given him the address when there came a sprinkle of rainnothing to hurt only for my new clothesand we took shelter under a pend at the head of a close or alley  being strange to what i saw i stepped a little farther in the narrow paved way descended swiftly prodigious tall houses sprang upon each side and bulged out one story beyond another as they rose at the top only a ribbon of sky showed in by what i could spy in the windows and by the respectable persons that passed out and in i saw the houses to be very well occupied and the whole appearance of the place interested me like a tale  i was still gazing when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in time and clash of steel behind me turning quickly i was aware of a party of armed soldiers and in their midst a tall man in a greatcoat he walked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy genteel and insinuating he waved his hands plausibly as he went and his face was sly and handsome i thought his eye took me in but could not meet it this procession went by to a door in the close which a servingman in a fine livery set open and two of the soldierlads carried the prisoner within the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door  there can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following of idle folk and children it was so now but the more part melted away incontinent until but three were left one was a girl she was dressed like a lady and had a screen of the drummond colours on her head but her comrades or i should say followers were ragged gillies such as i had seen the matches of by the dozen in my highland journey they all spoke together earnestly in gaelic the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of alan and though the rain was by again and my porter plucked at me to be going i even drew nearer where they were to listen the lady scolded sharply the others making apologies and cringeing before her so that i made sure she was come of a chiefs house all the while the three of them sought in their pockets and by what i could make out they had the matter of half a farthing among the party which made me smile a little to see all highland folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans  it chanced the girl turned suddenly about so that i saw her face for the first time there is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young woman fits in a mans mind and stays there and he could never tell you why it just seems it was the thing he wanted she had wonderful bright eyes like stars and i daresay the eyes had a part in it but what i remember the most clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she turned and whatever was the cause i stood there staring like a fool on her side as she had not known there was anyone so near she looked at me a little longer and perhaps with more surprise than was entirely civil  it went through my country head she might be wondering at my new clothes with that i blushed to my hair and at the sight of my colouring its to be supposed she drew her own conclusions for she moved her gillies farther down the close and they fell again to this dispute where i could hear no more of it  i had often admired a lassie before then if scarce so sudden and strong and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come forward for i was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind you would have thought i had now all the more reason to pursue my common practice since i had met this young lady in the city street seemingly following a prisoner and accompanied with two very ragged indecentlike highlandmen but there was here a different ingredient it was plain the girl thought i had been prying in her secrets and with my new clothes and sword and at the top of my new fortunes this was more than i could swallow the beggar on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low or at the least of it not by this young lady  i followed accordingly and took off my new hat to her the best that i was able  madam said i i think it only fair to myself to let you understand i have no gaelic it is true i was listening for i have friends of my own across the highland line and the sound of that tongue comes friendly but for your private affairs if you had spoken greek i might have had more guess at them  she made me a little distant curtsey there is no harm done said she with a pretty accent most like the english but more agreeable a cat may look at a king  i do not mean to offend said i i have no skill of city manners i never before this day set foot inside the doors of edinburgh take me for a country ladits what i am and i would rather i told you than you found it out  indeed it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to each other on the causeway she replied but if you are landward2 bred it will be different i am as landward as yourself i am highland as you see and think myself the farther from my home  it is not yet a week since i passed the line said i less than a week ago i was on the braes of balwhidder  balwhither she cries come ye from balwhither the name of it makes all there is of me rejoice you will not have been long there and not known some of our friends or family  i lived with a very honest kind man called duncan dhu maclaren i replied  well i know duncan and you give him the true name she said and if he is an honest man his wife is honest indeed  ay said i they are fine people and the place is a bonny place  where in the great world is such another she cries i am loving the smell of that place and the roots that grew there  i was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid i could be wishing i had brought you a spray of that heather says i and though i did ill to speak with you at the first now it seems we have common acquaintance i make it my petition you will not forget me david balfour is the name i am known by this is my lucky day when i have just come into a landed estate and am not very long out of a deadly peril i wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of balquidder said i and i will yours for the sake of my lucky day  my name is not spoken she replied with a great deal of haughtiness more than a hundred years it has not gone upon mens tongues save for a blink i am nameless like the folk of peace3 catriona drummond is the one i use  now indeed i knew where i was standing in all broad scotland there was but the one name proscribed and that was the name of the macgregors yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy i plunged the deeper in  i have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself said i and i think he will be one of your friends they called him robin oig  did ye so cries she ye met rob  i passed the night with him said i  he is a fowl of the night said she  there was a set of pipes there i went on so you may judge if the time passed  you should be no enemy at all events said she that was his brother there a moment since with the red soldiers round him it is him that i call father  is it so cried i are you a daughter of james mores  all the daughter that he has says she the daughter of a prisoner that i should forget it so even for one hour to talk with strangers  here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of english to know what she meaning by that himself was to do about ta sneeshin i took some note of him for a short bandylegged redhaired bigheaded man that i was to know more of to my cost  there can be none the day neil she replied how will you get sneeshin wanting siller it will teach you another time to be more careful and i think james more will not be very well pleased with neil of the tom  miss drummond i said i told you i was in my lucky day here i am and a bankporter at my tail and remember i have had the hospitality of your own country of balwhidder  it was not one of my people gave it said she  ah well said i but i am owing your uncle at least for some springs upon the pipes besides which i have offered myself to be your friend and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper time  if it had been a great sum it might have done you honour said she but i will tell you what this is james more lies shackled in prison but this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the advocates  the advocates i cried is that  it is the house of the lord advocate grant of prestongrange said she there they bring my father one time and another for what purpose i have no thought in my mind but it seems there is some hope dawned for him all this same time they will not let me be seeing him nor yet him write and we wait upon the kings street to catch him and now we give him his snuff as he goes by and now something else and here is this son of trouble neil son of duncan has lost my fourpennypiece that was to buy that snuff and james more must go wanting and will think his daughter has forgotten him  i took sixpence from my pocket gave it to neil and bade him go about his errand then to her that sixpence came with me by balwhidder said i  ah she said you are a friend to the gregara  i would not like to deceive you either said i i know very little of the gregara and less of james more and his doings but since the while i have been standing in this close i seem to know something of yourself and if you will just say a friend to miss catriona i will see you are the less cheated  the one cannot be without the other said she  i will even try said i  and what will you be thinking of myself she cried to be holding my hand to the first stranger  i am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter said i  i must not be without repaying it she said where is it you stop  to tell the truth i am stopping nowhere yet said i being not full three hours in the city but if you will give me your direction i will be so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself  will i can trust you for that she asked  you have little fear said i  james more could not bear it else said she i stop beyond the village of dean on the north side of the water with mrs drummondogilvy of allardyce who is my near friend and will be glad to thank you  you are to see me then so soon as what i have to do permits said i and the remembrance of alan rolling in again upon my mind i made haste to say farewell  i could not but think even as i did so that we had made extraordinary free upon short acquaintance and that a really wise young lady would have shown herself more backward i think it was the bankporter that put me from this ungallant train of thought  i thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o sense he began shooting out his lips yere no likely to gang far this gate a fule and his sillers shune parted eh but yere a green callant he cried an a veecious tae cleikin up wi baubeejoes  if you dare to speak of the young lady  i began  leddy he cried haud us and safe us whatten leddy ca thon a leddy the touns fu o them leddies man its weel seen yere no very acquant in embro  a clap of anger took me  here said i lead me where i told you and keep your foul mouth shut  he did not wholly obey me for though he no more addressed me directly he sang at me as he went in a very impudent manner of innuendo and with an exceedingly ill voice and ear      as mally lee cam doun the street her capuchin did flee     she cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee     and were a gaun east and wast were a gaun ajee     were a gaun east and wast courtin mally lee                                          chapter ii  the highland writer   mr charles stewart the writer dwelt at the top of the longest stair that ever mason set a hand to fifteen flights of it no less and when i had come to his door and a clerk had opened it and told me his master was within i had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing  awa east and wast wi ye said i took the money bag out of his hands and followed the clerk in  the outer room was an office with the clerks chair at a table spread with law papers in the inner chamber which opened from it a little brisk man sat poring on a deed from which he scarce raised his eyes upon my entrance indeed he still kept his finger in the place as though prepared to show me out and fall again to his studies this pleased me little enough and what pleased me less i thought the clerk was in a good posture to overhear what should pass between us  i asked if he was mr charles stewart the writer  the same says he and if the question is equally fair who may you be yourself  you never heard tell of my name nor of me either said i but i bring you a token from a friend that you know well that you know well i repeated lowering my voice but maybe are not just so keen to hear from at this present being and the bits of business that i have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential in short i would like to think we were quite private  he rose without more words casting down his paper like a man illpleased sent forth his clerk of an errand and shut to the housedoor behind him  now sir said he returning speak out your mind and fear nothing though before you begin he cries out i tell you mine misgives me i tell you beforehand yere either a stewart or a stewart sent ye a good name it is and one it would illbecome my fathers son to lightly but i begin to grue at the sound of it  my name is called balfour said i david balfour of shaws as for him that sent me i will let his token speak and i showed the silver button  put it in your pocket sir cries he ye need name no names the deevils buckie i ken the button of him and deil haet where is he now  i told him i knew not where alan was but he had some sure place or thought he had about the north side where he was to lie until a ship was found for him and how and where he had appointed to be spoken with  its been always my opinion that i would hang in a tow for this family of mine he cried and dod i believe the days come now get a ship for him quot he and whos to pay for it the mans daft  that is my part of the affair mr stewart said i here is a bag of good money and if more be wanted more is to be had where it came from  i neednt ask your politics said he  ye need not said i smiling for im as big a whig as grows  stop a bit stop a bit says mr stewart whats all this a whig then why are you here with alans button and what kind of a blackfoot traffic is this that i find ye out in mr whig here is a forfeited rebel and an accused murderer with two hundred pounds on his life and ye ask me to meddle in his business and then tell me yere a whig i have no mind of any such whigs before though ive kent plenty of them  hes a forfeited rebel the mores the pity said i for the mans my friend i can only wish he had been better guided and an accused murderer that he is too for his misfortune but wrongfully accused  i hear you say so said stewart  more than you are to hear me say so before long said i alan breck is innocent and so is james  oh says he the two cases hang together if alan is out james can never be in  hereupon i told him briefly of my acquaintance with alan of the accident that brought me present at the appin murder and the various passages of our escape among the heather and my recovery of my estate so sir you have now the whole train of these events i went on and can see for yourself how i come to be so much mingled up with the affairs of your family and friends which for all of our sakes i wish had been plainer and less bloody you can see for yourself too that i have certain pieces of business depending which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer chosen at random no more remains but to ask if you will undertake my service  i have no great mind to it but coming as you do with alans button the choice is scarcely left me said he what are your instructions he added and took up his pen  the first point is to smuggle alan forth of this country said i but i need not be repeating that  i am little likely to forget it said stewart  the next thing is the bit money i am owing to cluny i went on it would be ill for me to find a conveyance but that should be no stick to you it was two pounds five shillings and threehalfpence farthing sterling  he noted it  then said i theres a mr henderland a licensed preacher and missionary in ardgour that i would like well to get some snuff into the hands of and as i daresay you keep touch with your friends in appin so near by its a job you could doubtless overtake with the other  how much snuff are we to say he asked  i was thinking of two pounds said i  two said he  then theres the lass alison hastie in limekilns said i her that helped alan and me across the forth i was thinking if i could get her a good sunday gown such as she could wear with decency in her degree it would be an ease to my conscience for the mere truth is we owe her our two lives  i am glad to see you are thrifty mr balfour says he making his notes  i would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune said i and now if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges i would be glad to know if i could get some spendingmoney back its not that i grudge the whole of it to get alan safe its not that i lack more but having drawn so much the one day i think it would have a very ill appearance if i was back again seeking the next only be sure you have enough i added for i am very undesirous to meet with you again  well and im pleased to see youre cautious too said the writer but i think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my discretion  he said this with a plain sneer  ill have to run the hazard i replied o and theres another service i would ask and thats to direct me to a lodging for i have no roof to my head but it must be a lodging i may seem to have hit upon by accident for it would never do if the lord advocate were to get any jealousy of our acquaintance  ye may set your weary spirit at rest said he i will never name your name sir and its my belief the advocate is still so much to be sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence  i saw i had got to the wrong side of the man  theres a braw day coming for him then said i for hell have to learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than tomorrow when i call on him  when ye call on him repeated mr stewart am i daft or are you what takes ye near the advocate  o just to give myself up said i  mr balfour he cried are ye making a mock of me  no sir said i though i think you have allowed yourself some such freedom with myself but i give you to understand once and for all that i am in no jesting spirit  nor yet me says stewart and i give you to understand if thats to be the word that i like the looks of your behaviour less and less you come here to me with all sorts of propositions which will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons this many a day to come and then you tell me youre going straight out of my office to make your peace with the advocate alans button here or alans button there the four quarters of alan wouldnae bribe me further in  i would take it with a little more temper said i and perhaps we can avoid what you object to i can see no way for it but to give myself up but perhaps you can see another and if you could i could never deny but what i would be rather relieved for i think my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health theres just the one thing clear that i have to give my evidence for i hope itll save alans character whats left of it and jamess neck which is the more immediate  he was silent for a breathingspace and then my man said he youll never be allowed to give such evidence  well have to see about that said i im stiffnecked when i like  ye muckle ass cried stewart its james they want james has got to hangalan too if they could catch himbut james whatever go near the advocate with any such business and youll see hell find a way to muzzle ye  i think better of the advocate than that said i  the advocate be damned cries he its the campbells man youll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back and so will the advocate too poor body its extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand if theres no fair way to stop your gab theres a foul one gaping they can put ye in the dock do ye no see that he cried and stabbed me with one finger in the leg  ay said i i was told that same no further back than this morning by another lawyer  and who was he asked stewart he spoke sense at least  i told i must be excused from naming him for he was a decent stout old whig and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs  i think all the world seems to be mixed up in it cries stewart but what said you  i told him what had passed between rankeillor and myself before the house of shaws  well and so ye will hang said he yell hang beside james stewart theres your fortune told  i hope better of it yet than that said i but i could never deny there was a risk  risk says he and then sat silent again i ought to thank you for your staunchness to my friends to whom you show a very good spirit he says if you have the strength to stand by it but i warn you that youre wading deep i wouldnt put myself in your place me thats a stewart born for all the stewarts that ever there were since noah risk ay i take overmany but to be tried in court before a campbell jury and a campbell judge and that in a campbell country and upon a campbell quarrelthink what you like of me balfour its beyond me  its a different way of thinking i suppose said i i was brought up to this one by my father before me  glory to his bones he has left a decent son to his name says he yet i would not have you judge me oversorely my case is dooms hard see sir ye tell me yere a whig i wonder what i am no whig to be sure i couldnae be just that butlaigh in your ear manim maybe no very keen on the other side  is that a fact cried i its what i would think of a man of your intelligence  hut none of your whillywhas4 cries he theres intelligence upon both sides but for my private part i have no particular desire to harm king george and as for king james god bless him he does very well for me across the water im a lawyer ye see fond of my books and my bottle a good plea a welldrawn deed a crack in the parliament house with other lawyer bodies and perhaps a turn at the golf on a saturday at een where do ye come in with your hieland plaids and claymores  well said i its a fact ye have little of the wild highlandman  little quoth he nothing man and yet im hieland born and when the clan pipes who but me has to dance the clan and the name that goes by all its just what you said yourself my father learned it to me and a bonny trade i have of it treason and traitors and the smuggling of them out and in and the french recruiting weary fall it and the smuggling through of the recruits and their pleasa sorrow of their pleas here haye i been moving one for young ardshiel my cousin claimed the estate under the marriage contracta forfeited estate i told them it was nonsense muckle they cared and there was i cocking behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself for it was fair ruin to the pair of usa black mark disaffected branded on our hurdies like folks names upon their kye and what can i do im a stewart ye see and must fend for my clan and family then no later by than yesterday there was one of our stewart lads carried to the castle what for i ken fine act of 1736 recruiting for king lewie and youll see hell whistle me in to be his lawyer and therell be another black mark on my charater i tell you fair if i but kent the heid of a hebrew word from the hurdies of it be dammed but i would fling the whole thing up and turn minister  its rather a hard position said i  dooms hard cries he and thats what makes me think so much of yeyou thats no stewartto stick your head so deep in stewart business and for what i do not know unless it was the sense of duty  i hope it will be that said i  well says he its a grand quality but here is my clerk back and by your leave well pick a bit of dinner all the three of us when thats done ill give you the direction of a very decent man thatll be very fain to have you for a lodger and ill fill your pockets to ye forbye out of your ain bag for this businessll not be near as dear as ye supposenot even the ship part of it  i made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing  hoot ye neednae mind for robbie cries he a stewart too puir deevil and has smuggled out more french recruits and trafficking papists than what he has hairs upon his face why its robin that manages that branch of my affairs who will we have now rob for across the water  therell be andie scougal in the thristle replied rob i saw hoseason the other day but it seems hes wanting the ship then therell be tarn stobo but im none so sure of tam ive seen him colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances and if it was anybody important i would give tam the goby  the heads worth two hundred pounds robin said stewart  gosh thatll no be alan breck cried the clerk  just alan said his master  weary winds thats sayrious cried robin ill try andie then andiell be the best  it seems its quite a big business i observed  mr balfour theres no end to it said stewart  there was a name your clerk mentioned i went on hoseason that must be my man i think hoseason of the brig covenant would you set your trust on him  he didnae behave very well to you and alan said mr stewart but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise if he had taken alan on board his ship on an agreement its my notion he would have proved a just dealer how say ye rob  no more honest skipper in the trade than eli said the clerk i would lippen to5 elis worday if it was the chevalier or appin himsel he added  and it was him that brought the doctor wasnaet asked the master  he was the very man said the clerk  and i think he took the doctor back says stewart  ay with his sporran full cried robin and eli kent of that6  well it seems its hard to ken folk rightly said i  that was just what i forgot when ye came in mr balfour says the writer                                           chapter iii  i go to pilrig   the next morning i was no sooner awake in my new lodging than i was up and into my new clothes and no sooner the breakfast swallowed than i was forth on my adventures alan i could hope was fended for james was like to be a more difficult affair and i could not but think that enterprise might cost me dear even as everybody said to whom i had opened my opinion it seemed i was come to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down that i had clambered up through so many and hard trials to be rich to be recognised to wear city clothes and a sword to my side all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it and the worst kind of suicide besides which is to get hanged at the kings charges  what was i doing it for i asked as i went down the high street and out north by leith wynd first i said it was to save james stewart and no doubt the memory of his distress and his wifes cries and a word or so i had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly at the same time i reflected that it was or ought to be the most indifferent matter to my fathers son whether james died in his bed or from a scaffold he was alans cousin to be sure but so far as regarded alan the best thing would be to lie low and let the king and his grace of argyll and the corbie crows pick the bones of his kinsman their own way nor could i forget that while we were all in the pot together james had shown no such particular anxiety whether for alan or me  next it came upon me i was acting for the sake of justice and i thought that a fine word and reasoned it out that since we dwelt in polities at some discomfort to each one of us the main thing of all must still be justice and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole community next again it was the accuser of the brethren that gave me a turn of his argument bid me think shame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters and told me i was but a prating vain child who had spoken big words to rankeillor and to stewart and held myself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness nay and he hit me with the other end of the stick for he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater safety no doubt until i had declared and cleared myself i might any day encounter mungo campbell or the sheriffs officer and be recognised and dragged into the appin murder by the heels and no doubt in case i could manage my declaration with success i should breathe more free for ever after but when i looked this argument full in the face i could see nothing to be ashamed of as for the rest here are the two roads i thought and both go to the same place its unjust that james should hang if i can save him and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing its lucky for james of the glens that i have boasted beforehand and none so unlucky for myself because now im committed to do right i have the name of a gentleman and the means of one it would be a poor discovery that i was wanting in the essence and then i thought this was a pagan spirit and said a prayer in to myself asking for what courage i might lack and that i might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle and come off again scatheless as so many do  this train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me nor of how very apt i was if i went on to stumble on the ladder of the gallows it was a plain fair morning but the wind in the east the little chill of it sang in my blood and gave me a feeling of the autumn and the dead leaves and dead folks bodies in their graves it seemed the devil was in it if i was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other folks affairs on the top of the calton hill though it was not the customary time of year for that diversion some children were crying and running with their kites these toys appeared very plain against the sky i remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the whins and i thought to myself at sight of it there goes davie  my way lay over mouters hill and through an end of a clachan on the braeside among fields there was a whirr of looms in it went from house to house bees bummed in the gardens the neighbours that i saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue and i found out later that this was picardy a village where the french weavers wrought for the linen company here i got a fresh direction for pilrig my destination and a little beyond on the wayside came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains they were dipped in tar as the manner is the wind span them the chains clattered and the birds hung about the uncanny jumpingjacks and cried the sight coming on me suddenly like an illustration of my fears i could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort and as i thus turned and turned about the gibbet what should i strike on but a weird old wife that sat behind a leg of it and nodded and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies  who are these two mother i asked and pointed to the corpses  a blessing on your precious face she cried twa joes7 o mine just twa o my old joes my hinny dear  what did they suffer for i asked  ou just for the guid cause said she aften i spaed to them the way that it would end twa shillin scots no pickle mair and there are twa bonny callants hingin for t they took it frae a wean8 belanged to brouchton  ay said i to myself and not to the daft limmer and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business this is to lose all indeed  gies your loof9 hinny says she and let me spae your weird to ye  no mother said i i see far enough the way i am its an unco thing to see too far in front  i read it in your bree she said theres a bonnie lassie that has bricht een and theres a wee man in a braw coat and a big man in a pouthered wig and theres the shadow of the wuddy10 joe that lies braid across your path gies your loof hinny and let auld merren spae it to ye bonny  the two chance shots that seemed to point at alan and the daughter of james more struck me hard and i fled from the eldritch creature casting her a baubee which she continued to sit and play with under the moving shadows of the hanged  my way down the causeway of leith walk would have been more pleasant to me but for this encounter the old rampart ran among fields the like of them i had never seen for artfulness of agriculture i was pleased besides to be so far in the still countryside but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head and the mops and mows of the old witch and the thought of the dead men hagrode my spirits to hang on a gallows that seemed a hard case and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings scots or as mr stewart had it from the sense of duty once he was tarred and shackled and hung up the difference seemed small there might david balfour hang and other lads pass on their errands and think light of him and old daft limmers sit at legfoot and spae their fortunes and the clean genty maids go by and look to the other side and hold a nose i saw them plain and they had grey eyes and their screens upon their heads were of the drummond colours  i was thus in the poorest of spirits though still pretty resolved when i came in view of pilrig a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside among some brave young woods the lairds horse was standing saddled at the door as i came up but himself was in the study where he received me in the midst of learned works and musical instruments for he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician he greeted me at first pretty well and when he had read rankeillors letter placed himself obligingly at my disposal  and what is it cousin david says hesince it appears that we are cousinswhat is this that i can do for you a word to prestongrange doubtless that is easily given but what should be the word  mr balfour said i if i were to tell you my whole story the way it fell out its my opinion and it was rankeillors before me that you would be very little made up with it  i am sorry to hear this of you kinsman says he  i must not take that at your hands mr balfour said i i have nothing to my charge to make me sorry or you for me but just the common infirmities of mankind the guilt of adams first sin the want of original righteousness and the corruption of my whole nature so much i must answer for and i hope i have been taught where to look for help i said for i judged from the look of the man he would think the better of me if i knew my questions11 but in the way of worldly honour i have no great stumble to reproach myself with and my difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and by all that i can see without my fault my trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of  why very well mr david he replied i am pleased to see you are all that rankeillor represented and for what you say of political complications you do me no more than justice it is my study to be beyond suspicion and indeed outside the field of it the question is says he how if i am to know nothing of the matter i can very well assist you  why sir said i i propose you should write to his lordship that i am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means both of which i believe to be the case  i have rankeillors word for it said mr balfour and i count that a warrandice against all deadly  to which you might add if you will take my word for so much that i am a good churchman loyal to king george and so brought up i went on  none of which will do you any harm said mr balfour  then you might go on to say that i sought his lordship on a matter of great moment connected with his majestys service and the administration of justice i suggested  as i am not to hear the matter says the laird i will not take upon myself to qualify its weight great moment therefore falls and moment along with it for the rest i might express myself much as you propose  and then sir said i and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb then i would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection  protection says he for your protection here is a phrase that somewhat dampens me if the matter be so dangerous i own i would be a little loath to move in it blindfold  i believe i could indicate in two words where the thing sticks said i  perhaps that would be the best said he  well its the appin murder said i  he held up both the hands sirs sirs cried he  i thought by the expression of his face and voice that i had lost my helper  let me explain  i began  i thank you kindly i will hear no more of it says he i decline in toto to hear more of it for your names sake and rankeillors and perhaps a little for your own i will do what i can to help you but i will hear no more upon the facts and it is my first clear duty to warn you these are deep waters mr david and you are a young man be cautious and think twice  it is to be supposed i will have thought oftener than that mr balfour said i and i will direct your attention again to rankeillors letter where i hope and believe he has registered his approval of that which i design  well well said he and then again well well i will do what i can for you therewith he took a pen and paper sat awhile in thought and began to write with much consideration i understand that rankeillor approves of what you have in mind he asked presently  after some discussion sir he bade me to go forward in gods name said i  that is the name to go in said mr balfour and resumed his writing presently he signed reread what he had written and addressed me again now here mr david said he is a letter of introduction which i will seal without closing and give into your hands open as the form requires but since i am acting in the dark i will just read it to you so that you may see if it will secure your end        pilrig august 26th 1751       my lordthis is to bring to your notice my namesake and      cousin david balfour esquire of shaws a young gentleman      of unblemished descent and good estate he has enjoyed besides      the more valuable advantages of a godly training and his      political      principles are all that your lordship can desire i am not in      mr balfours confidence but i understand him to have a      matter      to declare touching his majestys service and the      administration      of justice purposes for which your lordships zeal is known      i should add that the young gentlemans intention is known to      and approved by some of his friends who will watch with      hopeful      anxiety the event of his success or failure   whereupon continued mr balfour i have subscribed myself with the usual compliments you observe i have said some of your friends i hope you can justify my plural  perfectly sir my purpose is known and approved by more than one said i and your letter which i take a pleasure to thank you for is all i could have hoped  it was all i could squeeze out said he and from what i know of the matter you design to meddle in i can only pray god that it may prove sufficient                                          chapter iv  lord advocate prestongrange   my kinsman kept me to a meal for the honour of the roof he said and i believe i made the better speed on my return i had no thought but to be done with the next stage and have myself fully committed to a person circumstanced as i was the appearance of closing a door on hesitation and temptation was itself extremely tempting and i was the more disappointed when i came to prestongranges house to be informed he was abroad i believe it was true at the moment and for some hours after and then i have no doubt the advocate came home again and enjoyed himself in a neighbouring chamber among friends while perhaps the very fact of my arrival was forgotten i would have gone away a dozen times only for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out of hand and be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience at first i read for the little cabinet where i was left contained a variety of books but i fear i read with little profit and the weather falling cloudy the dusk coming up earlier than usual and my cabinet being lighted with but a loophole of a window i was at last obliged to desist from this diversion such as it was and pass the rest of my time of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity the sound of people talking in a naer chamber the pleasant note of a harpsichord and once the voice of a lady singing bore me a kind of company  i do not know the hour but the darkness was long come when the door of the cabinet opened and i was aware by the light behind him of a tall figure of a man upon the threshold i rose at once  is anybody there he asked who is that  i am bearer of a letter from the laird of pilrig to the lord advocate said i  have you been here long he asked  i would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours said i  it is the first i hear of it he replied with a chuckle the lads must have forgotten you but you are in the bit at last for i am prestongrange  so saying he passed before me into the next room whither upon his sign i followed him and where he lit a candle and took his place before a businesstable it was a long room of a good proportion wholly lined with books that small spark of light in a corner struck out the mans handsome person and strong face he was flushed his eye watered and sparkled and before he sat down i observed him to sway back and forth no doubt he had been supping liberally but his mind and tongue were under full control  well sir sit ye down said he and let us see pilrigs letter  he glanced it through in the beginning carelessly looking up and bowing when he came to my name but at the last words i thought i observed his attention to redouble and i made sure he read them twice all this while you are to suppose my heart was beating for i had now crossed my rubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle  i am pleased to make your acquaintance mr balfour he said when he had done let me offer you a glass of claret  under your favour my lord i think it would scarce be fair on me said i i have come here as the letter will have mentioned on a business of some gravity to myself and as i am little used with wine i might be the sooner affected  you shall be the judge said he but if you will permit i believe i will even have the bottle in myself  he touched a bell and the footman came as at a signal bringing wine and glasses  you are sure you will not join me asked the advocate well here is to our better acquaintance in what way can i serve you  i should perhaps begin by telling you my lord that i am here at your own pressing invitation said i  you have the advantage of me somewhere said he for i profess i think i never heard of you before this evening  right my lord the name is indeed new to you said i and yet you have been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance and have declared the same in public  i wish you would afford me a clue says he i am no daniel  it will perhaps serve for such said i that if i was in a jesting humourwhich is far from the casei believe i might lay a claim on your lordship for two hundred pounds  in what sense he inquired  in the sense of rewards offered for my person said i  he thrust away his glass once and for all and sat straight up in the chair where he had been previously lolling what am i to understand said he  a tall strong lad of about eighteen i quoted speaks like a lowlander and has no beard  i recognise those words said he which if you have come here with any illjudged intention of amusing yourself are like to prove extremely prejudicial to your safety  my purpose in this i replied is just entirely as serious as life and death and you have understood me perfectly i am the boy who was speaking with glenure when he was shot  i can only suppose seeing you here that you claim to be innocent said he  the inference is clear i said i am a very loyal subject to king george but if i had anything to reproach myself with i would have had more discretion than to walk into your den  i am glad of that said he this horrid crime mr balfour is of a dye which cannot permit any clemency blood has been barbarously shed it has been shed in direct opposition to his majesty and our whole frame of laws by those who are their known and public oppugnants i take a very high sense of this i will not deny that i consider the crime as directly personal to his majesty  and unfortunately my lord i added a little drily directly personal to another great personage who may be nameless  if you mean anything by those words i must tell you i consider them unfit for a good subject and were they spoke publicly i should make it my business to take note of them said he you do not appear to me to recognise the gravity of your situation or you would be more careful not to pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of justice justice in this country and in my poor hands is no respecter of persons  you give me too great a share in my own speech my lord said i i did but repeat the common talk of the country which i have heard everywhere and from men of all opinions as i came along  when you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk is not to be listened to how much less repeated says the advocate but i acquit you of an ill intention that nobleman whom we all honour and who has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity sits too high to be reached by these aspersions the duke of argyleyou see that i deal plainly with youtakes it to heart as i do and as we are both bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his majesty and i could wish that all hands in this ill age were equally clean of family rancour but from the accident that this is a campbell who has fallen martyr to his dutyas who else but the campbells have ever put themselves foremost on that path i may say it who am no campbelland that the chief of that great house happens for all our advantages to be the present head of the college of justice small minds and disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the country and i find a young gentleman like mr balfour so illadvised as to make himself their echo so much he spoke with a very oratorical delivery as if in court and then declined again upon the manner of a gentleman all this apart said he it now remains that i should learn what i am to do with you  i had thought it was rather i that should learn the same from your lordship said i  ay true says the advocate but you see you come to me well recommended there is a good honest whig name to this letter says he picking it up a moment from the table andextrajudicially mr balfourthere is always the possibility of some arrangement i tell you and i tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your guard your fate lies with me singly in such a matter be it said with reverence i am more powerful than the kings majesty and should you please meand of course satisfy my consciencein what remains to be held of our interview i tell you it may remain between ourselves  meaning how i asked  why i mean it thus mr balfour said he that if you give satisfaction no soul need know so much as that you visited my house and you may observe that i do not even call my clerk  i saw what way he was driving i suppose it is needless anyone should be informed upon my visit said i though the precise nature of my gains by that i cannot see i am not at all ashamed of coming here  and have no cause to be says he encouragingly nor yet if you are careful to fear the consequences  my lord said i speaking under your correction i am not very easy to be frightened  and i am sure i do not seek to frighten you says he but to the interrogation and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the questions i shall ask you it may consist very immediately with your safety i have a great discretion it is true but there are bounds to it  i shall try to follow your lordships advice said i  he spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading it appears you were present by the way in the wood of lettermore at the moment of the fatal shot he began was this by accident  by accident said i  how came you in speech with colin campbell he asked  i was inquiring my way of him to aucharn i replied  i observed he did not write this answer down  hm true said he i had forgotten that and do you know mr balfour i would dwell if i were you as little as might be on your relations with these stewarts it might be found to complicate our business i am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential  i had thought my lord that all points of fact were equally material in such a case said i  you forget we are now trying these stewarts he replied with great significance if we should ever come to be trying you it will be very different and i shall press these very questions that i am now willing to glide upon but to resume i have it here in mr mungo campbells precognition that you ran immediately up the brae how came that  not immediately my lord and the cause was my seeing of the murderer  you saw him then  as plain as i see your lordship though not so near hand  you know him  i should know him again  in your pursuit you were not so fortunate then as to overtake him  i was not  was he alone  he was alone  there was no one else in that neighbourhood  alan breck stewart was not far off in a piece of a wood  the advocate laid his pen down i think we are playing at cross purposes said he which you will find to prove a very ill amusement for yourself  i content myself with following your lordships advice and answering what i am asked said i  be so wise as to bethink yourself in time said he i use you with the most anxious tenderness which you scarce seem to appreciate and which unless you be more careful may prove to be in vain  i do appreciate your tenderness but conceive it to be mistaken i replied with something of a falter for i saw we were come to grips at last i am here to lay before you certain information by which i shall convince you alan had no hand whatever in the killing of glenure  the advocate appeared for a moment at a stick sitting with pursed lips and blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat mr balfour he said at last i tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests  my lord i said i am as free of the charge of considering my own interests in this matter as your lordship as god judges me i have but the one design and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go clear if in pursuit of that i come to fall under your lordships displeasure i must bear it as i may  at this he rose from his chair lit a second candle and for a while gazed upon me steadily i was surprised to see a great change of gravity fallen upon his face and i could have almost thought he was a little pale  you are either very simple or extremely the reverse and i see that i must deal with you more confidentially says he this is a political caseah yes mr balfour whether we like it or no the case is politicaland i tremble when i think what issues may depend from it to a political case i need scarce tell a young man of your education we approach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only salus populi suprema lex is a maxim susceptible of great abuse but it has that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature i mean it has the force of necessity i will open this out to you if you will allow me at more length you would have me believe  under your pardon my lord i would have you to believe nothing but that which i can prove said i  tut tut young gentleman says he be not so pragmatical and suffer a man who might be your father if it was nothing more to employ his own imperfect language and express his own poor thoughts even when they have the misfortune not to coincide with mr balfours you would have me to believe breck innocent i would think this of little account the more so as we cannot catch our man but the matter of brecks innocence shoots beyond itself once admitted it would destroy the whole presumptions of our case against another and a very different criminal a man grown old in treason already twice in arms against his king and already twice forgiven a fomenter of discontent and whoever may have fired the shot the unmistakable original of the deed in question i need not tell you that i mean james stewart  and i can just say plainly that the innocence of alan and of james is what i am here to declare in private to your lordship and what i am prepared to establish at the trial by my testimony said i  to which i can only answer by an equal plainness mr balfour said he that in that case your testimony will not be called by me and i desire you to withhold it altogether  you are at the head of justice in this country i cried and you propose to me a crime  i am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country he replied and i press on you a political necessity patriotism is not always moral in the formal sense you might be glad of it i think it is your own protection the facts are heavy against you and if i am still trying to except you from a very dangerous place it is in part of course because i am not insensible to your honesty in coming here in part because of pilrigs letter but in part and in chief part because i regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial duty only second for the same reasoni repeat it to you in the same frank wordsi do not want your testimony  i desire not to be thought to make a repartee when i express only the plain sense of our position said i but if your lordship has no need of my testimony i believe the other side would be extremely blythe to get it  prestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room you are not so young he said but what you must remember very clearly the year 45 and the shock that went about the country i read in pilrigs letter that you are sound in kirk and state who saved them in that fatal year i do not refer to his royal highness and his ramrods which were extremely useful in their day but the country had been saved and the field won before ever cumberland came upon drummossie who saved it i repeat who saved the protestant religion and the whole frame of our civil institutions the late lord president culloden for one he played a mans part and small thanks he got for iteven as i whom you see before you straining every nerve in the same service look for no reward beyond the conscience of my duties done after the president who else you know the answer as well as i do tis partly a scandal and you glanced at it yourself and i reproved you for it when you first came in it was the duke and the great clan of campbell now here is a campbell foully murdered and that in the kings service the duke and i are highlanders but we are highlanders civilised and it is not so with the great mass of our clans and families they have still savage virtues and defects they are still barbarians like these stewarts only the campbells were barbarians on the right side and the stewarts were barbarians on the wrong now be you the judge the campbells expect vengeance if they do not get itif this man james escapethere will be trouble with the campbells that means disturbance in the highlands which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed the disarming is a farce  i can bear you out in that said i  disturbance in the highlands makes the hour of our old watchful enemy pursued his lordship holding out a finger as he paced and i give you my word we may have a 45 again with the campbells on the other side to protect the life of this man stewartwhich is forfeit already on halfadozen different counts if not on thisdo you propose to plunge your country in war to jeopardise the faith of your fathers and to expose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent persons    these are considerations that weigh with me and that i hope will weigh no less with yourself mr balfour as a lover of your country good government and religious truth  you deal with me very frankly and i thank you for it said i i will try on my side to be no less honest i believe your policy to be sound i believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship i believe you may have laid them on your conscience when you took the oaths of the high office which you hold but for me who am just a plain manor scarce a man yetthe plain duties must suffice i can think but of two things of a poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death and of the cries and tears of his wife that still tingle in my head i cannot see beyond my lord its the way that i am made if the country has to fall it has to fall and i pray god if this be wilful blindness that he may enlighten me before too late  he had heard me motionless and stood so a while longer  this is an unexpected obstacle says he aloud but to himself  and how is your lordship to dispose of me i asked  if i wished said he you know that you might sleep in gaol  my lord says i i have slept in worse places  well my boy said he there is one thing appears very plainly from our interview that i may rely on your pledged word give me your honour that you will be wholly secret not only on what has passed tonight but in the matter of the appin case and i let you go free  i will give it till tomorrow or any other near day that you may please to set said i i would not be thought too wily but if i gave the promise without qualification your lordship would have attained his end  i had no thought to entrap you said he  i am sure of that said i  let me see he continued tomorrow is the sabbath come to me on monday by eight in the morning and give me your promise until then  freely given my lord said i and with regard to what has fallen from yourself i will give it for as long as it shall please god to spare your days  you will observe he said next that i have made no employment of menaces  it was like your lordships nobility said i yet i am not altogether so dull but what i can perceive the nature of those you have not uttered  well said he goodnight to you may you sleep well for i think it is more than i am like to do  with that he sighed took up a candle and gave me his conveyance as far as the street door                                          chapter v  in the advocates house   the next day sabbath august 27th i had the occasion i had long looked forward to to hear some of the famous edinburgh preachers all well known to me already by the report of mr campbell alas and i might just as well have been at essendean and sitting under mr campbells worthy self the turmoil of my thoughts which dwelt continually on the interview with prestongrange inhibiting me from all attention i was indeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the divines than by the spectacle of the thronged congregation in the churches like what i imagined of a theatre or in my then disposition of an assize of trial above all at the west kirk with its three tiers of galleries where i went in the vain hope that i might see miss drummond  on the monday i betook me for the first time to a barbers and was very well pleased with the result thence to the advocates where the red coats of the soldiers showed again about his door making a bright place in the close i looked about for the young lady and her gillies there was never a sign of them but i was no sooner shown into the cabinet or antechamber where i had spent so wearyful a time upon the saturday than i was aware of the tall figure of james more in a corner he seemed a prey to a painful uneasiness reaching forth his feet and hands and his eyes speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the small chamber which recalled to me with a sense of pity the mans wretched situation i suppose it was partly this and partly my strong continuing interest in his daughter that moved me to accost him  give you a goodmorning sir said i  and a goodmorning to you sir said he  you bide tryst with prestongrange i asked  i do sir and i pray your business with that gentleman be more agreeable than mine was his reply  i hope at least that yours will be brief for i suppose you pass before me said i  all pass before me he said with a shrug and a gesture upward of the open hands it was not always so sir but times change it was not so when the sword was in the scale young gentleman and the virtues of the soldier might sustain themselves  there came a kind of highland snuffle out of the man that raised my dander strangely  well mr macgregor said i i understand the main thing for a soldier is to be silent and the first of his virtues never to complain  you have my name i perceivehe bowed to me with his arms crossedthough its one i must not use myself well there is a publicityi have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards of my enemies i must not wonder if both should be known to many that i know not  that you know not in the least sir said i nor yet anybody else but the name i am called if you care to hear it is balfour  it is a good name he replied civilly there are many decent folk that use it and now that i call to mind there was a young gentleman your namesake that marched surgeon in the year 45 with my battalion  i believe that would be a brother to balfour of baith said i for i was ready for the surgeon now  the same sir said james more and since i have been fellowsoldier with your kinsman you must suffer me to grasp your hand  he shook hands with me long and tenderly beaming on me the while as though he had found a brother  ah says he these are changed days since your cousin and i heard the balls whistle in our lugs  i think he was a very faraway cousin said i drily and i ought to tell you that i never clapped eyes upon the man  well well said he it makes no change and youi do not think you were out yourself siri have no clear mind of your face which is one not probable to be forgotten  in the year you refer to mr macgregor i was getting skelped in the parish school said i  so young cries he ah then you will never be able to think what this meeting is to me in the hour of my adversity and in the house of my enemy to meet in with the blood of an old brotherinarmsit heartens me mr balfour like the skirling of the highland pipes sir this is a sad lookback that many of us have to make some with falling tears i have lived in my own country like a king my sword my mountains and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me now i lie in a stinking dungeon and do you know mr balfour he went on taking my arm and beginning to lead me about do you know sir that i lack mere necessaries the malice of my foes has quite sequestered my resources i lie as you know sir on a trumpedup charge of which i am as innocent as yourself they dare not bring me to my trial and in the meanwhile i am held naked in my prison i could have wished it was your cousin i had met or his brother baith himself either would i know have been rejoiced to help me while a comparative stranger like yourself  i would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly vein or the very short and grudging answers that i made to him there were times when i was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change but whether it was from shame or pridewhether it was for my own sake or catrionaswhether it was because i thought him no fit father for his daughter or because i resented that grossness of immediate falsity that clung about the man himselfthe thing was clean beyond me and i was still being wheedled and preached to and still being marched to and fro three steps and a turn in that small chamber and had already by some very short replies highly incensed although not finally discouraged my beggar when prestongrange appeared in the doorway and bade me eagerly into his big chamber  i have a moments engagement said he and that you may not sit emptyhanded i am going to present you to my three braw daughters of whom perhaps you may have heard for i think they are more famous than papa this way  he led me into another long room above where a dry old lady sat at a frame of embroidery and the three handsomest young women i suppose in scotland stood together by a window  this is my new friend mr balfour said he presenting me by the arm david here is my sister miss grant who is so good as keep my house for me and will be very pleased if she can help you and here says he turning to the three younger ladies here are my three braw dauchters a fair question to ye mr davie which of the three is the best favoured and i wager he will never have the impudence to propound honest alan ramsays answer  hereupon all three and the old miss grant as well cried out against this sally which as i was acquainted with the verses he referred to brought shame into my own cheek it seemed to me a citation unpardonable in a father and i was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while they reproved or made believe to  under cover of this mirth prestongrange got forth of the chamber and i was left like a fish upon dry land in that very unsuitable society i could never deny in looking back upon what followed that i was eminently stockish and i must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long a patience with me the aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery only looking now and again and smiling but the misses and especially the eldest who was besides the most handsome paid me a score of attentions which i was very ill able to repay it was all in vain to tell myself i was a young fellow of some worth as well as good estate and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses the eldest not so much older than myself and no one of them by any probability half as learned reasoning would not change the fact and there were times when the colour came into my face to think i was shaved that day for the first time  the talk going with all their endeavours very heavily the eldest took pity on my awkwardness sat down to her instrument of which she was a passed mistress and entertained me for a while with playing and singing both in the scots and in the italian manners this put me more at my ease and being reminded of alans air that he had taught me in the hole near carriden i made so bold as to whistle a bar or two and ask if she knew that  she shook her head i never heard a note of it said she whistle it all through and now once again she added after i had done so  then she picked it out upon the keyboard and to my surprise instantly enriched the same with wellsounding chords and sang as she played with a very droll expression and broad accent      haenae i got just the lilt of it     isnae this the tune that ye whustled  you see she says i can do the poetry too only it wont rhyme and then again      i am miss grant sib to the advocate     you i believe are dauvit balfour  i told her how much astonished i was by her genius  and what do you call the name of it she asked  i do not know the real name said i i just call it alans air  she looked at me directly in the face i shall call it davids air said she though if its the least like what your namesake of israel played to saul i would never wonder that the king got little good by it for its but melancholy music your other name i do not like so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine  this was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog why that miss grant i asked  why says she if ever you should come to get hanged i will set your last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it  this put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and peril how or just how much it was more difficult to guess it was plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of alan and thus warned me to leave it out of reference and plain she knew that i stood under some criminal suspicion i judged besides that the harshness of her last speech which besides she had followed up immediately with a very noisy piece of music was to put an end to the present conversation i stood beside her affecting to listen and admire but truly whirled away by my own thoughts i have always found this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious and certainly this first interview made a mystery that was beyond my plummet one thing i learned long after the hours of the sunday had been well employed the bank porter had been found and examined my visit to charles stewart was discovered and the deduction made that i was pretty deep with james and alan and most likely in a continued correspondence with the last hence this broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord  in the midst of the piece of music one of the younger misses who was at a window over the close cried on her sisters to come quick for there was grey eyes again the whole family trooped there at once and crowded one another for a look the window whither they ran was in an odd corner of that room gave above the entrance door and flanked up the close  come mr balfour they cried come and see she is the most beautiful creature she hangs round the closehead these last days always with some wretchedlike gillies and yet seems quite a lady  i had no need to look neither did i look twice or long i was afraid she might have seen me there looking down upon her from that chamber of music and she without and her father in the same house perhaps begging for his life with tears and myself come but newly from rejecting his petitions but even that glance set me in a better conceit of myself and much less awe of the young ladies they were beautiful that was beyond question but catriona was beautiful too and had a kind of brightness in her like a coal of fire as much as the others cast me down she lifted me up i remembered i had talked easily with her if i could make no hand of it with these fine maids it was perhaps something their own fault my embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened with a sense of fun and when the aunt smiled at me from her embroidery and the three daughters unbent to me like a baby all with papas orders written on their faces there were times when i could have found it in my heart to smile myself  presently papa returned the same kind happylike pleasantspoken man  now girls said he i must take mr balfour away again but i hope you have been able to persuade him to return where i shall be always gratified to find him  so they each made me a little farthing compliment and i was led away  if this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance it was the worst of failures i was no such ass but what i understood how poor a figure i had made and that the girls would be yawning their jaws off as soon as my stiff back was turned i felt i had shown how little i had in me of what was soft and graceful and i longed for a chance to prove that i had something of the other stuff the stern and dangerous  well i was to be served to my desire for the scene to which he was conducting me was of a different character                                          chapter vi  umquile the master of lovat   there was a man waiting us in prestongranges study whom i distasted at the first look as we distaste a ferret or an earwig he was bitter ugly but seemed very much of a gentleman had still manners but capable of sudden leaps and violences and a small voice which could ring out shrill and dangerous when he so desired  the advocate presented us in a familiar friendly way  here fraser said he here is mr balfour whom we talked about mr david this is mr symon fraser whom we used to call by another title but that is an old song mr fraser has an errand to you  with that he stepped aside to his bookshelves and made believe to consult a quarto volume in the far end  i was thus left in a sense alone with perhaps the last person in the world i had expected there was no doubt upon the terms of introduction this could be no other than the forfeited master of lovat and chief of the great clan fraser i knew he had led his men in the rebellion i knew his fathers headmy old lords that grey fox of the mountainsto have fallen on the block for that offence the lands of the family to have been seized and their nobility attainted i could not conceive what he should be doing in grants house i could not conceive that he had been called to the bar had eaten all his principles and was now currying favour with the government even to the extent of acting advocatedepute in the appin murder  well mr balfour said he what is all this i hear of ye  it would not become me to prejudge said i but if the advocate was your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions  i may tell you i am engaged in the appin case he went on i am to appear under prestongrange and from my study of the precognitions i can assure you your opinions are erroneous the guilt of breck is manifest and your testimony in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the very moment will certify his hanging  it will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him i observed and for other matters i very willingly leave you to your own impressions  the duke has been informed he went on i have just come from his grace and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the great nobleman he is he spoke of you by name mr balfour and declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand your own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself gratitude is no empty expression in that mouth experto crede i daresay you know something of my name and clan and the damnable example and lamented end of my late father to say nothing of my own errata well i have made my peace with that good duke he has intervened for me with our friend prestongrange and here i am with my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting king georges enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult to his majesty  doubtless a proud position for your fathers son says i  he wagged his bald eyebrows at me you are pleased to make experiments in the ironical i think said he but i am here upon duty i am here to discharge my errand in good faith it is in vain you think to divert me and let me tell you for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like yourself a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years drudgery the shove is now at your command choose what you will to be advanced in the duke will watch upon you with the affectionate disposition of a father  i am thinking that i lack the docility of the son says i  and do you really suppose sir that the whole policy of this country is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an illmannered colt of a boy he cried this has been made a test case all who would prosper in the future must put a shoulder to the wheel look at me do you suppose it is for my pleasure that i put myself in the highly invidious position of prosecuting a man that i have drawn the sword alongside of the choice is not left me  but i think sir that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with that unnatural rebellion i remarked my case is happily otherwise i am a true man and can look either the duke or king george in the face without concern  is it so the wind sits says he i protest you are fallen in the worst sort of error prestongrange has been hitherto so civil he tells me as not to combat your allegations but you must not think they are not looked upon with strong suspicion you say you are innocent my dear sir the facts declare you guilty  i was waiting for you there said i  the evidence of mungo campbell your flight after the completion of the murder your long course of secresymy good young man said mr symon here is enough evidence to hang a bullock let be a david balfour i shall be upon that trial my voice shall be raised i shall then speak much otherwise from what i do today and far less to your gratification little as you like it now ah you look white cries he i have found the key of your impudent heart you look pale your eyes waver mr david you see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had fancied  i own to a natural weakness said i i think no shame for that shame    i was going on  shame waits for you on the gibbet he broke in  where i shall but be evend with my lord your father said i  aha but not so he cried and you do not yet see to the bottom of this business my father suffered in a great cause and for dealing in the affairs of kings you are to hang for a dirty murder about boddlepieces your personal part in it the treacherous one of holding the poor wretch in talk your accomplices a pack of ragged highland gillies and it can be shown my great mr balfourit can be shown and it will be shown trust me that has a finger in the pieit can be shown and shall be shown that you were paid to do it i think i can see the looks go round the court when i adduce my evidence and it shall appear that you a young man of education let yourself be corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast clothes a bottle of highland spirits and threeandfivepencehalfpenny in copper money  there was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a blow clothes a bottle of usquebaugh and threeandfivepencehalfpenny in change made up indeed the most of what alan and i had carried from aucharn and i saw that some of jamess people had been blabbing in their dungeons  you see i know more than you fancied he resumed in triumph and as for giving it this turn great mr david you must not suppose the government of great britain and ireland will ever be stuck for want of evidence we have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as we direct them as i direct if you prefer the phrase so now you are to guess your part of glory if you choose to die on the one hand life wine women and a duke to be your handgun on the other a rope to your craig and a gibbet to clatter your bones on and the lousiest lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told about a hired assassin and see here he cried with a formidable shrill voice see this paper that i pull out of my pocket look at the name there it is the name of the great david i believe the ink scarce dry yet can you guess its nature it is the warrant for your arrest which i have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the spot once in the tolbooth upon this paper may god help you for the die is cast  i must never deny that i was greatly horrified by so much baseness and much unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger mr symon had already gloried in the changes of my hue i make no doubt i was now no ruddier than my shirt my speech besides trembled  there is a gentleman in this room cried i i appeal to him i put my life and credit in his hands  prestongrange shut his book with a snap i told you so symon said he you have played your hand for all it was worth and you have lost mr david he went on i wish you to believe it was by no choice of mine you were subjected to this proof i wish you could understand how glad i am you should come forth from it with so much credit you may not quite see how but it is a little of a service to myself for had our friend here been more successful than i was last night it might have appeared that he was a better judge of men than i it might have appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations mr symon and myself and i know our friend symon to be ambitious says he striking lightly on frasers shoulder as for this stage play it is over my sentiments are very much engaged in your behalf and whatever issue we can find to this unfortunate affair i shall make it my business to see it is adopted with tenderness to you  these were very good words and i could see besides that there was little love and perhaps a spice of genuine illwill between those two who were opposed to me for all that it was unmistakable this interview had been designed perhaps rehearsed with the consent of both it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by all methods and now persuasion flattery and menaces having been tried in vain i could not but wonder what would be their next expedient my eyes besides were still troubled and my knees loose under me with the distress of the late ordeal and i could do no more than stammer the same form of words i put my life and credit in your hands  well well says he we must try to save them and in the meanwhile let us return to gentler methods you must not bear any grudge upon my friend mr symon who did but speak by his brief and even if you did conceive some malice against myself who stood by and seemed rather to hold a candle i must not let that extend to innocent members of my family these are greatly engaged to see more of you and i cannot consent to have my young womenfolk disappointed tomorrow they will be going to hope park where i think it very proper you should make your bow call for me first when i may possibly have something for your private hearing then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy  i had done better to have instantly refused but in truth i was beside the power of reasoning did as i was bid took my leave i know not how and when i was forth again in the close and the door had shut behind me was glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face that horrid apparition as i may call it of mr symon rang in my memory as a sudden noise rings after it is over on the ear tales of the mans father of his falseness of his manifold perpetual treacheries rose before me from all that i had heard and read and joined on with what i had just experienced of himself each time it occurred to me the ingenious foulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my character startled me afresh the case of the man upon the gibbet by leith walk appeared scarce distinguishable from that i was now to consider as my own to rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly a paltry enterprise for two grown men but my own tale as it was to be represented in a court by symon fraser appeared a fair second in every possible point of view of sordidness and cowardice  the voices of two of prestongranges liveried men upon his doorstep recalled me to myself  hae said the one this billet as fast as ye can link to the captain  is that for the cateran back again asked the other  it would seem sae returned the first him and symon are seeking him  i think prestongrange is gane gyte says the second hell have james more in bed with him next  weel its neither your affair nor mines says the first  and they parted the one upon his errand and the other back into the house  this looked as ill as possible i was scarce gone and they were sending already for james more to whom i thought mr symon must have pointed when he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all extremities my scalp curdled among my hair and the next moment the blood leaped in me to remember catriona poor lass her father stood to be hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct what was yet more unpalatable it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by the worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murdersmurder by the false oath and to complete our misfortunes it seemed myself was picked out to be the victim  i began to walk swiftly and at random conscious only of a desire for movement air and the open country                                          chapter vii  i make a fault in honor   i came forth i vow i know not how on the lang dykes12 this is a rural road which runs on the north side over against the city thence i could see the whole black length of it tail down from where the castle stands upon its crags above the loch in a long line of spires and gable ends and smoking chimneys and at the sight my heart swelled in my bosom my youth as i have told was already inured to dangers but such danger as i had seen the face of but that morning in the midst of what they call the safety of a town shook me beyond experience peril of slavery peril of shipwreck peril of sword and shot i had stood all of these without discredit but the peril there was in the sharp voice and the fat face of symon properly lord lovat daunted me wholly  i sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into the water and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples if i could have done so with any remains of selfesteem i would now have fled from my foolhardy enterprise but call it courage or cowardice and i believe it was both the one and the other i decided i was ventured out beyond the possibility of a retreat i had outfaced these men i would continue to outface them come what might i would stand by the word spoken  the sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits but not much at the best of it there was an icy place about my heart and life seemed a black business to be at all engaged in for two souls in particular my pity flowed the one was myself to be so friendless and lost among dangers the other was the girl the daughter of james more i had seen but little of her yet my view was taken and my judgment made i thought her a lass of a clean honour like a mans i thought her one to die of a disgrace and now i believed her father to be at that moment bargaining his vile life for mine it made a bond in my thoughts betwixt the girl and me i had seen her before only as a wayside appearance though one that pleased me strangely i saw her now in a sudden nearness of relation as the daughter of my blood foe and i might say my murderer i reflected it was hard i should be so plagued and persecuted all my days for other folks affairs and have no manner of pleasure myself i got meals and a bed to sleep in when my concerns would suffer it beyond that my wealth was of no help to me if i was to hang my days were like to be short if i was not to hang but to escape out of this trouble they might yet seem long to me ere i was done with them of a sudden her face appeared in my memory the way i had first seen it with the parted lips at that weakness came in my bosom and strength into my legs and i set resolutely forward on the way to dean if i was to hang tomorrow and it was sure enough i might very likely sleep that night in a dungeon i determined i should hear and speak once more with catriona  the exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me yet more so that i began to pluck up a kind of spirit in the village of dean where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the river i inquired my way of a millers man who sent me up the hill upon the farther side by a plain path and so to a decentlike small house in a garden of lawns and appletrees my heart beat high as i stepped inside the garden hedge but it fell low indeed when i came face to face with a grim and fierce old lady walking there in a white mutch with a mans hat strapped upon the top of it  what do ye come seeking here she asked  i told her i was after miss drummond  and what may be your business with miss drummond says she  i told her i had met her on saturday last had been so fortunate as to render her a trifling service and was come now on the young ladys invitation  oh so youre saxpence she cried with a very sneering manner a braw gift a bonny gentleman and hae ye ony ither name and designation or were ye bapteesed saxpence she asked  i told my name  preserve me she cried has ebenezer gotten a son  no maam said i i am a son of alexanders its i that am the laird of shaws  yell find your work cut out for ye to establish that quoth she  i perceive you know my uncle said i and i daresay you may be the better pleased to hear that business is arranged  and what brings ye here after miss drummond she pursued  im come after my saxpence mem said i its to be thought being my uncles nephew i would be found a careful lad  so ye have a spark of sleeness in ye observed the old lady with some approval i thought ye had just been a cuifyou and your saxpence and your lucky day and your sake of balwhidderfrom which i was gratified to learn that catriona had not forgotten some of our talk but all this is by the purpose she resumed am i to understand that ye come here keeping company  this is surely rather an early question said i the maid is young so am i worse fortune i have but seen her the once ill not deny i added making up my mind to try her with some frankness ill not deny but she has run in my head a good deal since i met in with her that is one thing but it would be quite another and i think i would look very like a fool to commit myself  you can speak out of your mouth i see said the old lady praise god and so can i i was fool enough to take charge of this rogues daughter a fine charge i have gotten but its mine and ill carry it the way i want to do ye mean to tell me mr balfour of shaws that you would marry james mores daughter and him hanged well then where theres no possible marriage there shall be no manner of carryings on and take that for said lasses are bruckle things she added with a nod and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled chafts i was a lassie mysel and a bonny one  lady allardyce said i for that i suppose to be your name you seem to do the two sides of the talking which is a very poor manner to come to an agreement you give me rather a home thrust when you ask if i would marry at the gallows foot a young lady whom i have seen but the once i have told you already i would never be so untenty as to commit myself and yet ill go some way with you if i continue to like the lass as well as i have reason to expect it will be something more than her father or the gallows either that keeps the two of us apart as for my family i found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee i owe less than nothing to my uncle and if ever i marry it will be to please one person thats myself  i have heard this kind of talk before ye were born said mrs ogilvy which is perhaps the reason that i think of it so little theres much to be considered this james more is a kinsman of mine to my shame be it spoken but the better the family the mair men hanged or heided thats always been poor scotlands story and if it was just the hanging for my part i think i would be best pleased with james upon the gallows which would be at least an end to him catrines a good lass enough and a goodhearted and lets herself be deaved all day with a runt of an auld wife like me but ye see theres the weak bit shes daft about that long false fleeching beggar of a father of hers and redmad about the gregara and proscribed names and king james and a wheen blethers and you might think ye could guide her ye would find yourself sore mistaen ye say yeve seen her but the once  spoke with her but the once i should have said i interrupted i saw her again this morning from a window at prestongranges  this i daresay i put in because it sounded well but i was properly paid for my ostentation on the return  whats this of it cries the old lady with a sudden pucker of her face i think it was at the advocates doorcheek that ye met her first  i told her that was so  hm she said and then suddenly upon rather a scolding tone i have your bare word for it she cries as to who and what you are by your way of it youre balfour of the shaws but for what i ken you may be balfour of the deevils oxter its possible ye may come here for what ye say and its equally possible ye may come here for deil care what im good enough whig to sit quiet and to have keepit all my menfolks heads upon their shoulders but im not just a good enough whig to be made a fool of neither and i tell you fairly theres too much advocates door and advocates window here for a man that comes taigling after a macgregors daughter ye can tell that to the advocate that sent ye with my fond love and i kiss my loof to ye mr balfour says she suiting the action to the word and a braw journey to ye back to where ye cam frae  if you think me a spy i broke out and speech stuck in my throat i stood and looked murder at the old lady for a space then bowed and turned away  here hoots the callants in a creel she cried think ye a spy what else would i think yeme that kens naething by ye but i see that i was wrong and as i cannot fight ill have to apologise a bonny figure i would be with a broadsword ay ay she went on youre none such a bad lad in your way i think yell have some redeeming vices but oh davit balfour yere damned countryfeed yell have to win over that lad yell have to soople your backbone and think a wee pickle less of your dainty self and yell have to try to find out that womenfolk are nae grenadiers but that can never be to your last day youll ken no more of womenfolk than what i do of sowgelding  i had never been used with such expressions from a ladys tongue the only two ladies i had known mrs campbell and my mother being most devout and most particular women and i suppose my amazement must have been depicted in my countenance for mrs ogilvy burst forth suddenly in a fit of laughter  keep me she cried struggling with her mirth you have the finest timber faceand you to marry the daughter of a hieland cateran davie my dear i think well have to make a match of itif it was just to see the weans and now she went on theres no manner of service in your daidling here for the young woman is from home and its my fear that the old woman is no suitable companion for your fathers son forbye that i have nobody but myself to look after my reputation and have been long enough alone with a sedooctive youth and come back another day for your saxpence she cried after me as i left  my skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a boldness they had otherwise wanted for two days the image of catriona had mixed in all my meditations she made their background so that i scarce enjoyed my own company without a glint of her in a corner of my mind but now she came immediately near i seemed to touch her whom i had never touched but the once i let myself flow out to her in a happy weakness and looking all about and before and behind saw the world like an undesirable desert where men go as soldiers on a march following their duty with what constancy they have and catriona alone there to offer me some pleasure of my days i wondered at myself that i could dwell on such considerations in that time of my peril and disgrace and when i remembered my youth i was ashamed i had my studies to complete i had to be called into some useful business i had yet to take my part of service in a place where all must serve i had yet to learn and know and prove myself a man and i had so much sense as blush that i should be already tempted with these furtheron and holier delights and duties my education spoke home to me sharply i was never brought up on sugar biscuits but on the hard food of the truth i knew that he was quite unfit to be a husband who was not prepared to be a father also and for a boy like me to play the father was a mere derision  when i was in the midst of these thoughts and about halfway back to town i saw a figure coming to meet me and the trouble of my heart was heightened it seemed i had everything in the world to say to her but nothing to say first and remembering how tonguetied i had been that morning at the advocates i made sure that i would find myself struck dumb but when she came up my fears fled away not even the consciousness of what i had been privately thinking disconcerted me the least and i found i could talk with her as easily and rationally as i might with alan  o she cried you have been seeking your sixpence did you get it  i told her no but now i had met with her my walk was not in vain though i have seen you today already said i and told her where and when  i did not see you she said my eyes are big but there are better than mine at seeing far only i heard singing in the house  that was miss grant said i the eldest and the bonniest  they say they are all beautiful said she  they think the same of you miss drummond i replied and were all crowding to the window to observe you  it is a pity about my being so blind said she or i might have seen them too and you were in the house you must have been having the fine time with the fine music and the pretty ladies  there is just where you are wrong said i for i was as uncouth as a seafish upon the brae of a mountain the truth is that i am better fitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies  well i would think so too at all events said she at which we both of us laughed  it is a strange thing now said i i am not the least afraid with you yet i could have run from the miss grants and i was afraid of your cousin too  o i think any man will be afraid of her she cried my father is afraid of her himself  the name of her father brought me to a stop i looked at her as she walked by my side i recalled the man and the little i knew and the much i guessed of him and comparing the one with the other felt like a traitor to be silent  speaking of which said i i met your father no later than this morning  did you she cried with a voice of joy that seemed to mock at me you saw james more you will have spoken with him then  i did even that said i  then i think things went the worst way for me that was humanly possible she gave me a look of mere gratitude ah thank you for that says she  you thank me for very little said i and then stopped but it seemed when i was holding back so much something at least had to come out i spoke rather ill to him said i i did not like him very much i spoke him rather ill and he was angry  i think you had little to do then and less to tell it to his daughter she cried out but those that do not love and cherish him i will not know  i will take the freedom of a word yet said i beginning to tremble perhaps neither your father nor i are in the best of good spirits at prestongranges i daresay we both have anxious business there for its a dangerous house i was sorry for him too and spoke to him the first if i could but have spoken the wiser and for one thing in my opinion you will soon find that his affairs are mending  it will not be through your friendship i am thinking said she and he is much made up to you for your sorrow  miss drummond cried i i am alone in this world  and i am not wondering at that said she  o let me speak said i i will speak but the once and then leave you if you will for ever i came this day in the hopes of a kind word that i am sore in want of i know that what i said must hurt you and i knew it then it would have been easy to have spoken smooth easy to lie to you can you not think how i was tempted to the same cannot you see the truth of my heart shine out  i think here is a great deal of work mr balfour said she i think we will have met but the once and will can part like gentlefolk  o let me have one to believe in me i pleaded i cannae bear it else the whole world is clanned against me how am i to go through with my dreadful fate if theres to be none to believe in me i cannot do it the man must just die for i cannot do it  she had still looked straight in front of her head in air but at my words or the tone of my voice she came to a stop what is this you say she asked what are you talking of  it is my testimony which may save an innocent life said i and they will not suffer me to bear it what would you do yourself you know what this is whose father lies in danger would you desert the poor soul they have tried all ways with me they have sought to bribe me they offered me hills and valleys and today that sleuthhound told me how i stood and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace me i am to be brought in a party to the murder i am to have held glenure in talk for money and old clothes i am to be killed and shamed if this is the way i am to fall and me scarce a manif this is the story to be told of me in all scotlandif you are to believe it too and my name is to be nothing but a bywordcatriona how can i go through with it the things not possible its more than a man has in his heart  i poured my words out in a whirl one upon the other and when i stopped i found her gazing on me with a startled face  glenure it is the appin murder she said softly but with a very deep surprise  i had turned back to bear her company and we were now come near the head of the brae above dean village at this word i stepped in front of her like one suddenly distracted  for gods sake i cried for gods sake what is this that i have done and carried my fists to my temples what made me do it sure i am bewitched to say these things  in the name of heaven what ails you now she cried  i gave my honour i groaned i gave my honour and now i have broke it o catriona  i am asking you what it is she said was it these things you should not have spoken and do you think i have no honour then or that i am one that would betray a friend i hold up my right hand to you and swear  o i knew you would be true said i its meits here i that stood but this morning and outfaced them that risked rather to die disgraced upon the gallows than do wrongand a few hours after i throw my honour away by the roadside in common talk there is one thing clear upon our interview says he that i can rely on your pledged word where is my word now who could believe me now you could not believe me i am clean fallen down i had best die all this i said with a weeping voice but i had no tears in my body  my heart is sore for you said she but be sure you are too nice i would not believe you do you say i would trust you with anything and these men i would not be thinking of them men who go about to entrap and to destroy you fy this is no time to crouch look up do you not think i will be admiring you like a great hero of the goodand you a boy not much older than myself and because you said a word too much in a friends ear that would die ere she betrayed youto make such a matter it is one thing that we must both forget  catriona said i looking at her hangdog is this true of it would ye trust me yet  will you not believe the tears upon my face she cried it is the world i am thinking of you mr david balfour let them hang you i will never forget i will grow old and still remember you i think it is great to die so i will envy you that gallows  and maybe all this while i am but a child frighted with bogles said i maybe they but make a mock of me  it is what i must know she said i must hear the whole the harm is done at all events and i must hear the whole  i had sat down on the wayside where she took a place beside me and i told her all that matter much as i have written it my thoughts about her fathers dealing being alone omitted  well she said when i had finished you are a hero surely and i never would have thought that same and i think you are in peril too o symon fraser to think upon that man for his life and the dirty money to be dealing in such traffic and just then she called out aloud with a queer word that was common with her and belongs i believe to her own language my torture says she look at the sun  indeed it was already dipping towards the mountains  she bid me come again soon gave me her hand and left me in a turmoil of glad spirits i delayed to go home to my lodging for i had a terror of immediate arrest but got some supper at a change house and the better part of that night walked by myself in the barleyfields and had such a sense of catrionas presence that i seemed to bear her in my arms                                          chapter viii  the bravo   the next day august 29th i kept my appointment at the advocates in a coat that i had made to my own measure and was but newly ready  aha says prestongrange you are very fine today my misses are to have a fine cavalier come i take that kind of you i take that kind of you mr david o we shall do very well yet and i believe your troubles are nearly at an end  you have news for me cried i  beyond anticipation he replied your testimony is after all to be received and you may go if you will in my company to the trial which is to be held at inverary thursday 21st proximo  i was too much amazed to find words  in the meanwhile he continued though i will not ask you to renew your pledge i must caution you strictly to be reticent tomorrow your precognition must be taken and outside of that do you know i think least said will be soonest mended  i shall try to go discreetly said i i believe it is yourself that i must thank for this crowning mercy and i do thank you gratefully after yesterday my lord this is like the doors of heaven i cannot find it in my heart to get the thing believed  ah but you must try and manage you must try and manage to believe it says he soothinglike and i am very glad to hear your acknowledgment of obligation for i think you may be able to repay me very shortlyhe coughedor even now the matter is much changed your testimony which i shall not trouble you for today will doubtless alter the complexion of the case for all concerned and this makes it less delicate for me to enter with you on a side issue  my lord i interrupted excuse me for interrupting you but how has this been brought about the obstacles you told me of on saturday appeared even to me to be quite insurmountable how has it been contrived  my dear mr david said he it would never do for me to divulge even to you as you say the councils of the government and you must content yourself if you please with the gross fact  he smiled upon me like a father as he spoke playing the while with a new pen methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of deception in the man yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper dipped his pen among the ink and began again to address me i was somehow not so certain and fell instinctively into an attitude of guard  there is a point i wish to touch upon he began i purposely left it before upon one side which need be now no longer necessary this is not of course a part of your examination which is to follow by another hand this is a private interest of my own you say you encountered breck upon the hill  i did my lord said i  this was immediately after the murder  it was  did you speak to him  i did  you had known him before i think says my lord carelessly  i cannot guess your reason for so thinking my lord i replied but such is the fact  and when did you part with him again said he  i reserve my answer said i the question will be put to me at the assize  mr balfour said he will you not understand that all this is without prejudice to yourself i have promised you life and honour and believe me i can keep my word you are therefore clear of all anxiety alan it appears you suppose you can protect and you talk to me of your gratitude which i think if you push me is not illdeserved there are a great many different considerations all pointing the same way and i will never be persuaded that you could not help us if you chose to put salt on alans tail  my lord said i i give you my word i do not so much as guess where alan is  he paused a breath nor how he might be found he asked  i sat before him like a log of wood  and so much for your gratitude mr david he observed again there was a piece of silence well said he rising i am not fortunate and we are a couple at cross purposes let us speak of it no more you will receive notice when where and by whom we are to take your precognition and in the meantime my misses must be waiting you they will never forgive me if i detain their cavalier  into the hands of these graces i was accordingly offered up and found them dressed beyond what i had thought possible and looking fair as a posy  as we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which came afterwards to look extremely big i heard a whistle sound loud and brief like a signal and looking all about spied for one moment the red head of neil of the tom the son of duncan the next moment he was gone again nor could i see so much as the skirttail of catriona upon whom i naturally supposed him to be then attending  my three keepers led me out by bristo and the bruntsfield links whence a path carried us to hope park a beautiful pleasance laid with gravelwalks furnished with seats and summersheds and warded by a keeper  the way there was a little longsome the two younger misses affected an air of genteel weariness that damped me cruelly the eldest considered me with something that at times appeared like mirth and though i thought i did myself more justice than the day before it was not without some effort upon our reaching the park i was launched on a bevy of eight or ten young gentlemen some of them cockaded officers the rest chiefly advocates who crowded to attend upon these beauties and though i was presented to all of them in very good words it seemed i was by all immediately forgotten young folk in a company are like to savage animals they fall upon or scorn a stranger without civility or i may say humanity and i am sure if i had been among baboons they would have shown me quite as much of both some of the advocates set up to be wits and some of the soldiers to be rattles and i could not tell which of these extremes annoyed me most all had a manner of handling their swords and coatskirts for the which in mere black envy i could have kicked them from that park i daresay upon their side they grudged me extremely the fine company in which i had arrived and altogether i had soon fallen behind and stepped stiffly in the rear of all that merriment with my own thoughts  from these i was recalled by one of the officers lieutenant hector duncansby a gawky leering highland boy asking if my name was not palfour  i told him it was not very kindly for his manner was scant civil  ha palfour says he and then repeating it palfour palfour  i am afraid you do not like my name sir says i annoyed with myself to be annoyed with such a rustical fellow  no says he but i wass thinking  i would not advise you to make a practice of that sir says i i feel sure you would not find it to agree with you  tit you effer hear where alan grigor fand the tangs said he  i asked him what he could possibly mean and he answered with a heckling laugh that he thought i must have found the poker in the same place and swallowed it  there could be no mistake about this and my cheek burned  before i went about to put affronts on gentlemen said i i think i would learn the english language first  he took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly outside hope park but no sooner were we beyond the view of the promenaders than the fashion of his countenance changed you tam lowland scoonrel cries he and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his closed fist  i paid him as good or better on the return whereupon he stepped a little back and took off his hat to me decorously  enough plows i think says he i will be the offended shentleman for who effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is the kings officer he cannae speak cots english we have swords at our hurdies and here is the kings park at hand will ye walk first or let me show ye the way  i returned his bow told him to go first and followed him as he went i heard him grumble to himself about cots english and the kings coat so that i might have supposed him to be seriously offended but his manner at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him it was manifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel on me right or wrong manifest that i was taken in a fresh contrivance of my enemies and to me conscious as i was of my deficiencies manifest enough that i should be the one to fall in our encounter  as we came into that rough rocky desert of the kings park i was tempted halfadozen times to take to my heels and run for it so loath was i to show my ignorance in fencing and so much averse to die or even to be wounded but i considered if their malice went as far as this it would likely stick at nothing and that to fall by the sword however ungracefully was still an improvement on the gallows i considered besides that by the unguarded pertness of my words and the quickness of my blow i had put myself quite out of court and that even if i ran my adversary would probably pursue and catch me which would add disgrace to my misfortune so that taking all in all i continued marching behind him much as a man follows the hangman and certainly with no more hope  we went about the end of the long craigs and came into the hunters bog here on a piece of fair turf my adversary drew there was nobody there to see us but some birds and no resource for me but to follow his example and stand on guard with the best face i could display it seems it was not good enough for mr duncansby who spied some flaw in my manoeuvres paused looked upon me sharply and came off and on and menaced me with his blade in the air as i had seen no such proceedings from alan and was besides a good deal affected with the proximity of death i grew quite bewildered stood helpless and could have longed to run away  fat deil ails her cries the lieutenant  and suddenly engaging he twitched the sword out of my grasp and sent it flying far among the rushes  twice was this manoeuvre repeated and the third time when i brought back my humiliated weapon i found he had returned his own to the scabbard and stood awaiting me with a face of some anger and his hands clasped under his skirt  pe tamned if i touch you he cried and asked me bitterly what right i had to stand up before shentlemans when i did not know the back of a sword from the front of it  i answered that was the fault of my upbringing and would he do me the justice to say i had given him all the satisfaction it was unfortunately in my power to offer and had stood up like a man  and that is the truth said he i am fery prave myself and pold as a lions but to stand up thereand you ken naething of fencethe way that you did i declare it was peyond me and i am sorry for the plow though i declare i pelief your own was the elder brother and my held still sings with it and i declare if i had kent what way it wass i would not put a hand to such a piece of pusiness  that is handsomely said i replied and i am sure you will not stand up a second time to be the actor for my private enemies  indeed no palfour said he and i think i was used extremely suffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife or all the same as a bairn whateffer and i will tell the master so and fecht him by cot himself  and if you knew the nature of mr symons quarrel with me said i you would be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such affairs  he swore he could well believe it that all the lovats were made of the same meal and the devil was the miller that ground that then suddenly shaking me by the hand he vowed i was a pretty enough fellow after all that it was a thousand pities i had been neglected and that if he could find the time he would give an eye himself to have me educated  you can do me a better service than even what you propose said i and when he had asked its naturecome with me to the house of one of my enemies and testify how i have carried myself this day i told him that will be the true service for though he has sent me a gallant adversary for the first the thought in mr symons mind is merely murder there will be a second and then a third and by what you have seen of my cleverness with the cold steel you can judge for yourself what is like to be upshot  and i would not like it myself if i was no more of a man than what you wass he cried but i will do you right palfour lead on  if i had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels were light enough on the way out they kept time to a very good old air that is as ancient as the bible and the words of it are surely the bitterness of death is passed i mind that i was extremely thirsty and had a drink at saint margarets well on the road down and the sweetness of that water passed belief we went through the sanctuary up the canongate in by the netherbow and straight to prestongranges door talking as we came and arranging the details of our affair the footman owned his master was at home but declared him engaged with other gentlemen on very private business and his door forbidden  my business is but for three minutes and it cannot wait said i you may say it is by no means private and i shall be even glad to have some witnesses  as the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand we made so bold as to follow him to the antechamber whence i could hear for a while the murmuring of several voices in the room within the truth is they were three at the one tableprestongrange symon fraser and mr erskine sheriff of perth and as they were met in consultation on the very business of the appin murder they were a little disturbed at my appearance but decided to receive me  well well mr balfour and what brings you here again and who is this you bring with you says prestongrange  as for fraser he looked before him on the table  he is here to bear a little testimony in my favour my lord which i think it very needful you should hear said i and turned to duncansby  i have only to say this said the lieutenant that i stood up this day with palfour in the hunters pog which i am now fery sorry for and he behaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it and i have creat respects for palfour he added  i thank you for your honest expressions said i  whereupon duncansby made his bow to the company and left the chamber as we had agreed upon before  what have i to do with this says prestongrange  i will tell your lordship in two words said i i have brought this gentleman a kings officer to do me so much justice now i think my character is covered and until a certain date which your lordship can very well supply it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any more officers i will not consent to fight my way through the garrison of the castle  the veins swelled on prestongranges brow and he regarded me with fury  i think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs he cried and then turning fiercely on his neighbour this is some of your work symon he said i spy your hand in the business and let me tell you i resent it it is disloyal when we are agreed upon one expedient to follow another in the dark you are disloyal to me what you let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters and because i let drop a word to you  fy sir keep your dishonours to yourself  symon was deadly pale i will be a kickball between you and the duke no longer he exclaimed either come to an agreement or come to a differ and have it out among yourselves but i will no longer fetch and carry and get your contrary instructions and be blamed by both for if i were to tell you what i think of all your hanover business it would make your head sing  but sheriff erskine had preserved his temper and now intervened smoothly and in the meantime says he i think we should tell mr balfour that his character for valour is quite established he may sleep in peace until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall be put to the proof no more  his coolness brought the others to their prudence and they made haste with a somewhat distracted civility to pack me from the house                                          chapter ix  the heather on fire   when i left prestongrange that afternoon i was for the first time angry the advocate had made a mock of me he had pretended my testimony was to be received and myself respected and in that very hour not only was symon practising against my life by the hands of the highland soldier but as appeared from his own language prestongrange himself had some design in operation i counted my enemies prestongrange with all the kings authority behind him and the duke with the power of the west highlands and the lovat interest by their side to help them with so great a force in the north and the whole clan of old jacobite spies and traffickers and when i remembered james more and the red head of neil the son of duncan i thought there was perhaps a fourth in the confederacy and what remained of rob roys old desperate sept of caterans would be banded against me with the others one thing was requisite some strong friend or wise adviser the country must be full of such both able and eager to support me or lovat and the duke and prestongrange had not been nosing for expedients and it made me rage to think that i might brush against my champions in the street and be no wiser  and just then like an answer a gentleman brushed against me going by gave me a meaning look and turned into a close i knew him with the tail of my eyeit was stewart the writer and blessing my good fortune turned in to follow him as soon as i had entered the close i saw him standing in the mouth of a stair where he made me a signal and immediately vanished seven storeys up there he was again in a house door the which he locked behind us after we had entered the house was quite dismantled with not a stick of furniture indeed it was one of which stewart had the letting in his hands  well have to sit upon the floor said he but were safe here for the time being and ive been wearying to see ye mr balfour  hows it with alan i asked  brawly said he andie picks him up at gillane sands tomorrow wednesday he was keen to say goodby to ye but the way that things were going i was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart and that brings me to the essential how does your business speed  why said i i was told only this morning that my testimony was accepted and i was to travel to inverary with the advocate no less  hout awa cried stewart ill never believe that  i have maybe a suspicion of my own says i but i would like fine to hear your reasons  well i tell ye fairly im hornmad cries stewart if my one hand could pull their government down i would pluck it like a rotten apple im doer for appin and for james of the glens and of course its my duty to defend my kinsman for his life hear how it goes with me and ill leave the judgment of it to yourself the first thing they have to do is to get rid of alan they cannae bring in james as art and part until theyve brought in alan first as principal thats sound law they could never put the cart before the horse  and how are they to bring in alan till they can catch him says i  ah but there is a way to evite that arrestment said he sound law too it would be a bonny thing if by the escape of one illdoer another was to go scatheless and the remeid is to summon the principal and put him to outlawry for the noncompearance now theres four places where a person can be summoned at his dwellinghouse at a place where he has resided forty days at the head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily resorts or lastly if there be ground to think him forth of scotland at the cross of edinburgh and the pier and shore of leith for sixty days the purpose of which last provision is evident upon its face being that outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the transaction and the summonsing be something other than a form now take the case of alan he has no dwellinghouse that ever i could hear of i would be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty days together since the 45 there is no shire where he resorts whether ordinarily or extraordinarily if he has a domicile at all which i misdoubt it must be with his regiment in france and if he is not yet forth of scotland as we happen to know and they happen to guess it must be evident to the most dull its what hes aiming for where then and what way should he be summoned i ask it at yourself a layman  you have given the very words said i here at the cross and at the pier and shore of leith for sixty days  yere a sounder scots lawyer than prestongrange then cries the writer he has had alan summoned once that was on the twentyfifth the day that we first met once and done with it and where where but at the cross of inverary the head burgh of the campbells a word in your ear mr balfourtheyre not seeking alan  what do you mean i cried not seeking him  by the best that i can make of it said he not wanting to find him in my poor thought they think perhaps he might set up a fair defence upon the back of which james the man theyre really after might climb out this is not a case ye see its a conspiracy  yet i can tell you prestongrange asked after alan keenly said i though when i come to think of it he was something of the easiest put by  see that says he but there i may be right or wrong thats guesswork at the best and let me get to my facts again it comes to my ears that james and the witnessesthe witnesses mr balfourlay in close dungeons and shackled forbye in the military prison at fort william none allowed in to them nor they to write the witnesses mr balfour heard ye ever the match of that i assure ye no old crooked stewart of the gang ever outfaced the law more impudently its clean in the two eyes of the act of parliament of 1700 anent wrongous imprisonment no sooner did i get the news than i petitioned the lord justice clerk i have his word today theres law for ye heres justice  he put a paper in my hand that same mealymouthed falsefaced paper that was printed since in the pamphlet by a bystander for behoof as the title says of jamess poor widow and five children  see said stewart he couldnt dare to refuse me access to my client so he recommends the commanding officer to let me in recommendsthe lord justice clerk of scotland recommends is not the purpose of such language plain they hope the officer may be so dull or so very much the reverse as to refuse the recommendation i would have to make the journey back again betwixt here and fort william there would follow a fresh delay till i got fresh authority and they had disavowed the officermilitary man notoriously ignorant of the law and thati ken the cant of it then the journey a third time and there we should be on the immediate heels of the trial before i had received my first instruction am i not right to call this a conspiracy  it will bear that colour said i  and ill go on to prove it you outright said he they have the right to hold james in prison yet they cannot deny me to visit him they have no right to hold the witnesses but am i to get a sight of them that should be as free as the lord justice clerk himself seeread for the rest refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not accused as having done anything contrary to the duties of their office anything contrary sirs and the act of seventeen hunner mr balfour this makes my heart to burst the heather is on fire inside my wame  and the plain english of that phrase said i is that the witnesses are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them  and i am not to see them until inverary when the court is set cries he and then to hear prestongrange upon the anxious responsibilities of his office and the great facilities afforded the defence but ill begowk them there mr david i have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon the road and see if i cannae get a little harle of justice out of the military man notoriously ignorant of the law that shall command the party  it was actually soit was actually on the wayside near tynedrum and by the connivance of a soldier officer that mr stewart first saw the witnesses upon the case  there is nothing that would surprise me in this business i remarked  ill surprise you ere im done cries he do ye see thisproducing a print still wet from the press this is the libel see theres prestongranges name to the list of witnesses and i find no word of any balfour but here is not the question who do ye think paid for the printing of this paper  i suppose it would likely be king george said i  but it happens it was me he cried not but it was printed by and for themselves for the grants and the erskines and yon thief of the black midnight symon fraser but could i win to get a copy no i was to go blindfold to my defence i was to hear the charges for the first time in court alongst the jury  is not this against the law i asked  i cannot say so much he replied it was a favour so natural and so constantly rendered till this nonesuch business that the law has never looked to it and now admire the hand of providence a stranger is in flemings printing house spies a proof on the floor picks it up and carries it to me of all things it was just this libel whereupon i had it set againprinted at the expense of the defence sumptibus moesti rei heard ever man the like of itand here it is for anybody the muckle secret outall may see it now but how do you think i would enjoy this that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience  troth i think you would enjoy it ill said i  and now you see how it is he concluded and why when you tell me your evidence is to be let in i laugh aloud in your face  it was now my turn i laid before him in brief mr symons threats and offers and the whole incident of the bravo with the subsequent scene at prestongranges of my first talk according to promise i said nothing nor indeed was it necessary all the time i was talking stewart nodded his head like a mechanical figure and no sooner had my voice ceased than he opened his mouth and gave me his opinion in two words dwelling strong on both of them  disappear yourself said he  i do not take you said i  then ill carry you there said he by my view of it youre to disappear whatever o thats outside debate the advocate who is not without some spunks of a remainder decency has wrung your lifesafe out of symon and the duke he has refused to put you on your trial and refused to have you killed and there is the clue to their ill words together for symon and the duke can keep faith with neither friend nor enemy yere not to be tried then and yere not to be murdered but im in bitter error if yere not to be kidnapped and carried away like the lady grange bet me what you pleasethere was their expedient  you make me think said i and told him of the whistle and the redheaded retainer neil  wherever james more is theres one big rogue never be deceived on that said he his father was none so ill a man though a kenning on the wrong side of the law and no friend to my family that i should waste my breath to be defending him but as for james hes a brock and a blagyard i like the appearing of this redheaded neil as little as yourself it looks uncanny fiegh it smells bad it was old lovat that managed the lady grange affair if young lovat is to handle yours itll be all in the family whats james more in prison for the same offence abduction his men have had practice in the business hell be to lend them to be symons instruments and the next thing well be hearing james will have made his peace or else hell have escaped and youll be in benbecula or applecross  ye make a strong case i admitted  and what i want he resumed is that you should disappear yourself ere they can get their hands upon ye lie quiet until just before the trial and spring upon them at the last of it when theyll be looking for you least this is always supposing mr balfour that your evidence is worth so very great a measure of both risk and fash  i will tell you one thing said i i saw the murderer and it was not alan  then by god my cousins saved cried stewart you have his life upon your tongue and theres neither time risk nor money to be spared to bring you to the trial he emptied his pockets on the floor here is all that i have by me he went on take it yell want it ere yere through go straight down this close theres a way out by there to the lang dykes and by my will of it see no more of edinburgh till the clash is over  where am i to go then i inquired  and i wish that i could tell ye says he but all the places that i could send ye to would be just the places they would seek no ye must fend for yourself and god be your guiding five days before the trial september the sixteen get word to me at the kings arms in stirling and if yeve managed for yourself as long as that ill see that ye reach inverary  one thing more said i can i no see alan  he seemed boggled hech i would rather you wouldnae said he but i can never deny that alan is extremely keen of it and is to lie this night by silvermills on purpose if youre sure that youre not followed mr balfourbut make sure of thatlie in a good place and watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it it would be a dreadful business if both you and him was to miscarry                                          chapter x  the redheaded man   it was about halfpast three when i came forth on the lang dykes dean was where i wanted to go since catriona dwelled there and the glengyle macgregors appeared almost certainly to be employed against me it was just one of the few places i should have kept away from and being a very young man and beginning to be very much in love i turned my face in that direction without pause as a salve to my conscience and common sense however i took a measure of precaution coming over the crown of a bit of a rise in the road i clapped down suddenly among the barley and lay waiting after a while a man went by that looked to be a highlandman but i had never seen him till that hour presently after came neil of the red head the next to go past was a millers cart and after that nothing but manifest country people here was enough to have turned the most foolhardy from his purpose but my inclination ran too strong the other way i argued it out that if neil was on that road it was the right road to find him in leading direct to his chiefs daughter as for the other highlandman if i was to be startled off by every highlandman i saw i would scarce reach anywhere and having quite satisfied myself with this disingenuous debate i made the better speed of it and came a little after four to mrs drummondogilvys  both ladies were within the house and upon my perceiving them together by the open door i plucked off my hat and said here was a lad come seeking saxpence which i thought might please the dowager  catriona ran out to greet me heartily and to my surprise the old lady seemed scarce less forward than herself i learned long afterwards that she had despatched a horseman by daylight to rankeillor at the queensferry whom she knew to be the doer for shaws and had then in her pocket a letter from that good friend of mine presenting in the most favourable view my character and prospects but had i read it i could scarce have seen more clear in her designs maybe i was countryfeed at least i was not so much so as she thought and it was plain enough even to my homespun wits that she was bent to hammer up a match between her cousin and a beardless boy that was something of a laird in lothian  saxpence had better take his broth with us catrine says she run and tell the lasses  and for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains to flatter me always cleverly always with the appearance of a banter still calling me saxpence but with such a turn that should rather uplift me in my own opinion when catriona returned the design became if possible more obvious and she showed off the girls advantages like a horsecouper with a horse my face flamed that she should think me so obtuse now i would fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of and then i could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel and now that perhaps these two had set their heads together to entrap me and at that i sat and gloomed betwixt them like the very image of illwill at last the matchmaker had a better device which was to leave the pair of us alone when my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a little the wrong side of easy to allay them but though i knew what breed she was of and that was a breed of thieves i could never look in catrionas face and disbelieve her  i must not ask says she eagerly the same moment we were left alone  ah but today i can talk with a free conscience i replied i am lightened of my pledge and indeed after what has come and gone since morning i would not have renewed it were it asked  tell me she said my cousin will not be so long  so i told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the last of it making it as mirthful as i could and indeed there was matter of mirth in that absurdity  and i think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the pretty ladies after all says she when i had done but what was your father that he could not learn you to draw the sword it is most ungentle i have not heard the match of that in anyone  it is most misconvenient at least said i and i think my father honest man must have been woolgathering to learn me latin in the place of it but you see i do the best i can and just stand up like lots wife and let them hammer at me  do you know what makes me smile said she well it is this i am made this way that i should have been a man child in my own thoughts it is so i am always and i go on telling myself about this thing that is to befall and that then it comes to the place of the fighting and it comes over me that i am only a girl at all events and cannot hold a sword or give one good blow and then i have to twist my story round about so that the fighting is to stop and yet me have the best of it just like you and the lieutenant and i am the boy that makes the fine speeches all through like mr david balfour  you are a bloodthirsty maid said i  well i know it is good to sew and spin and to make samplers she said but if you were to do nothing else in the great world i think you will say yourself it is a driech business and it is not that i want to kill i think did ever you kill anyone  that i have as it chances two no less and me still a lad that should be at the college said i but yet in the lookback i take no shame for it  but how did you feel thenafter it she asked  deed i sat down and grat like a bairn said i  i know that too she cried i feel where these tears should come from and at any rate i would not wish to kill only to be catherine douglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt where it was broken that is my chief hero would you not love to die sofor your king she asked  troth said i my affection for my king god bless the puggy face of him is under more control and i thought i saw death so near to me this day already that i am rather taken up with the notion of living  right she said the right mind of a man only you must learn arms i would not like to have a friend that cannot strike but it will not have been with the sword that you killed these two  indeed no said i but with a pair of pistols and a fortunate thing it was the men were so nearhand to me for i am about as clever with the pistols as i am with the sword  so then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig which i had omitted in my first account of my affairs  yes said she you are brave and your friend i admire and love him  well and i think any one would said i he has his faults like other folk but he is brave and staunch and kind god bless him that will be a strange day when i forget alan and the thought of him and that it was within my choice to speak with him that night had almost overcome me  and where will my head be gone that i have not told my news she cried and spoke of a letter from her father bearing that she might visit him tomorrow in the castle whither he was now transferred and that his affairs were mending you do not like to hear it said she will you judge my father and not know him  i am a thousand miles from judging i replied and i give you my word i do rejoice to know your heart is lightened if my face fell at all as i suppose it must you will allow this is rather an ill day for compositions and the people in power extremely ill persons to be compounding with i have symon fraser extremely heavy on my stomach still  ah she cried you will not be evening these two and you should bear in mind that prestongrange and james more my father are of the one blood  i never heard tell of that said i  it is rather singular how little you are acquainted with said she one part may call themselves grant and one macgregor but they are still of the same clan they are all the sons of alpin from whom i think our country has its name  what country is that i asked  my country and yours said she  this is my day for discoveries i think said i for i always thought the name of it was scotland  scotland is the name of what you call ireland she replied but the old ancient true name of this place that we have our footsoles on and that our bones are made of will be alban it was alban they called it when our forefathers will be fighting for it against rome and alexander and it is called so still in your own tongue that you forget  troth said i and that i never learned for i lacked heart to take her up about the macedonian  but your fathers and mothers talked it one generation with another said she and it was sung about the cradles before you or me were ever dreamed of and your name remembers it still ah if you could talk that language you would find me another girl the heart speaks in that tongue  i had a meal with the two ladies all very good served in fine old plate and the wine excellent for it seems that mrs ogilvy was rich our talk too was pleasant enough but as soon as i saw the sun decline sharply and the shadows to run out long i rose to take my leave for my mind was now made up to say farewell to alan and it was needful i should see the trysting wood and reconnoitre it by daylight catriona came with me as far as to the garden gate  it is long till i see you now she asked  it is beyond my judging i replied it will be long it may be never  it may be so said she and you are sorry  i bowed my head looking upon her  so am i at all events said she i have seen you but a small time but i put you very high you are true you are brave in time i think you will be more of a man yet i will be proud to hear of that if you should speed worse if it will come to fall as we are afraido well think you have the one friend long after you are dead and me an old wife i will be telling the bairns about david balfour and my tears running i will be telling how we parted and what i said to you and did to you god go with you and guide you prays your little friend so i saidi will be telling themand here is what i did  she took up my hand and kissed it this so surprised my spirits that i cried out like one hurt the colour came strong in her face and she looked at me and nodded  o yes mr david said she that is what i think of you the heart goes with the lips  i could read in her face high spirit and a chivalry like a brave childs not anything besides she kissed my hand as she had kissed prince charlies with a higher passion than the common kind of clay has any sense of nothing before had taught me how deep i was her lover nor how far i had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a character yet i could tell myself i had advanced some way and that her heart had beat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me  after that honour she had done me i could offer no more trivial civility it was even hard for me to speak a certain lifting in her voice had knocked directly at the door of my own tears  i praise god for your kindness dear said i farewell my little friend giving her that name which she had given to herself with which i bowed and left her  my way was down the glen of the leith river towards stockbridge and silvermills a path led in the foot of it the water bickered and sang in the midst the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west among long shadows and as the valley turned made like a new scene and a new world of it at every corner with catriona behind and alan before me i was like one lifted up the place besides and the hour and the talking of the water infinitely pleased me and i lingered in my steps and looked before and behind me as i went this was the cause under providence that i spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes  anger sprang in my heart and i turned straight about and walked at a stiff pace to where i came from the path lay close by the bushes where i had remarked the head the cover came to the wayside and as i passed i was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall no such thing befell i went by unmeddled with and at that fear increased upon me it was still day indeed but the place exceeding solitary if my haunters had let slip that fair occasion i could but judge they aimed at something more than david balfour the lives of alan and james weighed upon my spirit with the weight of two grown bullocks  catriona was yet in the garden walking by herself  catriona said i you see me back again  with a changed face said she  i carry two mens lives besides my own said i it would be a sin and a shame not to walk carefully i was doubtful whether i did right to come here i would like it ill if it was by that means we were brought to harm  i could tell you one that would be liking it less and will like little enough to hear you talking at this very same time she cried what have i done at all events  o you you are not alone i replied but since i went off i have been dogged again and i can give you the name of him that follows me it is neil son of duncan your man or your fathers  to be sure you are mistaken there she said with a white face neil is in edinburgh on errands from my father  it is what i fear said i the last of it but for his being in edinburgh i think i can show you another of that for sure you have some signal a signal of need such as would bring him to your help if he was anywhere within the reach of ears and legs  why how will you know that says she  by means of a magical talisman god gave to me when i was born and the name they call it by is commonsense said i oblige me so far as to make your signal and i will show you the red head of neil  no doubt but i spoke bitter and sharp my heart was bitter i blamed myself and the girl and hated both of us her for the vile crew that she was come of myself for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in such a byke of wasps  catriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once with an exceeding clear strong mounting note as full as a ploughmans a while we stood silent and i was about to ask her to repeat the same when i heard the sound of some one bursting through the bushes below on the braeside i pointed in that direction with a smile and presently neil leaped into the garden his eyes burned and he had a black knife as they call it on the highland side naked in his hand but seeing me beside his mistress stood like a man struck  he has come to your call said i judge how near he was to edinburgh or what was the nature of your fathers errands ask himself if i am to lose my life or the lives of those that hang by me through the means of your clan let me go where i have to go with my eyes open  she addressed him tremulously in the gaelic remembering alans anxious civility in that particular i could have laughed out loud for bitterness here sure in the midst of these suspicions was the hour she should have stuck by english  twice or thrice they spoke together and i could make out that neil for all his obsequiousness was an angry man  then she turned to me he swears it is not she said  catriona said i do you believe the man yourself  she made a gesture like wringing the hands  how will i can know she cried  but i must find some means to know said i i cannot continue to go dovering round in the black night with two mens lives at my girdle catriona try to put yourself in my place as i vow to god i try hard to put myself in yours this is no kind of talk that should ever have fallen between me and you no kind of talk my heart is sick with it see keep him here till two of the morning and i care not try him with that  they spoke together once more in the gaelic  he says he has james more my fathers errand said she she was whiter than ever and her voice faltered as she said it  it is pretty plain now said i and may god forgive the wicked  she said never anything to that but continued gazing at me with the same white face  this is a fine business said i again am i to fall then and those two along with me  o what am i to do she cried could i go against my fathers orders and him in prison in the danger of his life  but perhaps we go too fast said i this may be a lie too he may have no right orders all may be contrived by symon and your father knowing nothing  she burst out weeping between the pair of us and my heart smote me hard for i thought this girl was in a dreadful situation  here said i keep him but the one hour and ill chance it and say god bless you  she put out her hand to me i will be needing one good word she sobbed  the full hour then said i keeping her hand in mine three lives of it my lass  the full hour she said and cried aloud on her redeemer to forgive her  i thought it no fit place for me and fled                                          chapter xi  the wood by silvermills   i lost no time but down through the valley and by stockbrig and silvermills as hard as i could stave it was alans tryst to lie every night between twelve and two in a bit scrog of wood by east of silvermills and by south the south milllade this i found easy enough where it grew on a steep brae with the milllade flowing swift and deep along the foot of it and here i began to walk slower and to reflect more reasonably on my employment i saw i had made but a fools bargain with catriona it was not to be supposed that neil was sent alone upon his errand but perhaps he was the only man belonging to james more in which case i should have done all i could to hang catrionas father and nothing the least material to help myself to tell the truth i fancied neither one of these ideas suppose by holding back neil the girl should have helped to hang her father i thought she would never forgive herself this side of time and suppose there were others pursuing me that moment what kind of a gift was i come bringing to alan and how would i like that  i was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations struck me like a cudgel my feet stopped of themselves and my heart along with them what wild game is this that i have been playing thought i and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere  this brought my face to silvermills the path came past the village with a crook but all plainly visible and highland or lowland there was nobody stirring here was my advantage here was just such a conjuncture as stewart had counselled me to profit by and i ran by the side of the milllade fetched about beyond the east corner of the wood threaded through the midst of it and returned to the west selvage whence i could again command the path and yet be myself unseen again it was all empty and my heart began to rise  for more than an hour i sat close in the border of the trees and no hare or eagle could have kept a more particular watch when that hour began the sun was already set but the sky still all golden and the daylight clear before the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk the images and distances of things were mingled and observation began to be difficult all that time not a foot of man had come east from silvermills and the few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and their wives upon the road to bed if i were tracked by the most cunning spies in europe i judged it was beyond the course of nature they could have any jealousy of where i was and going a little further home into the wood i lay down to wait for alan  the strain of my attention had been great for i had watched not the path only but every bush and field within my vision that was now at an end the moon which was in her first quarter glinted a little in the wood all round there was a stillness of the country and as i lay there on my back the next three or four hours i had a fine occasion to review my conduct  two things became plain to me first that i had had no right to go that day to dean and having gone there had now no right to be lying where i was this where alan was to come was just the one wood in all broad scotland that was by every proper feeling closed against me i admitted that and yet stayed on wondering at myself i thought of the measure with which i had meted to catriona that same night how i had prated of the two lives i carried and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her fathers and how i was here exposing them again it seemed in wantonness a good conscience is eight parts of courage no sooner had i lost conceit of my behaviour than i seemed to stand disarmed amidst a throng of terrors of a sudden i sat up how if i went now to prestongrange caught him as i still easily might before he slept and made a full submission who could blame me not stewart the writer i had but to say that i was followed despaired of getting clear and so gave in not catriona here too i had my answer ready that i could not bear she should expose her father so in a moment i could lay all these troubles by which were after all and truly none of mine swim clear of the appin murder get forth out of handstroke of all the stewarts and campbells all the whigs and tories in the land and live thenceforth to my own mind and be able to enjoy and to improve my fortunes and devote some hours of my youth to courting catriona which would be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run and be followed like a hunted thief and begin over again the dreadful miseries of my escape with alan  at first i thought no shame of this capitulation i was only amazed i had not thought upon the thing and done it earlier and began to inquire into the causes of the change these i traced to my lowness of spirits that back to my late recklessness and that again to the common old public disconsidered sin of selfindulgence instantly the text came in my head how can satan cast out satan what i thought i had by selfindulgence and the following of pleasant paths and the lure of a young maid cast myself wholly out of conceit with my own character and jeopardised the lives of james and alan and i was to seek the way out by the same road as i had entered in no the hurt that had been caused by selfindulgence must be cured by selfdenial the flesh i had pampered must be crucified i looked about me for that course which i least liked to follow this was to leave the wood without waiting to see alan and go forth again alone in the dark and in the midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes  i have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections because i think it is of some utility and may serve as an example to young men but there is reason they say in planting kale and even in ethic and religion room for common sense it was already close on alans hour and the moon was down if i left as i could not very decently whistle to my spies to follow me they might miss me in the dark and tack themselves to alan by mistake if i stayed i could at the least of it set my friend upon his guard which might prove his mere salvation i had adventured other peoples safety in a course of selfindulgence to have endangered them again and now on a mere design of penance would have been scarce rational accordingly i had scarce risen from my place ere i sat down again but already in a different frame of spirits and equally marvelling at my past weakness and rejoicing in my present composure  presently after came a crackling in the thicket putting my mouth near down to the ground i whistled a note or two of alans air an answer came in the like guarded tone and soon we had thralled together in the dark  is this you at last davie he whispered  just myself said i  god man but ive been wearying to see ye says he ive had the longest kind of a time a day ive had my dwelling into the inside of a stack of hay where i couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers and then two hours of it waiting here for you and you never coming dod and yere none too soon the way it is with me to sail the morn the morn what am i sayingthe day i mean  ay alan man the day sure enough said i its past twelve now surely and ye sail the day thisll be a long road you have before you  well have a long crack of it first said he  well indeed and i have a good deal it will be telling you to hear said i  and i told him what behooved making rather a jumble of it but clear enough when done he heard me out with very few questions laughing here and there like a man delighted and the sound of his laughing above all there in the dark where neither one of us could see the other was extraordinary friendly to my heart  ay davie yere a queer character says he when i had done a queer bitch after a and i have no mind of meeting with the like of ye as for your story prestongrange is a whig like yoursel so ill say the less of him and dod i believe he was the best friend ye had if ye could only trust him but symon fraser and james more are my ain kind of cattle and ill give them the name that they deserve the muckle black deil was father to the frasers abody kens that and as for the gregara i never could abye the reek of them since i could stotter on two feet i bloodied the nose of one i mind when i was still so wambly on my legs that i cowped upon the top of him a proud man was my father that day god rest him and i think he had the cause ill never can deny but what robin was something of a piper he added but as for james more the deil guide him for me  one thing we have to consider said i was charles stewart right or wrong is it only me theyre after or the pair of us  and whats your ain opinion you thats a man of so much experience said he  it passes me said i  and me too says alan do ye think this lass would keep her word to ye he asked  i do that said i  well theres nae telling said he and anyway thats over and done hell be joined to the rest of them lang syne  how many would ye think there would be of them i asked  that depends said alan if it was only you they would likely send twothree lively brisk young birkies and if they thought that i was to appear in the employ i daresay ten or twelve said he  it was no use i gave a little crack of laughter  and i think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number or the double of it nearer hand cries he  it matters the less said i because i am well rid of them for this time  nae doubt thats your opinion said he but i wouldnae be the least surprised if they were hunkering this wood ye see david man theyll be hieland folk therell be some frasers im thinking and some of the gregara and i would never deny but what the both of them and the gregara in especial were clever experienced persons a man kens little till hes driven a spreagh of neat cattle say ten miles through a throng lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail its there that i learned a great part of my penetration and ye need nae tell me its better than war which is the next best however though generally rather a bauchle of a business now the gregara have had grand practice  no doubt thats a branch of education that was left out with me said i  and i can see the marks of it upon ye constantly said alan but thats the strange thing about you folk of the college learning yere ignorant and ye cannae see t waes me for my greek and hebrew but man i ken that i dinnae ken themtheres the differ of it now heres you ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood and ye tell me that yeve cuist off these frasers and macgregors why because i couldnae see them says you ye blockhead thats their livelihood  take the worst of it said i and what are we to do  i am thinking of that same said he we might twine it wouldnae be greatly to my taste and forbye that i see reasons against it first its now unco dark and its just humanly possible we might give them the clean slip if we keep together we make but the ae line of it if we gang separate we make twae of them the more likelihood to stave in upon some of these gentry of yours and then second if they keep the track of us it may come to a fecht for it yet davie and then ill confess i would be blythe to have you at my oxter and i think you would be none the worse of having me at yours so by my way of it we should creep out of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute and hold away east for gillane where im to find my ship itll be like old days while it lasts davie and come the time well have to think what you should be doing im wae to leave ye here wanting me  have with ye then says i do ye gang back where you were stopping  deil a fear said alan they were good folks to me but i think they would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again for the way times go i amnae just what ye could call a walcome guest which makes me the keener for your company mr david balfour of the shaws and set ye up for leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with charlie stewart i have scarce said black or white since the day we parted at corstorphine  with which he rose from his place and we began to move quietly eastward through the wood                                          chapter xii  on the march again with alan   it was likely between one and two the moon as i have said was down a strongish wind carrying a heavy wrack of cloud had set in suddenly from the west and we began our movement in as black a night as ever a fugitive or a murderer wanted the whiteness of the path guided us into the sleeping town of broughton thence through picardy and beside my old acquaintance the gibbet of the two thieves a little beyond we made a useful beacon which was a light in an upper window of lochend steering by this but a good deal at random and with some trampling of the harvest and stumbling and falling down upon the banks we made our way across country and won forth at last upon the linky boggy muirland that they call the figgate whins here under a bush of whin we lay down the remainder of that night and slumbered  the day called us about five a beautiful morning it was the high westerly wind still blowing strong but the clouds all blown away to europe alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself it was my first sight of my friend since we were parted and i looked upon him with enjoyment he had still the same big greatcoat on his back but what was new he had now a pair of knitted boothose drawn above the knee doubtless these were intended for disguise but as the day promised to be warm he made a most unseasonable figure  well davie said he is this no a bonny morning here is a day that looks the way that a day ought to this is a great change of it from the belly of my haystack and while you were there sottering and sleeping i have done a thing that maybe i do over seldom  and what was that said i  o just said my prayers said he  and where are my gentry as ye call them i asked  gude kens says he and the short and the long of it is that we must take our chance of them up with your footsoles davie forth fortune once again of it and a bonny walk we are like to have  so we went east by the beach of the sea towards where the saltpans were smoking in by the esk mouth no doubt there was a byordinary bonny blink of morning sun on arthurs seat and the green pentlands and the pleasantness of the day appeared to set alan among nettles  i feel like a gomeral says he to be leaving scotland on a day like this it sticks in my head i would maybe like it better to stay here and hing  ay but ye wouldnae alan said i  no but what france is a good place too he explained but its some way no the same its brawer i believe but its no scotland i like it fine when im there man yet i kind of weary for scots divots and the scots peatreek  if thats all you have to complain of alan its no such great affair said i  and it sets me ill to be complaining whatever said he and me but new out of yon deils haystack  and so you were unco weary of your haystack i asked  wearys nae word for it said he im not just precisely a man thats easily cast down but i do better with caller air and the lift above my head im like the auld black douglas wasnaet that likit better to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep and yon place ye see daviewhilk was a very suitable place to hide in as im free to ownwas pit mirk from dawn to gloaming there were days or nights for how would i tell one from other that seemed to me as long as a long winter  how did you know the hour to bide your tryst i asked  the goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy and a candledowp to eat it by about eleeven said he so when i had swallowed a bit it would be time to be getting to the wood there i lay and wearied for ye sore davie says he laying his hand on my shoulder and guessed when the two hours would be about byunless charlie stewart would come and tell me on his watchand then back to the dooms haystack na it was a driech employ and praise the lord that i have warstled through with it  what did you do with yourself i asked  faith said he the best i could whiles i played at the knucklebones im an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones but its a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye and whiles i would make songs  what were they about says i  o about the deer and the heather says he and about the ancient old chiefs that are all by with it long syne and just about what songs are about in general and then whiles i would make believe i had a set of pipes and i was playing i played some grand springs and i thought i played them awful bonny i vow whiles that i could hear the squeal of them but the great affair is that its done with  with that he carried me again to my adventures which he heard all over again with more particularity and extraordinary approval swearing at intervals that i was a queer character of a callant  so ye were frichened of sym fraser he asked once  in troth was i cried i  so would i have been davie said he and that is indeed a dreidful man but it is only proper to give the deil his due and i can tell you he is a most respectable person on the field of war  is he so brave i asked  brave said he he is as brave as my steel sword  the story of my duel set him beside himself  to think of that he cried i showed ye the trick in corrynakiegh too and three timesthree times disarmed its a disgrace upon my character that learned ye here stand up out with your airn ye shall walk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel and me mair credit  alan said i this is midsummer madness here is no time for fencing lessons  i cannae well say no to that he admitted but three times man and you standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword like a doggie with a pocketnapkin david this man duncansby must be something altogether byordinar he maun be extraordinar skilly if i had the time i would gang straight back and try a turn at him mysel the man must be a provost  you silly fellow said i you forget it was just me  na said he but three times  when ye ken yourself that i am fair incompetent i cried  well i never heard tell the equal of it said he  i promise you the one thing alan said i the next time that we forgather ill be better learned you shall not continue to bear the disgrace of a friend that cannot strike  ay the next time says he and when will that be i would like to ken  well alan i have had some thoughts of that too said i and my plan is this its my opinion to be called an advocate  thats but a weary trade davie says alan and rather a blagyard one forby ye would be better in a kings coat than that  and no doubt that would be the way to have us meet cried i but as youll be in king lewies coat and ill be in king geordies well have a dainty meeting of it  theres some sense in that he admitted  an advocate then itll have to be i continued and i think it a more suitable trade for a gentleman that was three times disarmed but the beauty of the thing is this that one of the best colleges for that kind of learningand the one where my kinsman pilrig made his studiesis the college of leyden in holland now what say you alan could not a cadet of royal ecossais get a furlough slip over the marches and call in upon a leyden student  well and i would think he could cried he ye see i stand well in with my colonel count drummondmelfort and whats mair to the purpose i have a cousin of mine lieutenantcolonel in a regiment of the scotsdutch naething could be mair proper than what i would get a leave to see lieutenantcolonel stewart of halketts and lord melfort who is a very scienteefic kind of a man and writes books like cæsar would be doubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes  is lord melfort an author then i asked for much as alan thought of soldiers i thought more of the gentry that write books  the very same davie said he one would think a colonel would have something better to attend to but what can i say that make songs  well then said i it only remains you should give me an address to write you at in france and as soon as i am got to leyden i will send you mine  the best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain said he charles stewart of ardsheil esquire at the town of melons in the isle of france it might take long or it might take short but it would aye get to my hands at the last of it  we had a haddock to our breakfast in musselburgh where it amused me vastly to hear alan his greatcoat and boothose were extremely remarkable this warm morning and perhaps some hint of an explanation had been wise but alan went into that matter like a business or i should rather say like a diversion he engaged the goodwife of the house with some compliments upon the rizzoring of our haddocks and the whole of the rest of our stay held her in talk about a cold he had taken on his stomach gravely relating all manner of symptoms and sufferings and hearing with a vast show of interest all the old wives remedies she could supply him with in return  we left musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from edinburgh for as alan said that was a rencounter we might very well avoid the wind although still high was very mild the sun shone strong and alan began to suffer in proportion from prestonpans he had me aside to the field of gladsmuir where he exerted himself a great deal more than needful to describe the stages of the battle thence at his old round pace we travelled to cockenzie though they were building herringbusses there at mrs cadells it seemed a desertlike backgoing town about half full of ruined houses but the alehouse was clean and alan who was now in a glowing heat must indulge himself with a bottle of ale and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the cold upon his stomach only now the symptoms were all different  i sat listening and it came in my mind that i had scarce ever heard him address three serious words to any woman but he was always drolling and fleering and making a private mock of them and yet brought to that business a remarkable degree of energy and interest something to this effect i remarked to him when the good wife as chanced was called away  what do ye want says he a man should aye put his best foot forrit with the womenkind he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert them the poor lambs its what ye should learn to attend to david ye should get the principles its like a trade now if this had been a young lassie or onyways bonnie she would never have heard tell of my stomach davie but aince theyre too old to be seeking joes they a set up to be apotecaries why what do i ken theyll be just the way god made them i suppose but i think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his attention to the same  and here the luckie coming back he turned from me as if with impatience to renew their former conversation the lady had branched some while before from alans stomach to the case of a goodbrother of her own in aberlady whose last sickness and demise she was describing at extraordinary length sometimes it was merely dull sometimes both dull and awful for she talked with unction the upshot was that i fell in a deep muse looking forth of the window on the road and scarce marking what i saw presently had any been looking they might have seen me to start  we pit a fomentation to his feet the goodwife was saying and a het stane to his wame and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal and fine clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast  sir says i cutting very quietly in theres a friend of mine gone by the house  is that een sae replies alan as though it were a thing of smallaccount and then ye were saying mem says he and the wearyful wife went on  presently however he paid her with a halfcrown piece and she must go forth after the change  was it him with the red head asked alan  ye have it said i  what did i tell you in the wood he cried and yet its strange he should be here too was he his lane  his leelane for what i could see said i  did he gang by he asked  straight by said i and looked neither to the right nor left  and thats queerer yet said alan it sticks in my mind davie that we should be stirring but where todeil haet this is like old days fairly cries he  there is one big differ though said i that now we have money in our pockets  and another big differ mr balfour says he that now we have dogs at our tail theyre on the scent theyre in full cry david its a bad business and be damned to it and he sat thinking hard with a look of his that i knew well  im saying luckie says he when the goodwife returned have ye a back road out of this change house  she told him there was and where it led to  then sir says he to me i think that will be the shortest road for us and heres goodbye to ye my braw woman and ill no forget thon of the cinnamon water  we went out by way of the womans kale yard and up a lane among fields alan looked sharply to all sides and seeing we were in a little hollow place of the country out of view of men sat down  now for a council of war davie said he but first of all a bit lesson to ye suppose that i had been like you what would yon old wife have minded of the pair of us just that we had gone out by the back gate and what does she mind now a fine canty friendly cracky man that suffered with the stomach poor body and was real taen up about the goodbrother o man david try and learn to have some kind of intelligence  ill try alan said i  and now for him of the red head says he was he gaun fast or slow  betwixt and between said i  no kind of a hurry about the man he asked  never a sign of it said i  nhm said alan it looks queer we saw nothing of them this morning on the whins hes passed us by he doesnae seem to be looking and yet here he is on our road dod davie i begin to take a notion i think its no you theyre seeking i think its me and i think they ken fine where theyre gaun  they ken i asked  i think andie scougals sold mehim or his mate wha kent some part of the affairor else chairlies clerk callant which would be a pity too says alan and if you askit me for just my inward private conviction i think therell be heads cracked on gillane sands  alan i cried if youre at all right therell be folk there and to spare itll be small service to crack heads  it would aye be a satisfaction though says alan but bide a bit bide a bit im thinkingand thanks to this bonny westland wind i believe ive still a chance of it its this way davie im no trysted with this man scougal till the gloaming comes but says he if i can get a bit of a wind out of the west ill be there long or that he says and lieto for ye behind the isle of fidra now if your gentry kens the place they ken the time forbye do ye see me coming davie thanks to johnnie cope and other redcoat gomerals i should ken this country like the back of my hand and if yere ready for another bit run with alan breck well can cast back inshore and come down to the seaside again by dirleton if the ships there well try and get on board of her if shes no there ill just have to get back to my weary haystack but either way of it i think we will leave your gentry whistling on their thumbs  i believe theres some chance in it said i have on with ye alan                                          chapter xiii  gillane sands   i did not profit by alans pilotage as he had done by his marchings under general cope for i can scarce tell what way we went it is my excuse that we travelled exceeding fast some part we ran some trotted and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace twice while we were at top speed we ran against countryfolk but though we plumped into the first from round a corner alan was as ready as a loaded musket  hae ye seen my horse he gasped  na man i haenae seen nae horse the day replied the countryman  and alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling ride and tie that our charger had escaped and it was feared he had gone home to linton not only that but he expended some breath of which he had not very much left to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity which was said to be its cause  them that cannae tell the truth he observed to myself as we went on again should be aye mindfu to leave an honest handy lee behind them if folk dinnae ken what yere doing davie theyre terrible taken up with it but if they think they ken they care nae mair for it than what i do for pease porridge  as we had first made inland so our road came in the end to lie very near due north the old kirk of aberlady for a landmark on the left on the right the top of the berwick law and it was thus we struck the shore again not far from dirleton from north berwick west to gillane ness there runs a string of four small islets craiglieth the lamb fidra and eyebrough notable by their diversity of size and shape fidra is the most particular being a strange grey islet of two humps made the more conspicuous by a piece of ruin and i mind that as we drew closer to it by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like a mans eye under the lee of fidra there is a good anchorage in westerly winds and there from a far way off we could see the thistle riding  the shore in face of these islets is altogether waste here is no dwelling of man and scarce any passage or at most of vagabond children running at their play gillane is a small place on the far side of the ness the folk of dirleton go to their business in the inland fields and those of north berwick straight to the seafishing from their haven so that few parts of the coast are lonelier but i mind as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows keeping a bright eye upon all sides and our hearts hammering at our ribs there was such a shining of the sun and the sea such a stir of the wind in the bent grass and such a bustle of downpopping rabbits and upflying gulls that the desert seemed to me like a place alive no doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation if the secret had been kept and even now that it was out and the place watched we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills where they look down immediately on the beach and sea  but here alan came to a full stop  davie said he this is a kittle passage as long as we lie here were safe but im nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of france and as soon as we stand up and signal the brig its another matter for where will your gentry be think ye  maybe theyre no come yet said i and even if they are theres one clear matter in our favour theyll be all arranged to take us thats true but theyll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we are upon their west  ay says alan i wish we were in some force and this was a battle we would have bonnily outmanoeuvred them but it isnae davit and the way it is is a wee thing less inspiring to alan breck i swither davie  time flies alan said i  i ken that said alan i ken naething else as the french folk say but this is a dreidful case of heids or tails o if i could but ken where your gentry were  alan said i this is no like you its got to be now or never      this is no me quo he  sang alan with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery      neither you nor me quo he neither you nor me     wow na johnnie man neither you nor me  and then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was and with a handkerchief flying in his right hand marched down upon the beach i stood up myself but lingered behind him scanning the sandhills to the east his appearance was at first unremarked scougal not expecting him so early and my gentry watching on the other side then they awoke on board the thistle and it seemed they had all in readiness for there was scarce a seconds bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round her stern and begin to pull lively for the coast almost at the same moment of time and perhaps half a mile away towards gillane ness the figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill waving with his arms and though he was gone again in the same flash the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly wild  alan had not seen this looking straight to seaward at the ship and skiff  it maun be as it will said he when i had told him weel may yon boatie row or my craigll have to thole a raxing  that part of the beach was long and flat and excellent walking when the tide was down a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to the sea and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of a town no eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the bents no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boats coming time stood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting  there is one thing i would like to ken says alan i would like fine to ken these gentrys orders were worth four hunner pound the pair of us how if they took the guns to us davie they would get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank  morally impossible said i the point is that they can have no guns this thing has been gone about too secret pistols they may have but never guns  i believe yell be in the right says alan for all which i am wearying a good deal for yon boat  and he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog  it was now perhaps a third of the way in and we ourselves already hard on the margin of the sea so that the soft sand rose over my shoes there was no more to do whatever but to wait to look as much as we were able at the creeping nearer of the boat and as little as we could manage at the long impenetrable front of the sandhills over which the gulls twinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling  this is a fine bright caller place to get shot in says alan suddenly and man i wish that i had your courage  alan i cried what kind of talk is this of it youre just made of courage its the character of the man as i could prove myself if there was nobody else  and you would be the more mistaken said he what makes the differ with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs but for auld cauld dour deidly courage i am not fit to hold a candle to yourself look at us two here upon the sands here am i fair hotching to be off heres you for all that i ken in two minds of it whether youll no stop do you think that i could do that or would no me firstly because i havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur and secondly because i am a man of so much penetration and would see ye damned first  its there yere coming is it i cried ah man alan you can wile your old wives but you never can wile me  remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron  i have a tryst to keep i continued i am trysted with your cousin charlie i have passed my word  braw trysts that youll can keep said alan yell just mistryst aince and for a with the gentry in the bents and what for he went on with an extreme threatening gravity just tell me that my mannie are ye to be speerited away like lady grange are they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents or is it to be the other way and are they to bring ye in with james are they folk to be trustit would ye stick your head in the mouth of sim fraser and the ither whigs he added with extraordinary bitterness  alan cried i theyre all rogues and liars and im with ye there the more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves my word is passed and ill stick to it i said long syne to your kinswoman that i would stumble at no risk do ye mind of thatthe night red colin fell it was no more i will then here i stop prestongrange promised me my life if hes to be mansworn here ill have to die  aweel aweel said alan  all this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers in truth we had caught them unawares their whole party as i was to learn afterwards had not yet reached the scene what there was of them was spread among the bents towards gillane it was quite an affair to call them in and bring them over and the boat was making speed they were besides but cowardly fellows a mere leash of highland cattle thieves of several clans no gentleman there to be the captain and the more they looked at alan and me upon the beach the less i must suppose they liked the looks of us  whoever had betrayed alan it was not the captain he was in the skiff himself steering and stirring up his oarsmen like a man with his heart in his employ already he was near in and the boat scouringalready alans face had flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance when our friends in the bents either in despair to see their prey escape them or with some hope of scaring andie raised suddenly a shrill cry of several voices  this sound arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast was really very daunting and the men in the boat held water instantly  whats this of it sings out the captain for he was come within an easy hail  freens o mine says alan and began immediately to wade forth in the shallow water towards the boat davie he said pausing davie are ye no coming i am swier to leave ye  not a hair of me said i  he stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water hesitating  he that will to cupar maun to cupar said he and swashing in deeper than his waist was hauled into the skiff which was immediately directed for the ship  i stood where he had left me with my hands behind my back alan sat with his head turned watching me and the boat drew smoothly away of a sudden i came the nearest hand to shedding tears and seemed to myself the most deserted solitary lad in scotland with that i turned my back upon the sea and faced the sand hills there was no sight or sound of man the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry the wind blew in the bents the gulls made a dreary piping as i passed higher up the beach the sandlice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles the devil any other sight or sound in that unchancy place and yet i knew there were folk there observing me upon some secret purpose they were no soldiers or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now doubtless they were some common rogues hired for my undoing perhaps to kidnap perhaps to murder me outright from the position of those engaged the first was the more likely from what i knew of their character and ardency in this business i thought the second very possible and the blood ran cold about my heart  i had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard for though i was very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade i thought i could do some scathe in a random combat but i perceived in time the folly of resistance this was no doubt the joint expedient on which prestongrange and fraser were agreed the first i was very sure had done something to secure my life the second was pretty likely to have slipped in some contrary hints into the ears of neil and his companions and if i were to show bare steel i might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy and seal my own doom  these thoughts brought me to the head of the beach i cast a look behind the boat was nearing the brig and alan flew his handkerchief for a farewell which i replied to with the waving of my hand but alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view alongside of this pass that lay in front of me i set my hat hard on my head clenched my teeth and went right before me up the face of the sandwreath it made a hard climb being steep and the sand like water underfoot but i caught hold at last by the long bent grass on the braetop and pulled myself to a good footing the same moment men stirred and stood up here and there six or seven of them raggedlike knaves each with a dagger in his hand the fair truth is i shut my eyes and prayed when i opened them again the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without speech or hurry every eye was upon mine which struck me with a strange sensation of their brightness and of the fear with which they continued to approach me i held out my hands empty whereupon one asked with a strong highland brogue if i surrendered  under protest said i if ye ken what that means which i misdoubt  at that word they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a carrion seized me took my sword and all the money from my pockets bound me hand and foot with some strong line and cast me on a tussock of bent there they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed upon him silently like something dangerous perhaps a lion or a tiger on the spring presently this attention was relaxed they drew nearer together fell to speech in the gaelic and very cynically divided my property before my eyes it was my diversion in this time that i could watch from my place the progress of my friends escape i saw the boat come to the brig and be hoisted in the sails fill and the ship pass out seaward behind the isles and by north berwick  in the course of two hours or so more and more ragged highlandmen kept collecting neil among the first until the party must have numbered near a score with each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk that sounded like complaints and explanations but i observed one thing none of those that came late had any share in the division of my spoils the last discussion was very violent and eager so that once i thought they would have quarrelled on the heels of which their company parted the bulk of them returning westward in a troop and only three neil and two others remaining sentries on the prisoner  i could name one who would be very ill pleased with your days work neil duncanson said i when the rest had moved away  he assured me in answer i should be tenderly used for he knew he was acquent wi the leddy  this was all our talk nor did any other son of man appear upon that portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the highland mountains and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark at which hour i was aware of a long lean bonylike lothian man of a very swarthy countenance that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse  lads cried he hae ye a paper like this and held up one in his hand neil produced a second which the new comer studied through a pair of horn spectacles and saying all was right and we were the folk he was seeking immediately dismounted i was then set in his place my feet tied under the horses belly and we set forth under the guidance of the lowlander his path must have been very well chosen for we met but one paira pair of loversthe whole way and these perhaps taking us to be freetraders fled on our approach we were at one time close at the foot of berwick law on the south side at another as we passed over some open hills i spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church among some trees not far off but too far to cry for help if i had dreamed of it at last we came again within sound of the sea there was moonlight though not much and by this i could see the three huge towers and broken battlements of tantallon that old chief place of the red douglases the horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch to graze and i was led within and forth into the court and thence into a tumbledown stone hall here my conductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the pavement for there was a chill in the night my hands were loosed i was set by the wall in the inner end and the lowlander having produced provisions i was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of french brandy this done i was left once more alone with my three highlandmen they sat close by the fire drinking and talking the wind blew in by the breaches cast about the smoke and flames and sang in the tops of the towers i could hear the sea under the cliffs and my mind being reassured as to my life and my body and spirits wearied with the days employment i turned upon one side and slumbered  i had no means of guessing at what hour i was wakened only the moon was down and the fire low my feet were now loosed and i was carried through the ruins and down the cliffside by a precipitous path to where i found a fishers boat in a haven of the rocks this i was had on board of and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight                                          chapter xiv  the bass   i had no thought where they were taking me only looked here and there for the appearance of a ship and there ran the while in my head a word of ransomesthe twentypounders if i were to be exposed a second time to that same former danger of the plantations i judged it must turn ill with me there was no second alan and no second shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now and i saw myself hoe tobacco under the whips lash the thought chilled me the air was sharp upon the water the stretchers of the boat drenched with a cold dew and i shivered in my place beside the steersman this was the dark man whom i have called hitherto the lowlander his name was dale ordinarily called black andie feeling the thrill of my shiver he very kindly handed me a rough jacket full of fishscales with which i was glad to cover myself  i thank you for this kindness said i and will make so free as to repay it with a warning you take a high responsibility in this affair you are not like these ignorant barbarous highlanders but know what the law is and the risks of those that break it  i am no just exactly what ye would ca an extremist for the law says he at the best of times but in this business i act with a good warranty  what are you going to do with me i asked  nae harm said he nae harm ava yell hae strong freens im thinking yell be richt eneuch yet  there began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea little dabs of pink and like coals of slow fire came in the east and at the same time the geese awakened and began crying about the top of the bass it is just the one crag of rock as everybody knows but great enough to carve a city from the sea was extremely little but there went a hollow plowter round the base of it with the growing of the dawn i could see it clearer and clearer the straight crags painted with seabirds droppings like a morning frost the sloping top of it green with grass the clan of white geese that cried about the sides and the black broken buildings of the prison sitting close on the seas edge  at the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap  its there youre taking me i cried  just to the bass mannie said he whaur the auld sants were afore ye and i misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson  but none dwells there now i cried the place is long a ruin  itll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese then quoth andie dryly  the day coming slowly brighter i observed on the bilge among the big stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats several kegs and baskets and a provision of fuel all these were discharged upon the crag andie myself and my three highlanders i call them mine although it was the other way about landed along with them the sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again the noise of the oars on the tholepins echoing from the cliffs and left us in our singular reclusion  andie dale was the prefect as i would jocularly call him of the bass being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich estate he had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on the grass of the sloping part of it like beasts grazing the roof of a cathedral he had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in the crags and from these an extraordinary income is derived the young are dainty eating as much as two shillings apiece being a common price and paid willingly by epicures even the grown birds are valuable for their oil and feathers and a part of the ministers stipend of north berwick is paid to this day in solan geese which makes it in some folks eyes a parish to be coveted to perform these several businesses as well as to protect the geese from poachers andie had frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the crag and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading bidding us all shoulder some of the packages a matter in which i made haste to bear a hand he led us in by a locked gate which was the only admission to the island and through the ruins of the fortress to the governors house there we saw by the ashes in the chimney and a standing bedplace in one corner that he made his usual occupation  this bed he now offered me to use saying he supposed i would set up to be gentry  my gentrice has nothing to do with where i lie said i i bless god i have lain hard ere now and can do the same again with thankfulness while i am here mr andie if that be your name i will do my part and take my place beside the rest of you and i ask you on the other hand to spare me your mockery which i own i like ill  he grumbled a little at this speech but seemed upon reflection to approve it indeed he was a longheaded sensible man and a good whig and presbyterian read daily in a pocket bible and was both able and eager to converse seriously on religion leaning more than a little towards the cameronian extremes his morals were of a more doubtful colour i found he was deep in the free trade and used the ruins of tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise as for a gauger i do not believe he valued the life of one at halfafarthing but that part of the coast of lothian is to this day as wild a place and the commons there as rough a crew as any in scotland  one incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it had long after there was a warship at this time stationed in the firth the seahorse captain palliser it chanced she was cruising in the month of september plying between fife and lothian and sounding for sunk dangers early one fine morning she was seen about two miles to east of us where she lowered a boat and seemed to examine the wildfire rocks and satans bush famous dangers of that coast and presently after having got her boat again she came before the wind and was headed directly for the bass this was very troublesome to andie and the highlanders the whole business of my sequestration was designed for privacy and here with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore it looked to become public enough if it were nothing worse i was in a minority of one i am no alan to fall upon so many and i was far from sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition all which considered i gave andie my parole of good behaviour and obedience and was had briskly to the summit of the rock where we all lay down at the cliffs edge in different places of observation and concealment the seahorse came straight on till i thought she would have struck and we looking giddily down could see the ships company at their quarters and hear the leadsman singing at the lead then she suddenly wore and let fly a volley of i know not how many great guns the rock was shaken with the thunder of the sound the smoke flowed over our heads and the geese rose in number beyond computation or belief to hear their screaming and to see the twinkling of their wings made a most inimitable curiosity and i suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure that captain palliser had come so near the bass he was to pay dear for it in time during his approach i had the opportunity to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by which i ever after knew it miles away and this was a means under providence of my averting from a friend a great calamity and inflicting on captain palliser himself a sensible disappointment  all the time of my stay on the rock we lived well we had small ale and brandy and oatmeal of which we made our porridge night and morning at times a boat came from the castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton for the sheep upon the rock we must not touch these being specially fed to market the geese were unfortunately out of season and we let them be we fished ourselves and yet more often made the geese to fish for us observing one when he had made a capture and scaring him from his prey ere he had swallowed it  the strange nature of this place and the curiosities with which it abounded held me busy and amused escape being impossible i was allowed my entire liberty and continually explored the surface of the isle wherever it might support the foot of man the old garden of the prison was still to be observed with flowers and potherbs running wild and some ripe cherries on a bush a little lower stood a chapel or a hermits cell who built or dwelt in it none may know and the thought of its age made a ground of many meditations the prison too where i now bivouacked with highland cattle thieves was a place full of history both human and divine i thought it strange so many saints and martyrs should have gone by there so recently and left not so much as a leaf out of their bibles or a name carved upon the wall while the rough soldier lads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood with their mementoesbroken tobaccopipes for the most part and that in a surprising plenty but also metal buttons from their coats there were times when i thought i could have heard the pious sound of psalms out of the martyrs dungeons and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes and the dawn rising behind them out of the north sea  no doubt it was a good deal andie and his tales that put these fancies in my head he was extraordinary well acquainted with the story of the rock in all particulars down to the names of private soldiers his father having served there in that same capacity he was gifted besides with a natural genius for narration so that the people seemed to speak and the things to be done before your face this gift of his and my assiduity to listen brought us the more close together i could not honestly deny but what i liked him i soon saw that he liked me and indeed from the first i had set myself out to capture his good will an odd circumstance to be told presently effected this beyond my expectation but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a prisoner and his gaoler  i should trifle with my conscience if i pretended my stay upon the bass was wholly disagreeable it seemed to me a safe place as though i was escaped there out of my troubles no harm was to be offered me a material impossibility rock and the deep sea prevented me from fresh attempts i felt i had my life safe and my honour safe and there were times when i allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters at other times my thoughts were very different i recalled how strong i had expressed myself both to rankeillor and to stewart i reflected that my captivity upon the bass in view of a great part of the coasts of fife and lothian was a thing i should be thought more likely to have invented than endured and in the eyes of these two gentlemen at least i must pass for a boaster and a coward now i would take this lightly enough tell myself that so long as i stood well with catriona drummond the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled water and thence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are so delightful to himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to a reader but anon the fear would take me otherwise i would be shaken with a perfect panic of selfesteem and these supposed hard judgments appear an injustice impossible to be supported with that another train of thought would be presented and i had scarce begun to be concerned about mens judgments of myself than i was haunted with the remembrance of james stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife then indeed passion began to work in me i could not forgive myself to sit there idle it seemed if i were a man at all that i could fly or swim out of my place of safety and it was in such humours and to amuse my selfreproaches that i would set the more particularly to win the good side of andie dale  at last when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright morning i put in some hint about a bribe he looked at me cast back his head and laughed out loud  ay youre funny mr dale said i but perhaps if you glance an eye upon that paper you may change your note  the stupid highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure nothing but hard money and the paper i now showed andie was an acknowledgment from the british linen company for a considerable sum  he read it troth and yere nane sae ill aff said he  i thought that would maybe vary your opinions said i  hout said he it shaws me ye can bribe but im no to be bribit  well see about that yet a while says i and first ill show you that i know what i am talking you have orders to detain me here till thursday 21st september  yere no athegether wrong either says andie im to let ye gang bar orders contrair on saturday the 23rd  i could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this arrangement that i was to reappear precisely in time to be too late would cast the more discredit on my tale if i were minded to tell one and this screwed me to fighting point  now then andie you that kens the world listen to me and think while ye listen said i i know there are great folks in the business and i make no doubt you have their names to go upon i have seen some of them myself since this affair began and said my say into their faces too but what kind of a crime would this be that i had committed or what kind of a process is this that i am fallen under to be apprehended by some ragged johnhielandmen on august 30th carried to a rickle of old stones that is now neither fort nor gaol whatever it once was but just the gamekeepers lodge of the bass rock and set free again september 23d as secretly as i was first arresteddoes that sound like law to you or does it sound like justice or does it not sound honestly like a piece of some low dirty intrigue of which the very folk that meddle with it are ashamed  i canna gainsay ye shaws it looks unco underhand says andie and werenae the folk guid sound whigs and trueblue presbyterians i would hae seen them ayont jordan and jeroozlem or i would have set hand to it  the master of lovatll be a braw whig says i and a grand presbyterian  i ken naething by him said he i hae nae trokings wi lovats  no itll be prestongrange that youll be dealing with said i  ah but ill no tell ye that said andie  little need when i ken was my retort  theres just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of shaws says andie and that is that try as ye please im no dealing wi yoursel nor yet i amnae goin to he added  well andie i see ill have to be speak out plain with you i replied and i told him so much as i thought needful of the facts  he heard me out with serious interest and when i had done seemed to consider a little with himself  shaws said he at last i deal with the naked hand its a queer tale and no vary creditable the way you tell it and im far frae minting that is other than the way that ye believe it as for yoursel ye seems to me rather a dacentlike young man but me thats aulder and mair judeecious see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than what ye can dae and here is the maitter clear and plain to ye therell be nae skaith to yoursel if i keep ye here far frae that i think yell be a hantle better by it therell be nae skaith to the kintryjust ae mair hielantman hangitgude kens a guid riddance on the ither hand it would be considerable skaith to me if i would let you free sae speakin as a guid whig an honest freen to you and an anxious freen to my ainsel the plain fact is that i think yell just have to bide here wi andie an the solans  andie said i laying my hand upon his knee this hielantmans innocent  ay its a peety about that said he but ye see in this warld the way god made it we cannae just get athing that we want                                          chapter xv  black andies tale of tod lapraik   i have yet said little of the highlanders they were all three of the followers of james more which bound the accusation very tight about their masters neck all understood a word or two of english but neil was the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse in which when once he got embarked his company was often tempted to the contrary opinion they were tractable simple creatures showed much more courtesy than might have been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth appearance and fell spontaneously to be like three servants for andie and myself  dwelling in that isolated place in the old falling ruins of a prison and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the seabirds i thought i perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear when there was nothing doing they would either lie and sleep for which their appetite appeared insatiable or neil would entertain the others with stories which seemed always of a terrifying strain if neither of these delights were within reachif perhaps two were sleeping and the third could find no means to follow their examplei would see him sit and listen and look about him in a progression of uneasiness starting his face blenching his hands clutched a man strung like a bow the nature of these fears i had never an occasion to find out but the sight of them was catching and the nature of the place that we were in favourable to alarms i can find no word for it in the english but andie had an expression for it in the scots from which he never varied  ay he would say its an unco place the bass it is so i always think of it it was an unco place by night unco by day and these were unco sounds of the calling of the solans and the plash of the sea and the rock echoes that hung continually in our ears it was chiefly so in moderate weather when the waves were anyway great they roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies dreadful but merry to hear and it was in the calm days that a man could daunt himself with listeningnot a highlandman only as i several times experimented on myself so many still hollow noises haunted and reverberated in the porches of the rock  this brings me to a story i heard and a scene i took part in which quite changed our terms of living and had a great effect on my departure it chanced one night i fell in a muse beside the fire and that little air of alans coming back to my memory began to whistle a hand was laid upon my arm and the voice of neil bade me to stop for it was not canny musics  not canny i asked how can that be  na said he it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon his body13  well said i there can be no bogles here neil for its not likely they would fash themselves to frighten solan geese  ay says andie is that what ye think of it but ill can tell ye theres been waur nor bogles here  whats waur than bogles andie said i  warlocks said he or a warlock at the least of it and thats a queer tale too he added and if ye would like ill tell it ye  to be sure we were all of the one mind and even the highlander that had the least english of the three set himself to listen with all his might   the tale of tod lapraik  my faither tam dale peace to his banes was a wild sploring lad in his young days wi little wisdom and less grace he was fond of a lass and fond of a glass and fond of a randan but i could never hear tell that he was muckle use for honest employment frae ae thing to anither he listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this fort which was the first way that ony of the dales cam to set foot upon the bass sorrow upon that service the governor brewed his ain ale it seems it was the warst conceivable the rock was proveesioned frae the shore with vivers the thing was illguided and there were whiles when they but to fish and shoot solans for their diet to crown a thir was the days of the persecution the perishin cauld chalmers were all occupeed wi sants and martyrs the saut of the yearth of which it wasnae worthy and though tam dale carried a firelock there a single sodger and liked a lass and a glass as i was sayin the mind of the man was mair just than set with his position he had glints of the glory of the kirk there were whiles when his dander rase to see the lords sants misguided and shame covered him that he should be haulding a canle or carrying a firelock in so black a business there were nights of it when he was here on sentry the place a wheesht the frosts o winter maybe riving in the was and he would hear are o the prisoners strike up a psalm and the rest join in and the blessed sounds rising from the different chalmersor dungeons i would raither sayso that this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt of heevn black shame was on his saul his sins hove up before him muckle as the bass and above a that chief sin that he should have a hand in hagging and hashing at christs kirk but the truth is that he resisted the spirit day cam there were the rousing companions and his guid resolves depairtit  in thir days dwalled upon the bass a man of god peden the prophet was his name yell have heard tell of prophet peden there was never the wale of him sinsyne and its a question wi mony if there ever was his like afore he was wild s a peathag fearsome to look at fearsome to hear his face like the day of judgment the voice of him was like a solans and dinnled in folks lugs and the words of him like coals of fire  now there was a lass on the rock and i think she had little to do for it was nae place far dacent weemen but it seems she was bonny and her and tam dale were very well agreed it befell that peden was in the gairden his lane at the praying when tam and the lass cam by and what should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sants devotions he rose and lookit at the twa o them and tams knees knoitered thegether at the look of him but whan he spak it was mair in sorrow than in anger poor thing poor thing says he and it was the lass he lookit at i hear you skirl and laugh he says but the lord has a deid shot prepared for you and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the ae time shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi twathree sodgers and it was a blawy day there cam a gowst of wind claught her by the coats and awa wi her bag and baggage and it was remarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl  nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon tam dale but it passed again and him none the better ae day he was flyting wi anither sodgerlad deil hae me quo tam for he was a profane swearer and there was peden glowering at him gash an waefu peden wi his lang chafts an luntin een the maud happed about his kist and the hand of him held out wi the black nails upon the fingernebsfor he had nae care of the body fy fy poor man cries he the poor fool man deil hae me quo he an i see the deil at his oxter the conviction of guilt and grace cam in on tam like the deep sea he flang doun the pike that was in his handsi will nae mair lift arms against the cause o christ says he and was as gudes word there was a sair fyke in the beginning but the governor seeing him resolved gied him his dischairge and he went and dwallt and merried in north berwick and had aye a gude name with honest folk frae that day on  it was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the bass cam in the hands o the darymples and there was twa men soucht the chairge of it baith were weel qualified for they had baith been sodgers in the garrison and kent the gate to handle solans and the seasons and values of them forby that they were baithor they baith seemedearnest professors and men of comely conversation the first of them was just tam dale my faither the second was ane lapraik whom the folk cad tod lapraik maistly but whether for his name or his nature i could never hear tell weel tam gaed to see lapraik upon this business and took me that was a toddlin laddie by the hand tod had his dwallin in the lang loan benorth the kirkyaird its a dark uncanny loan forby that the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o james the saxt and the deevils cantrips played therein when the queen was on the seas and as for tods house it was in the mirkest end and was little liked by some that kenned the best the door was on the sneck that day and me and my faither gaed straucht in tod was a wabster to his trade his loom stood in the but there he sat a muckle fat white hash of a man like creish wi a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner the hand of him aye cawed the shuttle but his een was steeked we cried to him by his name we skirled in the deid lug of him we shook him by the shouther nae mainner o service there he sat on his dowp an cawed the shuttle and smiled like creish  god be guid to us says tam dale this is no canny  he had jimp said the word when tod lapraik cam to himsel  is this you tam says he haith man im blythe to see ye i whiles fa into a bit dwam like this he says its frae the stamach  weel they began to crack about the bass and which of them twa was to get the warding ot and by little and little cam to very ill words and twined in anger i mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again he cam ower and ower the same expression how little he likit tod lapraik and his dwams  dwam says he i think folk hae brunt far dwams like yon  aweel my faither got the bass and tod had to go wantin it was remembered sinsyne what way he had taen the thing tam says he ye hae gotten the better ome aince mair and i hope says he yell find at least a that ye expeckit at the bass which have since been thought remarkable expressions at last the time came for tam dale to take young solans this was a business he was weel used wi he had been a craigsman frae a laddie and trustit nane but himsel so there was he hingin by a line an speldering on the craig face whaur its hieest and steighest fower tenty lads were on the tap hauldin the line and mindin for his signals but whaur tam hung there was naething but the craig and the sea belaw and the solans skirling and flying it was a braw spring morn and tam whustled as he claught in the young geese monys the time i heard him tell of this experience and aye the swat ran upon the man  it chanced ye see that tam keeked up and he was awaur of a muckle solan and the solan pyking at the line he thocht this byordinar and outside the creatures habits he minded that ropes was unco saft things and the solans neb and the bass rock unco hard and that twa hunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa  shoo says tam awa bird shoo awa wi ye says he  the solan keekit doun into tams face and there was something unco in the creatures ee just the ae keek it gied and back to the rope but now it wroucht and warstlt like a thing dementit there never was the solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht and it seemed to understand its employ brawly birzing the saft rope between the neb of it and a crunkled jag o stane  there gaed a cauld stend o fear into tams heart this thing is nae bird thinks he his een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed black about him if i get a dwam here he thoucht its by wi tam dale and he signalled for the lads to pu him up  and it seemed the solan understood about signals for nae sooner was the signal made than he let be the rope spried his wings squawked out loud took a turn flying and dashed straucht at tam dales een tam had a knife he gart the cauld steel glitter and it seemed the solan understood about knives for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun than he gied the ae squawk but laigher like a body disappointit and flegged aff about the roundness of the craig and tam saw him nae mair and as sune as that thing was gane tams held drapt upon his shouther and they pud him up like a deid corp dadding on the craig  a dram of brandy which he went never without broucht him to his mind or what was left of it up he sat  rin geordie rin to the boat mak sure of the boat manrin he cries or yon solan ll have it awa says he  the fower lads stared at ither an tried to whillywha him to be quiet but naething would satisfy tam dale till ane o them had startit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat the ithers askit if he was for down again  na says he and niether you nor me says he and as sune as i can win to stand on my twa feet well be aff frae this craig o sawtan  sure eneuch nae time was lost and that was ower muckle for before they won to north berwick tam was in a crying fever he lay a the simmer and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him but tod lapraik folk thocht afterwards that ilka time tod cam near the house the fever had worsened i kenna for that but what i ken the best that was the end of it  it was about this time o the year my grandfaither was out at the white fishing and like a bairn i but to gang wi him we had a grand take i mind and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the bass whaur we forgaithered wi anither boat that belanged to a man sandie fletcher in castleton hes no lang deid niether or ye could spier at himsel weel sandie hailed  whats yon on the bass says he  on the bass says grandfaither  ay says sandie on the green side ot  whatten kind of a thing says grandfaither there cannae be naething on the bass but just the sheep  it looks unco like a body quo sandie who was nearer in  a body says we and we nane of us likit that for there was nae boat that could have broucht a man and the key o the prison yett hung ower my faithers held at hame in the press bed  we keept the twa boats closs for company and crap in nearer hand grandfaither had a gless for he had been a sailor and the captain of a smack and had lost her on the sands of tay and when we took the gless to it sure eneuch there was a man he was in a crunkle o green brae a wee below the chaipel a by his lee lane and lowped and flang and danced like a daft quean at a waddin  its tod says grandfaither and passed the gless to sandie  ay its him says sandie  or ane in the likeness o him says grandfaither  sma is the differ quo sandie deil or warlock ill try the gun at him quo he and broucht up a fowlingpiece that he aye carried for sandie was a notable famous shot in all that country  haud your hand sandie says grandfaither we maun see clearer first says he or this may be a dear days wark to the baith of us  hout says sandie this is the lords judgments surely and be damned to it says he  maybe ay and maybe no says my grandfaither worthy man but have you a mind of the procurator fiscal that i think yell have forgaithered wi before says he  this was ower true and sandie was a wee thing set ajee aweel edie says he and what would be your way of it  ou just this says grandfaither let me that has the fastest boat gang back to north berwick and let you bide here and keep an eye on thon if i cannae find lapraik ill join ye and the twa of usll have a crack wi him but if lapraiks at hame ill rin up the flag at the harbour and ye can try thon thing wi the gun  aweel so it was agreed between them twa i was just a bairn an clum in sandies boat whaur i thoucht i would see the best of the employ my grandsire gied sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi the leid draps bein mair deidly again bogles and then the ae boat set aff for north berwick an the tither lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy thing on the braeside  a the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like a teetotum and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span i hae seen lassies the daft queans that would lowp and dance a winters nicht and still be lowping and dancing when the winters day cam in but there would be folk there to hauld them company and the lads to egg them on and this thing was its leelane and there would be a fiddler diddling his elbock in the chimneyside and this thing had nae music but the skirling of the solans and the lassies were bits o young things wi the reid life dinnling and stending in their members and this was a muckle fat crieshy man and him fan in the vale o years say what ye like i maun say what i believe it was joy was in the creatures heart the joy o hell i daursay joy whatever mony a time i have askit mysel why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls whilk are their maist dear possessions and be auld duddy wrunklt wives or auld feckless doddered men and then i mind upon tod lapraik dancing a they hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart nae doubt they burn for it in muckle hell but they have a grand time here of it whateverand the lord forgie us  weel at the hinder end we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mastheld upon the harbour rocks that was a sandie waited for he up wi the gun took a deleeberate aim an pud the trigger there cam a bang and then ae waefu skirl frae the bass and there were we rubbin our een and lookin at ither like daft folk for wi the bang and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared the sun glintit the wund blew and there was the bare yaird whaur the wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second syne  the hale way hame i roared and grat wi the terror of that dispensation the grawn folk were nane sae muckle better there was little said in sandies boat but just the name of god and when we won in by the pier the harbour rocks were fair black wi the folk waitin us it seems they had fund lapraik in ane of his dwams cawing the shuttle and smiling ae lad they sent to hoist the flag and the rest abode there in the wabsters house you may be sure they liked it little but it was a means of grace to severals that stood there praying in to themsels for nane cared to pray out loud and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed the shuttle syne upon a suddenty and wi the ae driedfu skelloch tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab a bluidy corp  when the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the warlocks body sorrow a leid drap was to be fund but there was grandfathers siller tester in the puddocks heart of him                                       andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had its consequence neil as i have said was himself a great narrator i have heard since that he knew all the stories in the highlands and thought much of himself and was thought much of by others on the strength of it now andies tale reminded him of one he had already heard  she would ken that story afore he said she was the story of uistean more mgillie phadrig and the gavar vore  it is no sic a thing cried andie it is the story of my faither now wi god and tod lapraik and the same in your beard says he and keep the tongue of ye inside your hielant chafts  in dealing with highlanders it will be found and has been shown in history how well it goes with lowland gentlefolk but the thing appears scarce feasible for lowland commons i had already remarked that andie was continually on the point of quarrelling with our three macgregors and now sure enough it was to come  thir will be no words to use to shentlemans says neil  shentlemans cries andie shentlemans ye hielant stot if god would give ye the grace to see yoursel the way that ithers see ye ye would throw your denner up  there came some kind of a gaelic oath from neil and the black knife was in his hand that moment  there was no time to think and i caught the highlander by the leg and had him down and his armed hand pinned out before i knew what i was doing his comrades sprang to rescue him andie and i were without weapons the gregara three to two it seemed we were beyond salvation when neil screamed in his own tongue ordering the others back and made his submission to myself in a manner the most abject even giving me up his knife which upon a repetition of his promises i returned to him on the morrow  two things i saw plain the first that i must not build too high on andie who had shrunk against the wall and stood there as pale as death till the affair was over the second the strength of my own position with the highlanders who must have received extraordinary charges to be tender of my safety but if i thought andie came not very well out in courage i had no fault to find with him upon the account of gratitude it was not so much that he troubled me with thanks as that his whole mind and manner appeared changed and as he preserved ever after a great timidity of our companions he and i were yet more constantly together                                          chapter xvi  the missing witness   on the seventeenth the day i was trysted with the writer i had much rebellion against fate the thought of him waiting in the kings arms and of what he would think and what he would say when next we met tormented and oppressed me the truth was unbelievable so much i had to grant and it seemed cruel hard i should be posted as a liar and a coward and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that i should do i repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish and reexamined in that light the steps of my behaviour it seemed i had behaved to james stewart as a brother might all the past was a picture that i could be proud of and there was only the present to consider i could not swim the sea nor yet fly in the air but there was always andie i had done him a service he liked me i had a lever there to work on if it were just for decency i must try once more with andie  it was late afternoon there was no sound in all the bass but the lap and bubble of a very quiet sea and my four companions were all crept apart the three macgregors higher on the rock and andie with his bible to a sunny place among the ruins there i found him in deep sleep and as soon as he was awake appealed to him with some fervour of manner and a good show of argument  if i thoucht it was to do guid to ye shaws said he staring at me over his spectacles  its to save another said i and to redeem my word what would be more good than that do ye no mind the scripture andie and you with the book upon your lap what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world  ay said he thats grand for you but where do i come in i have my word to redeem the sames yoursel and what are ye asking me to do but just to sell it ye for siller  andie have i named the name of siller cried i  ou the names naething said he the thing is there whatever it just comes to this if i am to service ye the way that you propose ill loss my lieihood then its clear yell have to make it up to me and a pickle mair for your ain credit like and whats that but just a bribe and if even i was certain of the bribe but by a that i can learn its far frae that and if you were to hang where would i be na the things no possible and just awa wi ye like a bonny lad and let andie read his chapter  i remember i was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result and the next humour i fell into was one i had near said of gratitude to prestongrange who had saved me in this violent illegal manner out of the midst of my dangers temptations and perplexities but this was both too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long and the remembrance of james began to succeed to the possession of my spirits the 21st the day set for the trial i passed in such misery of mind as i can scarce recall to have endured save perhaps upon isle earraid only much of the time i lay on a braeside betwixt sleep and waking my body motionless my mind full of violent thoughts sometimes i slept indeed but the courthouse of inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find his missing witness followed me in slumber and i would wake again with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body i thought andie seemed to observe me but i paid him little heed verily my bread was bitter to me and my days a burthen  early the next morning friday 22nd a boat came with provisions and andie placed a packet in my hand the cover was without address but sealed with a government seal it enclosed two notes mr balfour can now see for himself it is too late to meddle his conduct will be observed and his discretion rewarded so ran the first which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand there was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise the writer even if that person could be found the seal which formidably served instead of signature was affixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of writing and i had to confess that so far my adversaries knew what they were doing and to digest as well as i was able the threat that peeped under the promise  but the second enclosure was by far the more surprising it was in a ladys hand of writ maister dauvit balfour is informed a friend was speiring for him and her eyes were of the grey it ranand seemed so extraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under cover of a government seal that i stood stupid catrionas grey eyes shone in my remembrance i thought with a bound of pleasure she must be the friend but who should the writer be to have her billet thus enclosed with prestongranges and of all wonders why was it thought needful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequential intelligence upon the bass for the writer i could hit upon none possible except miss grant her family i remembered had remarked on catrionas eyes and even named her for their colour and she herself had been much in the habit to address me with a broad pronunciation by way of a sniff i supposed at my rusticity no doubt besides but she lived in the same house as this letter came from so there remained but one step to be accounted for and that was how prestongrange should have permitted her at all in an affair so secret or let her daftlike billet go in the same cover with his own but even here i had a glimmering for first of all there was something rather alarming about the young lady and papa might be more under her domination than i knew and second there was the mans continual policy to be remembered how his conduct had been continually mingled with caresses and he had scarce ever in the midst of so much contention laid aside a mask of friendship he must conceive that my imprisonment had incensed me perhaps this little jesting friendly message was intended to disarm my rancour  i will be honestand i think it did i felt a sudden warmth towards that beautiful miss grant that she should stoop to so much interest in my affairs the summoning up of catriona moved me of itself to milder and more cowardly counsels if the advocate knew of her and of our acquaintanceif i should please him by some of that discretion at which his letter pointedto what might not this lead in vain is the net spread in the sight of any fowl the scripture says well fowls must be wiser than folk for i thought i perceived the policy and yet fell in with it  i was in this frame my heart beating the grey eyes plain before me like two stars when andie broke in upon my musing  i see ye hae gotten guid news said he  i found him looking curiously in my face with that there came before me like a vision of james stewart and the court of inverary and my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges trials i reflected sometimes draw out longer than is looked for even if i came to inverary just too late something might yet be attempted in the interests of jamesand in those of my own character the best would be accomplished in a moment it seemed without thought i had a plan devised  andie said i is it still to be tomorrow  he told me nothing was changed  was anything said about the hour i asked  he told me it was to be two oclock afternoon  and about the place i pursued  whatten place says andie  the place im to be landed at said i  he owned there was nothing as to that  very well then i said this shall be mine to arrange the wind is in the east my road lies westward keep your boat i hire it let us work up the forth all day and land me at two oclock tomorrow at the westmost well can have reached  ye daft callant he cried ye would try for inverary after a  just that andie says i  weel yere ill to beat says he and i was kind o sorry for ye a day yesterday he added ye see i was never entirely sure till then which way of it ye really wantit  here was a spur to a lame horse  a word in your ear andie said i this plan of mine has another advantage yet we can leave these hielandmen behind us on the rock and one of your boats from the castleton can bring them off tomorrow yon neil has a queer eye when he regards you maybe if i was once out of the gate there might be knives again these redshanks are unco grudgeful and if there should come to be any question here is your excuse our lives were in danger by these savages being answerable for my safety you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat and do you know andie says i with a smile i think it was very wisely chosen  the truth is i have nae goo for neil says andie nor he for me im thinking and i would like ill to come to my hands wi the man tam anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway for this man anster came from fife where the gaelic is still spoken ay ay says andie tamll can deal with them the best and troth the mair i think of it the less i see what way we would be required the placeay feggs they had forgot the place eh shaws yere a langheided chield when ye like forby that im awing ye my life he added with more solemnity and offered me his hand upon the bargain  whereupon with scarce more words we stepped suddenly on board the boat cast off and set the lug the gregara were then busy upon breakfast for the cookery was their usual part but one of them stepping to the battlements our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from the rock and the three of them ran about the ruins and the landingshelf for all the world like ants about a broken nest hailing and crying on us to return we were still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock which last lay broad upon the waters but presently came forth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine the sail filled the boat heeled to the gunwale and we swept immediately beyond sound of the mens voices to what terrors they endured upon the rock where they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised person or so much as the protection of a bible no limit can be set nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation for even in the haste and secrecy of our departure andie had managed to remove it  it was our first care to set anster ashore in a cove by the glenteithy rocks so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the next day thence we kept away up firth the breeze which was then so spirited swiftly declined but never wholly failed us all day we kept moving though often not much more and it was after dark ere we were up with the queensferry to keep the letter of andies engagement or what was left of it i must remain on board but i thought no harm to communicate with the shore in writing on prestongranges cover where the government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent i writ by the boats lantern a few necessary words and andie carried them to rankeillor in about an hour he came aboard again with a purse of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled for me by two tomorrow at clackmannan pool this done and the boat riding by her stone anchor we lay down to sleep under the sail  we were in the pool the next day long ere two and there was nothing left for me but sit and wait i felt little alacrity upon my errand i would have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down but none being to be found my uneasiness was no less great than if i had been running to some desired pleasure by shortly after one the horse was at the waterside and i could see a man walking it to and fro till i should land which vastly swelled my impatience andie ran the moment of my liberation very fine showing himself a man of his bare word but scarce serving his employers with a heaped measure and by about fifty seconds after two i was in the saddle and on the full stretch for stirling in a little more than an hour i had passed that town and was already mounting alan water side when the weather broke in a small tempest the rain blinded me the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of balwhidder not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary  in the press of my hurry and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a guide i had followed so far as it was possible for any horseman the line of my journey with alan this i did with open eyes foreseeing a great risk in it which the tempest had now brought to a reality the last that i knew of where i was i think it must have been about uam var the hour perhaps six at night i must still think it great good fortune that i got about eleven to my destination the house of duncan dhu where i had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell i know we were twice down and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in a roaring burn steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes  from duncan i had news of the trial it was followed in all these highland regions with religious interest news of it spread from inverary as swift as men could travel and i was rejoiced to learn that up to a late hour that saturday it was not yet concluded and all men began to suppose it must spread over to the monday under the spur of this intelligence i would not sit to eat but duncan having agreed to be my guide took the road again on foot with the piece in my hand and munching as i went duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a handlantern which last enlightened us just so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it for the thing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust the more part of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain and day found us aimless on the mountains hard by we struck a hut on a burnside where we got a bite and a direction and a little before the end of the sermon came to the kirk doors of inverary  the rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me but i was still bogged as high as to the knees i streamed water i was so weary i could hardly limp and my face was like a ghosts i stood certainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on than of all the benefits in christianity for all which being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately public i set the door open entered that church with the dirty duncan at my tails and finding a vacant place hard by sat down  thirteenthly my brethren and in parenthesis the law itself must be regarded as a means of grace the minister was saying in the voice of one delighting to pursue an argument  the sermon was in english on account of the assize the judges were present with their armed attendants the halberts glittered in a corner by the door and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of lawyers the text was in romans 5th and 13ththe minister a skilled hand and the whole of that able churchfulfrom argyle and my lords elchies and kilkerran down to the halbertmen that came in their attendancewas sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention the minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the same the rest either did not hear or would not heed and i sat there amongst my friends and enemies unremarked  the first that i singled out was prestongrange he sat well forward like an eager horseman in the saddle his lips moving with relish his eyes glued on the minister the doctrine was clearly to his mind charles stewart on the other hand was half asleep and looked harassed and pale as for symon fraser he appeared like a blot and almost a scandal in the midst of that attentive congregation digging his hands in his pockets shifting his legs clearing his throat rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left now with a yawn now with a secret smile at times too he would take the bible in front of him run it through seem to read a bit run it through again and stop and yawn prodigiously the whole as if for exercise  in the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself he sat a second stupefied than tore a half leaf out of the bible scrawled upon it with a pencil and passed it with a whispered word to his next neighbor the note came to prestongrange who gave me but the one look thence it voyaged to the hands of mr erskine thence again to argyle where he sat between the other two lords of session and his grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye the last of those interested to observe my presence was charlie stewart and he too began to pencil and hand about despatches none of which i was able to trace to their destination in the crowd  but the passage of these notes had aroused notice all who were in the secret or supposed themselves to be so were whispering informationthe rest questions and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering his voice changed he plainly faltered nor did he again recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery it would be a puzzle to him till his dying day why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four parts should thus miscarry in the fifth  as for me i continued to sit there very wet and weary and a good deal anxious as to what should happen next but greatly exulting in my success                                          chapter xvii  the memorial   the last word of the blessing was scarce out of the ministers mouth before stewart had me by the arm we were the first to be forth of the church and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe within the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be thronged with the homegoing congregation  am i yet in time i asked  ay and no said he the case is over the jury is enclosed and will be so kind as let us ken their view of it tomorrow in the morning the same as i could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began the thing has been public from the start the panel kent it ye may do what ye will for me whispers he two days ago i ken my fate by what the duke of argyle has just said to mr macintosh o its been a scandal      the great argyle he gaed before     he gart the cannons and guns to roar  and the very macer cried cruachan but now that i have got you again ill never despair the oak shall go over the myrtle yet well ding the campbells yet in their own town praise god that i should see the day  he was leaping with excitement emptied out his mails upon the floor that i might have a change of clothes and incommoded me with his assistance as i changed what remained to be done or how i was to do it was what he never told me nor i believe so much as thought of well ding the camphells yet that was still his overcome and it was forced home upon my mind how this that had the externals of a sober process of law was in its essence a clan battle between savage clans i thought my friend the writer none of the least savage who that had only seen him at a counsels back before the lord ordinary or following a golf ball and laying down his clubs on bruntsfield links could have recognised for the same person this voluble and violent clansman  james stewarts counsel were four in numbersheriffs brown of colstoun and miller mr robert macintosh and mr stewart younger of stewart hall these were covenanted to dine with the writer after sermon and i was very obligingly included of the party no sooner the cloth lifted and the first bowl very artfully compounded by sheriff miller than we fell to the subject in hand i made a short narration of my seizure and captivity and was then examined and reexamined upon the circumstances of the murder it will be remembered this was the first time i had had my say out or the matter at all handled among lawyers and the consequence was very dispiriting to the others and i must own disappointing to myself  to sum up said colstoun you prove that alan was on the spot you have heard him proffer menaces against glenure and though you assure us he was not the man who fired you leave a strong impression that he was in league with him and consenting perhaps immediately assisting in the act you show him besides at the risk of his own liberty actively furthering the criminals escape and the rest of your testimony so far as the least material depends on the bare word of alan or of james the two accused in short you do not at all break but only lengthen by one personage the chain that binds our client to the murderer and i need scarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling block from the beginning  i am of the same opinion said sheriff miller i think we may all be very much obliged to prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way and chiefly i think mr balfour himself might be obliged for you talk of a third accomplice but mr balfour in my view has very much the appearance of a fourth  allow me sirs interposed stewart the writer there is another view here we have a witnessnever fash whether material or nota witness in this cause kidnapped by that old lawless bandit crew of the glengyle macgregors and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old cold ruins on the bass move that and see what dirt you fling on the proceedings sirs this is a tale to make the world ring with it would be strange with such a grip as this if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon for my client  and suppose we took up mr balfours cause tomorrow said stewart hall i am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown in our path as that james should have been hanged before we had found a court to hear us this is a great scandal but i suppose we have none of us forgot a greater still i mean the matter of the lady grange the woman was still in durance my friend mr hope of rankeillor did what was humanly possible and how did he speed he never got a warrant well itll be the same now the same weapons will be used this is a scene gentlemen of clan animosity the hatred of the name which i have the honor to bear rages in high quarters there is nothing here to be viewed but naked campbell spite and scurvy campbell intrigue  you may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic and i sat for some time in the midst of my learned counsel almost deaved with their talk but extremely little the wiser for its purport the writer was led into some hot expressions colstoun must take him up and set him right the rest joined in on different sides but all pretty noisy the duke of argyle was beaten like a blanket king george came in for a few digs in the bygoing and a great deal of rather elaborate defence and there was only one person that seemed to be forgotten and that was james of the glens  through all this mr miller sat quiet he was a slip of an oldish gentleman ruddy and twinkling he spoke in a smooth rich voice with an infinite effect of pawkiness dealing out each word the way an actor does to give the most expression possible and even now when he was silent and sat there with his wig laid aside his glass in both hands his mouth funnily pursed and his chin out he seemed the mere picture of a merry slyness it was plain he had a word to say and waited for the fit occasion  it came presently colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some expression of their duty to their client his brother sheriff was pleased i suppose with the transition he took the table in his confidence with a gesture and a look  that suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked said he the interest of our client goes certainly before all but the world does not come to an end with james stewart whereat he cocked his eye i might condescend exempli gratia upon a mr george brown a mr thomas miller and a mr david balfour mr david balfour has a very good ground of complaint and i think gentlemenif his story was properly red outi think there would be a number of wigs on the green  the whole table turned to him with a common movement  properly handled and carefully red out his is a story that could scarcely fail to have some consequence he continued the whole administration of justice from its highest officer downward would be totally discredited and it looks to me as if they would need to be replaced he seemed to shine with cunning as he said it and i need not point out to ye that this of mr balfours would be a remarkable bonny cause to appear in he added  well there they all were started on another hare mr balfours cause and what kind of speeches could be there delivered and what officials could be thus turned out and who would succeed to their positions i shall give but the two specimens it was proposed to approach symon fraser whose testimony if it could be obtained could prove certainly fatal to argyle and prestongrange miller highly approved of the attempt we have here before us a dreeping roast said he here is cutandcomeagain for all and methought all licked their lips the other was already near the end stewart the writer was out of the body with delight smelling vengeance on his chief enemy the duke  gentlemen cried he charging his glass here is to sheriff miller his legal abilities are known to all his culinary this bowl in front of us is here to speak for but when it comes to the poleeticalcries he and drains the glass  ay but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning my friend said the gratified miller a revolution if you like and i think i can promise you that historical writers shall date from mr balfours cause but properly guided mr stewart tenderly guided it shall prove a peaceful revolution  and if the damned campbells get their ears rubbed what care i cries stewart smiting down his fist  it will be thought i was not very well pleased with all this though i could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old intriguers but it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows for the advancement of sheriff miller or to make a revolution in the parliament house and i interposed accordingly with as much simplicity of manner as i could assume  i have to thank you gentlemen for your advice said i and now i would like by your leave to set you two or three questions there is one thing that has fallen rather on one side for instance will this cause do any good to our friend james of the glens  they seemed all a hair set back and gave various answers but concurring practically in one point that james had now no hope but in the kings mercy  to proceed then said i will it do any good to scotland we have a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest i remember hearing we had a riot in edinburgh when i was an infant child which gave occasion to the late queen to call this country barbarous and i always understood that we had rather lost than gained by that then came the year fortyfive which made scotland to be talked of everywhere but i never heard it said we had anyway gained by the fortyfive and now we come to this cause of mr balfours as you call it sheriff miller tells us historical writers are to date from it and i would not wonder it is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and public reproach  the nimblewitted miller had already smelt where i was travelling to and made haste to get on the same road forcibly put mr balfour says he a weighty observe sir  we have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for king george i pursued sheriff miller appears pretty easy upon this but i doubt you will scarce be able to pull down the house from under him without his majesty coming by a knock or two one of which might easily prove fatal  i gave them a chance to answer but none volunteered  of those for whom the case was to be profitable i went on sheriff miller gave us the names of several among the which he was good enough to mention mine i hope he will pardon me if i think otherwise i believe i hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to be saved but i own i thought myself extremely hazarded and i own i think it would be a pity for a young man with some idea of coming to the bar to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent factious fellow before he was yet twenty as for james it seemsat this date of the proceedings with the sentence as good as pronouncedhe has no hope but in the kings mercy may not his majesty then be more pointedly addressed the characters of these high officers sheltered from the public and myself kept out of a position which i think spells ruin for me  they all sat and gazed into their glasses and i could see they found my attitude on the affair unpalatable but miller was ready at all events  if i may be allowed to put our young friends notion in more formal shape says he i understand him to propose that we should embody the fact of his sequestration and perhaps some heads of the testimony he was prepared to offer in a memorial to the crown this plan has elements of success it is as likely as any other and perhaps likelier to help our client perhaps his majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such a memorial which might be construed into an expression of a very delicate loyalty and i think in the drafting of the same this view might be brought forward  they all nodded to each other not without sighs for the former alternative was doubtless more after their inclination  paper then mr stewart if you please pursued miller and i think it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present as procurators for the condemned man  it can do none of us any harm at least says colstoun heaving another sigh for he had seen himself lord advocate the last ten minutes  thereupon they set themselves not very enthusiastically to draft the memoriala process in the course of which they soon caught fire and i had no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional question the paper was very well expressed beginning with a recitation of the facts about myself the reward offered for my apprehension my surrender the pressure brought to bear upon me my sequestration and my arrival at inverary in time to be too late going on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of action and winding up with a forcible appeal to the kings mercy on behalf of james  methought i was a good deal sacrificed and rather represented in the light of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had restrained with difficulty from extremes but i let it pass and made but the one suggestion that i should be described as ready to deliver my own evidence and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiryand the one demand that i should be immediately furnished with a copy  colstoun hummed and hawed this is a very confidential document said he  and my position towards prestongrange is highly peculiar i replied no question but i must have touched his heart at our first interview so that he has since stood my friend consistently but for him gentlemen i must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor james for which reason i choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial as soon as it is copied you are to consider also that this step will make for my protection i have enemies here accustomed to drive hard his grace is in his own country lovat by his side and if there should hang any ambiguity over our proceedings i think i might very well awake in gaol  not finding any very ready answer to these considerations my company of advisers were at the last persuaded to consent and made only this condition that i was to lay the paper before prestongrange with the express compliments of all concerned  the advocate was at the castle dining with his grace by the hand of one of colstouns servants i sent him a billet asking for an interview and received a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the town here i found him alone in a chamber from his face there was nothing to be gleaned yet i was not so unobservant but what i spied some halberts in the hall and not so stupid but what i could gather he was prepared to arrest me there and then should it appear advisable  so mr david this is you said he  where i fear i am not overly welcome my lord said i and i would like before i go further to express my sense of your lordships continued good offices even should they now cease  i have heard of your gratitude before he replied drily and i think this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to i would remember also if i were you that you still stand on a very boggy foundation  not now my lord i think said i and if your lordship will but glance an eye along this you will perhaps think as i do  he read it sedulously through frowning heavily then turned back to one part and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect of his face a little lightened  this is not so bad but what it might be worse said he though i am still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with mr david balfour  rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man my lord said i  he still skimmed the paper and all the while his spirits seemed to mend  and to whom am i indebted for this he asked presently other counsels must have been discussed i think who was it proposed this private method was it miller  my lord it was myself said i these gentlemen have shown me no such consideration as that i should deny myself any credit i can fairly claim or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear and the mere truth is that they were all in favour of a process which should have remarkable consequences in the parliament house and prove for them in one of their own expressions a dripping roast before i intervened i think they were on the point of sharing out the different law appointments our friend mr symon was to be taken in upon some composition  prestongrange smiled these are our friends said he and what were your reasons for dissenting mr david  i told them without concealment expressing however with more force and volume those which regarded prestongrange himself  you do me no more than justice said he i have fought as hard in your interest as you have fought against mine and how came you here today he asked as the case drew out i began to grow uneasy that i had clipped the period so fine and i was even expecting you tomorrow but todayi never dreamed of it  i was not of course going to betray andie  i suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road said i  if i had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer of the bass says he  speaking of which my lord i return your letter and i gave him the enclosure in the counterfeit hand  there was the cover also with the seal said he  i have it not said i it bore naught but the address and could not compromise a cat the second enclosure i have and with your permission i desire to keep it  i thought he winced a little but he said nothing to the point tomorrow he resumed our business here is to be finished and i proceed by glasgow i would be very glad to have you of my party mr david  my lord i began  i do not deny it will be of service to me he interrupted i desire even that when we shall come to edinburgh you should alight at my house you have very warm friends in the miss grants who will be overjoyed to have you to themselves if you think i have been of use to you you can thus easily repay me and so far from losing may reap some advantage by the way it is not every strange young man who is presented in society by the kings advocate  often enough already in our brief relations this gentleman had caused my head to spin no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now here was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with his daughters one of whom had been so good as laugh at me while the other two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence and now i was to ride with my lord to glascow i was to dwell with him in edinburgh i was to be brought into society under his protection that he should have so much goodnature as to forgive me was surprising enough that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible and i began to seek for some ulterior meaning one was plain if i became his guest repentance was excluded i could never think better of my present design and bring any action and besides would not my presence in his house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial for that complaint could not be very seriously regarded if the person chiefly injured was the guest of the official most incriminated as i thought upon this i could not quite refrain from smiling  this is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial said i  you are cunning mr david said he and you do not wholly guess wrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence perhaps however you underrate my friendly sentiments which are perfectly genuine i have a respect for you mr david mingled with awe says he smiling  i am more than willing i am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes said i it is my design to be called to the bar where your lordships countenance would be invaluable and i am besides sincerely grateful to yourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence the difficulty is here there is one point in which we pull two ways you are trying to hang james stewart i am trying to save him in so far as my riding with you would better your lordships defence i am at your lordships orders but in so far as it would help to hang james stewart you see me at a stick  i thought he swore to himself you should certainly be called the bar is the true scene for your talents says he bitterly and then fell a while silent i will tell you he presently resumed there is no question of james stewart for or against james is a dead man his life is given and takenbought if you like it better and sold no memorial can helpno defalcation of a faithful mr david hurt him blow high blow low there will be no pardon for james stewart and take that for said the question is now of myself am i to stand or fall and i do not deny to you that i am in some danger but will mr david balfour consider why it is not because i have pushed the case unduly against james for that i am sure of condonation and it is not because i have sequestered mr david on a rock though it will pass under that colour but because i did not take the ready and plain path to which i was pressed repeatedly and send mr david to his grave or to the gallows hence the scandalhence this damned memorial striking the paper on his leg my tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty i wish to know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you help me out of it  no doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said if james was past helping whom was it more natural that i should turn to help than just the man before me who had helped myself so often and was even now setting me a pattern of patience i was besides not only weary but beginning to be ashamed of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and refusal  if you will name the time and place i will be punctually ready to attend your lordship said i  he shook hands with me and i think my misses have some news for you says he dismissing me  i came away vastly pleased to have my peace made yet a little concerned in conscience nor could i help wondering as i went back whether perhaps i had not been a scruple too goodnatured but there was the fact that this was a man that might have been my father an able man a great dignitary and one that in the hour of my need had reached a hand to my assistance i was in the better humour to enjoy the remainder of that evening which i passed with the advocates in excellent company no doubt but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch for though i went early to bed i have no clear mind of how i got there                                          chapter xviii  the teed ball   on the morrow from the justices private room where none could see me i heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon james the dukes words i am quite sure i have correctly and since that famous passage has been made a subject of dispute i may as well commemorate my version having referred to the year 45 the chief of the campbells sitting as justicegeneral upon the bench thus addressed the unfortunate stewart before him if you had been successful in that rebellion you might have been giving the law where you have now received the judgment of it we who are this day your judges might have been tried before one of your mock courts of judicature and then you might have been satiated with the blood of any name or clan to which you had an aversion  this is to let the cat out of the bag indeed thought i and that was the general impression it was extraordinary how the young advocate lads took hold and made a mock of this speech and how scarce a meal passed but what some one would get in the words and then you might have been satiated many songs were made in that time for the hours diversion and are near all forgot i remember one began      what do ye want the bluid of bluid of       is it a name or is it a clan       or is it an aefauld hielandman     that ye want the bluid of bluid of  another went to my old favourite air the house of airlie and began thus      it fell on a day when argyle was on the bench       that they served him a stewart for his denner  and one of the verses ran      then up and spak the duke and flyted on his cook       i regaird it as a sensible aspersion     that i would sup ava an satiate my maw       with the bluid of ony clan of my aversion  james was as fairly murdered as though the duke had got a fowlingpiece and stalked him so much of course i knew but others knew not so much and were more affected by the items of scandal that came to light in the progress of the cause one of the chief was certainly this sally of the justices it was run hard by another of a juryman who had struck into the midst of colstouns speech for the defence with a pray sir cut it short we are quite weary which seemed the very excess of impudence and simplicity but some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered with an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings one witness was never called his name indeed was printed where it may still be seen on the fourth page of the list james drummond alias macgregor alias james more late tenant in inveronachile and his precognition had been taken as the manner is in writing he had remembered or invented god help him matter which was lead in james stewarts shoes and i saw was like to prove wings to his own this testimony it was highly desirable to bring to the notice of the jury without exposing the man himself to the perils of crossexamination and the way it was brought about was a matter of surprise to all for the paper was handed round like a curiosity in court passed through the jurybox where it did its work and disappeared again as though by accident before it reached the counsel for the prisoner this was counted a most insidious device and that the name of james more should be mingled up with it filled me with shame for catriona and concern for myself  the following day prestongrange and i with a considerable company set out for glasgow where to my impatience we continued to linger some time in a mixture of pleasure and affairs i lodged with my lord with whom i was encouraged to familiarity had my place at entertainments was presented to the chief guests and altogether made more of than i thought accorded either with my parts or station so that on strangers being present i would often blush for prestongrange it must be owned the view i had taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a gloom upon my character i had met many men some of them leaders in israel whether by their birth or talents and who among them all had shown clean hands as for the browns and millers i had seen their selfseeking i could never again respect them prestongrange was the best yet he had saved me had spared me rather when others had it in their minds to murder me outright but the blood of james lay at his door and i thought his present dissimulation with myself a thing below pardon that he should affect to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me out of my patience i would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow fire of anger in my bowels ah friend friend i would think to myself if you were but through with this affair of the memorial would you not kick me in the streets here i did him as events have proved the most foul injustice and i think he was at once far more sincere and a far more artful performer than i supposed  but i had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that court of young advocates that hung about him in the hope of patronage the sudden favour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at first out of measure but two days were not gone by before i found myself surrounded with flattery and attention i was the same young man and neither better nor bonnier that they had rejected a month before and now there was no civility too fine for me the same do i say it was not so and the byname by which i went behind my back confirmed it seeing me so firm with the advocate and persuaded that i was to fly high and far they had taken a word from the golfing green and called me the teed ball14 i was told i was now one of themselves i was to taste of their soft lining who had already made my own experience of the roughness of the outer husk and the one to whom i had been presented in hope park was so assured as even to remind me of that meeting i told him i had not the pleasure of remembering it  why says he it was miss grant herself presented me my name is soandso  it may very well be sir said i but i have kept no mind of it  at which he desisted and in the midst of the disgust that commonly overflowed my spirits i had a glisk of pleasure  but i have not patience to dwell upon that time at length when i was in company with these young politics i was borne down with shame for myself and my own plain ways and scorn for them and their duplicity of the two evils i thought prestongrange to be the least and while i was always as stiff as buckram to the young bloods i made rather a dissimulation of my hard feelings towards the advocate and was in old mr campbells word soople to the laird himself commented on the difference and bid me be more of my age and make friends with my young comrades  i told him i was slow of making friends  i will take the word back said he but there is such a thing as fair gude een and fair gude day mr david these are the same young men with whom you are to pass your days and get through life your backwardness has a look of arrogance and unless you can assume a little more lightness of manner i fear you will meet difficulties in the path  it will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sows ear said i  on the morning of october 1st i was awakened by the clattering in of an express and getting to my window almost before he had dismounted i saw the messenger had ridden hard somewhile after i was called to prestongrange where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap with his letters around him  mr david said he i have a piece of news for you it concerns some friends of yours of whom i sometimes think you are a little ashamed for you have never referred to their existence  i suppose i blushed  i see you understand since you make the answering signal said he and i must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty but do you know mr david this seems to me a very enterprising lass she crops up from every side the government of scotland appears unable to proceed for mistress katrine drummond which was somewhat the case no great while back with a certain mr david balfour should not these make a good match her first intromission in politicsbut i must not tell you that story the authorities have decided you are to hear it otherwise and from a livelier narrator this new example is more serious however and i am afraid i must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in prison  i cried out  yes said he the little lady is in prison but i would not have you to despair unless you with your friends and memorials shall procure my downfall she is to suffer nothing  but what has she done what is her offence i cried  it might be almost construed a high treason he returned for she has broke the kings castle of edinburgh  the lady is much my friend i said i know you would not work me if the thing were serious  and yet it is serious in a sense said he for this rogue of a katrineor cateran as we may call herhas set adrift again upon the world that very doubtful character her papa  here was one of my previsions justified james more was once again at liberty he had lent his men to keep me a prisoner he had volunteered his testimony in the appin case and the same no matter by what subterfuge had been employed to influence the jury now came his reward and he was free it might please the authorities to give to it the colour of an escape but i knew betteri knew it was the fulfilment of a bargain the same course of thought relieved me of the least alarm for catriona she might be thought to have broke prison for her father she might have believed so herself but the chief hand in the whole business was that of prestongrange and i was sure so far from letting her come to punishment he would not suffer her to be even tried whereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation  ah i was expecting that  you have at times a great deal of discretion too says prestongrange  and what is my lord pleased to mean by that i asked  i was just marvelling he replied that being so clever as to draw these inferences you should not be clever enough to keep them to yourself but i think you would like to hear the details of the affair i have received two versions and the least official is the more full and far the more entertaining being from the lively pen of my eldest daughter here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work she writes and what would make the thing more noted if it were only known the malefactor is a protégée of his lordship my papa i am sure your heart is too much in your duty if it were nothing else to have forgotten grey eyes what does she do but get a broad hat with the flaps open a long hairylike mans greatcoat and a big gravatt kilt her coats up to gude kens whaur clap two pair of boothose upon her legs take a pair of clouted brogues15 in her hand and off to the castle here she gives herself out to be a soutar16 in the employ of james more and gets admitted to his cell the lieutenant who seems to have been full of pleasantry making sport among his soldiers of the soutars greatcoat presently they hear disputation and the sound of blows inside out flies the cobbler his coat flying the flaps of his hat beat about his face and the lieutenant and his soldiers mock at him as he runs off they laughed not so hearty the next time they had occasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall pretty greyeyed lass in the female habit as for the cobbler he was over the hills ayont dumblane and its thought that poor scotland will have to console herself without him i drank catrionas health this night in public indeed the whole town admires her and i think the beaux would wear bits of her garters in their buttonholes if they could only get them i would have gone to visit her in prison too only i remembered in time i was papas daughter so i wrote her a billet instead which i entrusted to the faithful doig and i hope you will admit i can be political when i please the same faithful gomeral is to despatch this letter by the express along with those of the wiseacres so that you may hear tom fool in company with solomon talking of gomerals do tell dauvit balfour i would i could see the face of him at the thought of a longlegged lass in such a predicament to say nothing of the levities of your affectionate daughter and his respectful friend so my rascal signs herself continued prestongrange and you see mr david it is quite true what i tell you that my daughters regard you with the most affectionate playfulness   the gomeral is much obliged said i  and was not this prettily done he went on is not this highland maid a piece of a heroine  i was always sure she had a great heart said i and i wager she guessed nothing but i beg your pardon this is to tread upon forbidden subjects  i will go bail she did not he returned quite openly i will go bail she thought she was flying straight into king georges face  remembrance of catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity moved me strangely i could see that even prestongrange admired and could not withhold his lips from smiling when he considered her behaviour as for miss grant for all her ill habit of mockery her admiration shone out plain a kind of a heat came on me  i am not your lordships daughter i began  that i know of he put in smiling  i speak like a fool said i or rather i began wrong it would doubtless be unwise in mistress grant to go to her in prison but for me i think i would look like a halfhearted friend if i did not fly there instantly  soho mr david says he i thought that you and i were in a bargain  my lord i said when i made that bargain i was a good deal affected by your goodness but ill never can deny that i was moved besides by my own interest there was selfseeking in my heart and i think shame of it now it may be for your lordships safety to say this fashious davie balfour is your friend and housemate say it then ill never contradict you but as for your patronage i give it all back i ask but the one thinglet me go and give me a pass to see her in her prison  he looked at me with a hard eye you put the cart before the horse i think says he that which i had given was a portion of my liking which your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked but for my patronage it is not given nor to be exact is it yet offered he paused a bit and i warn you you do not know yourself he added youth is a hasty season you will think better of all this before a year  well and i would like to be that kind of youth i cried i have seen too much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me and i have seen it in the old ones also they are all for byends the whole clan of them its this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordships liking why would i think that you would like me but ye told me yourself ye had an interest  i stopped at this confounded that i had run so far he was observing me with a unfathomable face  my lord i ask your pardon i resumed i have nothing in my chafts but a rough country tongue i think it would be only decentlike if i would go to see my friend in her captivity but im owing you my life ill never forget that andif its for your lordships good here ill stay thats barely gratitude  this might have been reached in fewer words says prestongrange grimly it is easy and it is at times gracious to say a plain scots ay  ah but my lord i think ye take me not yet entirely cried i for your sake for my lifesafe and the kindness that ye say ye bear to mefor these ill consent but not for any good that might be coming to myself if i stand aside when this young maid is in her trial its a thing i will be noways advantaged by i will lose by it i will never gain i would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that foundation  he was a minute serious then smiled you mind me of the man with the long nose said he was you to look at the moon by a telescope you would see david balfour there but you shall have your way of it i will ask at you one service and then set you free my clerks are overdriven be so good as copy me these few pages says he visibly swithering among some huge rolls of manuscripts and when that is done i shall bid you god speed i would never charge myself with mr davids conscience and if you could cast some part of it as you went by in a moss hag you would find yourself to ride much easier without it  perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though my lord says i  and you shall have the last word too cries he gaily  indeed he had some cause for gaiety having now found the means to gain his purpose to lessen the weight of the memorial or to have a readier answer at his hand he desired i should appear publicly in the character of his intimate but if i were to appear with the same publicity as a visitor to catriona in her prison the world would scarce stint to draw conclusions and the true nature of james mores escape must become evident to all this was the little problem i had set him of a sudden and to which he had so briskly found an answer i was to be tethered in glasgow by that job of copying which in mere outward decency i could not well refuse and during these hours of my employment catriona was privately got rid of i think shame to write of this man that loaded me with so many goodnesses he was kind to me as any father yet i ever thought him as false as a cracked bell                                          chapter xix  i am much in the hands of the ladies   the copying was a weary business the more so as i perceived very early there was no sort of urgency in the matters treated and began very early to consider my employment a pretext i had no sooner finished than i got to horse used what remained of daylight to the best purpose and being at last fairly benighted slept in a house by almondwater side i was in the saddle again before the day and the edinburgh booths were just opening when i clattered in by the west bow and drew up a smoking horse at my lord advocates door i had a written word for doig my lords private hand that was thought to be in all his secrets a worthy little plain man all fat and snuff and selfsufficiency him i found already at his desk and already bedabbled with maccabaw in the same anteroom where i rencountered with james more he read the note scrupulously through like a chapter in his bible  hm says he ye come a wee thing ahinthand mr balfour the birds flaen we hae letten her out  miss drummond is set free i cried  achy said he what would we keep her for ye ken to hae made a steer about the bairn would hae pleased naebody  and wherell she be now says i  gude kens says doig with a shrug  shell have gone home to lady allardyce im thinking said i  thatll be it said he  then ill gang there straight says i  but yell be for a bite or ye go said he  neither bite nor sup said i i had a good waucht of milk in by ratho  aweel aweel says doig but yell can leave your horse here and your bags for it seems were to have your upput  na na said i tamsons mear17 would never be the thing for me this day of all days  doig speaking somewhat broad i had been led by imitation into an accent much more countrified than i was usually careful to affect a good deal broader indeed than i have written it down and i was the more ashamed when another voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a ballad      gae saddle me the bonny black       gae saddle sune and mak him ready     for i will down the gatehopeslack       and a to see my bonny leddy  the young lady when i turned to her stood in a morning gown and her hands muffled in the same as if to hold me at a distance yet i could not but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me  my best respects to you mistress grant said i bowing  the like to yourself mr david she replied with a deep courtesy and i beg to remind you of an old musty saw that meat and mass never hindered man the mass i cannot afford you for we are all good protestants but the meat i press on your attention and i would not wonder but i could find something for your private ear that would be worth the stopping for  mistress grant said i i believe i am already your debtor for some merry wordsand i think they were kind tooon a piece of unsigned paper  unsigned paper says she and made a droll face which was likewise wondrous beautiful as of one trying to remember  or else i am the more deceived i went on but to be sure we shall have the time to speak of these since your father is so good as to make me for a while your inmate and the gomeral begs you at this time only for the favour of his liberty  you give yourself hard names said she  mr doig and i would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen says i  once more i have to admire the discretion of all menfolk she replied but if you will not eat off with you at once you will be back the sooner for you go on a fools errand off with you mr david she continued opening the door      he has lowpen on his bonny grey       he rade the richt gate and the ready     i trow he would neither stint nor stay       far he was seeking his bonny leddy  i did not wait to be twice bidden and did justice to miss grants citation on the way to dean  old lady allardyce walked there alone in the garden in her hat and mutch and having a silvermounted staff of some black wood to lean upon as i alighted from my horse and drew near to her with congees i could see the blood come in her face and her head fling into the air like what i had conceived of empresses  what brings you to my poor door she cried speaking high through her nose i cannot bar it the males of my house are dead and buried i have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me any beggar can pluck me by the baird18and a baird there is and thats the worst of it yet she added partly to herself  i was extremely put out at this reception and the last remark which seemed like a daft wifes left me near hand speechless  i see i have fallen under your displeasure maam said i yet i will still be so bold as ask after mistress drummond  she considered me with a burning eye her lips pressed close together into twenty creases her hand shaking on her staff this cows all she cried ye come to me to spier for her would god i knew  she is not here i cried  she threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me so that i fell back incontinent  out upon your leeing throat she cried what ye come and spier at me shes in jyle whaur ye took her tothats all there is to it and of a the beings ever i beheld in breeks to think it should be you ye timmer scounrel if i had a male left to my name i would have your jaicket dustit till ye raired  i thought it not good to delay longer in that place because i remarked her passion to be rising as i turned to the horsepost she even followed me and i make no shame to confess that i rode away with the one stirrup on and scrambling for the other  as i knew no other quarter where i could push my inquiries there was nothing left me but to return to the advocates i was well received by the four ladies who were now in company together and must give the news of prestongrange and what word went in the west country at the most inordinate length and with great weariness to myself while all the time that young lady with whom i so much desired to be alone again observed me quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience at last after i had endured a meal with them and was come very near the point of appealing for an interview before her aunt she went and stood by the music case and picking out a tune sang to it on a high keyhe that will not when he may when he will he shall have nay but this was the end of her rigours and presently after making some excuse of which i have no mind she carried me away in private to her fathers library i should not fail to say that she was dressed to the nines and appeared extraordinary handsome  now mr david sit ye down here and let us have a twohanded crack said she for i have much to tell you and it appears besides that i have been grossly unjust to your good taste  in what manner mistress grant i asked i trust i have never seemed to fail in due respect  i will be your surety mr david said she your respect whether to yourself or your poor neighbours has been always and most fortunately beyond imitation but that is by the question you got a note from me she asked  i was so bold as to suppose so upon inference said i and it was kindly thought upon  it must have prodigiously surprised you said she but let us begin with the beginning you have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so kind as to escort three very tedious misses to hope park i have the less cause to forget it myself because you was so particular obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles of the latin grammar a thing which wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude  i fear i was sadly pedantical said i overcome with confusion at the memory you are only to consider i am quite unused with the society of ladies  i will say the less about the grammar then she replied but how came you to desert your charge he has thrown her out overboard his ain dear annie she hummed and his ain dear annie and her two sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese it seems you returned to my papas where you showed yourself excessively martial and then on to realms unknown with an eye it appears to the bass rock solan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses  through all this raillery there was something indulgent in the ladys eye which made me suppose there might be better coming  you take a pleasure to torment me said i and i make a very feckless plaything but let me ask you to be more merciful at this time there is but the one thing that i care to hear of and that will be news of catriona  do you call her by that name to her face mr balfour she asked  in troth and i am not very sure i stammered  i would not do so in any case to strangers said miss grant and why are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady  i heard she was in prison said i  well and now you hear that she is out of it she replied and what more would you have she has no need of any further champion  i may have the greater need of her maam said i  come this is better says miss grant but look me fairly in the face am i not bonnier than she  i would be the last to be denying it said i there is not your marrow in all scotland  well here you have the pick of the two at your hand and must needs speak of the other said she this is never the way to please the ladies mr balfour  but mistress said i there are surely other things besides mere beauty  by which i am to understand that i am no better than i should be perhaps she asked  by which you will please understand that i am like the cock in the midden in the fable book said i i see the braw jeweland i like fine to see it toobut i have more need of the pickle corn  bravissimo she cried there is a word well said at last and i will reward you for it with my story that same night of your desertion i came late from a friends housewhere i was excessively admired whatever you may think of itand what should i hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me she had been there an hour or better said the servantlass and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting i went to her direct she rose as i came in and i knew her at a look grey eyes says i to myself but was more wise than to let on you will be miss grant at last she says rising and looking at me hard and pitiful ay it was true he said you are bonny at all eventsthe way god made me my dear i said but i would be gey and obliged if ye could tell me what brought you here at such a time of the nightlady she said we are kinsfolk we are both come of the blood of the sons of alpinmy dear i replied i think no more of alpin or his sons than what i do of a kalestock you have a better argument in these tears upon your bonny face and at that i was so weakminded as to kiss her which is what you would like to do dearly and i wager will never find the courage of i say it was weakminded of me for i knew no more of her than the outside but it was the wisest stroke i could have hit upon she is a very staunch brave nature but i think she has been little used with tenderness and at that caress though to say the truth it was but lightly given her heart went out to me i will never betray the secrets of my sex mr davie i will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb because it is the same she will use to twist yourself ay it is a fine lass she is as clean as hill well water  she is eent i cried  well then she told me her concerns pursued miss grant and in what a swither she was in about her papa and what a taking about yourself with very little cause and in what a perplexity she had found herself after you was gone away and then i minded at long last says she that we were kinswomen and that mr david should have given you the name of the bonniest of the bonny and i was thinking to myself if she is so bonny she will be good at all events and i took up my foot soles out of that that was when i forgave yourself mr davie when you was in my society you seemed upon hot iron by all marks if ever i saw a young man that wanted to be gone it was yourself and i and my two sisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from and now it appeared you had given me some notice in the bygoing and was so kind as to comment on my attractions from that hour you may date our friendship and i began to think with tenderness upon the latin grammar  you will have many hours to rally me in said i and i think besides you do yourself injustice i think it was catriona turned your heart in my direction she is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of her friend  i would not like to wager upon that mr david said she the lasses have clear eyes but at least she is your friend entirely as i was to see i carried her in to his lordship my papa and his advocacy being in a favourable stage of claret was so good as to receive the pair of us here is grey eyes that you have been deaved with these days past said i she is come to prove that we spoke true and i lay the prettiest lass in the three lothians at your feetmaking a papistical reservation of myself she suited her action to my words down she went upon her knees to himi would not like to swear but he saw two of her which doubtless made her appeal the more irresistible for you are all a pack of mahomedanstold him what had passed that night and how she had withheld her fathers man from following of you and what a case she was in about her father and what a flutter for yourself and begged with weeping for the lives of both of you neither of which was in the slightest danger till i vow i was proud of my sex because it was done so pretty and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion she had not gone far i assure you before the advocate was wholly sober to see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of his daughters but we took him in hand the pair of us and brought that matter straight properly managedand that means managed by methere is no one to compare with my papa  he has been a good man to me said i  well he was a good man to katrine and i was there to see to it said she  and she pled for me said i  she did that and very movingly said miss grant i would not like to tell you what she said i find you vain enough already  god reward her for it cried i  with mr david balfour i suppose says she  you do me too much injustice at the last i cried i would tremble to think of her in such hard hands do you think i would presume because she begged my life she would do that for a new whelped puppy i have had more than that to set me up if you but kend she kissed that hand of mine ay but she did and why because she thought i was playing a brave part and might be going to my death it was not for my sake but i need not be telling that to you that cannot look at me without laughter it was for the love of what she thought was bravery i believe there is none but me and poor prince charlie had that honour done them was this not to make a god of me and do you not think my heart would quake when i remember it  i do laugh at you a good deal and a good deal more than is quite civil said she but i will tell you one thing if you speak to her like that you have some glimmerings of a chance  me i cried i would never dare i can speak to you miss grant because its a matter of indifference what ye think of me but her no fear said i  i think you have the largest feet in all broad scotland says she  troth they are no very small said i looking down  ah poor catriona cried miss grant  and i could but stare upon her for though i now see very well what she was driving at and perhaps some justification for the same i was never swift at the uptake in such flimsy talk  ah well mr david she said it goes sore against my conscience but i see i shall have to be your speaking board she shall know you came to her straight upon the news of her imprisonment she shall know you would not pause to eat and of your conversation she shall hear just so much as i think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience believe me you will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself for i will keep the big feet out of the platter  you know where she is then i exclaimed  that i do mr david and will never tell said she  why that i asked  well she said i am a good friend as you will soon discover and the chief of those that i am a friend to is my papa i assure you you will never heat nor melt me out of that so you may spare me your sheeps eyes and adieu to your davidbalfourship for the now  but there is yet one thing more i cried there is one thing that must be stopped being mere ruin to herself and to me too  well she said be brief i have spent half the day on you already  my lady allardyce believes i began she supposesshe thinks that i abducted her  the colour came into miss grants face so that at first i was quite abashed to find her ear so delicate till i bethought me she was struggling rather with mirth a notion in which i was altogether confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied  i will take up the defence of your reputation said she you may leave it in my hands  and with that she withdrew out of the library                                          chapter xx  i continue to move in good society   for about exactly two months i remained a guest in prestongranges family where i bettered my acquaintance with the bench the bar and the flower of edinburgh company you are not to suppose my education was neglected on the contrary i was kept extremely busy i studied the french so as to be more prepared to go to leyden i set myself to the fencing and wrought hard sometimes three hours in the day with notable advancement at the suggestion of my cousin pilrig who was an apt musician i was put to a singing class and by the orders of my miss grant to one for the dancing at which i must say i proved far from ornamental however all were good enough to say it gave me an address a little more genteel and there is no question but i learned to manage my coat skirts and sword with more dexterity and to stand in a room as though the same belonged to me my clothes themselves were all earnestly reordered and the most trifling circumstance such as where i should tie my hair or the colour of my ribbon debated among the three misses like a thing of weight one way with another no doubt i was a good deal improved to look at and acquired a bit of a modish air that would have surprised the good folks at essendean  the two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my habiliment because that was in the line of their chief thoughts i cannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my presence and though always more than civil with a kind of heartless cordiality could not hide how much i wearied them as for the aunt she was a wonderful still woman and i think she gave me much the same attention as she gave the rest of the family which was little enough the eldest daughter and the advocate himself were thus my principal friends and our familiarity was much increased by a pleasure that we took in common before the court met we spent a day or two at the house of grange living very nobly with an open table and here it was that we three began to ride out together in the fields a practice afterwards maintained in edinburgh so far as the advocates continual affairs permitted when we were put in a good frame by the briskness of the exercise the difficulties of the way or the accidents of bad weather my shyness wore entirely off we forgot that we were strangers and speech not being required it flowed the more naturally on then it was that they had my story from me bit by bit from the time that i left essendean with my voyage and battle in the covenant wanderings in the heather etc and from the interest they found in my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a little later on a day when the courts were not sitting and of which i will tell a trifle more at length  we took horse early and passed first by the house of shaws where it stood smokeless in a great field of white frost for it was yet early in the day here prestongrange alighted down gave me his horse and proceeded alone to visit my uncle my heart i remember swelled up bitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of the old miser sitting chittering within in the cold kitchen  there is my home said i and my family  poor david balfour said miss grant  what passed during the visit i have never heard but it would doubtless not be very agreeable to ebenezer for when the advocate came forth again his face was dark  i think you will soon be the laird indeed mr davie says he turning half about with the one foot in the stirrup  i will never pretend sorrow said i and to say the truth during his absence miss grant and i had been embellishing the place in fancy with plantations parterres and a terrace much as i have since carried out in fact  thence we pushed to the queensferry where rankeillor gave us a good welcome being indeed out of the body to receive so great a visitor here the advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go quite fully over my affairs sitting perhaps two hours with the writer in his study and expressing i was told a great esteem for myself and concern for my fortunes to while this time miss grant and i and young rankeillor took boat and passed the hope to limekilns rankeillor made himself very ridiculous and i thought offensive with his admiration for the young lady and to my wonder only it is so common a weakness of her sex she seemed if anything to be a little gratified one use it had for when we were come to the other side she laid her commands on him to mind the boat while she and i passed a little further to the alehouse this was her own thought for she had been taken with my account of alison hastie and desired to see the lass herself we found her once more aloneindeed i believe her father wrought all day in the fieldsand she curtsied dutifully to the gentryfolk and the beautiful young lady in the riding coat  is this all the welcome i am to get said i holding out my hand and have you no more memory of old friends  keep me whas this of it she cried and then gods truth its the tautit19 laddie  the very same says i  monys the time ive thocht upon you and your freen and blythe am i to see in your braws20 she cried though i kent ye were come to your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that i thank ye for with a my heart  there said miss grant to me run out by with ye like a good bairn i didnae come here to stand and hand a candle its her and me that are to crack  i suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house but when she came forth i observed two thingsthat her eyes were reddened and a silver brooch was gone out of her bosom this very much affected me  i never saw you so well adorned said i  o davie man dinna be a pompous gowk said she and was more than usually sharp to me the remainder of the day  about candlelight we came home from this excursion  for a good while i heard nothing further of catriona my miss grant remaining quite impenetrable and stopping my mouth with pleasantries at last one day that she returned from walking and found me alone in the parlour over my french i thought there was something unusual in her looks the colour heightened the eyes sparkling high and a bit of a smile continually bitten in as she regarded me she seemed indeed like the very spirit of mischief and walking briskly in the room had soon involved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and at the least with nothing intended on my side i was like christian in the slough the more i tried to clamber out upon the side the deeper i became involved until at last i heard her declare with a great deal of passion that she would take that answer at the hands of none and i must down upon my knees for pardon  the causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile i have said nothing you can properly object to said i and as for my knees that is an attitude i keep for god  and as a goddess i am to be served she cried shaking her brown locks at me and with a bright colour every man that comes within waft of my petticoats shall use me so  i will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashions sake although i vow i know not why i replied but for these playacting postures you can go to others  o davie she said not if i was to beg you  i bethought me i was fighting with a woman which is the same as to say a child and that upon a point entirely formal  i think it a bairnly thing i said not worthy in you to ask or me to render yet i will not refuse you neither said i and the stain if there be any rests with yourself and at that i kneeled fairly down  there she cried there is the proper station there is where i have been manoeuvring to bring you and then suddenly kep21 said she flung me a folded billet and ran from the apartment laughing  the billet had neither place nor date dear mr david it began i get your news continually by my cousin miss grant and it is a pleisand hearing i am very well in a good place among good folk but necessitated to be quite private though i am hoping that at long last we may meet again all your friendships have been told me by my loving cousin who loves us both she bids me to send you this writing and oversees the same i will be asking you to do all her commands and rest your affectionate friend catriona macgregordrummond pswill you not see my cousin allardyce  i think it not the least brave of my campaigns as the soldiers say that i should have done as i was here bidden and gone forthright to the house by dean but the old lady was now entirely changed and supple as a glove by what means miss grant had brought this round i could never guess i am sure at least she dared not to appear openly in the affair for her papa was compromised in it pretty deep it was he indeed who had persuaded catriona to leave or rather not to return to her cousins placing her instead with a family of gregorys decent people quite at the advocates disposition and in whom she might have the more confidence because they were of her own clan and family these kept her private till all was ripe heated and helped her to attempt her fathers rescue and after she was discharged from prison received her again into the same secrecy thus prestongrange obtained and used his instrument nor did there leak out the smallest word of his acquaintance with the daughter of james more there was some whispering of course upon the escape of that discredited person but the government replied by a show of rigour one of the cell porters was flogged the lieutenant of the guard my poor friend duncansby was broken of his rank and as for catriona all men were well enough pleased that her fault should be passed by in silence  i could never induce miss grant to carry back an answer no she would say when i persisted i am going to keep the big feet out of the platter this was the more hard to bear as i was aware she saw my little friend many times in the week and carried her my news whenever as she said i had behaved myself at last she treated me to what she called an indulgence and i thought rather more of a banter she was certainly a strong almost a violent friend to all she liked chief among whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman very blind and very witty who dwelt in the top of a tall land on a strait close with a nest of linnets in a cage and thronged all day with visitors miss grant was very fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend with the narrative of my misfortunes and miss tibbie ramsay that was her name was particular kind and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge of old folks and past affairs in scotland i should say that from her chamber window and not three feet away such is the straitness of that close it was possible to look into a barred loophole lighting the stairway of the opposite house  here upon some pretext miss grant left me one day alone with miss ramsay i mind i thought that lady inattentive and like one preoccupied i was besides yery uncomfortable for the window contrary to custom was left open and the day was cold all at once the voice of miss grant sounded in my ears as from a distance  here shaws she cried keek out of the window and see what i have broughten you  i think it was the prettiest sight that ever i beheld the well of the close was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly the walls very black and dingy and there from the barred loophole i saw two faces smiling across at memiss grants and catrionas  there says miss grant i wanted her to see you in your braws like the lass of limekilns i wanted her to see what i could make of you when i buckled to the job in earnest  it came in my mind she had been more than common particular that day upon my dress and i think that some of the same care had been bestowed upon catriona for so merry and sensible a lady miss grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds  catriona was all i could get out  as for her she said nothing in the world but only waved her hand and smiled to me and was suddenly carried away again from before the loophole  the vision was no sooner lost than i ran to the house door where i found i was locked in thence back to miss ramsay crying for the key but might as well have cried upon the castle rock she had passed her word she said and i must be a good lad it was impossible to burst the door even if it had been mannerly it was impossible i should leap from the window being seven storeys above ground all i could do was to crane over the close and watch for their reappearance from the stair it was little to see being no more than the tops of their two heads each on a ridiculous bobbin of skirts like to a pair of pincushions nor did catriona so much as look up for a farewell being prevented as i heard afterwards by miss grant who told her folk were never seen to less advantage than from above downward  on the way home as soon as i was set free i upbraided miss grant with her cruelty  i am sorry you was disappointed says she demurely for my part i was very pleased you looked better than i dreaded you lookedif it will not make you vaina mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the window you are to remember that she could not see your feet says she with the manner of one reassuring me  o cried i leave my feet be they are no bigger than my neighbors  they are even smaller than some said she but i speak in parables like a hebrew prophet  i marvel little they were sometimes stoned says i but you miserable girl how could you do it why should you care to tantalise me with a moment  love is like folk says she it needs some kind of vivers22  o barbara let me see her properly i pleaded you can you see her when you please let me have half an hour  who is it that is managing this love affair you or me she asked and as i continued to press her with my instances fell back upon a deadly expedient that of imitating the tones of my voice when i called on catriona by name with which indeed she held me in subjection for some days to follow  there was never the least word heard of the memorial or none by me prestongrange and his grace the lord president may have heard of it for what i know on the deafest sides of their heads they kept it to themselves at least the public was none the wiser and in course of time on november 8th and in the midst of a prodigious storm of wind and rain poor james of the glens was duly hanged at lettermore by balachulish  so there was the final upshot of my politics innocent men have perished before james and are like to keep on perishing in spite of all our wisdom till the end of time and till the end of time young folk who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and men will struggle as i did and make heroical resolves and take long risks and the course of events will push them upon the one side and go on like a marching army james was hanged and here was i dwelling in the house of prestongrange and grateful to him for his fatherly attention he was hanged and behold when i met mr symon in the causeway i was fain to pull off my beaver to him like a good little boy before his dominie he had been hanged by fraud and violence and the world wagged along and there was not a pennyweight of difference and the villains of that horrid plot were decent kind respectable fathers of families who went to kirk and took the sacrament  but i had had my view of that detestable business they call politicsi had seen it from behind when it is all bones and blackness and i was cured for life of any temptations to take part in it again a plain quiet private path was that which i was ambitious to walk in when i might keep my head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of the road of temptation for upon a retrospect it appeared i had not done so grandly after all but with the greatest possible amount of big speech and preparation had accomplished nothing  the 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from leith and i was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for leyden to prestongrange i could of course say nothing for i had already been a long while sorning on his house and table but with his daughter i was more open bewailing my fate that i should be sent out of the country and assuring her unless she should bring me to farewell with catriona i would refuse at the last hour  have i not given you my advice she asked  i know you have said i and i know how much i am beholden to you already and that i am bidden to obey your orders but you must confess you are something too merry a lass at times to lippen23 to entirely  i will tell you then said she be you on board at nine oclock forenoon the ship does not sail before one keep your boat alongside and if you are not pleased with my farewells when i shall send them you can come ashore again and seek katrine for yourself  since i could make no more of her i was fain to be content with this  the day came round at last when she and i were to separate we had been extremely intimate and familiar i was much in her debt and what way we were to part was a thing that put me from my sleep like the vails i was to give to the domestic servants i knew she considered me too backward and rather desired to rise in her opinion on that head besides which after so much affection shown and i believe felt upon both sides it would have looked coldlike to be anyways stiff accordingly i got my courage up and my words ready and the last chance we were like to be alone asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell  you forget yourself strangely mr balfour said she i cannot call to mind that i had given you any right to presume on our acquaintancy  i stood before her like a stopped clock and knew not what to think far less to say when of a sudden she cast her arms about my neck and kissed me with the best will in the world  you inimitable bairn she cried did you think that i would let us part like strangers because i can never keep my gravity at you five minutes on end you must not dream i do not love you very well i am all love and laughter every time i cast an eye on you and now i will give you an advice to conclude your education which you will have need of before its very long never ask womenfolk theyre bound to answer no god never made the lass that could resist the temptation its supposed by divines to be the curse of eve because she did not say it when the devil offered her the apple her daughters can say nothing else  since i am so soon to lose my bonny professor i began  this is gallant indeed says she curtseying  i would put the one question i went on may i ask a lass to marry me  you think you could not marry her without she asked or else get her to offer  you see you cannot be serious said i  i shall be very serious in one thing david said she i shall always be your friend  as i got to my horse the next morning the four ladies were all at the same window whence we had once looked down on catriona and all cried farewell and waved their pocket napkins as i rode away one out of the four i knew was truly sorry and at the thought of that and how i had come to the door three months ago for the first time sorrow and gratitude made a confusion in my mind                                          part ii  father and daughter                                        chapter xxi  the voyage into holland   the ship lay at a single anchor well outside the pier of leith so that all we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs this was very little troublesome for the reason that the day was a flat calm very frosty and cloudy and with a low shifting fog upon the water the body of the vessel was thus quite hid as i drew near but the tall spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire she proved to be a very roomy commodious merchant but somewhat blunt in the bows and loaden extraordinary deep with salt salted salmon and fine white linen stockings for the dutch upon my coming on board the captain welcomed me one sang out of lesmahago i believe a very hearty friendly tarpauling of a man but at the moment in rather of a bustle there had no other of the passengers yet appeared so that i was left to walk about upon the deck viewing the prospect and wondering a good deal what these farewells should be which i was promised  all edinburgh and the pentland hills glinted above me in a kind of smuisty brightness now and again overcome with blots of cloud of leith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible and on the face of the water where the haar24 lay nothing at all out of this i was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling and a little after as if out of the smoke of a fire a boat issued there sat a grave man in the stern sheets well muffled from the cold and by his side a tall pretty tender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand i had scarce the time to catch my breath in and be ready to meet her as she stepped upon the deck smiling and making my best bow which was now vastly finer than some months before when i first made it to her ladyship no doubt we were both a good deal changed she seemed to have shot up taller like a young comely tree she had now a kind of pretty backwardness that became her well as of one that regarded herself more highly and was fairly woman and for another thing the hand of the same magician had been at work upon the pair of us and miss grant had made us both braw if she could make but the one bonny  the same cry in words not very different came from both of us that the other was come in compliment to say farewell and then we perceived in a flash we were to ship together  o why will not baby have been telling me she cried and then remembered a letter she had been given on the condition of not opening it till she was well on board within was an enclosure for myself and ran thus        dear daviewhat do you think of my farewell and what      do you say to your fellowpassenger did you kiss or did you      ask i was about to have signed here but that would leave the      purport of my question doubtful and in my own case i ken the      answer so fill up here with good advice do not be too      blate25      and for gods sake do not try to be too forward nothing sets      you      worse i am       your affectionate friend and governess       barbara grant   i wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my pocketbook put it in with another scratch from catriona sealed the whole with my new signet of the balfour arms and despatched it by the hand of prestongranges servant that still waited in my boat  then we had time to look upon each other more at leisure which we had not done for a piece of a minute before upon a common impulse we shook hands again  catriona said i it seemed that was the first and last word of my eloquence  you will be glad to see me again says she  and i think that is an idle word said i we are too deep friends to make speech upon such trifles  is she not the girl of all the world she cried again i was never knowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful  and yet she cared no more for alpin than what she did for a kalestock said i  ah she will say so indeed cries catriona yet it was for the name and the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good to me  well i will tell you why it was said i there are all sorts of peoples faces in this world there is barbaras face that everyone must look at and admire and think her a fine brave merry girl and then there is your face which is quite different i never knew how different till today you cannot see yourself and that is why you do not understand but it was for the love of your face that she took you up and was so good to you and everybody in the world would do the same  everybody says she  every living soul said i  ah then that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up she cried  barbara has been teaching you to catch me said i  she will have taught me more than that at all events she will have taught me a great deal about mr davidall the ill of him and a little that was not so ill either now and then she said smiling she will have told me all there was of mr david only just that he would sail upon this very same ship and why is it you go  i told her  ah well said she we will be some days in company and then i suppose goodbye for altogether i go to meet my father at a place of the name of helvoetsluys and from there to france to be exiles by the side of our chieftain  i could say no more than just o the name of james more always drying up my very voice  she was quick to perceive it and to guess some portion of my thought  there is one thing i must be saying first of all mr david said she i think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether very well and the one of them two is james more my father and the other is the laird of prestongrange prestongrange will have spoken by himself or his daughter in the place of him but for james more my father i have this much to say he lay shackled in a prison he is a plain honest soldier and a plain highland gentleman what they would be after he never would be guessing but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice to a young gentleman like yourself he would have died first and for the sake of all your friendships i will be asking you to pardon my father and family for that same mistake  catriona said i what that mistake was i do not care to know i know but the one thing that you went to prestongrange and begged my life upon your knees o i ken well it was for your father that you went but when you were there you pleaded for me also it is a thing i cannot speak of there are two things i cannot think of in to myself and the one is your good words when you called yourself my little friend and the other that you pleaded for my life let us never speak more we two of pardon or offence  we stood after that silent catriona looking on the deck and i on her and before there was more speech a little wind having sprung up in the norwest they began to shake out the sails and heave in upon the anchor  there were six passengers besides our two selves which made of it a full cabin three were solid merchants out of leith kirkaldy and dundee all engaged in the same adventure into high germany one was a hollander returning the rest worthy merchants wives to the charge of one of whom catriona was recommended mrs grebbie for that was her name was by great good fortune heavily incommoded by the sea and lay day and night on the broad of her back we were besides the only creatures at all young on board the rose except a whitefaced boy that did my old duty to attend upon the table and it came about that catriona and i were left almost entirely to ourselves we had the next seats together at the table where i waited on her with extraordinary pleasure on deck i made her a soft place with my cloak and the weather being singularly fine for that season with bright frosty days and nights a steady gentle wind and scarce a sheet started all the way through the north sea we sat there only now and again walking to and fro for warmth from the first blink of the sun till eight or nine at night under the clear stars the merchants or captain sang would sometimes glance and smile upon us or pass a merry word or two and give us the goby again but the most part of the time they were deep in herring and chintzes and linen or in computations of the slowness of the passage and left us to our own concerns which were very little important to any but ourselves  at the first we had a great deal to say and thought ourselves pretty witty and i was at a little pains to be the beau and she i believe to play the young lady of experience but soon we grew plainer with each other i laid aside my high clipped english what little there was of it and forgot to make my edinburgh bows and scrapes she upon her side fell into a sort of kind familiarity and we dwelt together like those of the same household only upon my side with a more deep emotion about the same time the bottom seemed to fall out of our conversation and neither one of us the less pleased whiles she would tell me old wives tales of which she had a wonderful variety many of them from my friend redheaded niel she told them very pretty and they were pretty enough childish tales but the pleasure to myself was in the sound of her voice and the thought that she was telling and i listening whiles again we would sit entirely silent not communicating even with a look and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of that neighbourhood i speak here only for myself of what was in the maids mind i am not very sure that ever i asked myself and what was in my own i was afraid to consider i need make no secret of it now either to myself or to the reader i was fallen totally in love she came between me and the sun she had grown suddenly taller as i say but with a wholesome growth she seemed all health and lightness and brave spirits and i thought she walked like a young deer and stood like a birch upon the mountains it was enough for me to sit near by her on the deck and i declare i scarce spent two thoughts upon the future and was so well content with what i then enjoyed that i was never at the pains to imagine any further step unless perhaps that i would be sometimes tempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there but i was too like a miser of what joys i had and would venture nothing on a hazard  what we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other so that if anyone had been at so much pains as overhear us he must have supposed us the most egotistical persons in the world it befell one day when we were at this practice that we came on a discourse of friends and friendship and i think now that we were sailing near the wind we said what a fine thing friendship was and how little we had guessed of it and how it made life a new thing and a thousand covered things of the same kind that will have been said since the foundation of the world by young folk in the same predicament then we remarked upon the strangeness of that circumstance that friends came together in the beginning as if they were there for the first time and yet each had been alive a good while losing time with other people  it is not much that i have done said she and i could be telling you the fivefifths of it in twothree words it is only a girl i am and what can befall a girl at all events but i went with the clan in the year 45 the men marched with swords and firelocks and some of them in brigades in the same set of tartan they were not backward at the marching i can tell you and there were gentlemen from the low country with their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound and there was a grand skirling of warpipes i rode on a little highland horse on the right hand of my father james more and of glengyle himself and here is one fine thing that i remember that glengyle kissed me in the face because says he my kinswoman you are the only lady of the clan that has come out and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old i saw prince charlie too and the blue eyes of him he was pretty indeed i had his hand to kiss in the front of the army o well these were the good days but it is all like a dream that i have seen and then awakened it went what way you very well know and these were the worst days of all when the redcoat soldiers were out and my father and my uncles lay in the hill and i was to be carrying them their meat in the middle night or at the short side of day when the cocks crow yes i have walked in the night manys the time and my heart great in me for terror of the darkness it is a strange thing i will never have been meddled with a bogle but they say a maid goes safe next there was my uncles marriage and that was a dreadful affair beyond all jean kay was that womans name and she had me in the room with her that night at inversnaid the night we took her from her friends in the old ancient manner she would and she wouldnt she was for marrying rob the one minute and the next she would be for none of him i will never have seen such a feckless creature of a woman surely all there was of her would tell her ay or no well she was a widow and i can never be thinking a widow a good woman  catriona says i how do you make out that  i do not know said she i am only telling you the seeming in my heart and then to marry a new man fy but that was her and she was married again upon my uncle robin and went with him awhile to kirk and market and then wearied or else her friends got claught of her and talked her round or maybe she turned ashamed at the least of it she ran away and went back to her own folk and said we had held her in the lake and i will never tell you all what i have never thought much of any females since that day and so in the end my father james more came to be cast in prison and you know the rest of it as well as me  and through all you had no friends said i  no said she i have been pretty chief with twothree lasses on the braes but not to call it friends  well mine is a plain tale said i i never had a friend to my name till i met in with you  and that brave mr stewart she asked  o yes i was forgetting him i said but he is a man and that is very different  i would think so said she o yes it is quite different  and then there was one other said i i once thought i had a friend but it proved a disappointment  she asked me who she was  it was a he then said i we were the two best lads at my fathers school and we thought we loved each other dearly well the time came when he went to glasgow to a merchants house that was his second cousin once removed and wrote me twothree times by the carrier and then he found new friends and i might write till i was tired he took no notice eh catriona it took me a long while to forgive the world there is not anything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend  then she began to question me close upon his looks and character for we were each a great deal concerned in all that touched the other till at last in a very evil hour i minded of his letters and went and fetched the bundle from the cabin  here are his letters said i and all the letters that ever i got that will be the last ill can tell of myself you know the lave26 as well as i do  will you let me read them then says she  i told her if she would be at the pains and she bade me go away and she would read them from the one end to the other now in this bundle that i gave her there were packed together not only all the letters of my false friend but one or two of mr campbells when he was in town at the assembly and to make a complete roll of all that ever was written to me catrionas little word and the two i had received from miss grant one when i was on the bass and one on board that ship but of these last i had no particular mind at the moment  i was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that it mattered not what i did nor scarce whether i was in her presence or out of it i had caught her like some kind of a noble fever that lived continually in my bosom by night and by day and whether i was waking or asleep so it befell that after i was come into the forepart of the ship where the broad bows splashed into the billows i was in no such hurry to return as you might fancy rather prolonged my absence like a variety in pleasure i do not think i am by nature much of an epicurean and there had come till then so small a share of pleasure in my way that i might be excused perhaps to dwell on it unduly  when i returned to her again i had a faint painful impression as of a buckle slipped so coldly she returned the packet  you have read them said i and i thought my voice sounded not wholly natural for i was turning in my mind for what could ail her  did you mean me to read all she asked  i told her yes with a drooping voice  the last of them as well said she  i knew where we were now yet i would not lie to her either i gave them all without afterthought i said as i supposed that you would read them i see no harm in any  i will be differently made said she i thank god i am differently made it was not a fit letter to be shown me it was not fit to be written  i think you are speaking of your own friend barbara grant said i  there will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend said she quoting my own expression  i think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied i cried what kind of justice do you call this to blame me for some words that a tomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper you know yourself with what respect i have behavedand would do always  yet you would show me that same letter says she i want no such friends i can be doing very well mr balfour without heror you  this is your fine gratitude says i  i am very much obliged to you said she i will be asking you to take away yourletters she seemed to choke upon the word so that it sounded like an oath  you shall never ask twice said i picked up that bundle walked a little way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea for a very little more i could have cast myself after them  the rest of the day i walked up and down raging there were few names so ill but what i gave her them in my own mind before the sun went down all that i had ever heard of highland pride seemed quite outdone that a girl scarce grown should resent so trifling an allusion and that from her next friend that she had near wearied me with praising of i had bitter sharp hard thoughts of her like an angry boys if i had kissed her indeed i thought perhaps she would have taken it pretty well and only because it had been written down and with a spice of jocularity up she must fuff in this ridiculous passion it seemed to me there was a want of penetration in the female sex to make angels weep over the case of the poor men  we were side by side again at supper and what a change was there she was like curdled milk to me her face was like a wooden dolls i could have indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet but she gave me not the least occasion to do either no sooner the meal done than she betook herself to attend on mrs gebbie which i think she had a little neglected heretofore but she was to make up for lost time and in what remained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the old lady and on deck began to make a great deal more than i thought wise of captain sang not but what the captain seemed a worthy fatherly man but i hated to behold her in the least familiarity with anyone except myself  altogether she was so quick to avoid me and so constant to keep herself surrounded with others that i must watch a long while before i could find my opportunity and after it was found i made not much of it as you are now to hear  i have no guess how i have offended said i it should scarce be beyond pardon then o try if you can pardon me  i have no pardon to give said she and the words seemed to come out of her throat like marbles i will be very much obliged for all your friendships and she made me an eight part of a curtsey  but i had schooled myself beforehand to say more and i was going to say it too  there is one thing said i if i have shocked your particularity by the showing of that letter it cannot touch miss grant she wrote not to you but to a poor common ordinary lad who might have had more sense than show it if you are to blame me  i will advise you to say no more about that girl at all events said catriona it is her i will never look the road of not if she lay dying she turned away from me and suddenly back will you swear you will have no more to deal with her she cried  indeed and i will never be so unjust then said i nor yet so ungrateful  and now it was i that turned away                                          chapter xxii  helvoetsluys   the weather in the end considerably worsened the wind sang in the shrouds the sea swelled higher and the ship began to labour and cry out among the billows the song of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce ceasing for we thrid all the way among shoals about nine in the morning in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail i had my first look of hollanda line of windmills birling in the breeze it was besides my first knowledge of these daftlike contrivances which gave me a near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life we came to an anchor about halfpast eleven outside the harbour of helvoetsluys in a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously you may be sure we were all on deck save mrs gebbie some of us in cloaks others mantled in the ships tarpaulins all clinging on by ropes and jesting the most like old sailorfolk that we could imitate  presently a boat that was backed like a partancrab came gingerly alongside and the skipper of it hailed our master in the dutch thence captain sang turned very troubled like to catriona and the rest of us crowding about the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all the rose was bound to the port of rotterdam whither the other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive in view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the direction of the upper germany this with the present halfgale of wind the captain if no time were lost declared himself still capable to save now james more had trysted in helvoet with his daughter and the captain had engaged to call before the port and place her according to the custom in a shore boat there was the boat to be sure and there was catriona ready but both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk and the first was in no humour to delay  your father said he would be gey an little pleased if we was to break a leg to ye miss drummond letabe drowning of you take my way of it says he and come onby with the rest of us here to rotterdam ye can get a passage down the maes in a sailing scoot as far to the brill and thence on again by a place in a rattelwaggon back to helvoet  but catriona would hear of no change she looked whitelike as she beheld the bursting of the sprays the green seas that sometimes poured upon the forecastle and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat among the billows but she stood firmly by her fathers orders my father james more will have arranged it so was her first word and her last i thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so much kind advice but the fact is she had a very good reason if she would have told us sailing scoots and rattelwaggons are excellent things only the use of them must first be paid for and all she was possessed of in the world was just two shillings and a penny halfpenny sterling so it fell out that captain and passengers not knowing of her destitutionand she being too proud to tell themspoke in vain  but you ken nae french and nae dutch neither said one  it is very true says she but since the year 46 there are so many of the honest scots abroad that i will be doing very well i thank you  there was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh others looked the more sorry and mr gebbie fall outright in a passion i believe he knew it was his duty his wife having accepted charge of the girl to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe nothing would have induced him to have done so since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance and i think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice at least he broke out upon captain sang raging and saying the thing was a disgrace that it was mere death to try to leave the ship and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty holland fishers and leave her to her fate i was thinking something of the same took the mate upon one side arranged with him to send on my chests by trackscoot to an address i had in leyden and stood up and signalled to the fishers  i will go ashore with the young lady captain sang said i it is all one what way i go to leyden and leaped at the same time into the boat which i managed not so elegantly but what i fell with two of the fishers in the bilge  from the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the ship she stood so high over us swung down so swift and menaced us so perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable i began to think i had made a fools bargain that it was merely impossible catriona should be got on board to me and that i stood to be set ashore at helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing james more if i should want to but this was to reckon without the lasss courage she had seen me leap with very little appearance however much reality of hesitation to be sure she was not to be beat by her discarded friend up she stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay the wind blowing in her petticoats which made the enterprise more dangerous and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities there was no minute lost and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the same i stood up on the other side and spread my arms the ship swung down on us the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe and catriona leaped into the air i was so happy as to catch her and the fishers readily supporting us escaped a fall she held to me a moment very tight breathing quick and deep thence she still clinging to me with both hands we were passed aft to our places by the steersman and captain sang and all the crew and passengers cheering and crying farewell the boat was put about for shore  as soon as catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly but said no word no more did i and indeed the whistling of the wind and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech and our crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way so that the rose had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the harbour mouth  we were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon according to their beastly hollands custom stopped his boat and required of us our fares two guilders was the mans demand between three and four shillings english money for each passenger but at this catriona began to cry out with a vast deal of agitation she had asked of captain sang she said and the fare was but an english shilling do you think i will have come on board and not ask first cries she the patroon scolded back upon her in a lingo where the oaths were english and the rest right hollands till at last seeing her near tears i privately slipped in the rogues hand six shillings whereupon he was obliging enough to receive from her the other shilling without more complaint no doubt i was a good deal nettled and ashamed i like to see folk thrifty but not with so much passion and i daresay it would be rather coldly that i asked her as the boat moved on again for shore where it was that she was trysted with her father  he is to be inquired of at the house of one sprott an honest scotch merchant says she and then with the same breath i am wishing to thank you very muchyou are a brave friend to me  it will be time enough when i get you to your father said i little thinking that i spoke so true i can tell him a fine tale of a loyal daughter  o i do not think i will be a loyal girl at all events she cried with a great deal of painfulness in the expression i do not think my heart is true  yet there are very few that would have made that leap and all to obey a fathers orders i observed  i cannot have you to be thinking of me so she cried again when you had done that same how would i stop behind and at all events that was not all the reasons whereupon with a burning face she told me the plain truth upon her poverty  good guide us cried i what kind of daftlike proceeding is this to let yourself be launched on the continent of europe with an empty pursei count it hardly decentscant decent i cried  you forget james more my father is a poor gentleman said she he is a hunted exile  but i think not all your friends are hunted exiles i exclaimed and was this fair to them that care for you was it fair to me was it fair to miss grant that counselled you to go and would be driven fair hornmad if she could hear of it was it even fair to these gregory folk that you were living with and used you lovingly its a blessing you have fallen in my hands suppose your father hindered by an accident what would become of you here and you your leealone in a strange place the thought of the thing frightens me i said  i will have lied to all of them she replied i will have told them all that i had plenty i told her too i could not be lowering james more to them  i found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust for the lie was originally the fathers not the daughters and she thus obliged to persevere in it for the mans reputation but at the time i was ignorant of this and the mere thought of her destitution and the perils in which she must have fallen had ruffled me almost beyond reason  well well well said i you will have to learn more sense  i left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore where i got a direction for sprotts house in my new french and we walked thereit was some little waybeholding the place with wonder as we went indeed there was much for scots folk to admire canals and trees being intermingled with the houses the houses each within itself of a brave red brick the colour of a rose with steps and benches of blue marble at the cheek of every door and the whole town so clean you might have dined upon the causeway sprott was within upon his ledgers in a low parlour very neat and clean and set out with china and pictures and a globe of the earth in a brass frame he was a bigchafted ruddy lusty man with a crooked hard look to him and he made us not that much civility as offer us a seat  is james more macgregor now in helvoet sir says i  i ken nobody by such a name says he impatientlike  since you are so particular says i i will amend my question and ask you where we are to find in helvoet one james drummond alias macgregor alias james more late tenant in iveronachile  sir says he he may be in hell for what i ken and for my part i wish he was  the young lady is that gentlemans daughter sir said i before whom i think you will agree with me it is not very becoming to discuss his character  i have nothing to make either with him or her or you cries he in his gross voice  under your favour mr sprott said i this young lady is come from scotland seeking him and by whatever mistake was given the name of your house for a direction an error it seems to have been but i think this places both you and mewho am but her fellowtraveller by accidentunder a strong obligation to help our countrywoman  will you ding me daft he cries i tell ye i ken naething and care less either for him or his breed i tell ye the man owes me money  that may very well be sir said i who was now rather more angry than himself at least i owe you nothing the young lady is under my protection and i am neither at all used with these manners nor in the least content with them  as i said this and without particularly thinking what i did i drew a step or two nearer to his table thus striking by mere good fortune on the only argument that could at all affect the man the blood left his lusty countenance  for the lords sake dinna be hasty sir he cried i am truly wishfu no to be offensive but ye ken sir im like a wheen guidnatured honest canty auld fallowsmy bark is waur nor my bite to hear me ye micht whiles fancy i was a wee thing dour but na na its a kind auld fellow at heart sandie sprott and ye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me  very good sir said i then i will make that much freedom with your kindness as trouble you for your last news of mr drummond  youre welcome sir said he as for the young leddy my respecs to her hell just have clean forgotten her i ken the man ye see i have lost siller by him ere now he thinks of naebody but just himsel clan king or dauchter if he can get his wameful he would give them a the goby ay or his correspondent either for there is a sense in whilk i may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent the fact is we are employed thegether in a business affair and i think its like to turn out a dear affair for sandie sprott the mans as guids my pairtner and i give ye my mere word i ken naething by where he is he micht be coming here to helvoet he micht come here the morn he michtnae come for a twalmonth i would wonder at naethingor just at the ae thing and thats if he was to pay me my siller ye see what way i stand with it and its clear im no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy as ye ca her she cannae stop here thats ae thing certain sure dod sir im a lone man if i was to tak her in its highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up  enough of this talk said i i will take the young lady among better friends give me pen ink and paper and i will leave here for james more the address of my correspondent in leyden he can inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter  this word i wrote and sealed which while i was doing sprott of his own motion made a welcome offer to charge himself with miss drummonds mails and even send a porter for them to the inn i advanced him to that effect a dollar or two to be a cover and he gave me an acknowledgment in writing of the sum  whereupon i giving my arm to catriona we left the house of this unpalatable rascal she had said no word throughout leaving me to judge and speak in her place i upon my side had been careful not to embarrass her by a glance and even now although my heart still glowed inside of me with shame and anger i made it my affair to seem quite easy  now said i let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the french have a piece of dinner and inquire for conveyances to rotterdam i will never be easy till i have you safe again in the hands of mrs gebbie  i suppose it will have to be said catriona though whoever will be pleased i do not think it will be her and i will remind you this once again that i have but one shilling and three baubees  and just this once again said i i will remind you it was a blessing that i came alongst with you  what else would i be thinking all this time says she and i thought weighed a little on my arm it is you that are the good friend to me                                          chapter xxiii  travels in holland   the rattelwagon which is a kind of a long wagon set with benches carried us in four hours of travel to the great city of rotterdam it was long past dark by then but the streets pretty brightly lighted and thronged with the wildlike outlandish charactersbearded hebrews black men and the hordes of courtesans most indecently adorned with finery and stopping seamen by their very sleeves the clash of talk about us made our heads to whirl and what was the most unexpected of all we appeared to be no more struck with all these foreigners than they with us i made the best face i could for the lasss sake and my own credit but the truth is i felt like a lost sheep and my heart beat in my bosom with anxiety once or twice i inquired after the harbor or the berth of the ship rose but either fell on some who spoke only hollands or my own french failed me trying a street at a venture i came upon a lane of lighted houses the doors and windows thronged with wauflike painted women these jostled and mocked upon us as we passed and i was thankful we had nothing of their language a little after we issued forth upon an open place along the harbour  we shall be doing now cries i as soon as i spied masts let us walk here by the harbour we are sure to meet some that has the english and at the best of it we may light upon that very ship  we did the next best as happened for about nine of the evening whom should we walk into the arms of but captain sang he told us they had made their run in the most incredible brief time the wind holding strong until they reached port by which means his passengers were all gone already on their further travels it was impossible to chase after the gebbies into high germany and we had no other acquaintance to fall back upon but captain sang himself it was the more gratifying to find the man friendly and wishful to assist he made it a small affair to find some good plain family of merchants where catriona might harbour till the rose was loaden declared he would then blithely carry her back to leith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of mr gregory and in the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the meal we stood in need of he seemed extremely friendly as i say but what surprised me a good deal rather boisterous in the bargain and the cause of this was soon to appear for at the ordinary calling for rhenish wine and drinking of it deep he soon became unutterably tipsy in this case as too common with all men but especially with those of his rough trade what little sense or manners he possessed deserted him and he behaved himself so scandalous to the young lady jesting most illfavoredly at the figure she had made on the ships rail that i had no resource but carry her suddenly away  she came out of that ordinary clinging to me close take me away david she said you keep me i am not afraid with you  and have no cause my little friend cried i and could have found it in my heart to weep  where will you be taking me she said again dont leave me at all events never leave me  where am i taking you indeed says i stopping for i had been staving on ahead in mere blindness i must stop and think but ill not leave you catriona the lord do so to me and more also if i should fail or fash you  she crept closer in to me by way of a reply  here i said is the stillest place that we have hit on yet in this busy byke of a city let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our course  that tree which i am little like to forget stood hard by the harbour side it was a black night but lights were in the houses and nearer hand in the quiet ships there was a shining of the city on the one hand and a buzz hung over it of many thousands walking and talking on the other it was dark and the water bubbled on the sides i spread my cloak upon a builders stone and made her sit there she would have kept her hold upon me for she still shook with the late affronts but i wanted to think clear disengaged myself and paced to and fro before her in the manner of what we call a smugglers walk belabouring my brains for any remedy by the course of these scattering thoughts i was brought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that in the heat and haste of our departure i had left captain sang to pay the ordinary at this i began to laugh out loud for i thought the man well served and at the same time by an instinctive movement carried my hand to the pocket where my money was i suppose it was in the lane where the women jostled us but there is only the one thing certain that my purse was gone  you will have thought of something good said she observing me to pause  at the pinch we were in my mind became suddenly clear as a perspective glass and i saw there was no choice of methods i had not one doit of coin but in my pocketbook i had still my letter on the leyden merchant and there was now but the one way to get to leyden and that was to walk on our two feet  catriona said i i know youre brave and i believe youre strong do you think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road we found it i believe scarce the twothirds of that but such was my notion of the distance  david she said if you will just keep near i will go anywhere and do anything the courage of my heart it is all broken do not be leaving me in this horrible country by myself and i will do all else  can you start now and march all night said i  i will do all that you can ask of me she said and never ask you why i have been a bad ungrateful girl to you and do what you please with me now and i think miss barbara grant is the best lady in the world she added and i do not see what she would deny you for at all events  this was greek and hebrew to me but i had other matters to consider and the first of these was to get clear of that city on the leyden road it proved a cruel problem and it may have been one or two at night ere we had solved it once beyond the houses there was neither moon or stars to guide us only the whiteness of the way in the midst and a blackness of an alley on both hands the walking was besides made most extraordinary difficult by a plain black frost that fell suddenly in the small hours and turned that highway into one long slide  well catriona said i here we are like the kings sons and the old wives daughters in your daftlike highland tales soon well be going over the seven bens the seven glens and the seven mountain moors which was a common byword or overcome in these tales of hers that had stuck in my memory  ah says she but here are no glens or mountains though i will never be denying but what the trees and some of the plain places hereabouts are very pretty but our country is the best yet  i wish we could say as much for our own folk says i recalling sprott and sang and perhaps james more himself  i will never complain of the country of my friend said she and spoke it out with an accent so particular that i seemed to see the look upon her face  i caught in my breath sharp and came near falling for my pains on the black ice  i do not know what you think catriona said i when i was a little recovered but this has been the best day yet i think shame to say it when you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours but for me it has been the best day yet  it was a good day when you showed me so much love said she  and yet i think shame to be happy too i went on and you here on the road in the black night  where in the great world would i be else she cried i am thinking i am safest where i am with you  i am quite forgiven then i asked  will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your mouth again she cried theres is nothing in this heart to you but thanks but i will be honest too she added with a kind of suddenness and ill never can forgive that girl  is this miss grant again said i you said yourself she was the best lady in the world  so she will be indeed says catriona but i will never forgive her for all that i will never never forgive her and let me hear tell of her no more  well said i this beats all that ever came to my knowledge and i wonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims here is a young lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us that learned us how to dress ourselves and in a great manner how to behave as anyone can see that knew us both before and after  but catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway  it is this way of it said she either you will go on to speak of her and i will go back to yon town and let come of it what god pleases or else you will do me that politeness to talk of other things  i was the most nonplussed person in this world but i bethought me that she depended altogether on my help that she was of the frail sex and not so much beyond a child and it was for me to be wise for the pair of us  my dear girl said i i can make neither head nor tails of this but god forbid that i should do anything to set you on the jee as for talking of miss grant i have no such a mind to it and i believe it was yourself began it my only design if i took you up at all was for your own improvement for i hate the very look of injustice not that i do not wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy they become you well but here you show them to excess  well then have you done said she  i have done said i  a very good thing said she and we went on again but now in silence  it was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night beholding only shadows and hearing nought but our own steps at first i believe our hearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity but the darkness and the cold and the silence which only the cocks sometimes interrupted or sometimes the farmyard dogs had pretty soon brought down our pride to the dust and for my own particular i would have jumped at any decent opening for speech  before the day peeped came on a warmish rain and the frost was all wiped away from among our feet i took my cloak to her and sought to hap her in the same she bade me rather impatiently to keep it  indeed and i will do no such thing said i here am i a great ugly lad that has seen all kinds of weather and here are you a tender pretty maid my dear you would not put me to a shame  without more words she let me cover her which as i was doing in the darkness i let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder almost like an embrace  you must try to be more patient of your friend said i  i thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against my bosom or perhaps it was but fancy  there will be no end to your goodness said she  and we went on again in silence but now all was changed and the happiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney  the rain passed ere day it was but a sloppy morning as we came into the town of delft the red gabled houses made a handsome show on either hand of a canal the servant lassies were out slestering and scrubbing at the very stones upon the public highway smoke rose from a hundred kitchens and it came in upon me strongly it was time to break our fasts  catriona said i i believe you have yet a shilling and three baubees  are you wanting it said she and passed me her purse i am wishing it was five pounds what will you want it for  and what have we been walking for all night like a pair of waif egyptians says i just because i was robbed of my purse and all i possessed in that unchancy town of rotterdam i will tell you of it now because i think the worst is over but we have still a good tramp before us till we get to where my money is and if you would not buy me a piece of bread i were like to go fasting  she looked at me with open eyes by the light of the new day she was all black and pale for weariness so that my heart smote me for her but as for her she broke out laughing  my torture are we beggars then she cried you too o i could have wished for this same thing and i am glad to buy your breakfast to you but it would be pleisand if i would have had to dance to get a meal to you for i believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of dancing over here and might be paying for the curiosity of that sight  i could have kissed her for that word not with a lovers mind but in a heat of admiration for it always warms a man to see a woman brave  we got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the town and in a bakers a piece of excellent hot sweetsmelling bread which we ate upon the road as we went on that road from delft to the hague is just five miles of a fine avenue shaded with trees a canal on the one hand on the other excellent pastures of cattle it was pleasant here indeed  and now davie said she what will you do with me at all events  it is what we have to speak of said i and the sooner yet the better i can come by money in leyden that will be all well but the trouble is how to dispose of you until your father come i thought last night you seemed a little sweir to part from me  it will be more than seeming then said she  you are a very young maid said i and i am but a very young callant this is a great piece of difficulty what way are we to manage unless indeed you could pass to be my sister  and what for no said she if you would let me  i wish you were so indeed i cried i would be a fine man if i had such a sister but the rub is that you are catriona drummond  and now i will be catrine balfour she said and who is to ken they are all strange folk here  if you think that it would do says i i own it troubles me i would like it very ill if i advised you at all wrong  david i have no friend here but you she said  the mere truth is i am too young to be your friend said i i am too young to advise you or you to be advised i see not what else we are to do and yet i ought to warn you  i will have no choice left said she my father james more has not used me very well and it is not the first time i am cast upon your hands like a sack of barley meal and have nothing else to think of but your pleasure if you will have me good and well if you will notshe turned and touched her hand upon my armdavid i am afraid said she  no but i ought to warn you i began and then bethought me that i was the bearer of the purse and it would never do to seem too churlish catriona said i dont misunderstand me i am just trying to do my duty by you girl here am i going alone to this strange city to be a solitary student there and here is this chance arisen that you might dwell with me a bit and be like my sister you can surely understand this much my dear that i would just love to have you  well and here i am said she so thats soon settled  i know i was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain i know this was a great blot on my character for which i was lucky that i did not pay more dear but i minded how easy her delicacy had been startled with a word of kissing her in barbaras letter now that she depended on me how was i to be more bold besides the truth is i could see no other feasible method to dispose of her and i daresay inclination pulled me very strong  a little beyond the hague she fell very lame and made the rest of the distance heavily enough twice she must rest by the wayside which she did with pretty apologies calling herself a shame to the highlands and the race she came of and nothing but a hindrance to myself it was her excuse she said that she was not much used with walking shod i would have had her strip off her shoes and stockings and go barefoot but she pointed out to me that the women of that country even in the landward roads appeared to be all shod  i must not be disgracing my brother said she and was very merry with it all although her face told tales of her  there is a garden in that city we were bound to sanded below with clean sand the trees meeting overhead some of them trimmed some pleached and the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours here i left catriona and went forward by myself to find my correspondent there i drew on my credit and asked to be recommended to some decent retired lodging my baggage not being yet arrived i told him i supposed i should require his caution with the people of the house and explained that my sister being come for a while to keep house with me i should be wanting two chambers this was all very well but the trouble was that mr balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great deal of particulars and never a word of any sister in the case i could see my dutchman was extremely suspicious and viewing me over the rims of a great pair of spectacleshe was a poor frail body and reminded me of an infirm rabbithe began to question me close  here i fell in a panic suppose he accept my tale thinks i suppose he invite my sister to his house and that i bring her i shall have a fine ravelled pirn to unwind and may end by disgracing both the lassie and myself thereupon i began hastily to expound to him my sisters character she was of a bashful disposition it appeared and so extremely fearful of meeting strangers that i had left her at that moment sitting in a public place alone and then being launched upon the stream of falsehood i must do like all the rest of the world in the same circumstance and plunge in deeper than was any service adding some altogether needless particulars of miss balfours illhealth and retirement during childhood in the midst of which i awoke to a sense of my behaviour and was turned to one blush  the old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a willingness to be quit of me but he was first of all a man of business and knowing that my money was good enough however it might be with my conduct he was so far obliging as to send his son to be my guide and caution in the matter of a lodging this implied my presenting of the young man to catriona the poor pretty child was much recovered with resting looked and behaved to perfection and took my arm and gave me the name of brother more easily than i could answer her but there was one misfortune thinking to help she was rather towardly than otherwise to my dutchman and i could not but reflect that miss balfour had rather suddenly outgrown her bashfulness and there was another thing the difference of our speech i had the low country tongue and dwelled upon my words she had a hill voice spoke with something of an english accent only far more delightful and was scarce quite fit to be called a deacon in the craft of talking english grammar so that for a brother and sister we made a most uneven pair but the young hollander was a heavy dog without so much spirit in his belly as to remark her prettiness for which i scorned him and as soon as he had found a cover to our heads he left us alone which was the greater service of the two                                          chapter xxiv  full story of a copy of heineccius   the place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal we had two rooms the second entering from the first each had a chimney built out into the floor in the dutch manner and being alongside each had the same prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in a little court of a piece of the canal and of houses in the hollands architecture and a church spire upon the further side a full set of bells hung in that spire and made delightful music and when there was any sun at all it shone direct in our two chambers from a tavern hard by we had good meals sent in  the first night we were both pretty weary and she extremely so there was little talk between us and i packed her off to her bed as soon as she had eaten the first thing in the morning i wrote word to sprott to have her mails sent on together with a line to alan at his chiefs and had the same dispatched and her breakfast ready ere i waked her i was a little abashed when she came forth in her one habit and the mud of the way upon her stockings by what inquiries i had made it seemed a good few days must pass before her mails could come to hand in leyden and it was plainly needful she must have a shift of things she was unwilling at first that i should go to that expense but i reminded her she was now a rich mans sister and must appear suitably in the part and we had not got to the second merchants before she was entirely charmed into the spirit of the thing and her eyes shining it pleased me to see her so innocent and thorough in this pleasure what was more extraordinary was the passion into which i fell on it myself being never satisfied that i had bought her enough or fine enough and never weary of beholding her in different attires indeed i began to understand some little of miss grants immersion in that interest of clothes for the truth is when you have the ground of a beautiful person to adorn the whole business becomes beautiful the dutch chintzes i should say were extraordinary cheap and fine but i would be ashamed to set down what i paid for stockings to her altogether i spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring as i may call it that i was ashamed for a great while to spend more and by way of a set off i left our chambers pretty bare if we had beds if catriona was a little braw and i had light to see her by we were richly enough lodged for me  by the end of this merchandising i was glad to leave her at the door with all our purchases and go for a long walk alone in which to read myself a lecture here had i taken under my roof and as good as to my bosom a young lass extremely beautiful and whose innocence was her peril my talk with the old dutchman and the lies to which i was constrained had already given me a sense of how my conduct must appear to others and now after the strong admiration i had just experienced and the immoderacy with which i had continued my vain purchases i began to think of it myself as very hasarded i bethought me if i had a sister indeed whether i would so expose her then judging the case too problematical i varied my question into this whether i would so trust catriona in the hands of any other christian being the answer to which made my face to burn the more cause since i had been entrapped and had entrapped the girl into an undue situation that i should behave in it with scrupulous nicety she depended on me wholly for her bread and shelter in case i should alarm her delicacy she had no retreat besides i was her host and her protector and the more irregularly i had fallen in these positions the less excuse for me if i should profit by the same to forward even the most honest suit for with the opportunities that i enjoyed and which no wise parent would have suffered for a moment even the most honest suit would be unfair i saw i must be extremely holdoff in my relations and yet not too much so neither for if i had no right to appear at all in the character of a suitor i must yet appear continually and if possible agreeably in that of host it was plain i should require a great deal of tact and conduct perhaps more than my years afforded but i had rushed in where angels might have feared to tread and there was no way out of that position save by behaving right while i was in it i made a set of rules for my guidance prayed for strength to be enabled to observe them and as a more human aid to the same end purchased a study book in law this being all that i could think of i relaxed from these grave considerations whereupon my mind bubbled at once into an effervescency of pleasing spirits and it was like one treading on air that i turned homeward as i thought that name of home and recalled the image of that figure awaiting me between four walls my heart beat upon my bosom  my troubles began with my return she ran to greet me with an obvious and affecting pleasure she was clad besides entirely in the new clothes that i had bought for her looked in them beyond expression well and must walk about and drop me curtseys to display them and to be admired i am sure i did it with an ill grace for i thought to have choked upon the words  well she said if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes see what i have done with our two chambers and she showed me the place all very finely swept and the fires glowing in the two chimneys  i was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than i quite felt catriona said i i am very much displeased with you and you must never again lay a hand upon my room one of us two must have the rule while we are here together it is most fit it should be i who am both the man and the elder and i give you that for my command  she dropped me one of her curtseys which were extraordinary taking if you will be cross said she i must be making pretty manners at you davie i will be very obedient as i should be when every stitch upon all there is of me belongs to you but you will not be very cross either because now i have not anyone else  this struck me hard and i made haste in a kind of penitence to blot out all the good effect of my last speech in this direction progress was more easy being down hill she led me forward smiling at the sight of her in the brightness of the fire and with her pretty becks and looks my heart was altogether melted we made our meal with infinite mirth and tenderness and the two seemed to be commingled into one so that our very laughter sounded like a kindness  in the midst of which i awoke to better recollections made a lame word of excuse and set myself boorishly to my studies it was a substantial instructive book that i had bought by the late dr heineccius in which i was to do a great deal of reading these next days and often very glad that i had no one to question me of what i read methought she bit her lip at me a little and that cut me indeed it left her wholly solitary the more as she was very little of a reader and had never a book but what was i to do  so the rest of the evening flowed by almost without speech  i could have beat myself i could not lie in my bed that night for rage and repentance but walked to and fro on my bare feet till i was nearly perished for the chimney was gone out and the frost keen the thought of her in the next room the thought that she might even hear me as i walked the remembrance of my churlishness and that i must continue to practise the same ungrateful course or be dishonoured put me beside my reason i stood like a man between scylla and charybdis what must she think of me was my one thought that softened me continually into weakness what is to become of us the other which steeled me again to resolution this was my first night of wakefulness and divided counsels of which i was now to pass many pacing like a madman sometimes weeping like a childish boy sometimes praying i would fain hope like a christian  but prayer is not very difficult and the hitch comes in practice in her presence and above all if i allowed any beginning of familiarity i found i had very little command of what should follow but to sit all day in the same room with her and feign to be engaged upon heineccius surpassed my strength so that i fell instead upon the expedient of absenting myself so much as i was able taking out classes and sitting there regularly often with small attention the test of which i found the other day in a notebook of that period where i had left off to follow an edifying lecture and actually scribbled in my book some very ill verses though the latinity is rather better than i thought i could ever have compassed the evil of this course was unhappily near as great as its advantage i had the less time of trial but i believe while that time lasted i was tried the more extremely for she being so much left to solitude she came to greet my return with an increasing fervour that came nigh to overmaster me these friendly offers i must barbarously cast back and my rejection sometimes wounded her so cruelly that i must unbend and seek to make it up to her in kindness so that our time passed in ups and downs tiffs and disappointments upon the which i could almost say if it may be said with reverence that i was crucified  the base of my trouble was catrionas extraordinary innocence at which i was not so much surprised as filled with pity and admiration she seemed to have no thought of our position no sense of my struggles welcomed any mark of my weakness with responsive joy and when i was drove again to my retrenchments did not always dissemble her chagrin there were times when i have thought to myself if she were over head in love and set her cap to catch me she would scarce behave much otherwise and then i would fall again into wonder at the simplicity of woman from whom i felt in these moments that i was not worthy to be descended  there was one point in particular on which our warfare turned and of all things this was the question of her clothes my baggage had soon followed me from rotterdam and hers from helvoet she had now as it were two wardrobes and it grew to be understood between us i could never tell how that when she was friendly she would wear my clothes and when otherwise her own it was meant for a buffet and as it were the renunciation of her gratitude and i felt it so in my bosom but was generally more wise than to appear to have observed the circumstance  once indeed i was betrayed into a childishness greater than her own it fell in this way on my return from classes thinking upon her devoutly with a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain the annoyance began to fade away out of my mind and spying in a window one of those forced flowers of which the hollanders are so skilled in the artifice i gave way to an impulse and bought it for catriona i do not know the name of that flower but it was of the pink colour and i thought she would admire the same and carried it home to her with a wonderful soft heart i had left her in my clothes and when i returned to find her all changed and a face to match i cast but the one look at her from head to foot ground my teeth together flung the window open and my flower into the court and then between rage and prudence myself out of that room again of which i slammed the door as i went out  on the steep stair i came near falling and this brought me to myself so that i began at once to see the folly of my conduct i went not into the street as i had purposed but to the house court which was always a solitary place and where i saw my flower that had cost me vastly more than it was worth hanging in the leafless tree i stood by the side of the canal and looked upon the ice country people went by on their skates and i envied them i could see no way out of the pickle i was in no way so much as to return to the room i had just left no doubt was in my mind but i had now betrayed the secret of my feelings and to make things worse i had shown at the same time and that with wretched boyishness incivility to my helpless guest  i suppose she must have seen me from the open window it did not seem to me that i had stood there very long before i heard the crunching of footsteps on the frozen snow and turning somewhat angrily for i was in no spirit to be interrupted saw catriona drawing near she was all changed again to the clocked stockings  are we not to have our walk today said she  i was looking at her in a maze where is your brooch says i  she carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high i will have forgotten it said she i will run upstairs for it quick and then surely well can have our walk  there was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me i had neither words nor voice to utter them i could do no more than nod by way of answer and the moment she had left me climbed into the tree and recovered my flower which on her return i offered her  i bought it for you catriona said i  she fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch i could have thought tenderly  it is none the better of my handling said i again and blushed  i will be liking it none the worse you may be sure of that said she  we did not speak so much that day she seemed a thought on the reserve though not unkindly as for me all the time of our walking and after we came home and i had seen her put my flower into a pot of water i was thinking to myself what puzzles women were i was thinking the one moment it was the most stupid thing on earth she should not have perceived my love and the next that she had certainly perceived it long ago and being a wise girl with the fine female instinct of propriety concealed her knowledge  we had our walk daily out in the streets i felt more safe i relaxed a little in my guardedness and for one thing there was no heineccius this made these periods not only a relief to myself but a particular pleasure to my poor child when i came back about the hour appointed i would generally find her ready dressed and glowing with anticipation she would prolong their duration to the extreme seeming to dread as i did myself the hour of the return and there is scarce a field or waterside near leyden scarce a street or lane there where we have not lingered outside of these i bade her confine herself entirely to our lodgings this in the fear of her encountering any acquaintance which would have rendered our position very difficult from the same apprehension i would never suffer her to attend church nor even go myself but made some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own chamberi hope with an honest but i am quite sure with a very much divided mind indeed there was scarce anything that more affected me than thus to kneel down alone with her before god like man and wife  one day it was snowing downright hard i had thought it not possible that we should venture forth and was surprised to find her waiting for me ready dressed  i will not be doing without my walk she cried you are never a good boy davie in the house i will never be caring for you only in the open air i think we two will better turn egyptian and dwell by the roadside  that was the best walk yet of all of them she clung near to me in the falling snow it beat about and melted on us and the drops stood upon her bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling mouth strength seemed to come upon me with the sight like a giants i thought i could have caught her up and run with her into the uttermost places in the earth and we spoke together all that time beyond belief for freedom and sweetness  it was the dark night when we came to the house door she pressed my arm upon her bosom thank you kindly for these same good hours said she on a deep note of her voice  the concern in which i fell instantly on this address put me with the same swiftness on my guard and we were no sooner in the chamber and the light made than she beheld the old dour stubborn countenance of the student of heineccius doubtless she was more than usually hurt and i know for myself i found it more than usually difficult to maintain my strangeness even at the meal i durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her and it was no sooner over than i fell again to my civilian with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than before methought as iread i could hear my heart strike like an eightday clock hard as i feigned to study there was still some of my eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon catriona she sat on the floor by the side of my great mail and the chimney lighted her up and shone and blinked upon her and made her glow and darken through a wonder of fine hues now she would be gazing in the fire and then again at me and at that i would be plunged in a terror of myself and turn the pages of heineccius like a man looking for the text in church  suddenly she called out aloud o why does not my father come she cried and fell at once into a storm of tears  i leaped up flung heineccius fairly into the fire ran to her side and cast an arm around her sobbing body  she put me from her sharply you do not love your friend says she i could be so happy too if you would let me and then o what will i have done that you should hate me so  hate you cries i and held her firm you blind lass can you not see a little in my wretched heart do you think when i set there reading in that foolbook that i have just burned and be damned to it i take ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself night after night i could have grat to see you sitting there your lone and what was i to do you are here under my honour would you punish me for that is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant  at the word with a small sudden motion she clung near to me i raised her face to mine i kissed it and she bowed her brow upon my bosom clasping me tight i sat in a mere whirl like a man drunken then i heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes  did you kiss her truly she asked  there went through me so great a heave of surprise that i was all shook with it  miss grant i cried all in a disorder yes i asked her to kiss me goodbye the which she did  ah well said she you have kissed me too at all events  at the strangeness and sweetness of that word i saw where we had fallen rose and set her on her feet  this will never do said i this will never never do o catrine catrine then there came a pause in which i was debarred from any speaking and then go away to your bed said i go away to your bed and leave me  she turned to obey me like a little child and the next i knew of it had stopped in the very doorway  good night davie said she  and o good night my love i cried with a great outbreak of my soul and caught her to me again so that it seemed i must have broken her the next moment i had thrust her from the room shut to the door even with violence and stood alone  the milk was spilt now the word was out and the truth told i had crept like an untrusty man into the poor maids affections she was in my hand like any frail innocent thing to make or mar and what weapon of defence was left me it seemed like a symbol that heinoccius my old protection was now burned i repented yet could not find it in my heart to blame myself for that great failure it seemed not possible to have resisted the boldness of her innocence or that last temptation of her weeping and all that i had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the greaterit was upon a nature so defenceless and with such advantages of the position that i seemed to have practised  what was to become of us now it seemed we could no longer dwell in the one place but where was i to go or where she without either choice or fault of ours life had conspired to wall us together in that narrow place i had a wild thought of marrying out of hand and the next moment put it from me with revolt she was a child she could not tell her own heart i had surprised her weakness i must never go on to build on that surprisal i must keep her not only clear of reproach but free as she had come to me  down i sat before the fire and reflected and repented and beat my brains in vain for any means of escape about two of the morning there were three red embers left and the house and all the city was asleep when i was aware of a small sound of weeping in the next room she thought that i slept the poor soul she regretted her weaknessand what perhaps god help her she called her forwardnessand in the dead of the night solaced herself with tears tender and bitter feelings love and penitence and pity struggled in my soul it seemed i was under bond to heal that weeping  o try to forgive me i cried out try try to forgive me let us forget it all let us try if well no can forget it  there came no answer but the sobbing ceased i stood a long while with my hands still clasped as i had spoken then the cold of the night laid hold upon me with a shudder and i think my reason reawakened  you can make no hand of this davie thinks i to bed with you like a wise lad and try if you can sleep tomorrow you may see your way                                          chapter xxv  the return of james more   i was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a knocking on my door ran to open it and had almost swooned with the contrariety of my feelings mostly painful for on the threshold in a rough wrapraseal and an extraordinary big laced hat there stood james more  i ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture for there was a sense in which the man came like an answer to prayer i had been saying till my head was weary that catriona and i must separate and looking till my head ached for any possible means of separation here were the means come to me upon two legs and joy was the hindmost of my thoughts it is to be considered however that even if the weight of the future were lifted off me by the mans arrival the present heaved up the more black and menacing so that as i first stood before him in my shirt and breeches i believe i took a leaping step backward like a person shot  ah said he i have found you mr balfour and offered me his large fine hand the which recovering at the same time my post in the doorway as if with some thought of resistance i took him by doubtfully it is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle he continued i am owing you an apology for an unfortunate intrusion upon yours which i suffered myself to be entrapped into by my confidence in that falseface prestongrange i think shame to own to you that i was ever trusting to a lawyer he shrugged his shoulders with a very french air but indeed the man is very plausible says he and now it seems that you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter for whose direction i was remitted to yourself  i think sir said i with a very painful air that it will be necessary we two should have an explanation  there is nothing amiss he asked my agent mr sprott  for gods sake moderate your voice i cried she must not hear till we have had an explanation  she is in this place cries he  that is her chamber door said i  you are here with her alone he asked  and who else would i have got to stay with us cries i  i will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale  this is very unusual said he this is a very unusual circumstance you are right we must hold an explanation  so saying he passed me by and i must own the tall old rogue appeared at that moment extraordinary dignified he had now for the first time the view of my chamber which i scanned i may say with his eyes a bit of morning sun glinted in by the window pane and showed it off my bed my mails and washing dish with some disorder of my clothes and the unlighted chimney made the only plenishing no mistake but it looked bare and cold and the most unsuitable beggarly place conceivable to harbour a young lady at the same time came in on my mind the recollection of the clothes that i had bought for her and i thought this contrast of poverty and prodigality bore an ill appearance  he looked all about the chamber for a seat and finding nothing else to his purpose except my bed took a place upon the side of it where after i had closed the door i could not very well avoid joining him for however this extraordinary interview might end it must pass if possible without waking catriona and the one thing needful was that we should sit close and talk low but i can scarce picture what a pair we made he in his great coat which the coldness of my chamber made extremely suitable i shivering in my shirt and breeks he with very much the air of a judge and i whatever i looked with very much the feelings of a man who has heard the last trumpet  well says he  and well i began but found myself unable to go further  you tell me she is here said he again but now with a spice of impatiency that seemed to brace me up  she is in this house said i and i knew the circumstance would be called unusual but you are to consider how very unusual the whole business was from the beginning here is a young lady landed on the coast of europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny she is directed to yon man sprott in helvoet i hear you call him your agent all i can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at the mere mention of your name and i must fee him out of my own pocket even to receive the custody of her effects you speak of unusual circumstances mr drummond if that be the name you prefer here was a circumstance if you like to which it was barbarity to have exposed her  but this is what i cannot understand the least said james my daughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons whose names i have forgot  gebbie was the name said i and there is no doubt that mr gebbie should have gone ashore with her at helvoet but he did not mr drummond and i think you might praise god that i was there to offer in his place  i shall have a word to say to mr gebbie before done said he as for yourself i think it might have occurred that you were somewhat young for such a post  but the choice was not between me and somebody else it was between me and nobody i cried nobody offered in my place and i must say i think you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did  i shall wait until i understand my obligation a little more in the particular says he  indeed and i think it stares you in the face then said i your child was deserted she was clean flung away in the midst of europe with scarce two shillings and not two words of any language spoken there i must say a bonny business i brought her to this place i gave her the name and the tenderness due to a sister all this has not gone without expense but that i scarce need to hint at they were services due to the young ladys character which i respect and i think it would be a bonny business too if i was to be singing her praises to her father  you are a young man he began  so i hear you tell me said i with a good deal of heat  you are a very young man he repeated or you would have understood the significancy of the step  i think you speak very much at your ease cried i what else was i to do it is a fact i might have hired some decent poor woman to be a third to us and i declare i never thought of it until this moment but where was i to find her that am a foreigner myself and let me point out to your observation mr drummond that it would have cost me money out of my pocket for here is just what it comes to that i had to pay through the nose for your neglect and there is only the one story to it just that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your daughter  he that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones says he and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of miss drummond before we go on to sit in judgment on her father  but i will be entrapped into no such attitude said i the character of miss drummond is far above inquiry as her father ought to know so is mine and i am telling you that there are but the two ways of it open the one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to another and to say no more the other if you are so difficult as to be still dissatisfied is to pay me that which i have expended and be done  he seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air  there there said he you go too fast you go too fast mr balfour it is a good thing that i have learned to be more patient and i believe you forget that i have yet to see my daughter  i began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in the mans manner that i spied in him as soon as the name of money fell between us  i was thinking it would be more fitif you will excuse the plainness of my dressing in your presencethat i should go forth and leave you to encounter her alone said i  what i would have looked for at your hands says he and there was no mistake but what he said it civilly  i thought this better and better still and as i began to pull on my hose recalling the mans impudent mendicancy at prestongranges i determined to pursue what seemed to be my victory  if you have any mind to stay some while in leyden said i this room is very much at your disposal and i can easy find another for myself in which way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible there being only one to change  why sir said he making his bosom big i think no shame of a poverty i have come by in the service of my king i make no secret that my affairs are quite involved and for the moment it would be even impossible for me to undertake a journey  until you have occasion to communicate with your friends said i perhaps it might be convenient for you as of course it would be honourable to myself if you were to regard yourself in the light of my guest  sir said he when an offer is frankly made i think i honour myself most to imitate that frankness your hand mr david you have the character that i respect the most you are one of those from whom a gentleman can take a favour and no more words about it i am an old soldier he went on looking rather disgustedlike around my chamber and you need not fear i shall prove burthensome i have ate too often at a dykeside drank of the ditch and had no roof but the rain  i should be telling you said i that our breakfasts are sent customarily in about this time of morning i propose i should go now to the tavern and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal the matter of an hour which will give you an interval to meet your daughter in  methought his nostrils wagged at this o an hour says he that is perhaps superfluous half an hour mr david or say twenty minutes i shall do very well in that and by the way he adds detaining me by the coat what is it you drink in the morning whether ale or wine  to be frank with you sir says i i drink nothing else but spare cold water  tuttut says he that is fair destruction to the stomach take an old campaigners word for it our country spirit at home is perhaps the most entirely wholesome but as that is not comeatable rhenish or a white wine of burgundy will be next best  i shall make it my business to see you are supplied said i  why very good said he and we shall make a man of you yet mr david  by this time i can hardly say that i was minding him at all beyond an odd thought of the kind of fatherinlaw that he was like to prove and all my cares centred about the lass his daughter to whom i determined to convey some warning of her visitor i stepped to the door accordingly and cried through the panels knocking thereon at the same time miss drummond here is your father come at last  with that i went forth upon my errand having by two words extraordinarily damaged my affairs                                          chapter xxvi  the threesome   whether or not i was to be so much blamed or rather perhaps pitied i must leave others to judge of my shrewdness of which i have a good deal too seems not so great with the ladies no doubt at the moment when i awaked her i was thinking a good deal of the effect upon james more and similarly when i returned and we were all sat down to breakfast i continued to behave to the young lady with deference and distance as i still think to have been most wise her father had cast doubts upon the innocence of my friendship and these it was my first business to allay but there is a kind of an excuse for catriona also we had shared in a scene of some tenderness and passion and given and received caresses i had thrust her from me with violence i had called aloud upon her in the night from the one room to the other she had passed hours of wakefulness and weeping and it is not to be supposed i had been absent from her pillow thoughts upon the back of this to be awaked with unaccustomed formality under the name of miss drummond and to be thenceforth used with a great deal of distance and respect led her entirely in error on my private sentiments and she was indeed so incredibly abused as to imagine me repentant and trying to draw off  the trouble betwixt us seems to have been this that whereas i since i had first set eyes on his great hat thought singly of james more his return and suspicions she made so little of these that i may say she scarce remarked them and all her troubles and doings regarded what had passed between us in the night before this is partly to be explained by the innocence and boldness of her character and partly because james more having sped so ill in his interview with me or had his mouth closed by my invitation said no word to her upon the subject at the breakfast accordingly it soon appeared we were at cross purposes i had looked to find her in clothes of her own i found her as if her father were forgotten wearing some of the best that i had bought for her and which she knew or thought that i admired her in i had looked to find her imitate my affectation of distance and be most precise and formal instead i found her flushed and wildlike with eyes extraordinary bright and a painful and varying expression calling me by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness and referring and deferring to my thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected wife  but this was not for long as i beheld her so regardless of her own interests which i had jeopardised and was now endeavoring to recover i redoubled my own boldness in the manner of a lesson to the girl the more she came forward the further i drew back the more she betrayed the closeness of our intimacy the more pointedly civil i became until even her father if he had not been so engrossed with eating might have observed the opposition in the midst of which of a sudden she became wholly changed and i told myself with a good deal of relief that she had took the hint at last  all day i was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging and though the hour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands i cannot say but i was happy on the whole to find my way cleared the girl again in proper keeping the father satisfied or at least acquiescent and myself free to prosecute my love with honour at supper as at all our meals it was james more that did the talking no doubt but he talked well if anyone could have believed him but i will speak of him presently more at large the meal at an end he rose got his great coat and looking as i thought at me observed he had affairs abroad i took this for a hint that i was to be going also and got up whereupon the girl who had scarce given me greeting at my entrance turned her eyes on me wide open with a look that bade me stay i stood between them like a fish out of water turning from one to the other neither seemed to observe me she gazing on the floor he buttoning his coat which vastly swelled my embarrassment this appearance of indifferency argued upon her side a good deal of anger very near to burst out upon his i thought it horribly alarming i made sure there was a tempest brewing there and considering that to be the chief peril turned towards him and put myself so to speak in the mans hands  can i do anything for you mr drummond says i  he stifled a yawn which again i thought to be duplicity why mr david said he since you are so obliging as to propose it you might show me the way to a certain tavern of which he gave the name where i hope to fall in with some old companions in arms  there was no more to say and i got my hat and cloak to bear him company  and as for you he says to his daughter you had best go to your bed i shall be late home and early to bed and early to rise gars bonny lasses have bright eyes  whereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness and ushered me before him from the door this was so done i thought on purpose that it was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation but i observed she did not look at me and set it down to terror of james more  it was some distance to that tavern he talked all the way of matters which did not interest me the smallest and at the door dismissed me with empty manners thence i walked to my new lodging where i had not so much as a chimney to hold me warm and no society but my own thoughts these were still bright enough i did not so much as dream that catriona was turned against me i thought we were like folk pledged i thought we had been too near and spoke too warmly to be severed least of all by what were only steps in a most needful policy and the chief of my concern was only the kind of fatherinlaw that i was getting which was not at all the kind i would have chosen and the matter of how soon i ought to speak to him which was a delicate point on several sides in the first place when i thought how young i was i blushed all over and could almost have found it in my heart to have desisted only that if once i let them go from leyden without explanation i might lose her altogether and in the second place there was our very irregular situation to be kept in view and the rather scant measure of satisfaction i had given james more that morning i concluded on the whole that delay would not hurt anything yet i would not delay too long neither and got to my cold bed with a full heart  the next day as james more seemed a little on the complaining hand in the matter of my chamber i offered to have in more furniture and coming in the afternoon with porters bringing chairs and tables found the girl once more left to herself she greeted me on my admission civilly but withdrew at once to her own room of which she shut the door i made my disposition and paid and dismissed the men so that she might hear them go when i supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to me i waited yet awhile then knocked upon her door  catriona said i  the door was opened so quickly even before i had the word out that i thought she must have stood behind it listening she remained there in the interval quite still but she had a look that i cannot put a name on as of one in a bitter trouble  are we not to have our walk today either so i faltered  i am thanking you said she i will not be caring much to walk now that my father is come home  but i think he has gone out himself and left you here alone said i  and do you think that was very kindly said she asked  it was not unkindly meant i replied what ails you catriona what have i done to you that you should turn from me like this  i do not turn from you at all she said speaking very carefully i will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me i will ever be his friend in all that i am able but now that my father james more is come again there is a difference to be made and i think there are some things said and done that would be better to be forgotten but i will ever be your friend in all that i am able and if that is not all that    if it is not so much    not that you will be caring but i would not have you think of me too hard it was true what you said to me that i was too young to be advised and i am hoping you will remember i was just a child i would not like to lose your friendship at all events  she began this very pale but before she was done the blood was in her face like scarlet so that not her words only but her face and the trembling of her very hands besought me to be gentle i saw for the first time how very wrong i had done to place the child in that position where she had been entrapped into a moments weakness and now stood before me like a person shamed  miss drummond i said and stuck and made the same beginning once again i wish you could see into my heart i cried you would read there that my respect is undiminished if that were possible i should say it was increased this is but the result of the mistake we made and had to come and the less said of it now the better of all of our life here i promise you it shall never pass my lips i would like to promise you too that i would never think of it but its a memory that will be always dear to me and as for a friend you have one here that would die for you  i am thanking you said she  we stood awhile silent and my sorrow for myself began to get the upper hand for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble and my love lost and myself alone again in the world as at the beginning  well said i we shall be friends always thats a certain thing but this is a kind of a farewell too its a kind of a farewell after all i shall always ken miss drummond but this is a farewell to my catriona  i looked at her i could hardly say i saw her but she seemed to grow great and brighten in my eyes and with that i suppose i must have lost my head for i called out her name again and made a step at her with my hands reached forth  she shrank back like a person struck her face flamed but the blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks than what it flowed back upon my own heart at sight of it with penitence and concern i found no words to excuse myself but bowed before her very deep and went my ways out of the house with death in my bosom  i think it was about five days that followed without any change i saw her scarce ever but at meals and then of course in the company of james more if we were alone even for a moment i made it my devoir to behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions having always in my minds eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming in a blush and in my heart more pity for her than i could depict in words i was sorry enough for myself i need not dwell on that having fallen all my length and more than all my height in a few seconds but indeed i was near as sorry for the girl and sorry enough to be scarce angry with her save by fits and starts her plea was good she was but a child she had been placed in an unfair position if she had deceived herself and me it was no more than was to have been looked for  and for another thing she was now very much alone her father when he was by was rather a caressing parent but he was very easy led away by his affairs and pleasures neglected her without compunction or remark spent his nights in taverns when he had the money which was more often than i could at all account for and even in the course of these few days failed once to come to a meal which catriona and i were at last compelled to partake of without him it was the evening meal and i left immediately that i had eaten observing i supposed she would prefer to be alone to which she agreed and strange as it may seem i quite believed her indeed i thought myself but an eyesore to the girl and a reminder of a moments weakness that she now abhorred to think of so she must sit alone in that room where she and i had been so merry and in the blink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many difficult and tender moments there she must sit alone and think of herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly proffered her affections and had the same rejected and in the meanwhile i would be alone some other place and reading myself whenever i was tempted to be angry lessons upon human frailty and female delicacy and altogether i suppose there were never two poor fools made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception  as for james he paid not so much heed to us or to anything in nature but his pocket and his belly and his own prating talk before twelve hours were gone he had raised a small loan of me before thirty he had asked for a second and been refused money and refusal he took with the same kind of high goodnature indeed he had an outside air of magnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon a daughter and the light in which he was constantly presented in his talk and the mans fine presence and great ways went together pretty harmoniously so that a man that had no business with him and either very little penetration or a furious deal of prejudice might almost have been taken in to me after my first two interviews he was as plain as print i saw him to be perfectly selfish with a perfect innocency in the same and i would harken to his swaggering talk of arms and an old soldier and a poor highland gentleman and the strength of my country and my friends as i might to the babbling of a parrot  the odd thing was that i fancy he believed some part of it himself or did at times i think he was so false all through that he scarce knew when he was lying and for one thing his moments of dejection must have been wholly genuine there were times when he would be the most silent affectionate clinging creature possible holding catrionas hand like a big baby and begging of me not to leave if i had any love to him of which indeed i had none but all the more to his daughter he would press and indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk a thing very difficult in the state of our relations and again break forth in pitiable regrets for his own land and friends or into gaelic singing  this is one of the melancholy airs of my native land he would say you may think it strange to see a soldier weep and indeed it is to make a near friend of you says he but the notes of this singing are in my blood and the words come out of my heart and when i mind upon my red mountains and the wild birds calling there and the brave streams of water running down i would scarce think shame to weep before my enemies then he would sing again and translate to me pieces of the song with a great deal of boggling and much expressed contempt against the english language it says here he would say that the sun is gone down and the battle is at an end and the brave chiefs are defeated and it tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange countries or lying dead on the red mountain and they will never more shout the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley but if you had only some of this language you would weep also because the words of it are beyond all expression and it is mere mockery to tell you it in english  well i thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business one way and another and yet there was some feeling too for which i hated him i think the worst of all and it used to cut me to the quick to see catriona so much concerned for the old rogue and weeping herself to see him weep when i was sure onehalf of his distress flowed from his last nights drinking in some tavern there were times when i was tempted to lend him a round sum and see the last of him for good but this would have been to see the last of catriona as well for which i was scarcely so prepared and besides it went against my conscience to squander my good money on one who was so little of a husband                                          chapter xxvii  a twosome   i believe it was about the fifth day and i know at least that james was in one of his fits of gloom when i received three letters the first was from alan offering to visit me in leyden the other two were out of scotland and prompted by the same affair which was the death of my uncle and my own complete accession to my rights rankeillors was of course wholly in the business view miss grants was like herself a little more witty than wise full of blame to me for not having written though how was i to write with such intelligence and of rallying talk about catriona which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence  for it was of course in my own rooms that i found them when i came to dinner so that i was surprised out of my news in the very first moment of reading it this made a welcome diversion for all three of us nor could any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued it was accident that brought the three letters the same day and that gave them into my hand in the same room with james more and of all the events that flowed from that accident and which i might have prevented if i had held my tongue the truth is that they were preordained before agricola came into scotland or abraham set out upon his travels  the first that i opened was naturally alans and what more natural than that i should comment on his design to visit me but i observed james to sit up with an air of immediate attention  is that not alan breck that was suspected of the appin accident he inquired  i told him ay it was the same and he withheld me some time from my other letters asking of our acquaintance of alans manner of life in france of which i knew very little and further of his visit as now proposed  all we forfeited folk hang a little together he explained and besides i know the gentleman and though his descent is not the thing and indeed he has no true right to use the name of stewart he was very much admired in the day of drummossie he did there like a soldier if some that need not be named had done as well the upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember there were two that did their best that day and it makes a bond between the pair of us says he  i could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him and could almost have wished that alan had been there to have inquired a little further into that mention of his birth though they tell me the same was indeed not wholly regular  meanwhile i had opened miss grants and could not withhold an exclamation  catriona i cried forgetting the first time since her father was arrived to address her by a handle i am come into my kingdom fairly i am the laird of shaws indeedmy uncle is dead at last  she clapped her hands together leaping from her seat the next moment it must have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was left to either and we stood opposite staring on each other sadly  but james showed himself a ready hypocrite my daughter says he is this how my cousin learned you to behave mr david has lost a near friend and we should first condole with him on his bereavement  troth sir said i turning to him in a kind of anger i can make no such faces his death is as blythe news as ever i got  its a good soldiers philosophy says james tis the way of flesh we must all go all go and if the gentleman was so far from your favour why very well but we may at least congratulate you on your accession to your estates  nor can i say that either i replied with the same heat it is a good estate what matters that to a lone man that has enough already i had a good revenue before in my frugality and but for the mans deathwhich gratifies me shame to me that must confess iti see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change  come come said he you are more affected than you let on or you would never make yourself out so lonely here are three letters that means three that wish you well and i could name two more here in this very chamber i have known you not so very long but catriona when we are alone is never done with the singing of your praises  she looked up at him a little wild at that and he slid off at once into another matter the extent of my estate which during the most of the dinner time he continued to dwell upon with interest but it was to no purpose he dissembled he had touched the matter with too gross a hand and i knew what to expect dinner was scarce ate when he plainly discovered his designs he reminded catriona of an errand and bid her attend to it i do not see you should be gone beyond the hour he added and friend david will be good enough to bear me company till you return she made haste to obey him without words i do not know if she understood i believe not but i was completely satisfied and sat strengthening my mind for what should follow  the door had scarce closed behind her departure when the man leaned back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness only the one thing betrayed him and that was his face which suddenly shone all over with fine points of sweat  i am rather glad to have a word alone with you says he because in our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and i have long meant to set you right upon my daughter stands beyond doubt so do you and i would make that good with my sword against all gainsayers but my dear david this world is a censorious placeas who should know it better than myself who have lived ever since the days of my late departed father god sain him in a perfect spate of calumnies we have to face to that you and me have to consider of that we have to consider of that and he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit  to what effect mr drummond said i i would be obliged to you if you would approach your point  ay ay says he laughing like your character indeed and what i most admire in it but the point my worthy fellow is sometimes in a kittle bit he filled a glass of wine though between you and me that are such fast friends it need not bother us long the point i need scarcely tell you is my daughter and the first thing is that i have no thought in my mind of blaming you in the unfortunate circumstances what could you do else deed and i cannot tell  i thank you for that said i pretty close upon my guard  i have besides studied your character he went on your talents are fair you seem to have a moderate competence which does no harm and one thing with another i am very happy to have to announce to you that i have decided on the latter of the two ways open  i am afraid i am dull said i what ways are these  he bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs why sir says he i think i need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your condition either that i should cut your throat or that you should marry my daughter  you are pleased to be quite plain at last said i  and i believe i have been plain from the beginning cries he robustiously i am a careful parent mr balfour but i thank god a patient and deleeberate man there is many a father sir that would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field my esteem for your character  mr drummond i interrupted if you have any esteem for me at all i will beg of you to moderate your voice it is quite needless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best attention  why very true says he with an immediate change and you must excuse the agitations of a parent  i understand you then i continuedfor i will take no note of your other alternative which perhaps it was a pity you let falli understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case i should desire to apply for your daughters hand  it is not possible to express my meaning better said he and i see we shall do well together  that remains to be yet seen said i but so much i need make no secret of that i bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection and i could not fancy even in a dream a better fortune than to get her  i was sure of it i felt certain of you david he cried and reached out his hand to me  i put it by you go too fast mr drummond said i there are conditions to be made and there is a difficulty in the path which i see not entirely how we shall come over i have told you that upon my side there is no objection to the marriage but i have good reason to believe there will be much on the young ladys  this is all beside the mark says he i will engage for her acceptance  i think you forget mr drummond said i that even in dealing with myself you have been betrayed into twothree unpalatable expressions i will have none such employed to the young lady i am here to speak and think for the two of us and i give you to understand that i would no more let a wife be forced upon myself than what i would let a husband be forced on the young lady  he sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper  so that this is to be the way of it i concluded i will marry miss drummond and that blythely if she is entirely willing but if there be the least unwillingness as i have reason to fearmarry her will i never  well well said he this is a small affair as soon as she returns i will sound her a bit and hope to reassure you  but i cut in again not a finger of you mr drummond or i cry off and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else said i it is i that am to be the only dealer and the only judge i shall satisfy myself exactly and none else shall anyways meddleyou the least of all  upon my word sir he exclaimed and who are you to be the judge  the bridegroom i believe said i  this is to quibble he cried you turn your back upon the facts the girl my daughter has no choice left to exercise her character is gone  and i ask your pardon said i but while this matter lies between her and you and me that is not so  what security have i he cried am i to let my daughters reputation depend upon a chance  you should have thought of all this long ago said i before you were so misguided as to lose her and not afterwards when it is quite too late i refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect and i will be browbeat by no man living my mind is quite made up and come what may i will not depart from it a hairs breadth you and me are to sit here in company till her return upon which without either word or look from you she and i are to go forth again to hold our talk if she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step i will then make it and if she cannot i will not  he leaped out of his seat like a man stung i can spy your manoeuvre he cried you would work upon her to refuse  maybe ay and maybe no said i that is the way it is to be whatever  and if i refuse cries he  then mr drummond it will have to come to the throatcutting said i  what with the size of the man his great length of arm in which he came near rivalling his father and his reputed skill at weapons i did not use this word without some trepidation to say nothing at all of the circumstance that he was catrionas father but i might have spared myself alarms from the poorness of my lodginghe does not seem to have remarked his daughters dresses which were indeed all equally new to himand from the fact that i had shown myself averse to lend he had embraced a strong idea of my poverty the sudden news of my estate convinced him of his error and he had made but the one bound of it on this fresh venture to which he was now so wedded that i believe he would have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of fighting  a little while longer he continued to dispute with me until i hit upon a word that silenced him  if i find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself said i i must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about her unwillingness  he gabbled some kind of an excuse  but all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers i added and i think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence  the which we did until the girl returned and i must suppose would have cut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view us                                          chapter xxviii  in which i am left alone   i opened the door to catriona and stopped her on the threshold  your father wishes us to take our walk said i  she looked to james more who nodded and at that like a trained soldier she turned to go with me  we took one of our old ways where we had gone often together and been more happy than i can tell of in the past i came a half a step behind so that i could watch her unobserved the knocking of her little shoes upon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad and i thought it a strange moment that i should be so near both ends of it at once and walk in the midst between two destinies and could not tell whether i was hearing these steps for the last time or whether the sound of them was to go in and out with me till death should part us  she avoided even to look at me only walked before her like one who had a guess of what was coming i saw i must speak soon before my courage was run out but where to begin i knew not in this painful situation when the girl was as good as forced into my arms and had already besought my forbearance any excess of pressure must have seemed indecent yet to avoid it wholly would have a very coldlike appearance between these extremes i stood helpless and could have bit my fingers so that when at last i managed to speak at all it may be said i spoke at random  catriona said i i am in a very painful situation or rather so we are both and i would be a good deal obliged to you if you would promise to let me speak through first of all and not to interrupt till i have done  she promised me that simply  well said i this that i have got to say is very difficult and i know very well i have no right to be saying it after what passed between the two of us last friday i have no manner of right we have got so ravelled up and all by my fault that i know very well the least i could do is just to hold my tongue which was what i intended fully and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you again but my dear it has become merely necessary and no way by it you see this estate of mine has fallen in which makes me rather a better match and thethe business would not have quite the same ridiculouslike appearance that it would before besides which its supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up as i was saying that it would be better to let them be the way they are in my view this part of the thing is vastly exaggerate and if i were you i would not wear two thoughts on it only its right i should mention the same because theres no doubt it has some influence on james more then i think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before i think we did pretty well together if you would look back my dear  i will look neither back nor forward she interrupted tell me the one thing this is my fathers doing  he approves of it said i he approved that i should ask your hand in marriage and was going on again with somewhat more of an appeal upon her feelings but she marked me not and struck into the midst  he told you to she cried it is no sense denying it you said yourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts he told you to  he spoke of it the first if that is what you mean i began  she was walking ever the faster and looking fair in front of her but at this she made a little noise in her head and i thought she would have run  without which i went on after what you said last friday i would never have been so troublesome as make the offer but when he as good as asked me what was i to do  she stopped and turned round upon me  well it is refused at all events she cried and there will be an end of that  and she began to walk forward  i suppose i could expect no better said i but i think you might try to be a little kind to me for the last end of it i see not why you should be harsh i have loved you very well catrionano harm that i should call you so for the last time i have done the best that i could manage i am trying the same still and only vexed that i can do no better it is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to be hard to me  i am not thinking of you she said i am thinking of that man my father  well and that way too said i i can be of use to you that way too i will have to be it is very needful my dear that we should consult about your father for the way this talk has gone an angry man will be james more  she stopped again it is because i am disgraced she asked  that is what he is thinking i replied but i have told you already to make nought of it  it will be all one to me she cried i prefer to be disgraced  i did not know very well what to answer and stood silent  there seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last cry presently she broke out and what is the meaning of all this why is all this shame loundered on my head how could you dare it david balfour  my dear said i what else was i to do  i am not your dear she said and i defy you to be calling me these words  i am not thinking of my words said i my heart bleeds for you miss drummond whatever i may say be sure you have my pity in your difficult position but there is just the one thing that i wish you would bear in view if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly for there is going to be a collieshangie when we two get home take my word for it it will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace  ay said she there sprang a patch of red in either of her cheeks was he for fighting you said she  well he was that said i  she gave a dreadful kind of laugh at all events it is complete she cried and then turning on me my father and i are a fine pair she said but i am thanking the good god there will be somebody worse than what we are i am thanking the good god that he has let me see you so there will never be the girl made that would not scorn you  i had borne a good deal pretty patiently but this was over the mark  you have no right to speak to me like that said i what have i done but to be good to you or try to and here is my repayment o it is too much  she kept looking at me with a hateful smile coward said she  the word in your throat and in your fathers i cried i have dared him this day already in your interest i will dare him again the nasty polecat little i care which of us should fall come said i back to the house with us let us be done with it let me be done with the whole hieland crew of you you will see what you think when i am dead  she shook her head at me with that same smile i could have struck her for  o smile away i cried i have seen your bonny father smile on the wrong side this day not that i mean he was afraid of course i added hastily but he preferred the other way of it  what is this she asked  when i offered to draw with him said i  you offered to draw upon james more she cried  and i did so said i and found him backward enough or how would we be here  there is a meaning upon this said she what is it you are meaning  he was to make you take me i replied and i would not have it i said you should be free and i must speak with you alone little i supposed it would be such a speaking and what if i refuse says hethen it must come to the throat cutting says i for i will no more have a husband forced on that young lady than what i would have a wife forced upon myself these were my words they were a friends words bonnily have i been paid for them now you have refused me of your own clear free will and there lives no father in the highlands or out of them that can force on this marriage i will see that your wishes are respected i will make the same my business as i have all through but i think you might have that decency as to affect some gratitude deed and i thought you knew me better i have not behaved quite well to you but that was weakness and to think me a coward and such a coward as thato my lass there was a stab for the last of it  davie how would i guess she cried o this is a dreadful business me and mineshe gave a kind of wretched cry at the wordme and mine are not fit to speak to you o i could be kneeling down to you in the street i could be kissing your hands for your forgiveness  i will keep the kisses i have got from you already cried i i will keep the ones i wanted and that were something worth i will not be kissed in penitence  what can you be thinking of this miserable girl says she  what i am trying to tell you all this while said i that you had best leave me alone whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried and turn your attention to james more your father with whom you are like to have a queer pirn to wind  o that i must be going out into the world alone with such a man she cried and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort but trouble yourself no more for that said she he does not know what kind of nature is in my heart he will pay me dear for this day of it dear dear will he pay  she turned and began to go home and i to accompany her at which she stopped  i will be going alone she said it is alone i must be seeing him  some little while i raged about the streets and told myself i was the worst used lad in christendom anger choked me it was all very well for me to breathe deep it seemed there was not air enough about leyden to supply me and i thought i would have burst like a man at the bottom of the sea i stopped and laughed at myself at a street corner a minute together laughing out loud so that a passenger looked at me which brought me to myself  well i thought i have been a gull and a ninny and a soft tommy long enough time it was done here is a good lesson to have nothing to do with that accursed sex that was the ruin of the man in the beginning and will be so to the end god knows i was happy enough before ever i saw her god knows i can be happy enough again when i have seen the last of her  that seemed to me the chief affair to see them go i dwelled upon the idea fiercely and presently slipped on in a kind of malevolence to consider how very poorly they were like to fare when davie balfour was no longer by to be their milkcow at which to my own very great surprise the disposition of my mind turned bottom up i was still angry i still hated her and yet i thought i owed it to myself that she should suffer nothing  this carried me home again at once where i found the mails drawn out and ready fastened by the door and the father and daughter with every mark upon them of a recent disagreement catriona was like a wooden doll james more breathed hard his face was dotted with white spots and his nose upon one side as soon as i came in the girl looked at him with a steady clear dark look that might very well have been followed by a blow it was a hint that was more contemptuous than a command and i was surprised to see james more accept it it was plain he had had a master talkingto and i could see there must be more of the devil in the girl than i had guessed and more goodhumor about the man than i had given him the credit of  he began at least calling me mr balfour and plainly speaking from a lesson but he got not very far for at the first pompous swell of his voice catriona cut in  i will tell you what james more is meaning said she he means we have come to you beggarfolk and have not behaved to you very well and we are ashamed of our ingratitude and illbehaviour now we are wanting to go away and be forgotten and my father will have guided his gear so ill that we cannot even do that unless you will give us some more alms for that is what we are at all events beggarfolk and sorners  by your leave miss drummond said i i must speak to your father by myself  she went into her own room and shut the door without a word or a look  you must excuse her mr balfour says james more she has no delicacy  i am not here to discuss that with you said i but to be quit of you and to that end i must talk of your position now mr drummond i have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for i know you had money of your own when you were borrowing mine i know you have had more since you were here in leyden though you concealed it even from your daughter  i bid you beware i will stand no more baiting he broke out i am sick of her and you what kind of a damned trade is this to be a parent i have had expressions used to me there he broke off sir this is the heart of a soldier and a parent he went on again laying his hand on his bosom outraged in both charactersand i bid you beware  if you would have let me finish says i you would have found i spoke for your advantage  my dear friend he cried i know i might have relied upon the generosity of your character  man will you let me speak said i the fact is that i cannot win to find out if you are rich or poor but it is my idea that your means as they are mysterious in their source so they are something insufficient in amount and i do not choose your daughter to be lacking if i durst speak to herself you may be certain i would never dream of trusting it to you because i know you like the back of my hand and all your blustering talk is that much wind to me however i believe in your way you do still care something for your daughter after all and i must just be doing with that ground of confidence such as it is  whereupon i arranged with him that he was to communicate with me as to his whereabouts and catrionas welfare in consideration of which i was to serve him a small stipend  he heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness and when it was done my dear fellow my dear son he cried out this is more like yourself than any of it yet i will serve you with a soldiers faithfulness  let me hear no more of it says i you have got me to that pitch that the bare name of soldier rises on my stomach our traffic is settled i am now going forth and will return in one halfhour when i expect to find my chambers purged of you  i gave them good measure of time it was my one fear that i might see catriona again because tears and weakness were ready in my heart and i cherished my anger like a piece of dignity perhaps an hour went by the sun had gone down a little wisp of a new moon was following it across a scarlet sunset already there were stars in the east and in my chambers when at last i entered them the night lay blue i lit a taper and reviewed the rooms in the first there remained nothing so much as to awake a memory of those who were gone but in the second in a corner of the floor i spied a little heap that brought my heart into my mouth she had left behind at her departure all that ever she had of me it was the blow that i felt sorest perhaps because it was the last and i fell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more foolish than i care to tell of  late in the night in a strict frost and my teeth chattering i came again by some portion of my manhood and considered with myself the sight of these poor frocks and ribbons and her shifts and the clocked stockings was not to be endured and if i were to recover any constancy of mind i saw i must be rid of them ere the morning it was my first thought to have made a fire and burned them but my disposition has always been opposed to wastery for one thing and for another to have burned these things that she had worn so close upon her body seemed in the nature of a cruelty there was a corner cupboard in that chamber there i determined to bestow them the which i did and made it a long business folding them with very little skill indeed but the more care and sometimes dropping them with my tears all the heart was gone out of me i was weary as though i had run miles and sore like one beaten when as i was folding a kerchief that she wore often at her neck i observed there was a corner neatly cut from it it was a kerchief of a very pretty hue on which i had frequently remarked and once that she had it on i remembered telling her by way of a banter that she wore my colours there came a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness in my bosom and the next moment i was plunged back in a fresh despair for there was the corner crumpled in a knot and cast down by itself in another part of the floor  but when i argued with myself i grew more hopeful she had cut that corner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender that she had cast it away again was little to be wondered at and i was inclined to dwell more upon the first than upon the second and to be more pleased that she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake than concerned because she had flung it from her in an hour of natural resentment                                          chapter xxix  we meet in dunkirk   altogether then i was scarce so miserable the next days but what i had many hopeful and happy snatches threw myself with a good deal of constancy upon my studies and made out to endure the time till alan should arrive or i might hear word of catriona by the means of james more i had altogether three letters in the time of our separation one was to announce their arrival in the town of dunkirk in france from which place james shortly after started alone upon a private mission this was to england and to see lord holderness and it has always been a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same but he has need of a long spoon who sups with the deil or james more either during this absence the time was to fall due for another letter and as the letter was the condition of his stipend he had been so careful as prepare it beforehand and leave it with catriona to be despatched the fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions and he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal what i received began accordingly in the writing of james more  my dear siryour esteemed favour came to hand duly and i have to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement it shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter who is well and desires to be remembered to her dear friend i find her in rather a melancholy disposition but trusts in the mercy of grod to see her reestablished our manner of life is very much alone but we solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains and by walking upon the margin of the sea that lies next to scotland it was better days with me when i lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of gladsmuir i have found employment here in the haras of a french nobleman where my experience is valued but my dear sir the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that i would be ashamed to mention them which makes your remittances the more necessary to my daughters comfort though i daresay the sight of old friends would be still better  my dear sir your affectionate obedient servant  james macgregor drummond  below it began again in the hand of catriona      do not be believing him it is all lies together     cmd  not only did she add this postcript but i think she must have come near suppressing the letter for it came long after date and was closely followed by the third in the time betwixt them alan had arrived and made another life to me with his merry conversation i had been presented to his cousin of the scotsdutch a man that drank more than i could have thought possible and was not otherwise of interest i had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself all with no great change upon my sorrow and we two by which i mean alan and myself and not at all the cousin had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with james more and his daughter i was naturally diffident to give particulars and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of alans commentary upon those i gave  i cannae make head nor tail of it he would say but it sticks in my mind yeve made a gowk of yourself theres few people that has had more experience than alan breck and i can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours the way that you tell it the things fair impossible ye must have made a terrible hash of the business david  there are whiles that i am of the same mind said i  the strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of a fancy for her too said alan  the biggest kind alan said i and i think ill take it to my grave with me  well ye beat me whatever he would conclude  i showed him the letter with catrionas postcript and here again he cried impossible to deny a kind of decency to this catriona and sense forby as for james more the mans as boss as a drum hes just a wame and a wheen words though ill can never deny that he fought reasonably well at gladsmuir and its true what he says here about the five wounds but the loss of him is that the mans boss  ye see alan said i it goes against the grain with me to leave the maid in such poor hands  ye couldnae weel find poorer he admitted but what are ye to do with it its this way about a man and a woman ye see davie the weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them either they like the man and then a goes fine or else they just detest him and ye may spare your breathye can do naething theres just the two sets of themthem that would sell their coats for ye and them that never look the road yere on thats a that there is to women and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither  well and im afraid thats true for me said i  and yet theres naething easier cried alan i could easy learn ye the science of the thing but ye seem to me to be born blind and theres where the diffeeculty comes in  and can you no help me i asked you thats so clever at the trade  ye see david i wasnae here said he im like a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and éclaireurs and what would he ken but it sticks in my mind that yell have made some kind of bauchle and if i was you i would have a try at her again  would ye so man alan said i  i would eent says he  the third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion james professed to be in some concern upon his daughters health which i believe was never better abounded in kind expressions to myself and finally proposed that i should visit them at dunkirk  you will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade mr stewart he wrote why not accompany him so far in his return to france i have something very particular for mr stewarts ear and at any rate i would be pleased to meet in with an old fellowsoldier and one so mettle as himself as for you my dear sir my daughter and i would be proud to receive our benefactor whom we regard as a brother and a son the french nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character and i have been necessitate to leave the haras you will find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the auberge of a man bazin on the dunes but the situation is caller and i make no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days when mr stewart and i could recall our services and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting your age i beg at least that mr stewart would come here my business with him opens a very wide door  what does the man want with me cried alan when he had read what he wants with you is clear enoughits siller but what can he want with alan breck  o itll be just an excuse said i he is still after this marriage which i wish from my heart that we could bring about and he asks you because he thinks i would be less likely to come wanting you  well i wish that i kent says alan him and me were never onyways pack we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers something for my ear quo he ill maybe have something for his hinder end before were through with it dod im thinking it would be a kind of a divertisement to gang and see what hell be after forby that i could see your lassie then what say ye davie will ye ride with alan  you may be sure i was not backward and alans furlough running towards an end we set forth presently upon this joint adventure  it was near dark of a january day when we rode at last into the town of dunkirk we left our horses at the post and found a guide to bazins inn which lay beyond the walls night was quite fallen so that we were the last to leave that fortress and heard the doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge on the other side there lay a lighted suburb which we thridded for a while then turned into a dark lane and presently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of the sea we travelled in this fashion for some while following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice and i had begun to think he was perhaps misleading us when we came to the top of a small brae and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a window  voilà lauberge à bazin says the guide  alan smacked his lips an unco lonely bit said he and i thought by his tone he was not wholly pleased  a little after and we stood in the lower storey of the house which was all in the one apartment with a stair leading to the chambers at the side benches and tables by the wall the cooking fire at the one end of it and shelves of bottles and the cellartrap at the other here bazin who was an illlooking big man told us the scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where but the young lady was above and he would call her down to us  i took from my breast the kerchief wanting the corner and knotted it about my throat i could hear my heart go and alan patting me on the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions i could scarce refrain from a sharp word but the time was not long to wait i heard her step pass overhead and saw her on the stair this she descended very quietly and greeted me with a pale face and certain seeming of earnestness or uneasiness in her manner that extremely dashed me  my father james more will be here soon he will be very pleased to see you she said and then of a sudden her face flamed her eyes lightened the speech stopped upon her lips and i made sure she had observed the kerchief it was only for a breath that she was discomposed but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to welcome alan and you will be his friend alan breck she cried many is the dozen times i will have heard him tell of you and i love you already for all your bravery and goodness  well well says alan holding her hand in his and viewing her and so this is the young lady at the last of it david youre an awful poor hand of a description  i do not know that ever i heard him speak so straight to peoples hearts the sound of his voice was like song  what will he have been describing me she cried  little else of it since i ever came out of france says he forby a bit of speciment one night in scotland in a shaw of wood by silvermills but cheer up my dear yere bonnier than what he said and now theres one thing sure you and me are to be a pair of friends im a kind of a henchman to davie here im like a tyke at his heels and whatever he cares for ive got to care for tooand by the holy airn theyve got to care for me so now you can see what way you stand with alan breck and yell find yell hardly lose on the transaction hes no very bonnie my dear but hes leal to them he loves  i thank you with my heart for your good words said she i have that honour for a brave honest man that i cannot find any to be answering with  using travellers freedom we spared to wait for james more and sat down to meat we threesome alan had catriona sit by him and wait upon his wants he made her drink first out of his glass he surrounded her with continual kind gallantries and yet never gave me the most small occasion to be jealous and he kept the talk so much in his own hand and that in so merry a note that neither she nor i remembered to be embarrassed if any one had seen us there it must have been supposed that alan was the old friend and i the stranger indeed i had often cause to love and to admire the man but i never loved or admired him better than that night and i could not help remarking to myself what i was sometimes rather in danger of forgetting that he had not only much experience of life but in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides as for catriona she seemed quite carried away her laugh was like a peal of bells her face gay as a may morning and i own although i was very well pleased yet i was a little sad also and thought myself a dull stockish character in comparison of my friend and very unfit to come into a young maids life and perhaps ding down her gaiety  but if that was like to be my part i found at least that i was not alone in it for james more returning suddenly the girl was changed into a piece of stone through the rest of that evening until she made an excuse and slipped to bed i kept an eye upon her without cease and i can bear testimony that she never smiled scarce spoke and looked mostly on the board in front of her so that i really marvelled to see so much devotion as it used to be changed into the very sickness of hate  of james more it is unnecessary to say much you know the man already what there was to know of him and i am weary of writing out his lies enough that he drank a great deal and told us very little that was to any possible purpose as for the business with alan that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private hearing  it was the more easy to be put off because alan and i were pretty weary with our days ride and sat not very late after catriona  we were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make shift with a single bed alan looked on me with a queer smile  ye muckle ass said he  what do ye mean by that i cried  mean what do i mean its extraordinar david man says he that you should be so mortal stupit  again i begged him to speak out  well its this of it said he i told ye there were the two kinds of womenthem that would sell their shifts for ye and the others just you try for yoursel my bonny man i but whats that neepkin at your craig  i told him  i thocht it was something there about said he  nor would he say another word though i besieged him long with importunities                                          chapter xxx  the letter from the ship   daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood it was plainly hard upon the sea yet out of all view of it and beset on every side with scabbit hills of sand there was indeed only one thing in the nature of a prospect where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill like an asss ears but with the ass quite hidden it was strange after the wind rose for at first it was dead calm to see the turning and following of each other of these great sails behind the hillock scarce any road came by there but a number of footways travelled among the bents in all directions up to mr bazins door the truth is he was a man of many trades not any one of them honest and the position of his inn was the best of his livelihood smugglers frequented it political agents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await their passages and i daresay there was worse behind for a whole family might have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser  i slept little and ill long ere it was day i had slipped from beside my bedfellow and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro before the door dawn broke mighty sullen but a little after sprang up a wind out of the west which burst the clouds let through the sun and set the mill to the turning there was something of spring in the sunshine or else it was in my heart and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind the hill diverted me extremely at times i could hear a creak of the machinery and by halfpast eight of the day catriona began to sing in the house at this i would have cast my hat in the air and i thought this dreary desert place was like a paradise  for all which as the day drew on and nobody came near i began to be aware of an uneasiness that i could scarce explain it seemed there was trouble afoot the sails of the windmill as they came up and went down over the hill were like persons spying and outside of all fancy it was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought to dwell in  at breakfast which we took late it was manifest that james more was in some danger or perplexity manifest that alan was alive to the same and watched him close and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side and vigilance upon the other held me on live coals the meal was no sooner over than james seemed to come to a resolve and began to make apologies he had an appointment of a private nature in the town it was with the french nobleman he told me and we would please excuse him till about noon meanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen without much inclination  i am caring less and less about this man james said alan theres something no right with the man james and i wouldnae wonder but what alan breck would give an eye to him this day i would like fine to see yon french nobleman davie and i daresay you could find an employ to yoursel and that would be to speer at the lassie for some news of your affair just tell it to her plainlytell her yere a muckle ass at the offset and then if i were you and ye could do it naitural i would just mint to her i was in some kind of a danger a weemenfolk likes that  i cannae lee alan i cannae do it naitural says i mocking him  the more fool you says he then yell can tell her that i recommended it thatll set her to the laughing and i wouldnae wonder but what that was the next best but see to the pair of them if i didnae feel just sure of the lassie and that she was awful pleased and chief with alan i would think there was some kind of hocuspocus about yon  and is she so pleased with ye then alan i asked  she thinks a heap of me says he and im no like you im one that can tell that she doesshe thinks a heap of alan and troth im thinking a good deal of him mysel and with your permission shaws ill be getting a wee yont amang the bents so that i can see what way james goes  one after another went till i was left alone beside the breakfast table james to dunkirk alan dogging him catriona up the stairs to her own chamber i could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone with me yet was none the better pleased with it for that and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned upon the whole the best appeared to me to do like alan if i was out of view among the sand hills the fine morning would decoy her out and once i had her in the open i could please myself  no sooner said than done nor was i long under the bield of a hillock before she appeared at the inn door looked here and there and seeing nobody set out by a path that led directly seaward and by which i followed her i was in no haste to make my presence known the further she went i made sure of the longer hearing to my suit and the ground being all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard the path rose and came at last to the head of a knowe thence i had a picture for the first time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in where was no man to be seen nor any house of man except just bazins and the windmill only a little further on the sea appeared and two or three ships upon it pretty as a drawing one of these was extremely close in to be so great a vessel and i was aware of a shock of new suspicion when i recognized the trim of the seahorse what should an english ship be doing so near in france why was alan brought into her neighbourhood and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue and was it by accident or by design that the daughter of james more should walk that day to the seaside  presently i came forth behind her in the front of the sand hills and above the beach it was here long and solitary with a manowars boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect and an officer in charge and pacing the sands like one who waited i sat immediately down where the rough grass a good deal covered me and looked for what should follow catriona went straight to the boat the officer met her with civilities they had ten words together i saw a letter changing hands and there was catriona returning at the same time as if this was all her business on the continent the boat shoved off and was headed for the seahorse but i observed the officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents  i liked the business little and the more i considered of it liked it less was it alan the officer was seeking or catriona she drew near with her head down looking constantly on the sand and made so tender a picture that i could not bear to doubt her innocency the next she raised her face and recognised me seemed to hesitate and then came on again but more slowly and i thought with a changed colour and at that thought all else that was upon my bosomfears suspicions the care of my friends lifewas clean swallowed up and i rose to my feet and stood waiting her in a drunkenness of hope  i gave her goodmorning as she came up which she returned with a good deal of composure  will you forgive my having followed you said i  i know you are always meaning kindly she replied and then with a little outburst but why will you be sending money to that man it must not be  i never sent it for him said i but for you as you know well  and you have no right to be sending it to either one of us said she david it is not right  it is not it is all wrong said i and i pray god he will help this dull fellow if it be at all possible to make it better catriona this is no kind of life for you to lead and i ask your pardon for the word but yon man is no fit father to take care of you  do not be speaking of him even was her cry  and i need speak of him no more it is not of him that i am thinking o be sure of that says i i think of the one thing i have been alone now this long time in leyden and when i was by way of at my studies still i was thinking of that next alan came and i went among soldiermen to their big dinners and still i had the same thought and it was the same before when i had her there beside me catriona do you see this napkin at my throat you cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you theyre your colours now i wear them in my heart my dear i cannot want you o try to put up with me  i stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on  try to put up with me i was saying try and bear me with a little  still she had never the word and a fear began to rise in me like a fear of death  catriona i cried gazing on her hard is it a mistake again am i quite lost  she raised her face to me breathless  do you want me davie truly said she and i scarce could hear her say it  i do that said i o sure you know iti do that  i have nothing left to give or to keep back said she i was all yours from the first day if you would have had a gift of me she said  this was on the summit of a brae the place was windy and conspicuous we were to be seen there even from the english ship but i kneeled down before her in the sand and embraced her knees and burst into that storm of weeping that i thought it must have broken me all thought was wholly beaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure i knew not where i was i had forgot why i was happy only i knew she stooped and i felt her cherish me to her face and bosom and heard her words out of a whirl  davie she was saying o davie is this what you think of me is it so that you were caring for poor me o davie davie  with that she wept also and our tears were commingled in a perfect gladness  it might have been ten in the day before i came to a clear sense of what a mercy had befallen me and sitting over against her with her hands in mine gazed in her face and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child and called her foolish and kind names i have never seen the place look so pretty as these bents by dunkirk and the windmill sails as they bobbed over the knowe were like a tune of music  i know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else besides ourselves had i not chanced upon a reference to her father which brought us to reality  my little friend i was calling her again and again rejoicing to summon up the past by the sound of it and to gaze across on her and to be a little distantmy little friend now you are mine altogether mine for good my little friend and that mans no longer at all  there came a sudden whiteness in her face she plucked her hands from mine  davie take me away from him she cried theres something wrong hes not true there will be something wrong i have a dreadful terror here at my heart what will he be wanting at all events with that kings ship what will this word be saying and she held the letter forth my mind misgives me it will be some ill to alan open it davieopen it and see  i took it and looked at it and shook my head  no said i it goes against me i cannot open a mans letter  not to save your friend she cried  i cannae tell said i i think not if i was only sure  and you have but to break the seal said she  i know it said i but the thing goes against me  give it here said she and i will open it myself  nor you neither said i you least of all it concerns your father and his honour dear which we are both misdoubting no question but the place is dangerouslike and the english ship being here and your father having word of it and yon officer that stayed ashore he would not be alone either there must be more along with him i daresay we are spied upon this minute ay no doubt the letter should be opened but somehow not by you nor me  i was about this far with it and my spirit very much overcome with a sense of danger and hidden enemies when i spied alan come back again from following james and walking by himself among the sand hills he was in his soldiers coat of course and mighty fine but i could not avoid to shudder when i thought how little that jacket would avail him if he were once caught and flung in a skiff and carried on board of the seahorse a deserter a rebel and now a condemned murderer  there said i there is the man that has the best right to open it or not as he thinks fit  with which i called upon his name and we both stood up to be a mark for him  if it is soif it be more disgracewill you can bear it she asked looking upon me with a burning eye  i was asked something of the same question when i had seen you but the once said i what do you think i answered that if i liked you as i thought i didand o but i like you betteri would marry you at his gallows foot  the blood rose in her face she came close up and pressed upon me holding my hand and it was so that we awaited alan  he came with one of his queer smiles what was i telling ye david says he  there is a time for all things alan said i and this time is serious how have you sped you can speak out plain before this friend of ours  i have been upon a fools errand said he  i doubt we have done better than you then said i and at least here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of do you see that i went on pointing to the ship that is the seahorse captain palliser  i should ken her too says alan i had fyke enough with her when she was stationed in the forth but what ails the man to come so close  i will tell you why he came there first said i it was to bring this letter to james more why he stops here now that its delivered what its likely to be about why theres an officer hiding in the bents and whether or not its probable that hes alonei would rather you considered for yourself  a letter to james more said he  the same said i  well and i can tell ye more than that said alan for last night when you were fast asleep i heard the man colloquing with some one in the french and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut  alan cried i you slept all night and i am here to prove it  ay but i would never trust alan whether he was asleep or waking says he but the business looks bad lets see the letter  i gave it him  catriona said he yell have to excuse me my dear but theres nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it and ill have to break this seal  it is my wish said catriona  he opened it glanced it through and flung his hand in the air  the stinking brock says he and crammed the paper in his pocket here lets get our things thegether this place is fair death to me and he began to walk towards the inn  it was catriona who spoke the first he has sold you she asked  sold me my dear said alan but thanks to you and davie ill can jink him yet just let me win upon my horse he added  catriona must come with us said i she can have no more traffic with that man she and i are to be married at which she pressed my hand to her side  are ye there with it says alan looking back the best days work that ever either of ye did yet i and im bound to say my dawtie ye make a real bonny couple  the way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill where i was aware of a man in seamans trousers who seemed to be spying from behind it only of course we took him in the rear  see alan said i  wheesht said he this is my affairs  the man was no doubt a little deafened by the clattering of the mill and we got up close before he noticed then he turned and we saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany face  i think sir says alan that you speak the english  non monsieur says he with an incredible bad accent  non monsieur cries alan mocking him is that how they learn you french on the seahorse ye muckle gutsey hash heres a scots boot to your english hurdies  and bounding on him before he could escape he dealt the man a kick that laid him on his nose then he stood with a savage smile and watched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand hills  but its high time i was clear of these empty bents said alan and continued his way at top speed and we still following to the back door of bazins inn  it chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with james more entering by the other  here said i to catriona quick upstairs with you and make your packets this is no fit scene for you  in the meanwhile james and alan had met in the midst of the long room she passed them close by to reach the stairs and after she was some way up i saw her turn and glance at them again though without pausing indeed they were worth looking at alan wore as they met one of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness yet with something eminently warlike so that james smelled danger off the man as folk smell fire in a house and stood prepared for accidents  time pressed alans situation in that solitary place and his enemies about him might have daunted cæsar it made no change in him and it was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the interview  a braw good day to ye again mr drummond said he whatll yon business of yours be just about  why the thing being private and rather of a long story says james i think it will keep very well till we have eaten  im none so sure of that said alan it sticks in my mind its either now or never for the fact is me and mr balfour here have gotten a line and were thinking of the road  i saw a little surprise in jamess eye but he held himself stoutly  i have but the one word to say to cure you of that said he and that is the name of my business  say it then says alan hout wha minds for davie  it is a matter that would make us both rich men said james  do ye tell me that cries alan  i do sir said james the plain fact is that it is clunys treasure  no cried alan have ye got word of it  i ken the place mr stewart and can take you there said james  this crowns all says alan well and im glad i came to dunkirk and so this was your business was it halvers im thinking  that is the business sir says james  well well says alan and then in the same tone of childlike interest it has naething to do with the seahorse then he asked  with what says james  or the lad that i have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill pursued alan hut man have done with your lees i have pallisers letter here in my pouch youre by with it james more you can never show your face again with dacent folk  james was taken all aback with it he stood a second motionless and white then swelled with the living anger  do you talk to me you bastard he roared out  ye gleed swine cried alan and hit him a sounding buffet on the mouth and the next wink of time their blades clashed together  at the first sound of the bare steel i instinctively leaped back from the collision the next i saw james parried a thrust so nearly that i thought him killed and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girls father and in a manner almost my own and i drew and ran in to sever them  keep back davie are ye daft damn ye keep back roared alan your blood be on your ain heid then  i beat their blades down twice i was knocked reeling against the wall i was back again betwixt them they took no heed of me thrusting at each other like two furies i can never think how i avoided being stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two rodomonts and the whole business turned about me like a piece of a dream in the midst of which i heard a great cry from the stair and catriona sprang before her father in the same moment the point of my sword encountered something yielding it came back to me reddened i saw the blood flow on the girls kerchief and stood sick  will you be killing him before my eyes and me his daughter after all she cried  my dear i have done with him said alan and went and sat on a table with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand  awhile she stood before the man panting with big eyes then swung suddenly about and faced him  begone was her word take your shame out of my sight leave me with clean folk i am a daughter of alpin shame of the sons of alpin begone  it was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own bloodied sword the two stood facing she with the red stain on her kerchief he white as a rag i knew him well enoughi knew it must have pierced him in the quick place of his soul but he betook himself to a bravado air  why says he sheathing his sword though still with a bright eye on alan if this brawl is over i will but get my portmanteau  there goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me says alan  sir cries james  james more says alan this lady daughter of yours is to marry my friend davie upon the which account i let you pack with a hale carcase but take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harms way or ower late little as you suppose it there are leemits to my temper  be damned sir but my moneys there said james  im vexed about that too says alan with his funny face but now ye see its mines and then with more gravity be you advised james more you leave this house  james seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind but its to be thought he had enough of alans swordsmanship for he suddenly put off his hat to us and with a face like one of the damned bade us farewell in a series with which he was gone  at the same time a spell was lifted from me  catriona i cried it was meit was my sword o are ye much hurt  i know it davie i am loving you for the pain of it it was done defending that bad man my father see she said and showed me a bleeding scratch see you have made a man of me now i will carry a wound like an old soldier  joy that she should be so little hurt and the love of her brave nature transported me i embraced her i kissed the wound  and am i to be out of the kissing me that never lost a chance says alan and putting me aside and taking catriona by either shoulder my dear he said youre a true daughter of alpin by all accounts he was a very fine man and he may weel be proud of you if ever i was to get married its the marrow of you i would be seeking for a mother to my sons and i bear a kings name and speak the truth  he said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the girl and through her to me it seemed to wipe us clean of all james mores disgraces and the next moment he was just himself again  and now by your leave my dawties said he this is a very bonny but alan breckll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than hes caring for and dod i think this is a grand place to be leaving  the word recalled us to some wisdom alan ran upstairs and returned with our saddlebags and james mores portmanteau i picked up catrionas bundle where she had dropped it on the stair and we were setting forth out of that dangerous house when bazin stopped the way with cries and gesticulations he had whipped under a table when the swords were drawn but now he was as bold as a lion there was his bill to be settled there was a chair broken alan had sat among his dinner things james more had fled  here i cried pay yourself and flung him down some lewie dors for i thought it was no time to be accounting  he sprang upon that money and we passed him by and ran forth into the open upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in a little nearer to us james more waved his hat as if to hurry them and right behind him like some foolish person holding up its hands were the sails of the windmill turning  alan gave but the one glance and laid himself down to run he carried a great weight in james mores portmanteau but i think he would as soon have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his revenge and he ran so that i was distressed to follow him and marvelled and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side  as soon as we appeared they cast off all disguise upon the other side and the seamen pursued us with shouts and viewhullohs we had a start of some two hundred yards and they were but bandylegged tarpaulins after all that could not hope to better us at such an exercise i suppose they were armed but did not care to use their pistols on french ground and as soon as i perceived that we not only held our advantage but drew a little away i began to feel quite easy of the issue for all which it was a hot brisk bit of work so long as it lasted dunkirk was still far off and when we popped over a knowe and found a company of the garrison marching on the other side on some manoeuvre i could very well understand the word that alan had  he stopped running at once and mopping at his brow theyre a real bonny folk the french nation says he                                          conclusion   no sooner were we safe within the walls of dunkirk than we held a very necessary councilofwar on our position we had taken a daughter from her father at the swords point any judge would give her back to him at once and by all likelihood clap me and alan into jail and though we had an argument upon our side in captain palissers letter neither catriona nor i were very keen to be using it in public upon all accounts it seemed the most prudent to carry the girl to paris to the hands of her own chieftain macgregor of bohaldie who would be very willing to help his kinswoman on the one hand and not at all anxious to dishonour james upon the other  we made but a slow journey of it up for catriona was not so good at the riding as the running and had scarce sat in a saddle since the fortyfive but we made it out at last reached paris early of a sabbath morning and made all speed under alans guidance to find bohaldie he was finely lodged and lived in a good style having a pension in the scots fund as well as private means greeted catriona like one of his own house and seemed altogether very civil and discreet but not particularly open we asked of the news of james more poor james said he and shook his head and smiled so that i thought he knew further than he meant to tell then we showed him palissers letter and he drew a long face at that  poor james said he again well there are worse folk than james more too but this is dreadful bad tut tut he must have forgot himself entirely this is a most undesirable letter but for all that gentlemen i cannot see what we would want to make it public for its an ill bird that fouls his own nest and we are all scots folk and all hieland  upon this we were all agreed save perhaps alan and still more upon the question of our marriage which bohaldie took in his own hands as though there had been no such person as james more and gave catriona away with very pretty manners and agreeable compliments in french it was not till all was over and our healths drunk that he told us james was in that city whither he had preceded us some days and where he now lay sick and like to die i thought i saw by my wifes face what way her inclination pointed  and let us go see him then said i  if it is your pleasure said catriona these were early days  he was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief in a great house upon a corner and we were guided up to the garret where he lay by the sound of highland piping it seemed he had just borrowed a set of them from bohaldie to amuse his sickness though he was no such hand as was his brother rob he made good music of the kind and it was strange to observe the french folk crowding on the stairs and some of them laughing he lay propped in a pallet the first look of him i saw he was upon his last business and doubtless this was a strange place for him to die in but even now i find i can scarce dwell upon his end with patience doubtless bohaldie had prepared him he seemed to know we were married complimented us on the event and gave us a benediction like a patriarch  i have been never understood said he i forgive you both without an afterthought after which he spoke for all the world in his old manner was so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon his pipes and borrowed a small sum before i left i could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour but he was great upon forgiveness it seemed always fresh to him i think he forgave me every time we met and when after some four days he passed away in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity i could have torn my hair out for exasperation i had him buried but what to put upon his tomb was quite beyond me till at last i considered the date would look best alone  i thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of leyden where we had appeared once as brother and sister and it would certainly look strange to return in a new character scotland would be doing for us and thither after i had recovered that which i had left behind we sailed in a low country ship  and now miss barbara balfour to set the ladies first and mr alan balfour younger of shaws here is the story brought fairly to an end a great many of the folk that took a part in it you will find if you think well that you have seen and spoken with alison hastie in limekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too small to know of it and walked abroad with you in the policy when you were bigger that very fine great lady that is miss barbaras namemamma is no other than the same miss grant that made so much a fool of david balfour in the house of the lord advocate and i wonder whether you remember a little lean lively gentleman in a scratchwig and a wraprascal that came to shaws very late of a dark night and whom you were awakened out of your beds and brought down to the dininghall to be presented to by the name of mr jamieson or has alan forgotten what he did at mr jamiesons requesta most disloyal actfor which by the letter of the law he might be hangedno less than drinking the kings health across the water these were strange doings in a good whig house but mr jamieson is a man privileged and might set fire to my cornbarn and the name they know him by now in france is the chevalier stewart  as for davie and catriona i shall watch you pretty close in the next days and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and mamma it is true we were not so wise as we might have been and made a great deal of sorrow out of nothing but you will find as you grow up that even the artful miss barbara and even the valiant mr alan will be not so very much wiser than their parents for the life of man upon this world of ours is a funny business they talk of the angels weeping but i think they must more often be holding their sides as they look on and there was one thing i determined to do when i began this long story and that was to tell out everything as it befell         footnote 1 conspicuous  footnote 2 country  footnote 3 the fairies  footnote 4 flatteries  footnote 5 trust to  footnote 6 this must
