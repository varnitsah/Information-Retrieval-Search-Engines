44671823	captains all  by ww jacobs    bobs redemption  illustration bobs redemption  gratitoode said the nightwatchman with a hard laugh  hmf  dont talk to me about gratitoode ive seen too much of it  if people wot ive helped in my time ad only done arf their dootyarf mind youi should be riding in my carriage  forgetful of the limitations of soapboxes he attempted to illustrate his remark by lolling and nearly went over backwards  recovering himself by an effort he gazed sternly across the river and smoked fiercely  it was evident that he was brooding over an illused past  arry thomson was one of them he said at last  for over six months i wrote all is loveletters for him e being an iggernerant sort of man and only being able to do the kisses at the end which he always insisted on doing imself being jealous  only three weeks arter he was married e come up to where i was standing one day and set about me without saying a word  i was a single man at the time and i didnt understand it  my idea was that he ad gone mad and being pretty artful and always aving a horror of mad people i let im chase me into a policestation  leastways i would ha let im but he didnt come and i all but got fourteen days for being drunk and disorderly  then there was bill clark  he ad been keeping compny with a gal and got tired of it and to oblige im i went to her and told er he was a married man with five children  bill was as pleased as punch at fust but as soon as she took up with another chap he came round to see me and said as id ruined his life  we ad words about itnaturallyand i did ruin it then to the extent of a couple o ribs  i went to see im in the horsepittleplace ive always been fond ofand the langwidge he used to me was so bad that they sent for the sister to ear it  thats ony two out of dozens i could name  arf the unpleasantnesses in my life ave come out of doing kindnesses to people and all the gratitoode ive ad for it i could put in a pintpot with a pint o beer already in it  the only case o real gratitoode i ever heard of appened to a shipmate o minea young chap named bob evans  coming home from auckland in a barque called the dragon fly he fell overboard and another chap named george crofts one o the best swimmers i ever knew went overboard arter im and saved his life  we was hardly moving at the time and the sea was like a duck pond but to ear bob evans talk youd ha thought that george crofts was the bravestarted chap that ever lived  he adnt liked him afore same as the rest of us george being a sly mean sort o chap but arter george ad saved his life e couldnt praise im enough  he said that so long as he ad a crust george should share it and wotever george asked im he should have  the unfortnit part of it was that george took im at his word and all the rest of the vyge he acted as though bob belonged to im and by the time we got into the london river bob couldnt call his soul is own  he used to take a room when he was ashore and live very steady as e was saving up to get married and as soon as he found that out george invited imself to stay with him  it wont cost you a bit more he ses not if you work it properly  bob didnt work it properly but george having saved his life and never letting im forget it he didnt like to tell him so  he thought hed let im see gradual that hed got to be careful because of is gal and the fust evening they was ashore e took im along with im there to tea  gerty mitchellthat was the gals nameadnt heard of bobs accident and when she did she gave a little scream and putting er arms round his neck began to kiss im right in front of george and her mother  you ought to give him one too ses mrs mitchell pointing to george  george wiped is mouth on the back of his and but gerty pretended not to ear  fancy if youd been drownded she ses hugging bob agin  he was pretty near ses george shaking his ead  im a pore swimmer but i made up my mind either to save im or else go down to a watery grave myself  he wiped his mouth on the back of his and agin but all the notice gerty took of it was to send her young brother ted out for some beer  then they all ad supper together and mrs mitchell drank good luck to george in a glass o beer and said she oped that er own boy would grow up like him  let im grow up a good and brave man thats all i ask she ses  i dont care about is looks  he might have both ses george sharplike  why not  mrs mitchell said she supposed he might and then she cuffed young teds ears for making a noise while e was eating and then cuffed im agin for saying that hed finished is supper five minutes ago  george and bob walked ome together and all the way there george said wot a pretty gal gerty was and ow lucky it was for bob that he adnt been drownded  he went round to tea with im the next day to mrs mitchells and arter tea when bob and gerty said they was going out to spend the evening together got imself asked too  they took a tramcar and went to a musichall and bob paid for the three of em  george never seemed to think of putting his and in his pocket and even arter the musichall when they all went into a shop and ad stewed eels he let bob pay  as i said afore bob evans was chockfull of gratefulness and it seemed only fair that he shouldnt grumble at spending a little over the man wot ad risked is life to save his but wot with keeping george at his room and paying for im every time they went out he was spending a lot more money than e could afford  youre ony young once bob george said to him when e made a remark one arternoon as to the fast way his money was going and if it hadnt ha been for me youd never ave lived to grow old  wot with spending the money and always aving george with them when they went out it wasnt long afore bob and gerty ad a quarrel  i dont like a porespirited man she ses  twos company and threes none and besides why cant he pay for imself  hes big enough  why should you spend your money on im  he never pays a farthing  bob explained that he couldnt say anything because e owed his life to george but e might as well ave talked to a lamppost  the more he argued the more angry gerty got and at last she ses twos company and threes none and if you and me cant go out without george crofts then me and im ll go out without you  she was as good as her word too and the next night while bob ad gone out to get some bacca she went off alone with george  it was ten oclock afore they came back agin and gertys eyes were all shining and er cheeks as pink as roses  she shut er mother up like a concertina the moment she began to find fault with er and at supper she sat next to george and laughed at everything e said  george and bob walked all the way ome arter supper without saying a word but arter they got to their room george took a sidelook at bob and then he ses suddenlike look ere  i saved your life didnt i  you did ses bob and i thank you for it  i saved your life ses george agin very solemn  if it hadnt ha been for me you couldnt ha married anybody  thats true ses bob  me and gerty ave been having a talk ses george bending down to undo his boots  weve been getting on very well together you cant elp your feelings and the long and the short of it is the pore gal has fallen in love with me  bob didnt say a word  if you look at it this way its fair enough ses george  i gave you your life and you give me your gal  were quits now  you dont owe me anything and i dont owe you anything  thats the way gerty puts it and she told me to tell you so  ifif she dont want me im agreeable ses bob in a choking voice well call it quits and next time i tumble overboard i ope you wont be handy  he took gertys photygraph out of is box and handed it to george youve got more right to it now than wot i ave he ses  i shant go round there any more i shall look out for a ship tomorrow  george crofts said that perhaps it was the best thing he could do and e asked im in a offhand sort o way ow long the room was paid up for  mrs mitchell ad a few words to say about it next day but gerty told er to save er breath for walking upstairs  the ony thing that george didnt like when they went out was that young ted was with them but gerty said she preferred it till she knew im better and she ad so much to say about his noble behaviour in saving life that george gave way they went out looking at the shops george thinking that that was the cheapest way of spending an evening and they were as happy as possible till gerty saw a brooch she liked so much in a window that he couldnt get er away  it is a beauty she ses  i dont know when ive seen a brooch i liked better  look here  lets all guess the price and then go in and see whos right  they ad their guesses and then they went in and asked and as soon as gerty found that it was only threeandsixpence she began to feel in her pocket for er purse just like your wife does when you go out with er knowing all the time that its on the mantelpiece with twopencehapenny and a cough lozenge in it  i must ha left it at ome she ses looking at george  just wot ive done ses george arter patting is pockets  gerty bit er lips and for a minute or two be civil to george she could not  then she gave a little smile and took is arm agin and they walked on talking and laughing till she turned round of a sudden and asked a big chap as was passing wot e was shoving er for  shoving you ses he  wot do you think i want to shove you for  dont you talk to me ses gerty firing up  george make im beg my pardon  you ought to be more careful ses george in a gentle sort o way  make im beg my pardon ses gerty stamping er foot if he dont knock im down  yes knock im down ses the big man taking hold o georges cap and rumpling his air  pore george who was never much good with his fists hit im in the chest and the next moment he was on is back in the middle o the road wondering wot had appened to im  by the time e got up the other man was arf a mile away and young ted stepped up and wiped im down with a pocketandkerchief while gerty explained to im ow she saw im slip on a piece o banana peel  its ard lines she ses but never mind you frightened im away and i dont wonder at it  you do look terrible when youre angry george i didnt know you  she praised im all the way ome and if it adnt been for his mouth and nose george would ave enjoyed it more than e did  she told er mother how e had flown at a big man wot ad insulted her and mrs mitchell shook her ead at im and said his bold spirit would lead im into trouble afore he ad done  they didnt seem to be able to make enough of im and next day when he went round gerty was so upset at the sight of is bruises that he thought she was going to cry  when he had ad his tea she gave im a cigar she had bought for im herself and when he ad finished smoking it she smiled at him and said that she was going to take im out for a pleasant evening to try and make up to im for wot he ad suffered for er  were all going to stand treat to each other she ses  bob always would insist on paying for everything but i like to feel a bit independent  give and takethats the way i like to do things  theres nothing like being independent ses george  bob ought to ha known that  im sure its the best plan ses gerty  now get your at on  were going to a theayter and ted shall pay the bus fares  george wanted to ask about the theayter but e didnt like to and arter gerty was dressed they went out and ted paid the bus fares like a man  here you are ses gerty as the bus stopped outside the theayter hurry up and get the tickets george ask for three upper circles  she bustled george up to the pay place and as soon as she ad picked out the seats she grabbed old of the tickets and told george to make haste  twelve shillings it is ses the man as george put down arf a crown  twelve ses george beginning to stammer  twelve  twelve  twel  twelve shillings ses the man three upper circles youve ad  george was going to fetch gerty back and ave cheaper seats but she ad gone inside with young ted and at last arter making an awful fuss he paid the rest o the money and rushed in arter her arf crazy at the idea o spending so much money  make aste ses gerty afore he could say anything the band as just begun  she started running upstairs and she was so excited that when they got their seats and george started complaining about the price she didnt pay any attention to wot he was saying but kept pointing out ladies dresses to im in wispers and wondering wot they ad paid for them george gave it up at last and then he sat wondering whether he ad done right arter all in taking bobs gal away from him  gerty enjoyed it very much but when the curtain came down after the first act she leaned back in her chair and looked up at george and said she felt faint and thought shed like to ave an icecream  and you ave one too dear she ses when young ted ad got up and beckoned to the gal and ted ud like one too im sure  she put her ead on georges shoulder and looked up at im  then she put her and on his and stroked it and george reckoning that arter all icecreams were ony a hapenny or at the most a penny each altered is mind about not spending any more money and ordered three  the way he carried on when the gal said they was three shillings was alarming  at fust e thought she was aving a joke with im and it took another gal and the fireman and an old gentleman wot was sitting behind im to persuade im different  he was so upset that e couldnt eat his arter paying for it and ted and gerty had to finish it for im  theyre expensive but theyre worth the money ses gerty  you are good to me george  i could go on eating em all night but you mustnt fling your money away like this always  ill see to that ses george very bitter  i thought we was going to stand treat to each other  that was the idea i understood  so we are ses gerty  ted stood the bus fares didnt he  he did ses george wot there was of em but wot about you  me ses gerty drawing her ead back and staring at im  why ave you forgot that cigar already george  george opened is mouth but e couldnt speak a word  he sat looking at er and making a gasping noise in is throat and fortunately just as e got is voice back the curtain went up agin and everybody said hsh  he couldnt enjoy the play at all e was so upset and he began to see more than ever ow wrong he ad been in taking bobs gal away from im he walked downstairs into the street like a man in a dream with gerty sticking to is arm and young ted treading on is heels behind  now you mustnt waste any more money george ses gerty when they got outside  well walk ome  george ad got arf a mind to say something about a bus but he remembered in time that very likely young ted hadnt got any more money then gerty said she knew a short cut and she took them walking along little dark narrow streets and places until at last just as george thought they must be pretty near ome she began to dab her eyes with er pocketandkerchief and say shed lost er way  you two go ome and leave me she ses arf crying  i cant walk another step  where are we ses george looking round  i dont know ses gerty  i couldnt tell you if you paid me  i must ave taken a wrong turning  oh hurrah  heres a cab  afore george could stop er she held up er umbrella and a ansom cab with bells on its horse crossed the road and pulled up in front of em ted nipped in first and gerty followed im  tell im the address dear and make aste and get in ses gerty  george told the cabman and then he got in and sat on teds knee partly on gertys umbrella and mostly on nothing  you are good to me george ses gerty touching the back of is neck with the brim of her hat  it aint often i get a ride in a cab  all the time i was keeping company with bob we never ad one once  i only wish id got the money to pay for it  george who was going to ask a question stopped imself and then he kept striking matches and trying to read all about cab fares on a bill in front of im  ow are we to know ow many miles it is he ses at last  i dont know ses gerty leave it to the cabman  its his bisness aint it  and if e dont know he must suffer for it  there was hardly a soul in gertys road when they got there but afore george ad settled with the cabman there was a policeman moving the crowd on and arf the winders in the road up  by the time george had paid im and the cabman ad told him wot e looked like gerty and ted ad disappeared indoors all the lights was out and in a state o mind that wont bear thinking of george walked ome to his lodging  illustration afore george had settled with the cabman there was a policeman moving the crowd on  bob was asleep when he got there but e woke im up and told im about it and then arter a time he said that he thought bob ought to pay arf because he ad saved is life  certnly not ses bob  were quits now that was the arrangement i only wish it was me spending the money on her i shouldnt grumble  george didnt get a wink o sleep all night for thinking of the money he ad spent and next day when he went round he ad almost made up is mind to tell bob that if e liked to pay up the money he could ave gerty back but she looked so pretty and praised im up so much for is generosity that he began to think better of it  one thing e was determined on and that was never to spend money like that agin for fifty gertys  there was a very sensible man there that evening that george liked very much  his name was uncle joe and when gerty was praising george to is face for the money he ad been spending uncle joe instead o looking pleased shook his ead over it  young people will be young people i know he ses but still i dont approve of extravagance  bob evans would never ave spent all that money over you  bob evans aint everybody ses mrs mitchell standing up for gerty  he was steady anyway ses uncle joe  besides gerty ought not to ha let mr crofts spend his money like that  she could ha prevented it if shed ha put er foot down and insisted on it  he was so solemn about it that everybody began to feel a bit upset and gerty borrowed teds pocketandkerchief and then wiped er eyes on the cuff of her dress instead  well well ses uncle joe i didnt mean to be ard but dont do it no more  you are young people and cant afford it  we must ave a little pleasure sometimes ses gerty  yes i know ses uncle joe but theres moderation in everything look ere its time somebody paid for mr crofts  tomorrows saturday and if you like ill take you all to the crystal palace  gerty jumped up off of er chair and kissed im while mrs mitchell said she knew is bark was worse than is bite and asked im who was wasting his money now  you meet me at london bridge station at two oclock ses uncle joe getting up to go  it aint extravagance for a man as can afford it  he shook ands with george crofts and went and arter george ad stayed long enough to hear a lot o things about uncle joe which made im think theyd get on very well together he went off too  they all turned up very early the next arternoon and gerty was dressed so nice that george couldnt take his eyes off of her  besides her there was mrs mitchell and ted and a friend of is named charlie smith  they waited some time but uncle joe didnt turn up and they all got looking at the clock and talking about it and oping he wouldnt make em miss the train  here he comes ses ted at last  uncle joe came rushing in puffing and blowing as though hed bust take em on by this train will you he ses catching old o george by the arm  ive just been stopped by a bit o business i must do and ill come on by the next or as soon arter as i can  he rushed off again puffing and blowing his ardest in such a hurry that he forgot to give george the money for the tickets  however george borrowed a pencil of mrs mitchell in the train and put down on paper ow much they cost and mrs mitchell said if george didnt like to remind im she would  they left young ted and charlie to stay near the station when they got to the palace uncle joe aving forgotten to say where hed meet em but train arter train came in without im and at last the two boys gave it up  were sure to run across im sooner or later ses gerty  lets ave something to eat im so hungry  george said something about buns and milk but gerty took im up sharp buns and milk she ses  why uncle would never forgive us if we spoilt his treat like that  she walked into a refreshment place and they ad cold meat and bread and pickles and beer and tarts and cheese till even young ted said hed ad enough but still they couldnt see any signs of uncle joe  they went on to the roundabouts to look for im and then into all sorts o shows at sixpence a head but still there was no signs of im and george had ad to start on a fresh bit o paper to put down wot hed spent  i suppose he must ha been detained on important business ses gerty at last  unless its one of is jokes ses mrs mitchell shaking her ead you know wot your uncle is gerty  there now i never thought o that ses gerty with a start praps it is  joke  ses george choking and staring from one to the other  i was wondering where hed get the money from ses mrs mitchell to gerty  i see it all now i never see such a man for a bit o fun in all my born days  and the solemn way he went on last night too  why he must ha been laughing in is sleeve all the time  its as good as a play  look here ses george ardly able to speak do you mean to tell me he never meant to come  im afraid not ses mrs mitchell knowing wot he is  but dont you worry ill give him a bit o my mind when i see im  george crofts felt as though hed burst and then e got his breath and the things e said about uncle joe was so awful that mrs mitchell told the boys to go away  how dare you talk of my uncle like that ses gerty firing up  you forget yourself george ses mrs mitchell  youll like im when you get to know im better  dont you call me george ses george crofts turning on er  ive been done thats wot ive been  i ad fourteen pounds when i was paid off and its melting like butter  well weve enjoyed ourselves ses gerty and thats what money was given us for  im sure those two boys ave had a splendid time thanks to you  dont go and spoil all by a little bit o temper  temper ses george turning on her  ive done with you i wouldnt marry you if you was the ony gal in the world  i wouldnt marry you if you paid me  oh indeed ses gerty but if you think you can get out of it like that youre mistaken  ive lost my young man through you and im not going to lose you too  ill send my two big cousins round to see you tomorrow  they wont put up with no nonsense i can tell you ses mrs mitchell  she called the boys to her and then she and gerty arter holding their eads very high and staring at george went off and left im alone  he went straight off ome counting is money all the way and trying to make it more and arter telling bob ow hed been treated and trying hard to get im to go shares in his losses packed up his things and cleared out all boiling over with temper  bob was so dazed he couldnt make head or tail out of it but e went round to see gerty the first thing next morning and she explained things to him  i dont know when ive enjoyed myself so much she ses wiping her eyes but ive had enough gadding about for once and if you come round this evening well have a nice quiet time together looking at the furniture shops
