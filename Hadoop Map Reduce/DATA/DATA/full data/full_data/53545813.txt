  in the latter part of charles the seconds reign the stage as well as every other engine which could affect the popular mind was eagerly employed in the service of the contending factions settle and shadwell had in tragedy and comedy contributed their mite to the support of the popular cause in the stormy session of parliament in 1680 the famous bill was moved for the exclusion of the duke of york as a papist from the succession and accompanied by others of a nature equally peremptory and determined the most remarkable was a bill to order an association for the safety of his majestys person for defence of the protestant religion for the preservation of the protestant liege subjects against invasion and opposition and for preventing any papist from succeeding to the throne of england to recommend these rigid measures and to keep up that zealous hatred and terror of the catholic religion which the plot had inspired settle wrote his forgotten tragedy of pope joan in which he revives the old fable of a female pope and loads her with all the crimes of which a priest or a woman could possibly be guilty shadwells comedy of the lancashire witches was levelled more immediately at the papists but interspersed with most gross and scurrilous reflections upon the english divines of the high church party otway lee and dryden were the formidable antagonists whom the court opposed to the whig poets thus arrayed and confronted the stage absolutely foamed with politics the prologues and epilogues in particular formed channels through which the tenets of the opposite parties were frequently assailed and the persons of their leaders and their poets exposed to scandal and derision  in the middle of these political broils dryden was called upon as he informs us by lee to return the assistance which that poet had afforded in composing oedipus the history of the duke of guise had formerly occupied his attention as an acceptable subject to the court after the restoration a league formed under pretence of religion and in defence of the kings authority against his person presented facilities of application to the late civil wars to which we may be sure our poet was by no means insensible but however apt these allusions might have been in 1665 the events which had taken place in 16812 admitted of a closer parallel and excited a deeper interest the unbounded power which shaftesbury had acquired in the city of london and its state of factious fermentation had been equalled by nothing but the sway exercised by the leaders of the league in the metropolis of france the intrigues by which the council of sixteen placed and displaced flattered or libelled those popular officers of paris whom the french call echevins admitted of a direct and immediate comparison with the contest between the court and the whigs for the election of the sheriffs of london contests which attained so great violence that at one time there was little reason to hope they would have terminated without bloodshed the tumultuous day of the barricades when henry the second after having in vain called in the assistance of his guards was obliged to abandon his capital to the duke of guise and his faction and assemble the states of his kingdom at blois was not entirely without a parallel in the annals of 1681 the violence of the parliament at london had led to its dissolution and in order to insure the tractability of their successors they were assembled by the king at oxford where a concurrence of circumstances rendered the royal authority more paramount than in any other city of the kingdom to this parliament the members came in an array which more resembled the parliament of the white bands in the reign of edward the second than any that had since taken place yet though armed and attended by their retainers and the more ardent of their favourers the leaders of opposition expressed their apprehensions of danger from the royal party the sixteen whig peers in their memorable petition against this removal complained that the parliament would at oxford be exposed to the bloody machinations of the papists and their adherents of whom too many had crept into his majestys guards the aid of ballads and libellous prints was called in to represent this alteration of the usual place of meeting as a manoeuvre to throw the parliament its members and its votes at the feet of an arbitrary monarch1 it is probable that this meeting which rather resembled a polish diet than a british parliament would not have separated without some signal and perhaps bloody catastrophe if the political art of halifax who was at the head of the small moderate party called trimmers joined to the reluctance of either faction to commence hostilities against an enemy as fully prepared as themselves had not averted so eminent a crisis in all particulars excepting the actual assassination the parliament of oxford resembled the assembly of the states general at blois the general character of the duke of monmouth certainly had not many points of similarity to that of the duke of guise but in one particular incident his conduct had been formed on that model and it is an incident which makes a considerable figure in the tragedy in september 1679 after the kings illness monmouth was disgraced and obliged to leave the kingdom he retired to holland where he resided until the intrigues of shaftesbury assured him the support of a party so strongly popular that he might return in open defiance of the court in the november following he conceived his presence necessary to animate his partizans and without the kings permission for his return he embarked at the brill and landed at london on the 27th at midnight where the tumultuous rejoicings of the popular party more than compensated for the obscurity of his departure2 this bold step was in all its circumstances very similar to the return of the duke of guise from his government to paris against the express command of henry the second together with his reception by the populace whom he came prepared to head in insurrection above all the bill of exclusion bore a striking resemblance to the proceedings of the league against the king of navarre presumptive heir of the throne whom on account of his attachment to the protestant faith they threatened to deprive of the succession  the historical passages corresponding in many particulars with such striking accuracy offered an excellent groundwork for a political play and the duke of guise was composed accordingly dryden making use of the scenes which he had formerly written on the subject and lee contributing the remainder which he eked out by some scenes and speeches adopted from the massacre of paris then lying by him in manuscript the court however considered the representation of the piece as at least of dubious propriety the parallel was capable of being so extended as to exhibit no very flattering picture of the kings politics and on the other hand it is possible that the fate of the duke of guise as identified with monmouth might shock the feelings of charles and the justice of the audience  accordingly we learn from the vindication that the representation of the piece was prohibited that it lay in the hands of the lord chamberlain henry lord arlington from before midsummer 1682 till two months after that term and that orders were not finally given for its being acted until the month of december in the same year the kings tenderness for the duke of monmouth had by this time so far given way that he had ordered his arrest at stafford and from the dark preparations on both sides it was obvious that no measures were any longer to be kept betwixt them all the motives of delicacy and prudence which had prevented the representation of this obnoxious party performance were now therefore annihilated or overlooked  our authors part of the duke of guise is important though not of great extent as his scenes contain some of the most striking political sketches the debate of the council of sixteen with which the play opens was his composition the whole of the fourth act which makes him responsible for the alleged parallel betwixt guise and monmouth and the ridicule cast upon the sheriffs and citizens of the popular party with the first part of the fifth which implicates him in vindicating the assassination of guise the character and sentiments of the king in these scenes are drawn very closely after davila as the reader will easily see from the italian original subjoined in the notes that picturesque historian had indeed anticipated almost all that even a poet could do in conveying a portraiture equally minute and striking of the stormy period which he had undertaken to describe and had his powers of description been inferior it is probable that dryden hampered as he was by restraints of prudence and delicacy would not have chosen to go far beyond the authority to which he referred the lord chamberlain the language of the play at least in these scenes seldom rises above that of the higher tone of historical oratory and the descriptions are almost literally taken from davila and thrown into beautiful verse in the character of marmoutiere there seems to be an allusion to the duchess of buccleuch and monmouth whose influence was always and sometimes successfully used to detach her husband from the desperate schemes of shaftesbury and armstrong the introduction of the necromancer malicorn seems to refer to some artifices by which the party of monmouth endeavoured to call to their assistance the sanction of supernatural powers3 the particular story of malicorn is said to be taken from a narrative in rossets histoires tragiques a work which the present editor has never seen in the conference between malicorn and melanax dryden has made much use of his astrological knowledge and its mystical terms give a solemnity to the spirits predictions which was probably deepened by the poets secret belief in this visionary study as he borrowed liberally from davila in the other parts of the play he has not here disdained to use the assistance of pulci from whose romantic poem he has translated one or two striking passages as the reader will find upon consulting the notes the last scene betwixt the necromancer and the fiend is horribly fine the description of the approach of the evil one and the effect which his presence produces upon the attendants the domestic animals and the wizard himself is an instance amongst many of the powerful interest which may be produced by a judicious appeal to the early prejudices of superstition i may be pardoned however when i add that such scenes are in general unfit for the stage where the actual appearance of a demon is apt to excite emotions rather ludicrous than terrific accordingly that of dryden failed in the representation the circumstance upon which the destruction of the wizard turns is rather puerile but there are many similar fables in the annals of popular superstition4  lees part of this play is in general very well written and contains less rant than he usually puts in the mouths of his characters  the factions have been long at rest which were so deeply agitated by the first representation of this performance yet some pains has been taken to trace those points of resemblance which gave so much offence to one party and triumph to the other many must doubtless have escaped our notice but enough remains to shew the singular felicity with which dryden in the present instance as in that of absalom and achitophel could adapt the narrative of ancient or foreign transactions to the political events of his own time and moralize two meanings in one word altogether abstracted from this consideration the duke of guise as a historical play possesses merit amply sufficient to rescue it from the oblivion into which it has fallen  the play was first acted 4th december 1682 and encountered a stormy and dubious if not an unfavourable reception but as the strength of the court party increased the piece was enabled to maintain its ground with more general approbation it was performed by the united companies and printed in 1683   footnotes 1 i cannot resist transcribing that ballad which cost poor college    the protestant joiner so extremely dear it is extracted from mr    luttrells collection who has marked it thus a most scandalous    libel against the government for which with other things college    was justly executed the justice of the execution may i think be    questioned unless like cinna the poet the luckless balladmonger    was hanged for his bad verses there is prefixed a cut    representing the king with a double face carrying the house of    commons

bells at st giles in the fields placing    several flambeaus on the top of the steeple and divers great    bonefires were made two of which were very large one in the    palaceyard at westminster and the other in thamesstreet near    the customhouse which was kindled in the morning and maintained    burning all day till evening and then the universal joy of the    people was expressed in most of the streets throughout london and    westminster by bonefires fireworks and ringing of bells    accompanied with loud acclamations of joy to the great grief of    the papists an account of the heroick life and magnanimous    actions of the most illustrious protestant prince james duke of    monmouth london 1683 p 95  3 a relation was published in the name of one elizabeth freeman    afterwards called the mayor of hatfield setting forth that on    the 24th of january the apparition of a woman all in white the    duke of monmouths mother was here to be understood with a white    veil over her face accosted her with these words sweetheart the    15th of may is appointed for the bloodroyal to be poisoned be not    afraid for i am sent to tell thee that on the 27th the same    appearance stood before her again and she having then acquired    courage enough to lay it under the usual adjuration in the name    c it assumed a more glorious shape and said in a harsher tone of    voice tell king charles from me and bid him not remove his    parliament ie from london to oxford and stand to his council    adding do as i bid you that on the 26th it appeared to her a    third time but said only do your message and that on the next    night when she saw it for the last time it said nothing at all    those who depend upon the people for support must try all manner    of practices upon them and such fooleries as these sometimes    operate more forcibly than experiments of a more rational kind    care was besides taken to have this relation attested by sir joseph    jordan a justice of peace and the rector of hatfield dr lee who    was one of the kings chaplains nay the message was actually sent    to his majesty and the whole forgery very officially circulated    over the kingdom ralphs history vol i p 562  4 in truth the devil and the conjuror did not always play upon the    square but often took the most unfair advantages of each other    there is more than one instance of bad faith in the history of that    renowned enchanter peter fabel on one occasion he prevailed upon    the devil when he came to carry him off to repose himself in an    enchanted chair from which he refused to liberate him until he    had granted him an additional lease of seven years when this term    was also expired he had the eloquence and art to prevail on the    fiend to allow him a farther respite till a wax taper then nearly    expiring was burned out this boon being granted he instantly put    out the light and deposited the taper in the church at edmonton    hence in weivers funeral monuments he is thus mentioned here    at edmonton lieth interred under a seemly tombe without    inscription the body of peter fabell as the report goes upon    whom this fable was fathered that he by his wittie devices    beguiled the devill p 514 see also the book of his merry    prankes another instance occurs in the famous history of friar    bacon london 1666 where that renowned conjurer is recorded to    have saved a man that had given himself to the devil on condition    of his debts being paid the case was referred to the friar    deceiver of mankind said he speaking to the devil it was thy    bargain never to meddle with him so long as he was indebted to any    now how canst thou demand of him any thing when he is indebted for    all he hath to thee when he payeth thee thy money then take him    as thy due till then thou hast nothing to do with him and so i    charge thee to be gone at this the devil vanished with great    horrour but fryar bacon comforted the gentleman and sent him home    with a quiet conscience bidding him never to pay the devils money    back as he tendred his own safety which he promised for to    observe from these instances melanax might have quoted precedent    for insisting on the literal execution of his stipulation with    malicorn since to give the devil his due the strict legal    interpretation appears always to have been applied to bargains of    that nature                                       to                           the right honourable                                lawrence                        earl of rochester c1   my lord  the authors of this poem present it humbly to your lordships patronage if you shall think it worthy of that honour it has already been a confessor and was almost made a martyr for the royal cause but having stood two trials from its enemiesone before it was acted another in the representationand having been in both acquitted it is now to stand the public censure in the reading where since of necessity it must have the same enemies we hope it may also find the same friends and therein we are secure not only of the greater number but of the more honest and loyal party we only expected bare justice in the permission to have it acted and that we had after a severe and long examination from an upright and knowing judge who having heard both sides and examined the merits of the cause in a strict perusal of the play gave sentence for us that it was neither a libel nor a parallel of particular persons2 in the representation itself it was persecuted with so notorious malice by one side that it procured us the partiality of the other so that the favour more than recompensed the prejudice and it is happier to have been saved if so we were by the indulgence of our good and faithful fellowsubjects than by our own deserts because thereby the weakness of the faction is discovered which in us at that time attacked the government and stood combined like the members of the rebellious league against the lawful sovereign authority to what topic will they have recourse when they are manifestly beaten from their chief post which has always been popularity and majority of voices they will tell usthat the voices of a people are not to be gathered in a playhouse and yet even there the enemies as well as friends have free admission but while our argument was serviceable to their interests they could boast that the theatres were true protestant and came insulting to the plays when their own triumphs were represented3 but let them now assure themselves that they can make the major part of no assembly except it be of a meetinghouse4 their tide of popularity is spent and the natural current of obedience is in spite of them at last prevalent in which my lord after the merciful providence of god the unshaken resolution and prudent carriage of the king and the inviolable duty and manifest innocence of his royal highnessthe prudent management of the ministers is also most conspicuous i am not particular in this commendation because i am unwilling to raise envy to your lordship who are too just not to desire that praise should be communicated to others which was the common endeavour and cooperation of all it is enough my lord that your own part was neither obscure in it nor unhazardous and if ever this excellent government so well established by the wisdom of our forefathers and so much shaken by the folly of this age shall recover its ancient splendour posterity cannot be so ungrateful as to forget those who in the worst of times have stood undaunted by their king and country and for the safeguard of both have exposed themselves to the malice of false patriots and the madness of an headstrong rabble but since this glorious work is yet unfinished and though we have reason to hope well of the success yet the event depends on the unsearchable providence of almighty god it is no time to raise trophies while the victory is in dispute but every man by your example to contribute what is in his power to maintain so just a cause on which depends the future settlement and prosperity of three nations the pilots prayer to neptune was not amiss in the middle of the storm thou mayest do with me o neptune what thou pleasest but i will be sure to hold fast the rudder we are to trust firmly in the deity but so as not to forget that he commonly works by second causes and admits of our endeavours with his concurrence for our own parts we are sensible as we ought how little we can contribute with our weak assistance the most we can boast of is that we are not so inconsiderable as to want enemies whom we have raised to ourselves on no other account than that we are not of their number and since that is their quarrel they shall have daily occasion to hate us more it is not my lord that any man delights to see himself pasquined and affronted by their inveterate scribblers but on the other side it ought to be our glory that themselves believe not of us what they write reasonable men are well satisfied for whose sakes the venom of their party is shed on us because they see that at the same time our adversaries spare not those to whom they owe allegiance and veneration their despair has pushed them to break those bonds and it is observable that the lower they are driven the more violently they write as lucifer and his companions were only proud when angels but grew malicious when devils let them rail since it is the only solace of their miseries and the only revenge which we hope they now can take the greatest and the best of men are above their reach and for our meanness though they assault us like footpads in the dark their blows have done us little harm we yet live to justify ourselves in open day to vindicate our loyalty to the government and to assure your lordship with all submission and sincerity that we are    your lordships     most obedient faithful servants       john dryden       nat lee   footnotes 1 lawrence hyde created earl of rochester in 1682 was the second    son of the famous lord clarendon and affords a rare instance of    the son of a disgraced minister recovering that favour at court    which had been withdrawn from his father he was now at the head of    the commissioners for the treasury and a patron of our poet as    appears from the terms of drydens letter soliciting his interest    in very affecting terms and from the subsequent dedication of    cleomenes where he acknowledges his lordships goodness during    the reign of two masters and that even from a bare treasury his    success was contrary to that of mr cowley gideons fleece having    been moistened when all the ground was dry around it the earl of    rochester was the more proper patron for the duke of guise as he    was a violent opponent of the bill of exclusion he was lord high    treasurer in the reign of james ii and died in 1711  2 henry bennet earl of arlington then lord chamberlain  3 dryden seems here to allude to the triumphant strain in which    shadwell mentions the reception of the lancashire witches i    could not imagine he says till i heard that great opposition    was designed against the play a month before it was acted by a    party who being ashamed to say it was for the sake of the irish    priest pretended that i had written a satire on the church of    england and several profest papists railed at it violently before    they had seen it alleging that for a reason such dear friends    they are to our church and notwithstanding all was put out that    could any way be wrested to an offence against the church yet they    came with the greatest malice in the world to hiss it and many    that called themselves protestants joined with them in that noble    enterprise     but for all this they came resolved to hiss it right or wrong    and had gotten mercenary fellows who were such fools they did not    know when to hiss and this was evident to all the audience it was    wonderful to see men of great quality and gentlemen in so mean a    combination but to my great satisfaction they came off as meanly    as i could wish i had so numerous an assembly of the best sort of    men who stood so generously in my defence for the three first    days that they quashed all the vain attempts of my enemies the

in lord shaftesburys cabinet and    produced on his trial in which that memorable engagement seems to    be pretty closely copied was probably what our poet alludes to  2 the protestant flail was a kind of bludgeon so jointed as to fold    together and lie concealed in the pocket they are supposed to    have been invented to arm the insurgents about this period in the    trial of braddon and spoke for a misdemeanor the recorder offered    to prove that braddon had bragged that he was the only inventor    of the protestant flails an instrument you have heard of    gentlemen and for what use designed this circumstance was not    omitted by jefferies in his characteristic address to the    prisoner but oh what a happiness it was for this sort of people    that they had got mr braddon an honest man and a man of courage    says mr speke a man a propos and pray says he to his friend    give him the best advice you can for he is a man very fit for the    purpose and pray secure him under a sham name for ill undertake    there are such designs upon pious mr braddon such connivances to    do him mischief that if he had not had his protestant flail    about him somebody or other would have knocked him on the head    and he is such a wonderful man that all the kings courts must    needs conspire to do mr braddon a mischief a very pretty sort of    man upon my word and he must be used accordingly state    trials vol iii p 897 in one of the scarce medals struck by    james ii justice is represented weighing mural crowns which    preponderate against a naked sword a serpent and a protestant    flail on each side of the figure are a head and trunk    representing those of argyle and monmouth an accurate description    of this weapon occurs in the following passage from roger north    there was much recommendation of silk armour and the prudence of    being provided with it against the time protestants were to be    massacred and accordingly there were abundance of these silken    backs breasts and pots ie headpieces made and sold that    were pretended to be pistol proof in which any man dressed up was    as safe as in a house for it was impossible any one could go to    strike him for laughing so ridiculous was the figure as they say    of hogs in armour an image of derision insensible but to the    view as i have had it this was armour of defence but our sparks    were not altogether so tame as to carry their provisions no    farther for truly they intended to be assailants upon fair    occasion and had for that end recommended also to them a certain    pocket weapon which for its design and efficacy had the honour    to be called a protestant flail it was for street and    crowdwork and the engine lying perdue in a coat pocket might    readily sally out to execution and by clearing a great hall a    piazza or so carry an election by a choice way of polling called    knocking down the handle resembled a farriers bloodstick and    the fall was joined to the end by a strong nervous ligature that    in its swing fell just short of the hand and was made of lignum    vitæ or rather as the poet termed it mortis examen p    572 the following is the first stanza of the protestant flail an    excellent new song to the tune of lacys maggot or the hobby    horse it is thus labelled by luttrell a bonny thing 14 june    1632

finest wood      all lined with lead and notable good      for splitting of bones and shedding the blood      of all that withstood                  with a thump c  3 shaftesbury college and others were liberated by grand juries    who refused to find bills against them bringing in what are    technically called verdicts of ignoramus it was here that the    whig sheriffs were of most consequence to their party for by their    means the juries were picked from the very centre of the faction    and although they included many men of eminence both for rank and    talents yet they were generally such as had made up their minds to    cast the bill long before they came into court this gave great    offence to the royalists north says there lay the barrier of the    faction and that stately word ignoramus became the appellative    of the whole corrupt practice and the infamous title of all the    persons concerned in it in luttrells collection i find    ignoramus an excellent new song to

of orleans writ this to justify the admiral for taking arms against the king deceased wherein he proves that irreligious kings may justly be deposed and put to death  buss to borrow arguments from heretic books methinks was not so prudent  cur yes from the devil if it would help our cause the author was indeed a heretic the matter of the book is good and pious  pol but one prime article of our holy league is to preserve the king his power and person  cur that must be said you know for decency a pretty blind to make the shoot secure  buss but did the primitive christians eer rebel when under

he rebel  cur ill make it out rebellion is an insurrection against the government but they that have the power are actually the government therefore if the people have the power the rebellion is in

duke of aumale    approached paris with five hundred veteran horse levied in the    disaffected province of picardy jean conti one of the sheriffs    echevins of paris was tampered with to admit them by st    martins gate but as he refused the leaguers stigmatised him as a    heretic and favourer of navarre another of these officers    consented to open to aumale the gate of st denis of which the keys    were intrusted to him     the conspirators had determined as is here expressed to seize the    person of the king when he should attend the procession of the    flagellants as he was wont to do in time of lent but he was    apprised of their purpose by poltrot one of their number and used    the pretext of indisposition to excuse his absence from the    penitential procession davila lib viii  3 in the year 1565 an interview took place at bayonne between    catharine of medicis her son charles ix and the queen of spain    attended by the famous duke of alva and the count of benevento    many political discussions took place and the opinion of alva as    expressed in the text is almost literally versified from davilas    account of the conference il duca dalva uomo di veemente    natura risolutamente diceva che per distruggere la novità della    fede e le sollevazioni di stato bisognava levare le teste de    papaveri pescare i pesci grossi e non si curare di prendere le    ranocchie erano questi i concetti proferiti da lui perchè cessati    i venti londe della plebe facilmente si sarebbono da se stesse    composte e acquietate aggiugneva che un prencipe non può far cosa    più vituperosa nè più dannosa a se stesso quanto il permettere al    popolo il vivere secondo la loro coscienza ponendo tanta varietà    di religioni in uno stato quanto sono i capricci degli huomini e    le fantasíe delle persone inquiete aprendo la porta alla discordia    e alla confusione e dimostrava con lunga commemorazione di    segnalati esempj che la diversità della fede aveva sempre messo    larme in mano ai sudditi e sempre sollevate atroci perfidie e    funeste rebellioni contra i superiori onde conchiudeva nel fine    che siccome le controversie della fede avevan sempre servito di    pretesto e di argumento alle sollevazioni de mal contenti così    era necessario rimovere a primo tratto questa coperta e poi con    severi rimedj e senza riguardo di ferro nè di fuoco

passage     entrò il duca di guisa in parigi il lunedì nono giorno di maggio    ch era gia vicino il mezzogiorno non con maggior comitiva che di    sette cavalli tra gentiluomini e servitori ma come una piccolo    palla di neve che discende dall erto si va tanto ingrossando che    nel fine diviene quasi una montagna eminente così abandonando il    popolo le case e le botteghe con plauso e con allegrezza per    seguitarlo non fu a mezzo la città che aveva dietro più di    trentamila persone ed era tanta la calca che a pena egli medesimo    poteva seguitare la sua strada andavan le grida del popolo insino    al cielo nè mai fu con tanto plauso gridato vita il re con    quanto ora si gridava vita guisa chi lo sulutava chi lo    ringraziava chi se gl inchinava chi gli baciava le falde de    vestimenti chi non potendo accostarsi con le mani e con i gesti    di tutto il corpo dava segui profusi d allegrezza e furono veduti    di quelli che adorandolo come santo lo toccavano con le corone e    le medesime poi o baciavano o con esse si toccavano gli occhi e la    fronte e sino le donne dalle finestra spargendo fiori e fronde    onoravano e benedicevano la sua venuta egli all incontro con    viso popolare e con faccia ridente altri accarezzava con le    parole altri risalutava con i gesti altri rallegrava con l    occhio e traversando le caterve del popolo con la testa scoperta    non permetteva cosa alcuna che fosse a proposito per finire a    conciliarsi la benevolenza e l applauso popolare in questa    maniera senza fermarsi alla sua casa andò a dirittura a smontare    a sant eustachio al palazzo della reina madre la quale mezza    attonita per il suo venire improvviso perchè monsignor di    bellieure arrivato tre ore innanzi aveva posto in dubbio la sua    venuta lo ricevè pallida nel volto tutta tremante e contra l    ordinario costume della natura sua quasi smarrita le dimostrazioni    del duca di guisa furono piene d affettuosa umiltà e di profonda    sommissione le parole della reina ambigue dicendoli che lo    vedeva volentieri ma che molto più volontieri l arebbe veduto in    altro tempo alla quale egli rispose con sembiante modestissimo ma    con parole altiere ch egli era buon servitore del re e che    avendo intese le calunnie date all innocenza sua e le cose che si    trattavano contra la religione e contra gli uomini dabbene di quel    popolo era venuto o per divertire il male e espurgarese stesso    ovvero per lasciar la vita in servizio di santa chiesa e della    salute universale la reina interrotto il ragionamento mentre    egli salutava come è solito le altre dame della corte chiamò    luigi davila suo gentiluomo d onore e gli commise che facesse    intendere al re ch era arrivato il duca di guisa e ch ella fra    poco l arebbe condotto al lovero personalmente si commosse di    maniera il re ch era nel suo gabinetto con monsignore di    villaclera con bellieure e con l abbate del bene che fu    costretto appogiarsi col braccio coprendosi la faccia al    tavolino e interrogato il davila d ogni particolare gli    commandò che dicesse segretamente alla reina che framettesse più    tempo che fosse possibile alla venuta l abbate del bene e il    colonello alfonso corso il quale entrò in questo punto nel    gabinetto e era confidentissimo servitore del re e pieno di    merito verso la corona lo consigliavano che ricevendo il duca di    guisa nel medesimo gabinetto lo facese uccidere subito nell    istesso luogo dicendo l abbate questo percutiam pastorem et    dispergentur oves ma villaclera bellieure e il gran cancelliere    che sopravvenne furono di contrario parere allegando esesr tanta    la commozione del popolo che in caso tale sprezzando la maestà    regia e rompendo tutti i vincoli delle leggi sarebbe corso a    precipitosa vendetta e che non essendo le cose ancora    apparecchiate per la difesa propria e per frenare il furore della    città le forze de parigini erano troppo poderose parole per    stuzzicarle lib ix  14 for this scene also which gave great offence to the followers of    monmouth our author had the authority of davila in the    continuation of the passage already quoted     mentre il re sta dubbioso nell animo sopraggiunse la reina che    conduceva il duca di guisa essendo venuta nella sua seggetta e il    duca accompagnatala sempre a piedi ma con tanto seguito e    frequenza di gente che tutta la città pareva ridotta nel giro del    cortile del lovero e nelle strade vicine traversarono fra la    spalliera de soldati essendo presente monsignor di griglione    maestro di campo della guardia il quale uomo libero e militare e    poco amico del duca di guisa mentre egli s inchina ad ogni    privato soldato fece pochissimo sembiante di riverirlo il che da    lui fu con qualche pallidezza del volto ben osservato la quale    continuò maggiormente poichè vide gli suizzeri far spalliera con    larme a piedi della scala e nella sala gli arcieri e nelle    camere i gentiluomini tutti radunati per aspettarlo entrarono    nella camera del re il quale mentre il duca di guisa con profonda    riverenza se gl inchinò con viso scorrucciato gli disse io v    avevo fatto intendere che non veniste a queste parole il duca con    l istessa sommissione che aveva fatto alla reina ma con parole    più ritenute rispose ch egli era venuto a mettersi nelle braccia    della giustitia di sua maestà per iscolparsi delle calunnie che    gli erano apposte da suoi nemici e che nondimeno non sarebbe    venuto quando gli fosse stato detto chiaramente che sua maestà    comandata che non venisse il re rivolto a bellieure    alteratamente lo domandò s era vero che gli avesse data    commissione di dire al duca di guisa che non venisse se non    voleva esser tenuto per autore delli scandali e delle sollevazioni    de parigini monseignor di bellieure si feceinnanzi e volle    render conto dell ambasciata sua ma nel principio del parlare il    re l interruppe dicendogli che bastava e rivolto al duca di    guisa disse che non sapeva ch egii fosse stato calunniato da    persona alcuna ma che la sua innocenza sarebbe apparsa chiara    quando dalla sua venuta non fosse nata alcuna novità e interrotta    la quiete del governo come si prevedeva la reina pratica della    natura del re conoscendolo dalla faccia inclinato a qualche    gagliarda risoluzione lo tirò da parte e gli disse in sostanza    quel che aveva veduto della concorrenza del popolo e che non    pensasse a deliberazioni precipitose perchè non era tempo il    medesimo soggiunse la duchessa d uzes che gli era vicina e il    duca di guisa osservando attentamente ogni minuzia come vide    questa  fluttazione per non dar tempo al re di deliberare si    finse stracco dal viaggio e licenziandosi brevemente da lui    accompagnato dall istessa frequenza di popolo ma da niuno di    quelli della corte si ritirò nella strada di sant antonio alle    sue case lib ix  15 see the speech

mattina del giovedi duodecimo giorno dì maggio un ora    innanzi giorno si sentirono i pifferi e i tamburi degli suizzeri    che battendo l ordinanza entrarono nella città per la porta di    sant

città per lo strepito de tamburi il popolo pieno    di spavento e già certo che la fama divolgata dell intenzione    del re era più che sicura cominciò a radunarsi serrando le porte    delle case e

personal liberties of the subject this    is set forth with some humour in a political pamphlet of the day    called a dialogue betwixt sam the ferryman of datchet will a    waterman of london and tom a bargeman of oxford upon the kings    calling a parliament to meet at oxford london 1681 as to their    own members they turned them out and took others in at their will    and pleasure and if they made any fault they expelled them and    wherever any stood in competition for any town him they knew would    give his vote along with them was admitted right or wrong and then    they terrified all the sheriffs mayors and bailiffs in the    kingdom besides abundance of gentlemen and other honest    countrymen for on the least complaint of any mans misdemeanour    or information from any member immediately a serjeant at arms was    sent for them and so much a mile and hour paid and down on their    marrowbones to their worships and a sound scolding from mr    speaker or else to the tower or gatehouse they went the king god    bless him never took a quarter of that state on him they did     it was brought to that pass that two footboys boxing one day in    the palaceyard he that was beaten proved to belong to a member    and told the other boy if he knew his master he would cause him    to be sent for in custody for keeping such a rogue as he was that    had committed a breach of privilege in beating a members servant    the boy replied if it would do him any kindness he would beat him    again and tell him his masters name into the bargain and would    lay him a crown that though his master should bid the speaker    and all the house of commons kiss c they durst not send a    serjeant at arms for him the beaten boy much nettled at his    speech laid down his money as the other did now said the boy    my master is the king of france and i am come over with some of    his servants to fetch horses out of england go bid thy master and    the house of commons send a serjeant at arms to fetch him    oversam before my heart it was a good answer i hope he won    his monieswill so he did but it was put into a watermans    hands and when it was demanded says the beaten boy sirrah give    it him if you dare if his master be the king of france ill make    you answer it before the house of commons the waterman durst do no    other but gave either their own monies theres no contending with    parliament men or parliament mens men nor boys     some occasion was given for these reproaches by the summary and    arbitrary commitment of many individuals who had addressed the    king in terms expressing their abhorrence of the vehement petitions    presented by the other party for the sitting of parliament and    were thence distinguished by the name of abhorrers this course was    ended by the sturdy resistance of one stowell who had as foreman    of the grand jury at exeter presented an abhorring address to    the king a serjeant at arms having been sent to apprehend him he    refused to submit and bid the officer take his course adding he    knew no law which made him accountable for what he did as a grand    juryman the house were so much embarrassed by his obstinacy that    they hushed up the matter by voting that he was indisposed and    adjourning the debate sine dic  19 this famous interview betwixt grillon and the king deserved to    have been brought on the stage in a nobler strain and free from    the buffoonery by which the veterans character is degraded it is    thus told by davila trattandosi delle persone che avessero da    eseguire il fatto il re elesse di fidarsene nel maestro di campo    della sua guardia griglione uomo feroce e ardito e per molte    cagioni nemico del duca di guisa fattolo perciò venire gli espose    con accomodate parole il suo pensiero e gli significò aver    disegnato che egli fosse quello che eseguisse l impresa nella    quale consisteva tutta la sua salute griglione rispose con brevi e    significanti parole sire io sono ben servitore a vostra maestà di    somma fedeltà e divozione ma faccio professione di soldato e di    cavuliero s ella vuoles ch io vada a sfidare il duca di guisa e    che mi ammazzi a corpo a corpo con lui son pronto a farlo in    questo istesso punto ma ch io serva di manigoldo mentre la    giustizia sua determina di farlo morire questo non si conviene a    par mio nè sono per farlo giammai il re non si stupì molto della    libertà di griglione noto a lui e a tutta la corte per uomo    schietto e che libramente diceva i suoi sensi senza timore alcuno    e però replicò che gli bastava che tenesse segreta questo    pensiero perchè non l aveva communicato ad alcun altro e    divulgandosi egli sarebbe stato colpevole d averlo palesato a    questo rispose griglione essere servitore di fede d onore nè    dover mai ridire i segreti interessi del padrone e partito lasciò    il re grandemente dubbioso di quello dovesse operare lib ix  20 a similar

seigneur de    larchant accosted the duke as he passed from his own lodging to the    kings accompanied by a body of soldiers who he pretended were    petitioners for the dukes interest to obtain payment of their    arrears and would attend at the door of the council next day to    remind him of their case this pretext was to account for the    unusual number of guards which might otherwise have excited g    uises suspicion  22 intanto il duca entrato nel consiglio e pustosi in una sedia    vicina al fuoco si sentì un poco di svenimento o che allora gli    sovcenisse il pericolo net

the door of the kings cabinet lognac a gentleman of the kings    chamber and a creature of the late duke de joyeuse commanded the    assassins who were eight in number the duke never was able to    unsheath his sword being slain with many wounds as he grappled    with lognac the king himself was in the cabinet and listened to    the murderous scuffle till the noise of guises fall announced its    termination the cardinal of guise and the archbishop of lyons    were also within hearing and were arrested while they were    endeavouring to call their attendants to guises assistance the    cardinal was next day murdered by da gast to whose custody he had    been commuted  24 literally from davila ora comparse il re le dimanda egli    primo come ella stava al quale avendo risposto che si

subjoined to the duke of guise it is    extremely coarse and as the author himself suppressed it the    editor will not do his better judgment the injustice to revive it  2 the trimmers a body small and unpopular as must always be the    case with those who in violent times declare for moderate and    temporising measures were headed by the ingenious and politic    halifax he had much of the confidence at least of the countenance    of charles who was divided betwixt tenderness for monmouth and    love of ease on the one hand and on the other desire of    arbitrary power and something like fear of the duke of york    halifax repeatedly prevented each of these parties from subjugating    the other and his ambidexter services seem to have been rewarded    by the sincere hatred of both in 1688 was published a vindication    of this party entitled the character of a trimmer and his    opinion ofi the laws of government ii protestant religion    iii foreign affairs by the hon sir william coventry                                      the                               vindication                                 or the                                 parallel

spolia ista diemque             oderit                       vindication of the duke of guise   it was easy to foresee that a play which professed to be a broadside discharged at the whole popular party would not long remain uncensured the satire being derived from a historical parallel of some delicacy offered certain facilities of attack to the critics it was only stretching the resemblance beyond the bounds to which dryden had limited it and the comparison became odious if not dangerous the whig writers did not neglect this obvious mode of attack now rendered more popular by the encroachment lately attempted by the court upon the freedom of the city whose magistrates had been exposed to ridicule in the play  our readers cannot but remember that in order to break the spirit of the city of london a writ of quo warranto was issued against the incorporation by which was instituted a vexatious and captious inquiry into the validity of the charter of london the purpose of this process was to compel the city to resign their freedom and immunities into the kings hands and to receive a new grant of them so limited as might be consistent with the views of the crown or otherwise to declare them forfeited one thomas hunt a lawyer of some eminence who had been solicitor for the viscount stafford when that unfortunate nobleman was tried for high treason and had written upon the side of the tories but had now altered his principles stepped forward upon this occasion as the champion of the immunities of the city of london1 the ludicrous light in which the sheriffs are placed during the scene with grillon in the third act gave great offence to this active partizan and he gives vent to his displeasure in the following attack upon the author and the performance    they have already condemned the charter and city and have executed   the magistrates in effigy upon the stage in a play called the duke   of guise frequently acted and applauded intended most certainly   to provoke the rabble into tumults and disorder the roman priest   had no success god be thanked when he animated the people not to   suffer the same sheriffs to be carried through the city to the   tower prisoners now the poet hath undertaken for their being   kicked three or four times aweek about the stage to the gallows   infamously rogued and rascalled to try what he can do towards   making the charter forfeitable by some extravagancy and disorder of   the people which the authority of the best governed cities have not   been able to prevent sometimes under far less provocations    but this ought not to move the citizens when he hath so   maliciously and mischievously represented the king and the kings   son nay and his favourite the duke too to whom he gives the worst   strokes of his unlucky fancy    he puts the king under the person of henry iii of france who   appeared in the head of the parisian massacre the kings son   under the person of the duke of guise who concerted it with the   queenmother of france and was slain in that very place by the   righteous judgment of god where he and his mother had first   contrived it    the duke of guise ought to have represented a great prince that   had inserved to some most detestable villany to please the rage or   lust of a tyrant    such great courtiers have been often sacrificed to appease the   furies of the tyrants guilty conscience to expiate for his sin   and to atone the people    besides that a tyrant naturally stands in fear of ministers of   mighty wickedness he is always obnoxious to them he is a slave to   them as long as they live they remember him of his guilt and awe   him these wicked slaves become most imperious masters they drag   him to greater evils for their own impunity than they first   perpetrated for his pleasure and their own ambition    but such are best given up to public justice but by no means to be   assassinated until this age never before was an assassination   invited commended and encouraged upon a public theatre    it is no wonder that trimmers so they call men of some   moderation of that party displease them for they seem to have   designs for which it behoves them to know their men they must be   perfectly wicked or perfectly deceived of the catiline make bold   and without understanding that can adhere to men that publicly   profess murders and applaud the design    caius cæsar to give unto cæsar the things that are cæsars was in   the catiline conspiracy and then the word was he that is not for   us is against us for the instruments of wickedness must be men   that are resolute and forward and without consideration or they   will deceive the design and relent when they enterprize    but when he was made dictator and had some pretences and a   probability by means less wicked and mischievous to arrive at the   government his words were he that is not against us is with us   but to pompey only it belonged and to his cause or the like cause   to the defenders of ancient established governments of the english   monarchy and liberties to say they that are not with us are   against us in internecino bello in attacks upon government   medii pro hostibus habentur neutral men are traitors and assist   by their indifferency to the destruction of the government as many   as applaud this play ought to be put under sureties of the peace   and yet not one warrant that we hear of yet granted by the lord   chief justice    but it is not a duke of guise to be assassinated a turbulent   wicked and haughty courtier but an innocent and gentle prince as   well as brave and renowned for noble achievements a prince that   hath no fault but that he is the kings son and the best too of   all his sons such a son as would have made the best of emperors   happy    except it be that the people honour him and love him and every   where publicly and loudly show it but this they do for that the   best people of england have no other way left to show their loyalty   to the king and love to their religion and government in long   intervals of parliament than by prosecuting his son for the sake   of the king and his own merit with all the demonstrations of the   highest esteem    but he hath not used his patron duke much better for he hath put   him under a most dismal and unfortunate character of a successor   excluded from the crown by act of state for his religion who fought   his way to the crown changed his religion and died by the hand of   a roman assassinate    it is enough to make his great dukes courage quail to find   himself under such an unlucky and disastrous representation and   thus personated besides he hath offered a justification of an act   of exclusion against a popish successor in a protestant kingdom by   remembering what was done against the king of navarre    the popish religion in france did de facto by act of state   exclude a protestant prince who is under no obligation from his   religion to destroy his popish subjects    though a popish prince is to destroy his protestant subjects    a popish prince to a protestant kingdom without more must be the   most insufferable tyrant and exceed the character that any story   can furnish for that sort of monster and yet all the while to   himself a religious and an applauded prince discharged from the   tortures that ordinarily tear and rend the hearts of the most cruel   princes and make them as uneasy to themselves as they are to their   subjects and sometimes prevail so far as to lay some restraints   upon their wicked minds    but this his patron will impute to his want of judgment for this   poets heroes are commonly such monsters as theseus and hercules   are renowned throughout all ages for destroying    but to excuse him this man hath forsaken his post and entered   upon another province to the observator2 it belongs to confound   truth and falsehood and by his false colours and impostures to   put out the eyes of the people and leave them without   understanding    but our poet hath not so much art left him as to frame any thing   agreeable or verisimilar to amuse the people or wherewith to   deceive them    his province is to corrupt the manners of the nation and lay waste   their morals his understanding is clapt and his brains are   vitiated and he is to rot the age    his endeavours are more happily applied to extinguish the little   remains of the virtue of the age by bold impieties and befooling   religion by impious and inept rhymes to confound virtue and vice   good and evil and leave us without consciences    and thus we are prepared for destruction    but to give the world a taste of his atheism and impiety i shall   recite two of his verses as recited upon the stage viz      for conscience and heavens fear religious rules     they are all statebells to toll in pious fools    which i have done the rather that some honest judge or justice   may direct a process against this bold impious man or some honest   surrogate or official may find leisure to proceed ex officio   against him notwithstanding at present they are so encumbered with   the dissenters    such public blasphemies against religion never were unpunished in   any country or age but this    but i have made too long a digression but that it carries with it   some instructions towards the preserving of the honour of your   august city viz    that you do not hereafter authorise the stage to expose and revile   your great officers and offices by the indignities yourselves do   them whilst the papists clap their hands and triumph at your   public disgraces and in the hopes they conceive thereby of the ruin   of your government as if that were as sure and certain to them as   it is to us without doubt that they once fired it    and further for that it was fit to set forth to the world of what   spirit our enemies are how they intend to attack us as also how   bold they are with his majesty what false and dishonourable   representations they make of him and present to the world upon a   public theatre which i must confess hath moved me with some   passion  this angry barrister was not the only adversary whom dryden had to encounter on this occasion thomas shadwell a man of some talents for comedy and who professed to tread in the footsteps of ben jonson had for some time been at variance with dryden and otway he was probably the author of a poem entitled a lenten prologue refused by the players which is marked by mr luttrel 11th april 1683 and contains the following direct attack on the duke of guise and the author    our prologue wit grows flat the naps worn off   and howsoeer we turn and trim the stuff   the gloss is gone that looked at first so gaudy   tis now no jest to hear young girls talk bawdry   but plots and parties give new matters birth   and state distractions serve you here for mirth   at englands cost poets now purchase fame   while factious heats

host of swearers pressed   their succour was ill husbandry at best   bayess crowned muse by sovereign right of satire   without desert can dub a man a traitor   and tories without troubling law or reason   by loyal instinct can find plots and treason  a more formal attack was made in a pamphlet entitled some reflections on the pretended parallel in the play called the duke of guise this dryden in the following vindication supposes to have been sketched by shadwell and finished by a gentleman of the temple4 in these reflections the obvious ground of attack occupied by hunt is again resumed the general indecency of a theatrical exhibition which alluded to statetransactions of a grave and most important nature the indecorum of comparing the king to such a monarch as henry iii infamous for treachery cruelty and vices of the most profligate nature above all the parallel betwixt the dukes of monmouth and guise by which the former is exhibited as a traitor to his father and recommended as no improper object for assassinationare topics insisted on at some length and with great vehemence  our author was not insensible to these attacks by which his loyalty to the king and the decency of his conduct towards monmouth the kings offending but still beloved son and once drydens own patron stood painfully compromised accordingly shortly after these pamphlets had appeared the following advertisement was annexed to the duke of guise    there was a preface intended to this play in vindication of it   against two scurrilous libels lately printed but it was judged   that a defence of this nature would require more room than a preface   reasonably could allow for this cause and for the importunities of   the stationers who hastened their impression it is deferred for   some little time and will be printed by itself most men are   already of opinion that neither of the pamphlets deserve an answer   because they are stuffed with open falsities and sometimes   contradict each other but for once they shall have a day or two   thrown away upon them though i break an old custom for their sakes   which wasto scorn them  the resolution thus announced did not give universal satisfaction to our authors friends one of whom published the following remonstrance which contains some good sense in very indifferent poetry    an epode to his worthy friend john dryden to advise him not to     answer two malicious pamphlets against his tragedy called the     duke of guise marked by luttrel 10 march 16834    can angry frowns rest on thy noble brow     for trivial things   or

true friends sir will reflect on you  the remonstrance of this friendly poet was unavailing dryden having soon after published the following vindication   footnotes 1 a defence of the charter and municipal rights of the city of    london and the rights of other municipal cities and towns of    england directed to the citizens of london by thomas hunt       si populus vult decipi decipiatur     london printed and to be sold by richard baldwin 4to pages    46     wood informs us that thomas hunt the author was educated at    queens college cambridge and was esteemed a person of quick    parts and of a ready fluency in discourse but withal too pert and    forward he was called to the bar and esteemed a good lawyer in    1659 he became clerk of the assizes at oxford circuit but was    ejected from the office at the restoration to his great loss to    make room for the true owner he wrote an argument for the    bishops right of judging in capital cases in parliament c for    which he expected says anthony no less than to be made lord chief    baron of the exchequer in ireland but falling short of that    honourable office which he too ambitiously catched at and    considering the loss of another place which he unjustly possessed    he soon after appeared one of the worst and most inveterate enemies    to church and state that was in his time and the most malicious    and withal the most ignorant scribbler of the whole herd and was    thereupon stiled by a noted author dryden in the following    vindication magni nominis umbra hunt also published great    and weighty considerations on the duke of york c in favour of    the exclusion he had also the boldness to republish his high    church tract in favour of the bishops jurisdiction with a whig    postscript tending to destroy his own argumentsath ox ii p    728  2 a tory paper then conducted with great zeal and some    controversial talent by sir roger lestrange  3 alluding to the fate of stephen college the protestant joiner a    meddling pragmatical fellow who put himself so far forward in the    disputes at oxford as to draw down the vengeance of the court he    was very harshly treated during his trial and though in the toils    and deprived of all assistance defended himself with right english    manliness he was charged with the ballad on page 6 and with    coming to oxford armed to attack the guards he said he did not    deny he had pistols in his holsters at oxford to which jefferies    answered indecently but not unaptly he thought a chissel might    have been more proper for a joiner poor college was executed a    vengeance unworthy of the king who might have apostrophised him as    hamlet does polonius       thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell      i took thee for thy betterstake thy fortune      thou findst to be too busy is some danger  4 anthony wood is followed by mr malone in supposing that hunt    himself is the templar alluded to but dryden seems obviously to    talk of the author of the defence and the two reflectors as three    separate persons he calls them the sputtering triumvirate mr    hunt and the two reflectors and again what says my lord chief    baron ie hunt to the business what says the liveryman    templar what says og the king of basan ie shadwell to it    the templar may be discovered when we learn who hired a    liverygown to give a vote among the electors                                      the                               vindication                                    of                            the duke of guise   in the year of his majestys happy restoration the first play i undertook was the duke of guise as the fairest way which the act of indemnity had then left us of setting forth the rise of the late rebellion and by exploding the villainies of it upon the stage to precaution posterity against the like errors  as this was my first essay so it met with the fortune of an unfinished piece that is to say it was damned in private by the advice of some friends to whom i shewed it who freely told me that it was an excellent subject but not so artificially wrought as they could have wished and now let my enemies make their best of this confession  the scene of the duke of guises return to paris against the kings positive command was then written i have the copy of it still by me almost the same which it now remains being taken verbatim out of davila for where the action is remarkable and the very words related the poet is not at liberty to change them much and if he will be adding any thing for ornament it ought to be wholly of a piece this do i take for a sufficient justification of that scene unless they will make the pretended parallel to be a prophecy as well as a parallel of accidents that were twenty years after to come1 neither do i find that they can suggest the least colour for it in any other part of the tragedy  but now comes the main objectionwhy was it stopt then to which i shall render this just account with all due respects to those who were the occasion of it  upon a wandering rumour which i will divide betwixt malice and mistake that some great persons were represented or personated in it the matter was complained of to my lord chamberlain who thereupon appointed the play to be brought to him and prohibited the acting of it until further order commanding me after this to wait upon his lordship which i did and humbly desired him to compare the play with the history from whence the subject was taken referring to the first scene of the fourth act whereupon the exception was grounded and leaving davila the original with his lordship this was before midsummer and about two months after i received the play back again from his lordship but without any positive order whether it should be acted or not neither was mr lee or myself any way solicitous about it but this indeed i ever said that it was intended for the kings service and his majesty was the best judge whether it answered that end or no and that i reckoned it my duty to submit if his majesty for any reason whatsoever should deem it unfit for the stage in the interim a strict scrutiny was made and no parallel of the great person designed could be made out but this push failing there were immediately started some terrible insinuations that the person of his majesty was represented under that of henry the third which if they could have found out would have concluded perchance not only in the stopping of the play but in the hanging up of the poets but so it was that his majestys wisdom and justice acquitted both the one and the other and when the play itself was almost forgotten there were orders given for the acting of it  this is matter of fact and i have the honour of so great witnesses to the truth of what i have delivered that it will need no other appeal as to the exposing of any person living our innocency is so clear that it is almost unnecessary to say it was not in my thought and as far as any one man can vouch for another i do believe it was as little in mr lees and now since some people have been so busy as to cast out false and scandalous surmises how far we two agreed upon the writing of it i must do a common right both to mr lee and myself to declare publicly that it was at his earnest desire without any solicitation of mine that this play was produced betwixt us after the writing of oedipus i passed a promise to join with him in another and he happened to claim the performance of that promise just upon the finishing of a poem2 when i would have been glad of a little respite before the undertaking of a second task the person that passed betwixt us knows this to be true and mr lee himself i am sure will not disown it so that i did not seduce him to join with me as the malicious authors of the reflections are pleased to call it but mr lees loyalty is above so ridiculous a slander i know very well that the town did ignorantly call and take this to be my play but i shall not arrogate to myself the merits of my friend twothirds of it belonged to him and to me only the first scene of the play the whole fourth act and the first half or somewhat more of the fifth  the pamphleteers i know do very boldly insinuate that before the acting of it i took the whole play to myself but finding afterwards how ill success it had upon the stage i threw as much of it as possibly i could upon my fellow now here are three damned lies crowded together into a very little room first that i assumed any part of it to myself which i had not written wherein i appeal not only to my particular acquaintance but to the whole company of actors who will witness for me that in all the rehearsals i never pretended to any one scene of mr lees but did him all imaginable right in his title to the greater part of it i hope i may without vanity affirm to the world that i never stood in need of borrowing another mans reputation and i have been as little guilty of the injustice of laying claim to any thing which was not my own nay i durst almost refer myself to some of the angry poets on the other side whether i have not rather countenanced and assisted their beginnings than hindered them from rising3 the two other falsities are the ill success of the play and my disowning it the former is manifestly without foundation for it succeeded beyond my very hopes having been frequently acted and never without a considerable audience and then it is a thousand to one that having no ground to disown it i did not disown it but the universe to a nutshell that i did not disown it for want of success when it succeeded so much beyond my expectation but my malignant adversaries are the more excusable for this coarse method of breaking in upon truth and good manners because it is the only way they have to gratify the genius and the interest of the faction together and never so much pains taken neither to so very very little purpose they decry the play but in such a manner that it has the effect of a recommendation they call it a dull entertainment and that is a dangerous word i must confess from one of the greatest masters in human nature of that faculty now i can forgive them this reproach too after all the rest for this play does openly discover the original and root of the practices and principles both of their party and cause and they are so well acquainted with all the trains and mazes of rebellion that there is nothing new to them in the whole history or what if it were a little insipid there was no conjuring that i remember in pope joan and the lancashire witches were without doubt the most insipid jades that ever flew upon a stage and even these by the favour of a party made a shift to hold up their heads4 now if we have outdone these plays in their own dull way their authors have some sort of privilege to throw the first stone but we shall rather chuse to yield the point of dulness than contend for it against so indisputable a claim  but matters of state it seems are canvassed on the stage and things of the gravest concernment there managed and who were the aggressors i beseech you but a few factious popular hirelings that by tampering the theatres and by poisoning the people made a playhouse more seditious than a conventicle so that the loyal party crave only the same freedom of defending the government which the other took beforehand of exposing and defaming it there was no complaint of any disorders of the stage in the bustle that was made even to the forming of a party to uphold a farce of theirs5 upon the first day the whole faction in a manner appeared but after one sight of it they sent their proxies of servingmen and porters to clap in the right of their patrons and it was impossible ever to have gotten off the nonsense of three hours for halfacrown but for the providence of so congruous an audience thus far i presume the reckoning is even for bad plays on both sides and for plays written for a party i shall say nothing of their poets affection to the government unless upon an absolute and an odious necessity but to return to the pretended parallel  i have said enough already to convince any man of common sense that there neither was nor could be any parallel intended and it will farther appear from the nature of the subject there being no relation betwixt henry the third and the duke of guise except that of the kings marrying into the family of lorraine if a comparison had been designed how easy had it been either to have found a story or to have invented one where the ties of nature had been nearer if we consider their actions or their persons a much less proportion will be yet found betwixt them and if we bate the popularity perhaps none at all if we consider them in reference to their parties the one was manifestly the leader the other at the worst is but misled the designs of the one tended openly to usurpation those of the other may yet be interpreted more fairly and i hope from the natural candour and probity of his temper that it will come to a perfect submission and reconcilement at last but that which perfectly destroys this pretended parallel is that our picture of the duke of guise is exactly according to the original in the history his actions his manners nay sometimes his very words are so justly copied that whoever has read him in davila sees him the same here there is no going out of the way no dash of a pen to make any byfeature resemble him to any other man and indeed excepting his ambition there was not in france or perhaps in any other country any man of his age vain enough to hope he could be mistaken for him6 so that if you would have made a parallel we could not and yet i fancy that where i make it my business to draw likeness it will be no hard matter to judge who sate for the picture for the duke of guises return to paris contrary to the kings order enough already has been said it was too considerable in the story to be omitted because it occasioned the mischiefs that ensued but in this likeness which was only casual no danger followed i am confident there was none intended and am satisfied that none was feared but the argument drawn from our evident design is yet if possible more convincing the first words of the prologue spake the play to be a parallel and then you are immediately informed how far that parallel extended and of what it is so the holy league begot the covenant guisards got the whig c so then it is not as the snarling authors of the reflections tell you a parallel of the men but of the times a parallel of the factions and of the leaguers and every one knows that this prologue was written before the stopping of the play neither was the name altered on any such account as they insinuate but laid aside long before because a book called the parallel had been printed resembling the french league to the english covenant and therefore we thought it not convenient to make use of another mans title7 the chief person in the tragedy or he whose disasters are the subject of it may in reason give the name and so it was called the duke of guise our intention therefore was to make the play a parallel betwixt the holy league plotted by the house of guise and its adherents with the covenant plotted by the rebels in the time of king charles i and those of the new association which was the spawn of the old covenant  but this parallel is plain that the exclusion of the lawful heir was the main design of both parties and that the endeavours to get the lieutenancy of france established on the head of the league is in effect the same with offering to get the militia out of the kings hand as declared by parliament and consequently that the power of peace and war should be wholly in the people it is also true that the tumults in the city in the choice of their officers have had no small resemblance with a parisian rabble and i am afraid that both their faction and ours had the same good lord i believe also that if julian had been written and calculated for the parisians as it was for our sectaries one of their sheriffs might have mistaken too and called him julian the apostle8 i suppose i need not push this point any further where the parallel was intended i am certain it will reach but a larger account of the proceedings in the city may be expected from a better hand and i have no reason to forestall it9 in the mean time because there has been no actual rebellion the faction triumph in their loyalty which if it were out of principle all our divisions would soon be ended and we the happy people which god and the constitution of our government have put us in condition to be but so long as they take it for a maxim that the king is but an officer in trust that the people or their representatives are superior to him judges of miscarriages and have power of revocation it is a plain case that whenever they please they may take up arms and according to their doctrine lawfully too let them jointly renounce this one opinion as in conscience and law they are bound to do because both scripture and acts of parliament oblige them to it and we will then thank their obedience for our quiet whereas now we are only beholden to them for their fear the miseries of the last war are yet too fresh in all mens memory and they are not rebels only because they have been so too lately an author of theirs has told us roundly the westcountry proverb chud eat more cheese and chad it their stomach is as good as ever it was but the mischief ont is they are either muzzled or want their teeth if there were as many fanatics now in england as there were christians in the empire when julian reigned i doubt we should not find them much inclined to passive obedience and curse ye meroz10 would be oftener preached upon than give to cæsar except in the sense mr hunt means it  having clearly shewn wherein the parallel consisted which no man can mistake who does not wilfully i need not justify myself in what concerns the sacred person of his majesty neither the french history nor our own could have supplied me nor plutarch himself were he now alive could have found a greek or roman to have compared to him in that eminent virtue of his clemency even his enemies must acknowledge it to be superlative because they live by it far be it from flattery if i say that there is nothing under heaven which can furnish me with a parallel and that in his mercy he is of all men the truest image of his maker  henry iii was a prince of a mixed character he had as an old historian says of another magnas virtutes nec minora vitia but amongst those virtues i do not find his forgiving qualities to be much celebrated that he was deeply engaged in the bloody massacre of st bartholomew is notoriously known and if the relation printed in the memoirs of villeroy be true he confesses there that the admiral having brought him and the queenmother into suspicion with his brother then reigning for endeavouring to lessen his authority and draw it to themselves he first designed his accusers death by maurevel who shot him with a carbine but failed to kill him after which he pushed on the king to that dreadful revenge which immediately succeeded it is true the provocations were high there had been reiterated rebellions but a peace was now concluded it was solemnly sworn to by both parties and as great an assurance of safety given to the protestants as the word of a king and public instruments could make it therefore the punishment was execrable and it pleased god if we may dare to judge of his secret providence to cut off that king in the very flower of his youth to blast his successor in his undertakings to raise against him the duke of guise the complotter and executioner of that inhuman action who by the divine justice fell afterwards into the same snare which he had laid for others and finally to die a violent death himself murdered by a priest an enthusiast of his own religion11 from these premises let it be concluded if reasonably it can that we could draw a parallel where the lines were so diametrically opposite we were indeed obliged by the laws of poetry to cast into shadows the vices of this prince for an excellent critic has lately told us that when a king is named a hero is supposed12 it is a reverence due to majesty to make the virtues as conspicuous and the vices as obscure as we can possibly and this we own we have either performed or at least endeavoured but if we were more favourable to that character than the exactness of history would allow we have been far from diminishing a greater by drawing it into comparison you may see through the whole conduct of the play a king naturally severe and a resolution carried on to revenge himself to the uttermost on the rebellious conspirators that this was sometimes shaken by reasons of policy and pity is confessed but it always returned with greater force and ended at last in the ruin of his enemies in the mean time we cannot but observe the wonderful loyalty on the other side that the play was to be stopped because the king was represented may we have many such proofs of their duty and respect but there was no occasion for them here it is to be supposed that his majesty himself was made acquainted with this objection if he were so he was the supreme and only judge of it and then the event justifies us if it were inspected only by those whom he commanded it is hard if his own officers and servants should not see as much ill in it as other men and be as willing to prevent it especially when there was no solicitation used to have it acted it is known that noble person13 to whom it was referred is a severe critic on good sense decency and morality and i can assure the world that the rules of horace are more familiar to him than they are to me he remembers too well that the vetus comædia was banished from the athenian theatre for its too much licence in representing persons and would never have pardoned it in this or any play  what opinion henry iii had of his successor is evident from the words he spoke upon his deathbed he exhorted the nobility says davila to acknowledge the king of navarre to whom the kingdom of right belonged and that they should not stick at the difference of religion for both the king of navarre a man of a sincere noble nature would in the end return into the bosom of the church and the pope being better informed would receive him into his favour to prevent the ruin of the whole kingdom i hope i shall not need in this quotation to defend myself as if it were my opinion that the pope has any right to dispose of kingdoms my meaning is evident that the kings judgment of his brotherinlaw was the same which i have copied and i must farther add from davila that the arguments i have used in defence of that succession were chiefly drawn from the kings answer to the deputies as they may be seen more at large in pages 730 and 731 of the first edition of that history in english there the three estates to the wonder of all men jointly concurred in cutting off the succession the clergy who were managed by the archbishop of lyons and cardinal of guise were the first who promoted it and the commons and nobility afterwards consented as referring themselves says our author to the clergy so that there was only the king to stand in the gap and he by artifice diverted that storm which was breaking upon posterity  the crown was then reduced to the lowest ebb of its authority and the king in a manner stood single and yet preserved his negative entire but if the clergy and nobility had been on his part of the balance it might reasonably be supposed that the meeting of those estates at blois had healed the breaches of the nation and not forced him to the ratio ultima regum which is never to be praised nor is it here but only excused as the last result of his necessity as for the parallel betwixt the king of navarre and any other prince now living what likeness the god of nature and the descent of virtues in the same channel have produced is evident i have only to say that the nation certainly is happy where the royal virtues of the progenitors are derived on their descendants14  in that scene it is true there is but one of the three estates mentioned but the other two are virtually included for the archbishop and cardinal are at the head of the deputies and that the rest are mute persons every critic understands the reason ne quarta loqui persona laboret i am never willing to cumber the stage with many speakers when i can reasonably avoid it as here i might and what if i had a mind to pass over the clergy and nobility of france in silence and to excuse them from joining in so illegal and so ungodly a decree am i tied in poetry to the strict rules of history i have followed it in this play more closely than suited with the laws of the drama and a great victory they will have who shall discover to the world this wonderful secret that i have not observed the unities of place and time but are they better kept in the farce of the libertine destroyed15 it was our common business here to draw the parallel of the times and not to make an exact tragedy for this once we were resolved to err with honest shakespeare neither can catiline or sejanus written by the great master of our art stand excused any more than we from this exception but if we must be criticised some plays of our adversaries may be exposed and let them reckon their gains when the dispute is ended i am accused of ignorance for speaking of the third estate as not sitting in the same house with the other two let not those gentlemen mistake themselves there are many things in plays to be accommodated to the country in which we live i spoke to the understanding of an english audience our three estates now sit and have long done so in two houses but our records bear witness that they according to the french custom have sate in one that is the lords spiritual and temporal within the bar and the commons without it if that custom had been still continued here it should have been so represented but being otherwise i was forced to write so as to be understood by our own countrymen if these be errors a bigger poet than either of us two has fallen into greater and the proofs are ready whenever the suit shall be recommenced  mr hunt the jehu of the party begins very furiously with me and says i have already condemned the charter and city and have executed the magistrates in effigy upon the stage in a play called the duke of guise frequently acted and applauded c16  compare the latter end of this sentence with what the two authors of the reflections or perhaps the associating club of the deviltavern17 write in the beginning of their libelnever was mountain delivered of such a mouse the fiercest tories have been ashamed to defend this piece they who have any sparks of wit among them are so true to their pleasure that they will not suffer dulness to pass upon them for wit nor tediousness for diversion which is the reason that this piece has not met with the expected applause i never saw a play more deficient in wit good characters or entertainment than this is  for shame gentlemen pack your evidence a little better against another time you see my lord chief baron18 has delivered his opinion that the play was frequently acted and applauded but you of the jury have found ignoramus on the wit and the success of it oates dugdale and turberville never disagreed more than you do let us know at last which of the witnesses are true protestants and which are irish19 but it seems your authors had contrary designs mr hunt thought fit to say it was frequently acted and applauded because says he it was intended to provoke the rabble into tumults and disorder now if it were not seen frequently this argument would lose somewhat of its force the reflectors business went another way it was to be allowed no reputation no success but to be damned root and branch to prevent the prejudice it might do their party accordingly as much as in them lay they have drawn a bill of exclusion for it on the stage but what rabble was it to provoke are the audience of a playhouse which are generally persons of honour noblemen and ladies or at worst as one of your authors calls his gallants men of wit and pleasure about the town20are these the rabble of mr hunt i have seen a rabble at sir edmundbury godfreys night and have heard of such a name as true protestant meetinghouses but a rabble is not to be provoked where it never comes indeed we had one in this tragedy but it was upon the stage and thats the reason why your reflectors would break the glass which has shewed them their own faces the business of the theatre is to expose vice and folly to dissuade men by examples from one and to shame them out of the other and however you may pervert our good intentions it was here particularly to reduce men to loyalty by shewing the pernicious consequences of rebellion and popular insurrections i believe no man who loves the government would be glad to see the rabble in such a posture as they were represented in our play but if the tragedy had ended on your side the play had been a loyal witty poem the success of it should have been recorded by immortal og or doeg21 and the rabble scene should have been true protestant though a whigdevil were at the head of it  in the mean time pray where lies the relation betwixt the tragedy of the duke of guise and the charter of london mr hunt has found a rare connection for he tacks them together by the kicking of the sheriffs that chain of thought was a little ominous for something like a kicking has succeeded the printing of his book and the charter of london was the quarrel for my part i have not law enough to state that question much less decide it let the charter shift for itself in westminsterhall the government is somewhat wiser than to employ my ignorance on such a subject my promise to honest nat lee was the only bribe i had to engage me in this trouble for which he has the good fortune to escape scotfree and i am left in pawn for the reckoning who had the least share in the entertainment but the rising it seems should have been on the true protestant side for he has tried says ingenious mr hunt what he could do towards making the charter forfeitable by some extravagancy and disorder of the people a wise man i had been doubtless for my pains to raise the rabble to a tumult where i had been certainly one of the first men whom they had limbed or dragged to the next convenient signpost  but on second thought he says this ought not to move the citizens he is much in the right for the rabble scene was written on purpose to keep his party of them in the bounds of duty it is the business of factious men to stir up the populace sir edmond on horseback attended by a swinging pope in effigy and forty thousand true protestants for his guard to execution are a show more proper for that design than a thousand stageplays22  well he has fortified his opinion with a reason however why the people should not be moved because i have so maliciously and mischievously represented the king and the kings son nay and his favourite saith he the duke too to whom i give the worst strokes of my unlucky fancy  this need not be answered for it is already manifest that neither the king nor the kings son are represented neither that son he means nor any of the rest god bless them all what strokes of my unlucky fancy i have given to his royal highness will be seen and it will be seen also who strikes him worst and most unluckily  the duke of guise he tells us ought to have represented a great prince that had inserved to some most detestable villainy to please the rage or lust of a tyrant such great courtiers have been often sacrificed to appease the furies of the tyrants guilty conscience to expiate for his sin and to attone the people for a tyrant naturally stands in fear of such wicked ministers is obnoxious to them awed by them and they drag him to greater evils for their own impunity than they perpetrated for his pleasure and their own ambition23  sure he said not all this for nothing i would know of him on what persons he would fix the sting of this sharp satire what two they are whom to use his own words he so maliciously and mischievously would represent for my part i dare not understand the villainy of his meaning but somebody was to have been shown a tyrant and some other a great prince inserving to some detestable villainy and to that tyrants rage and lust this great prince or courtier ought to be sacrificed to atone the people and the tyrant is persuaded for his own interest to give him up to public justice i say no more but that he has studied the law to good purpose he is dancing on the rope without a metaphor his knowledge of the law is the staff that poizes him and saves his neck the party indeed speaks out sometimes for wickedness is not always so wise as to be secret especially when it is driven to despair by some of their discourses we may guess at whom he points but he has fenced himself in with so many evasions that he is safe in his sacrilege and he who dares to answer him may become obnoxious it is true he breaks a little out of the clouds within two paragraphs for there he tells you that caius cæsar to give into cæsar the things that were cæsars was in the catiline conspiracy a fine insinuation this to be sneered at by his party and yet not to be taken hold of by public justice they would be glad now that i or any man should bolt out their covert treason for them for their loophole is ready that the cæsar here spoken of was a private man but the application of the text declares the authors to be another cæsar which is so black and so infamous an aspersion that nothing less than the highest clemency can leave it unpunished i could reflect on his ignorance in this place for attributing these words to cæsar he that is not with us is against us he seems to have mistaken them out of the newtestament and that is the best defence i can make for him for if he did it knowingly it was impiously done to put our saviours words into cæsars mouth but his law and our gospel are two things this gentlemans knowledge is not of the bible any more than his practice is according to it he tells you he will give the world a taste of my atheism and impiety for which he quotes these following verses in the second or third act of the duke of guise    for conscience or heavens fear religious rules   are all state bells to toll in pious fools  in the first place he is mistaken in his man for the verses are not mine but mr lees i asked him concerning them and have this accountthat they were spoken by the devil now what can either whig or devil say more proper to their character than that religion is only a name a stalkinghorse as errant a property as godliness and property themselves are amongst their party yet for these two lines which in the mouth that speaks them are of no offence he halloos on the whole pack against me judge justice surrogate and official are to be employed at his suit to direct process and boring through the tongue for blasphemy is the least punishment his charity will allow me  i find it is happy for me that he was not made a judge and yet i had as lieve have him my judge as my council if my life were at stake my poor lord stafford was well helped up with this gentleman for his solicitor no doubt he gave that unfortunate nobleman most admirable advice towards the saving of his life and would have rejoiced exeedingly to have seen him cleared24 i think i have disproved his instance of my atheism it remains for him to justify his religion in putting the words of christ into a heathens mouth and much more in his prophane allusion to the scripture in the other textgive unto cæsar the things that are cæsars which if it be not a profanation of the bible for the sake of a silly witticism let all men but his own party judge i am not malicious enough to return him the names which he has called me but of all sins i thank god i have always abhorred atheism and i had need be a better christian than mr hunt has shown himself if i forgive him so infamous a slander  but as he has mistaken our saviour for julius cæsar so he would pompey too if he were let alone to him and to his cause or to the like cause it belonged he says to use these wordshe that is not for us is against us i find he cares not whose the expression is so it be not christs but how comes pompey the great to be a whig he was indeed a defender of the ancient established roman government but cæsar was the whig who took up arms unlawfully to subvert it our liberties and our religion both are safe they are secured to us by the laws and those laws are executed under an established government by a lawful king the defender of our faith is the defender of our common freedom to cabal to write to rail against this administration are all endeavours to destroy the government and to oppose the succession in any private man is a treasonable practice against the foundation of it pompey very honourably maintained the liberty of his country which was governed by a commonwealth so that there lies no parallel betwixt his cause and mr hunts except in the bare notion of a commonwealth as it is opposed to monarchy and thats the thing he would obliquely slur upon us yet on these premises he is for ordering my lord chief justice to grant out warrants against all those who have applauded the duke of guise as if they committed a riot when they clapped i suppose they paid for their places as well as he and his party did who hissed if he were not half distracted for not being lord chief baron methinks he should be lawyer enough to advise my lord chief justice better to clap and hiss are the privileges of a freeborn subject in a playhouse they buy them with their money and their hands and mouths are their own property it belongs to the master of the revels to see that no treason or immorality be in the play but when it is acted let every man like or dislike freely not but that respect should be used too in the presence of the king for by his permission the actors are allowed it is due to his person as he is sacred and to the successors as being next related to him there are opportunities enow for men to hiss who are so disposed in their absence for when the king is in sight though but by accident a malefactor is reprieved from death yet such is the duty and good manners of these good subjects that they forbore not some rudeness in his majestys presence but when his royal highness and his court were only there they pushed it as far as their malice had power and if their party had been more numerous the affront had been greater  the next paragraph of our authors is a panegyric on the duke of monmouth which concerns not me who am very far from detracting from him the obligations i have had to him were those of his countenance his favour his good word and his esteem all which i have likewise had in a greater measure from his excellent duchess the patroness of my poor unworthy poetry if i had not greater the fault was never in their want of goodness to me but in my own backwardness to ask which has always and i believe will ever keep me from rising in the world let this be enough with reasonable men to clear me from the imputation of an ungrateful man with which my enemies have most unjustly taxed me if i am a mercenary scribbler the lords commissioners of the treasury best know i am sure they have found me no importunate solicitor for i know myself i deserved little and therefore have never desired much i return that slander with just disdain on my accusers it is for men who have ill consciences to suspect others i am resolved to stand or fall with the cause of my god my king and country never to trouble myself for any railing aspersions which i have not deserved and to leave it as a portion to my childrenthat they had a father who durst do his duty and was neither covetous nor mercenary  as little am i concerned at that imputation of my backfriends that i have confessed myself to be put on to write as i do if they mean this play in particular that is notoriously proved against them to be false for the rest of my writings my hatred of their practices and principles was cause enough to expose them as i have done and will do more i do not think as they do for if i did i must think treason but i must in conscience write as i do because i know which is more than thinking that i write for a lawful established government against anarchy innovation and sedition but these lies as prince harry said to falstaff are as gross as he that made them25 more i need not say for i am accused without witness i fear not any of their evidences not even him of salamanca who though he has disowned his doctorship in spain yet there are some allow him to have taken a certain degree in italy a climate they say more proper for his masculine constitution26 to conclude this ridiculous accusation against me i know but four men in their whole party to whom i have spoken for above this year last past and with them neither but casually and cursorily we have been acquaintance of a long standing many years before this accursed plot divided men into several parties i dare call them to witness whether the most i have at any time said will amount to more than this that i hoped the time would come when these names of whig and tory would cease among us and that we might live together as we had done formerly i have since this pamphlet met accidentally with two of them and i am sure they are so far from being my accusers that they have severally owned to me that all men who espouse a party must expect to be blackened by the contrary side that themselves knew nothing of it nor of the authors of the reflections it remains therefore to be considered whether if i were as much a knave as they would make me i am fool enough to be guilty of this charge and whether they who raised it would have made it public if they had thought i was theirs inwardly for it is plain they are glad of worse scribblers than i am and maintain them too as i could prove if i envied them their miserable subsistence i say no more but let my actions speak for me spectemur agendothat is the trial  much less am i concerned at the noble name of bayes that is a brat so like his own father that he cannot be mistaken for any other body27 they might as reasonably have called tom sternhold virgil and the resemblance would have held as well  as for knave and sycophant and rascal and impudent and devil and old serpent and a thousand such good morrows i take them to be only names of parties and could return murderer and cheat and whignapper and sodomite and in short the goodly number of the seven deadly sins with all their kindred and relations which are names of parties too but saints will be saints in spite of villainy i believe they would pass themselves upon us for such a compound as mithridate or venicetreacle as if whiggism were an admirable cordial in the mass though the several ingredients are rank poisons  but if i think either mr hunt a villain or know any of my reflectors to be ungrateful rogues i do not owe them so much kindness as to call them so for i am satisfied that to prove them either would but recommend them to their own party yet if some will needs make a merit of their infamy and provoke a legend of their sordid lives i think they must be gratified at last and though i will not take the scavengers employment from him yet i may be persuaded to point at some mens doors who have heaps of filth before them but this must be when they have a little angered me for hitherto i am provoked no further than to smile at them and indeed to look upon the whole faction in a lump never was a more pleasant sight than to behold these builders of a new babel how ridiculously they are mixed and what a rare confusion there is amongst them one part of them is carrying stone and mortar for the building of a meetinghouse another sort understand not that language they are for snatching away their workfellows materials to set up a bawdyhouse some of them blaspheme and others pray and both i believe with equal godliness at bottom some of them are atheists some sectaries yet all true protestants most of them love all whores but her of babylon in few words any man may be what he will so he be one of them it is enough to despise the king to hate the duke and rail at the succession after this it is no matter how a man lives he is a saint by infection he goes along with the party has their mark upon him his wickedness is no more than frailty their righteousness is imputed to him so that as ignorant rogues go out doctors when a prince comes to an university they hope at the last day to take their degree in a crowd of true protestants and thrust unheeded into heaven28  it is a credit to be railed at by such men as these the charterman in the very titlepage where he hangs out the cloth of the city before his book gives it for his motto si populus vult decipi decipiatur29 as if he should have said you have a mind to be cozened and the devil give you good ont if i cry a sirreverence and you take it for honey make the best of your bargain for shame good christians can you suffer such a man to starve when you see his design is upon your purses he is contented to expose the ears representative of your party on the pillory and is in a way of doing you more service than a wornout witness who can hang nobody hereafter but himself he tells you the papists clap their hands in the hopes they conceive of the ruin of your government does not this single syllable your deserve a pension if he can prove the government to be yours and that the king has nothing to do in your republic he continues as if that were as sure and certain to them as it is to us without doubt that they the papists once fired the city just as certain in your own consciences i wish the papists had no more to answer for than that accusation pray let it be put to the vote and resolved upon the question by your whole party that the northeast wind is not only illaffected to man and beast but is also a tory or tantivy papist in masquerade30 i am satisfied not to have so much art left me as to frame any thing agreeable or verisimilar but it is plain that he has and therefore as i ought in justice i resign my laurel and my bays too to mr hunt it is he sets up for the poet now and has the only art to amuse and to deceive the people you may see how profound his knowledge is in poetry for he tells you just before that my heroes are commonly such monsters as theseus and hercules renowned throughout all ages for destroying31 now theseus and hercules you know have been the heroes of all poets and have been renowned through all ages for destroying monsters for succouring the distressed and for putting to death inhuman arbitrary tyrants is this your oracle if he were to write the acts and monuments of whig heroes i find they should be quite contrary to mine destroyers indeedbut of a lawful government murderersbut of their fellowsubjects lovers as hercules was of hylas with a journey at last to hell like that of theseus  but mark the wise consequences of our author i have not he says so much art left me to make any thing agreeable or verisimilar wherewith to amuse or deceive the people and yet in the very next paragraph my province is to corrupt the manners of the nation and lay waste their morals and my endeavours are more happily applied to extinguish the little remainders of the virtue of the age now i am to perform all this it seems without making any thing verisimilar or agreeable why pharaoh never set the israelites such a task to build pyramids without brick or straw if the fool knows it not verisimilitude and agreeableness are the very tools to do it but i am willing to disclaim them both rather than to use them to so ill purpose as he has done  yet even this their celebrated writer knows no more of stile and english than the northern dictator as if dulness and clumsiness were fatal to the name of tom it is true he is a fool in three languages more than the poet for they say he understands latin greek and hebrew from all which to my certain knowledge i acquit the other og may write against the king if he pleases so long as he drinks for him and his writings will never do the government so much harm as his drinking does it good for true subjects will not be much perverted by his libels but the wineduties rise considerably by his claret he has often called me an atheist in print i would believe more charitably of him and that he only goes the broad way because the other is too narrow for him he may see by this i do not delight to meddle with his course of life and his immoralities though i have a long beadroll of them i have hitherto contented myself with the ridiculous part of him which is enough in all conscience to employ one man even without the story of his late fall at the old devil where he broke no ribs because the hardness of the stairs could reach no bones and for my part i do not wonder how he came to fall for i have always known him heavy the miracle is how he got up again i have heard of a sea captain as fat as he who to escape arrests would lay himself flat upon the ground and let the bailiffs carry him to prison if they could if a messenger or two nay we may put in three or four should come he has friendly advertisement how to escape them but to leave him who is not worth any further consideration now i have done laughing at himwould every man knew his own talent and that they who are only born for drinking would let both poetry and prose alone32  i am weary with tracing the absurdities and mistakes of our great lawyer some of which indeed are wilful as where he calls the trimmers the more moderate sort of tories it seems those politicians are odious to both sides for neither own them to be theirs we know them and so does he too in his conscience to be secret whigs if they are any thing but now the designs of whiggism are openly discovered they tack about to save a stake that is they will not be villains to their own ruin while the government was to be destroyed and there was probability of compassing it no men were so violent as they but since their fortunes are in hazard by the law and their places at court by the kings displeasure they pull in their horns and talk more peaceably in order i suppose to their vehemence on the right side if they were to be believed for in laying of colours they observe a medium black and white are too far distant to be placed directly by one another without some shadowings to soften their contrarieties it is mariana i think but am not certain that makes the following relation and let the noble family of trimmers read their own fortune in it don pedro king of castile surnamed the cruel who had been restored by the valour of our edward the black prince was finally dispossessed by don henry the bastard and he enjoyed the kingdom quietly till his death which when he felt approaching he called his son to him and gave him this his last counsel i have said he gained this kingdom which i leave you by the sword for the right of inheritance was in don pedro but the favour of the people who hated my brother for his tyranny was to me instead of title you are now to be the peaceable possessor of what i have unjustly gotten and your subjects are composed of these three sorts of men one party espoused my brothers quarrel which was the undoubted lawful cause those though they were my enemies were men of principle and honour cherish them and exalt them into places of trust about you for in them you may confide safely who prized their fidelity above their fortune another sort are they who fought my cause against don pedro to those you are indeed obliged because of the accidental good they did me for they intended only their private benefit and helped to raise me that i might afterwards promote them you may continue them in their offices if you please but trust them no farther than you are forced for what they did was against their conscience but there is a third sort which during the whole wars were neuters let them be crushed on all occasions for their business was only their own security they had neither courage enough to engage on my side nor conscience enough to help their lawful sovereign therefore let them be made examples as the worst sort of interested men which certainly are enemies to both and would be profitable to neither  i have only a dark remembrance of this story and have not the spanish author by me but i think i am not much mistaken in the main of it and whether true or false the counsel given i am sure is such as ought in common prudence to be practised against trimmers whether the lawful or unlawful cause prevail loyal men may justly be displeased with this party not for their moderation as mr hunt insinuates but because under that mask of seeming mildness there lies hidden either a deep treachery or at best an interested lukewarmness but he runs riot into almost treasonable expressions as if trimmers were hated because they are not perfectly wicked or perfectly deceived of the catiline make bold and without understanding that can adhere to men that publicly profess murders and applaud the design by all which villainous names he opprobriously calls his majestys most loyal subjects as if men must be perfectly wicked who endeavour to support a lawful government or perfectly deceived who on no occasion dare take up arms against their sovereign as if acknowledging the right of succession and resolving to maintain it in the line were to be in a catiline conspiracy and at last which is ridiculous enough after so much serious treason as if to clap the duke of guise were to adhere to men that publicly profess murders and applaud the design of the assassinating poets  but together with his villainies pray let his incoherences be observed he commends the trimmers at least tacitly excuses them for men of some moderation and this in opposition to the instruments of wickedness of the catiline make that are resolute and forward and without consideration but he forgets all this in the next twenty lines for there he gives them their own and tells them roundly in internecino bello medii pro hostibus habentur neutral men are traitors and assist by their indifferency to the destruction of the government the plain english of his meaning is this while matters are only in dispute and in machination he is contented they should be moderate but when once the faction can bring about a civil war then they are traitors if they declare not openly for them  but it is not says he the duke of guise who is to be assassinated a turbulent wicked and haughty courtier but an innocent and gentle prince by his favour our duke of guise was neither innocent nor gentle nor a prince of the blood royal though he pretended to descend from charlemagne and a genealogy was printed to that purpose for which the author was punished as he deserved witness davila and the journals of henry iii where the story is at large related well who is it then why it is a prince who has no fault but that he is the kings son then he has no fault by consequence for i am certain that is no fault of his the rest of the compliment is so silly and so fulsome as if he meant it all in ridicule and to conclude the jest he says that the best people of england have no other way left to shew their loyalty to the king their religion and government in long intervals of parliament than by prosecuting his son for the sake of the king and his own merit with all the demonstrations of the highest esteem  yes i can tell them one other way to express their loyalty which is to obey the king and to respect his brother as the next lawful successor their religion commands them both and the government is secured in so doing but why in intervals of parliament how are they more obliged to honour the kings son out of parliament than in it and why this prosecution of love for the kings sake has he ordered more love to be shewn to one son than to another indeed his own quality is cause sufficient for all men to respect him and i am of their number who truly honour him and who wish him better than this miserable sycophant for i wish him from his fathers royal kindness what justice can make him which is a greater honour than the rabble can confer upon him  but our author finds that commendation is no more his talent than flattery was that of Æsops ass and therefore falls immediately from pawing with his forefeet and grinning upon one prince to downright braying against another  he says i have not used my patron duke much better for i have put him under a most dismal and unfortunate character of a successor excluded from the crown by act of state for his religion who fought his way to the crown changed his religion and died by the hand of a roman assassinate  if it please his royal highness to be my patron i have reason to be proud of it because he never yet forsook any man whom he has had the goodness to own for his but how have i put him under an unfortunate character the authors of the reflections and our johnanokes have not laid their noddles together about this accusation for it is their business to prove the king of navarre to have been a most successful magnanimous gentle and grateful prince in which character they have followed the stream of all historians how then happens this jarring amongst friends that the same man is put under such dismal circumstances on one side and so fortunate on the other by the writers of the same party the answer is very plain that they take the cause by several handles they who will not have the duke resemble the king of navarre have magnified the character of that prince to debase his royal highness and therein done what they can to shew the disparity mr hunt who will have it to be the dukes character has blackened that king as much as he is able to shew the likeness now this would be ridiculous pleading at a bar by lawyers retained for the same cause and both sides would call each other fools because the jury betwixt them would be confounded and perhaps the judges too  but this it is to have a bad cause which puts men of necessity upon knavery and that knavery is commonly found out well mr hunt has in another place confessed himself to be in passion and that is the reason he is so grosly mistaken in opening of the cause for first the king of navarre was neither under dismal nor unfortunate circumstances before the end of that very sentence our lawyer has confessed that he fought his way to the crown that is he gloriously vanquished all his rebels and happily possessed his inheritance many years after he had regained it in the next place he was never excluded from the crown by act of state he changed his religion indeed but not until he had almost weathered the storm recovered the best part of his estate and gained some glorious victories in pitched battles so that his changing cannot without injustice be attributed to his fear monsieur chiverny in his memoirs of those times plainly tells us that he solemnly promised to his predecessor henry iii then dying that he would become a romanist and davila though he says not this directly yet denies it not by whose hands henry iv died is notoriously known but it is invidiously urged both by mr hunt and the reflectors for we may to our shame remember that a king of our own country was barbarously murdered by his subjects who professed the same religion though i believe that neither jaques clement nor ravaillac were better papists than the independents and presbyterians were protestants so that their argument only proves that there are rogues of all religions iliacos infra muros peccatur et extra but mr hunt follows his blow again that i have offered a justification of an act of exclusion against a popish successor in a protestant kingdom by remembering what was done against the king of navarre who was de facto excluded by an act of state my gentleman i perceive is very willing to call that an act of exclusion and an act of state which is only in our language called a bill for henry iii could never be gained to pass it though it was proposed by the three estates at blois the reflectors are more modest for they profess though i am afraid it is somewhat against the grain that a vote of the house of commons is not an act but the times are turned upon them and they dare speak no other language mr hunt indeed is a bold republican and tells you the bottom of their meaning yet why should it make the courage of his royal highness quail to find himself under this representation which by our authors favour is neither dismal nor disastrous henry iv escaped this dreadful machine of the league i say dreadful for the three estates were at that time composed generally of guisards factious hotheaded rebellious interested men the king in possession was but his brotherinlaw and at the time publicly his enemy for the king of navarre was then in arms against him and yet the sense of common justice and the good of his people so prevailed that he withstood the project of the states which he also knew was levelled at himself for had the exclusion proceeded he had been immediately laid by and the lieutenancy of france conferred on guise after which the rebel would certainly have put up his title for the crown in the case of his royal highness only one of the three estates have offered at the exclusion and have been constantly opposed by the other two and by his majesty neither is it any way probable that the like will ever be again attempted for the fatal consequences as well as the illegality of that design are seen through already by the people so that instead of offering a justification of an act of exclusion i have exposed a rebellious impious and fruitless contrivance tending to it if we look on the parliament of paris when they were in their right wits before they were intoxicated by the league at least wholly we shall find them addressing to king henry iii in another key concerning the king of navarres succession though he was at that time as they called it a relapsed heretic and to this purpose i will quote a passage out of the journals of henry iii so much magnified by my adversaries  towards the end of september 1585 there was published at paris a bull of excommunication against the king of navarre and the prince of condé the parliament of paris made their remonstrance to the king upon it which was both grave and worthy of the place they held and of the authority they have in this kingdom saying for conclusion that their court had found the stile of this bull so full of innovation and so distant from the modesty of ancient popes that they could not understand in it the voice of an apostles successor forasmuch as they found not in their records nor in the search of all antiquity that the princes of france had ever been subject to the justice or jurisdiction of the pope and they could not take it into consideration until first he made appear the right which he pretended in the translation of kingdoms established and ordained by almighty god before the name of pope was heard of in the world it is plain by this that the parliament of paris acknowledged an inherent right of succession in the king of navarre though of a contrary religion to their own and though after the duke of guises murder at blois the city of paris revolted from their obedience to their king pretending that he was fallen from the crown by reason of that and other actions with which they charged him yet the sum of all their power to renounce him and create the duke of mayenne lieutenantgeneral depended ultimately on the popes authority which as you see but three years before they had peremptorily denied  the college of sorbonne began the dance by their determination that the kingly right was forfeited and stripping him of all his dignities they called him plain henry de valois after this says my author sixteen rascals by which he means the council of that number having administered the oath of government to the duke of mayenne to take in quality of lieutenantgeneral of the estate and crown of france the same ridiculous dignity was confirmed to him by an imaginary parliament the true parliament being detained prisoners in divers of the city gaols and two new seals were ordered to be immediately made with this inscriptionthe seal of the kingdom of france i need not enlarge on this relation it is evident from hence that the sorbonnists were the original and our schismatics in england were the copiers of rebellion that paris began and london followed  the next lines of my author are that a gentleman of paris made the duke of mayennes picture to be drawn with a crown imperial on his head and i have heard of an english nobleman who has at this day a picture of old oliver with this motto underneath itutinam vixeris all this while this cannot be reckoned an act of state for the deposing king henry iii because it was an act of overt rebellion in the parisians neither could the holding of the three estates at paris afterwards by the same duke of mayenne devolve any right on him in prejudice of king henry iv though those pretended states declared his title void on the account of his religion because those estates could neither be called nor holden but by and under the authority of the lawful king it would take more time than i have allowed for this vindication or i could easily trace from the french history what misfortunes attended france and how near it was to ruin by the endeavours to alter the succession for first it was actually dismembered the duke of mercæur setting up a principality in the dutchy of bretagne independent of the crown the duke of mayenne had an evident design to be elected king by the favour of the people and the pope the young dukes of guise and of nemours aspired with the interest of the spaniards to be chosen by their marriage with the infanta isabella the duke of lorraine was for cantling out some part of france which lay next his territories and the duke of savoy had before the death of henry iii actually possessed himself of the marquisate of saluces but above all the spaniards fomented these civil wars in hopes to reduce that flourishing kingdom under their own monarchy to as many and as great mischiefs should we be evidently subject if we should madly engage ourselves in the like practices of altering the succession which our gracious king in his royal wisdom well foresaw and has cut up that accursed project by the roots which will render the memory of his justice and prudence immortal and sacred to future ages for having not only preserved our present quiet but secured the peace of our posterity  it is clearly manifest that no act of state passed to the exclusion of either the king of navarre or of henry the fourth consider him in either of the two circumstances but oracle hunt taking this for granted would prove à fortiori that if a protestant prince were actually excluded from a popish kingdom then a popish successor is more reasonably to be excluded from a protestant kingdom because says he a protestant prince is under no obligation to destroy his popish subjects but a popish prince is to destroy his protestant subjects upon which bare supposition without farther proof he calls him insufferable tyrant and the worst of monsters  now i take the matter quite otherwise and bind myself to maintain that there is not nor can be any obligation for a king to destroy his subjects of a contrary persuasion to the established religion of his country for quatenus subjects of what religion soever he is infallibly bound to preserve and cherish and not to destroy them and this is the first duty of a lawful sovereign as such antecedent to any tie or consideration of his religion indeed in those countries where the inquisition is introduced it goes harder with protestants and the reason is manifest because the protestant religion has not gotten footing there and severity is the means to keep it out but to make this instance reach england our religion must not only be changed which in itself is almost impossible to imagine but the council of trent received and the inquisition admitted which many popish countries have rejected i forget not the cruelties which were exercised in queen marys time against the protestants neither do i any way excuse them but it follows not that every popish successor should take example by them for every ones conscience of the same religion is not guided by the same dictates in his government neither does it follow that if one be cruel another must especially when there is a stronger obligation and greater interest to the contrary for if a popish king in england should be bound to destroy his protestant people i would ask the question over whom he meant to reign afterwards and how many subjects would be left  in queen marys time the protestant religion had scarcely taken root and it is reasonable to be supposed that she found the number of papists equalling that of the protestants at her entrance to the kingdom especially if we reckon into the account those who were the trimmers of the times i mean such who privately were papists though under her protestant predecessor they appeared otherwise therefore her difficulties in persecuting her reformed subjects were far from being so insuperable as ours now are when the strength and number of the papists is so very inconsiderable they who cast in the church of england as ready to embrace popery are either knaves enough to know they lie or fools enough not to have considered the tenets of that church which are diametrically opposite to popery and more so than any of the sects  not to insist on the quiet and security which protestant subjects at this day enjoy in some parts of germany under popish princes where i have been assured that mass is said and a lutheran sermon preached in different parts of the same church on the same day without disturbance on either side nor on the privileges granted by henry the fourth of france to his party after he had forsaken their opinions which they quietly possessed for a long time after his death  the french histories are full of examples manifestly proving that the fiercest of their popish princes have not thought themselves bound to destroy their protestant subjects and the several edicts granted under them in favour of the reformed religion are pregnant instances of this truth i am not much given to quotations but davila lies open for every man to read tolerations and free exercise of religion granted more amply in some more restrainedly in others are no sign that those princes held themselves obliged in conscience to destroy men of a different persuasion it will be said those tolerations were gained by force of arms in the first place it is no great credit to the protestant religion that the protestants in france were actually rebels but the truth is they were only geneva protestants and their opinions were far distant from those of the church of england which teaches passive obedience to all her sons and not to propagate religion by rebellion but it is further to be considered that those french kings though papists thought the preservation of their subjects and the public peace were to be considered before the gratification of the court of rome and though the number of the papists exceeded that of the protestants in the proportion of three to one though the protestants were always beaten when they fought and though the pope pressed continually with exhortations and threatenings to extirpate calvinism yet kings thought it enough to continue in their own religion themselves without forcing it upon their subjects much less destroying them who professed another but it will be objected those edicts of toleration were not kept on the papists side they would answer because the protestants stretched their privileges further than was granted and that they often relapsed into rebellion but whether or no the protestants were in fault i leave history to determine it is matter of fact that they were barbarously massacred under the protection of the public faith therefore to argue fairly either an oath from protestants is not to be taken by a popish prince or if taken ought inviolably to be preserved for when we oblige ourselves to any one it is not his person we so much consider as that of the most high god who is called to witness this our action and it is to him we are to discharge our conscience neither is there or can be any tie on human society when that of an oath is no more regarded which being an appeal to god he is immediate judge of it and chronicles are not silent how often he has punished perjured kings the instance of vladislaus king of hungary breaking his faith with amurath the turk at the instigation of julian the popes legate and his miserable death ensuing it shews that even to infidels much more to christians that obligation ought to be accounted sacred33 and i the rather urge this because it is an argument taken almost verbatim from a papist who accuses catharine de medicis for violating her word given to the protestants during her regency of france what securities in particular we have that our own religion and liberties would be preserved though under a popish successor any one may inform himself at large in a book lately written by the reverend and learned doctor hicks called jovian in answer to julian the apostate34 in which that truly christian author has satisfied all scruples which reasonable men can make and proved that we are in no danger of losing either and wherein also if those assurances should all fail which is almost morally impossible the doctrine of passive obedience is unanswerably demonstrated a doctrine delivered with so much sincerity and resignation of spirit that it seems evident the assertor of it is ready if there were occasion to seal it with his blood  i have done with mannerly mr hunt who is only magni nominis umbra the most malicious and withal the most incoherent ignorant scribbler of the whole party i insult not over his misfortunes though he has himself occasioned them and though i will not take his own excuse that he is in passion i will make a better for him for i conclude him cracked and if he should return to england am charitable enough to wish his only prison might be bedlam this apology is truer than that he makes for me for writing a play as i conceive is not entering into the observators province neither is it the observators manner to confound truth with falsehood to put out the eyes of people and leave them without understanding the quarrel of the party to him is that he has undeceived the ignorant and laid open the shameful contrivances of the new vamped association that though he is on the wrong side of life as he calls it yet he pleads not his age to be emeritus that in short he has left the faction as bare of arguments as Æsops bird of feathers and plumed them of all those fallacies and evasions which they borrowed from jesuits and presbyterians  now for my templar and poet in association for a libel like the conjunction of saturn and jupiter in a fiery sign what the one wants in wit the other must supply in law as for malice their quotas are indifferently well adjusted the rough draught i take for granted is the poets the finishings the lawyers they beginthat in order to one mr friends commands one of them went to see the play this was not the poet i am certain for nobody saw him there and he is not of a size to be concealed but the mountain they say was delivered of a mouse i have been gossip to many such labours of a dull fat scribbler where the mountain has been bigger and the mouse less the next sally is on the cityelections and a charge is brought against my lord mayor and the two sheriffs for excluding true electors i have heard that a whig gentleman of the temple hired a liverygown to give his voice among the companies at guildhall let the question be put whether or no he were a true electorthen their own juries are commended from several topics they are the wisest richest and most conscientious to which is answered ignoramus but our juries give most prodigious and unheardof damages hitherto there is nothing but boysplay in our authors my mill grinds pepper and spice your mill grinds rats and mice they go onif i may be allowed to judge as men that do not poetize may be judges of wit human nature and common decencies so then the sentence is begun with i there is but one of them puts in for a judges place that is he in the grey but presently it ismen two more in buckram would be judges too neither of them it seems poetize that is true but both of them are in at rhime doggrel witness the song against the bishops and the tunbridge ballad35 by the way i find all my scribbling enemies have a mind to be judges and chief barons proceed gentlementhis play as i am informed by some who have a nearer communication with the poets and the players than i have which of the two sosias is it that now speaks if the lawyer it is true he has but little communication with the players if the poet the players have but little communication with him for it is not long ago he said to somebody by g my lord those tory rogues will act none of my plays well but the accusationthat this play was once written by another and then it was called the parisian massacre such a play i have heard indeed was written but i never saw it36 whether this be any of it or no i can say no more than for my own part of it but pray who denies the unparalleled villainy of the papists in that bloody massacre i have enquired why it was not acted and heard it was stopt by the interposition of an ambassador who was willing to save the credit of his country and not to have the memory of an action so barbarous revived but that i tempted my friend to alter it is a notorious whiggism to save the broader word the sicilian vespers i have had plotted by me above these seven years the story of it i found under borrowed names in giraldo cinthio but the rape in my tragedy of amboyna was so like it that i forbore the writing but what had this to do with protestants for the massacrers and the massacred were all papists  but it is observable they say that though the massacre could not be acted as it was first written against papists yet when it was turned upon protestants it found reception  now all is come out the scandal of the story turns at last upon the government that patronizes popish plays and forbids protestant37 ours is to be a popish play why because it exposes the villainy of sectaries and rebels prove them first to be protestants and see what you will get by it when you have done your party are certainly the men whom the play attacks and so far i will help you the designs and actions represented in the play are such as you have copied from the league for though you have wickedness enough yet you wanted the wit to make a new contrivance but for shame while you are carrying on such palpable villainy do not assume the name of protestants you will tell us you are friends to the government and the kings best subjects but all the while you are aspersing both it and him who shall be judges whether you are friends or not the government or you have not all rebels always sung the same song was ever thief or murderer fool enough to plead guilty for your love and loyalty to the king they who mean him best among you are no better subjects than duke trinculo they would be content he should be viceroy so they may be viceroys over him38  the next accusation is particular to methat i the said bayes would falsely and feloniously have robbed nat lee of his share in the representation of oedipus now i am culprit i writ the first and third acts of oedipus and drew the scenery of the whole play whenever i have owned a farther proportion let my accusers speak this was meant mischievously to set us two at variance who is the old serpent and satan now when my friends help my barren fancy i am thankful for it i do not use to receive assistance and afterwards ungratefully disown it  not long after exemplary punishment is due to me for this most devilish parallel it is a devilish one indeed but who can help it if i draw devils like one another the fault is in themselves for being so i neither made their horns nor claws nor cloven feet i know not what i should have done unless i had drawn the devil a handsome proper gentleman like the painter in the fable to have made a friend of him39 but i ought to be exemplarily punished for it when the devil gets uppermost i shall expect it in the mean time let magistrates that respect their oaths and officewhich words you see are put into a parenthesis as if god help us we had none such nowlet them put the law in execution against lewd scribblers the mark will be too fair upon a pillory for a turnip or a rotten egg to miss it but for my part i have not malice enough to wish him so much harmnot so much as to have a hair of his head perish much less that one whole side of it should be dismantled i am no informer who writ such a song or such a libel if the dulness betrays him not he is safe for me and may the same dulness preserve him ever from public justice it is a sufficient thick mudwall betwixt him and law it is his guardian angel that protects him from punishment because in spite of him he cannot deserve it it is that which preserves him innocent when he means most mischief and makes him a saint when he intends to be a devil he can never offend enough to need the mercy of government for it is beholden to him that he writes against it and he never offers at a satire but he converts his readers to a contrary opinion  some of the succeeding paragraphs are intended for very ciceronian there the lawyer flourishes in the pulpit and the poet stands in socks among the crowd to hear him now for narration resolution calumniation aggravation and the whole artillery of tropes and figures to defend the proceedings at guildhall the most minute circumstances of the elections are described so lively that a man who had not heard he was there in a liverygown might suspect there was a quorum pars magna fui in the case and multitudes of electors just as well qualified as himself might give their party the greater number but throw back their gilt shillings which were told for guineas and their true sum was considerably less well there was no rebellion at this time therefore says my adversary there was no parallel it is true there was no rebellion but who ever told him that i intended this parallel so far if the likeness had been throughout i may guess by their good will to me that i had never lived to write it but to show his mistake which i believe wilful the play was wholly written a month or two before the last election of the sheriffs yet it seems there was some kind of prophecy in the case and till the faction gets clear of a riot a part of the comparison will hold even there yet if he pleases to remember there has been a king of england forced by the inhabitants from his imperial town it is true the son has had better fortune than the father but the reason is that he has now a stronger party in the city than his enemies the government of it is secured in loyal and prudent hands and the party is too weak to push their designs farther they rescued not their beloved sheriffs at a time he tells you when they had a most important use of them what the importancy of the occasion was i will not search it is well if their own consciences will acquit them but let them be never so much beloved their adherents knew it was a lawful authority that sent them to the tower and an authority which to their sorrow they were not able to resist so that if four men guarded them without disturbance and to the contempt of their strength at broad noonday and at full exchangetime it was no more their honesty to stand looking on with their hands in their pockets than it is of a small band of robbers to let a caravan go by which is too strong for them to assault  after this i am called after the old rate loose and infamous scribbler and it is well i escape so cheap bear your good fortune moderately mr poet for as loose and infamous as i am if i had written for your party your pension would have been cut off as useless but they must take up with settle and such as they can get bartholomewfair writers40 and bartholemewclose printers there is a famine of wit amongst them they are forced to give unconscionable rates and after all to have only carrion for their money  then i am an ignorant fellow for not knowing there were no juries in paris i do not remember to have written any such thing but whoever did i am confident it was not his ignorance perhaps he had a mind to bring the case a little nearer home if they had not juries in paris we had them from the normans who were frenchmen and as you managed them we had as good have had none in london let it satisfy you we have them now and some of your loose and infamous scribblers may come to understand it a little better  the next is the justification of a noble peer deceased the case is known and i have no quarrel to his memory let it sleep he is now before another judge immediately after i am said to have intended an abuse to the house of commons which is called by our authors the most august assembly of europe they are to prove i have abused that house but it is manifest they have lessened the house of lords by owning the commons to be the more august assemblyit is an house chosen they say by every protestant who has a considerable inheritance in england which word considerable signifies forty shillings per annum of free land for the interest of the loyal party so much undervalued by our authors they have long ago confessed in print that the nobility and gentry have disowned them and the yeomanry have at last considered queis hæc consevimus arva they have had enough of unlawful and arbitrary power and know what an august assembly they had once without a king and house of peers  but now they have me in a burning scent and run after me full cry was ever such licence connived at in an impious libeller and scribbler that the succession so solemn a matter that is not fit to be debated of but in parliament should be profaned so far as to be played with on the stage  hold a little gentlemen hold a little as one of your fellow citizens says in the duke of guise is it so unlawful for me to argue for the succession in the right line upon the stage and is it so very lawful for mr hunt and the scribblers of your party to oppose it in their libels off the stage is it so sacred that a parliament only is suffered to debate it and dare you run it down both in your discourses and pamphlets out of parliament in conscience what can you urge against me which i cannot return an hundred times heavier on you and by the way you tell me that to affirm the contrary to this is a præmunire against the statute of the 13th of elizabeth if such præmunire be pray answer me who has most incurred it in the mean time do me the favour to look into the statutebook and see if you can find the statute you know yourselves or you have been told it that this statute is virtually repealed by that of the 1st of king james acknowledging his immediate lawful and undoubted right to this imperial crown as the next lineal heir those last words are an implicit antideclaration to the statute in queen elizabeth which for that reason is now omitted in our books the lawful authority of an house of commons i acknowledge but without fear and trembling as my reflectors would have it for why should i fear my representatives they are summoned to consult about the public good and not to frighten those who chose them it is for you to tremble who libel the supreme authority of the nation but we knavish coxcombs and villains are to know say my authors that a vote is the opinion of that house lord help our understandings that know not this without their telling what englishman do you think does not honour his representatives and wish a parliament void of heat and animosities to secure the quiet of the nation you cite his majestys declaration against those that dare trifle with parliaments a declaration by the way which you endeavoured not to have read publicly in churches with a threatening to those that did it but we still declare says his majesty that no irregularities of parliament shall make us out of love with them are not you unfortunate quoters why now should you rub up the remembrance of those irregularities mentioned in that declaration which caused as the king informs us its dissolution  the next paragraph is already answered it is only a clumsy commendation of the duke of monmouth copied after mr hunt and a proof that he is unlike the duke of guise  after having done my drudgery for me and having most officiously proved that the english duke is no parallel for the french which i am sure he is not they are next to do their own business which is that i meant a parallel betwixt henry iii and our most gracious sovereign but as fallacies are always couched in general propositions they plead the whole course of the drama which they say seems to insinuate my intentions one may see to what a miserable shift they are driven when for want of any one instance to which i challenge them they have only to allege that the play seems to insinuate it i answer it does not seem which is a bare negative to a bare affirmative and then we are just where we were before fat falstaff was never set harder by the prince for a reason when he answered that if reasons grew as thick as blackberries he would not give one well after long pumping lest the lie should appear quite barefaced they have found i said that at king henrys birth there shone a regal star so there did at king charles the seconds therefore i have made a parallel betwixt henry iii and charles ii a very concluding syllogism if i should answer it no farther  now let us look upon the play the words are in the fourth act the conjurer there is asking his devil what fortune attended his master the guise and what the king the familiar answers concerning the kinghe cannot be deposed he may be killed a violent fate attends him but at his birth there shone a regal starconj my master had a strongerdevil no not a stronger but more popular let the whole scene which is one of the best in the tragedy though murdered in the acting be read together and it will be as clear as day light that the devil gave an astrological account of the french kings horoscope that the regal star then culminating was the sun in the tenth house or midheaven which cæteris paribus is a regal nativity in that art the rest of the scene confirms what i have said for the devil has taken the position of the heavens or scheme of the world at the point of the suns entrance into aries i dispute not here the truth or lawfulness of that art but it is usual with poets especially the italians to mix astrology in their poems chaucer amongst us is frequent in it but this revolution particularly i have taken out of luigi pulci and there is one almost the same in boiardos orlando inamorato now if these poets knew that a star were to appear at our kings birth they were better prophets than nostradamus who has told us nothing of it yet this they say is treason with a witness and one of the crimes for which they condemned me to be hanged drawn and quartered i find they do not believe me to be one of their party at the bottom by their charitable wishes to me and am proud enough to think i have done them some little mischief because they are so desirous to be rid of me but if jack ketch must needs have the handling of us poets let him begin first where he may take the deepest say41 let me be hanged but in my turn for i am sure i am neither the fattest scribbler nor the worst ill be judged by their own party but for all our comforts the days of hanging are a little out of date and i hope there will be no more treason with a witness or witnesses for now there is no more to be got by swearing and the market is overstocked besides  but are you in earnest when you say i have made henry iii fearful weak bloody perfidious hypocritical and fawning in the play i am sure an unbiassed reader will find a more favourable image of him in the tragedy whatever he was out of it you would not have told a lie so shameless but that you were resolved to second it with a worsethat i made a parallel of that prince and now it comes to my turn pray let me ask youwhy you spend three pages and a half in heaping up all the villainies true or false which you can rake together to blast his memory why is all this pains taken to expose the person of king henry iii are you leaguers or covenanters or associators what has the poor dead man done to nettle you were his rebels your friends or your relations were your norman ancestors of any of those families which were conspirators in the play i smell a rat in this business henry iii is not taken thus to task for nothing let me tell you this is little better than an implicit confession of the parallel i intended this gentleman of valois sticks in your stomachs and though i do not defend his proceedings in the states any otherwise than by the inevitable necessity which caused them yet acknowledging his crime does not extenuate their guilt that forced him to it it was bad on both sides but the revenge was not so wicked as the treason for it was a voluntary act of theirs and a compelled one of his the short ont is he took a violent course to cut up the covenant by the roots and there is your quarrel to him  now for a longwinded panegyric of the king of navarre and here i am sure they are in earnest when they take such overpains to prove there is no likeness where they say i intended it the hero at whom their malice is levelled does but laugh at it i believe and amongst the other virtues of that predecessor wants neither his justice nor his clemency to forgive all the heads of the league as fast as they submit as for obliging them which our author would fain hook in for an ingredient let them be satisfied that no more enemies are to be bought off with places and preferments the trial which has been made in two kings reigns will warn the family from so fruitless and dangerous an expedient the rest is already answered in what i have said to mr hunt but i thank them by the way for their instance of the fellow whom the king of navarre had pardoned and done good to yet he would not love him for that story reaches home somewhere  i must make haste to get out of hearing from this billingsgate oratory and indeed to make an end with these authors except i could call rogue and rascal as fast as they let us examine the little reason they produce concerning the exclusion  did the pope the clergy the nobility and commonalty of france think it reasonable to exclude a prince for professing a different religion and will the papists be angry if the protestants be of the same opinion no sure they cannot have the impudence  first here is the difference of religion taken for granted which was never proved on one side though in the king of navarre it was openly professed then the pope and the three estates of france had no power to alter the succession neither did the king in being consent to it or afterwards did the greater part of the nobility clergy and gentry adhere to the exclusion but maintained the lawful king successfully against it as we are bound to do in england by the oaths of allegiance and supremacy made for the benefit of our kings and their successors the objections concerning which oath are fully answered by dr hicks in his preface to jovian and thither i refer the reader  they tell us that what it concerns protestants to do in that case enough has been heard by us in parliament debates  i answer that debates coming not by an act to any issue conclude that there is nothing to be done against a law established and fundamental of the monarchy they dare not infer a right of taking up arms by virtue of a debate or vote and yet they tacitly insinuate this i ask them what it does concern protestants to do in this case and whether they mean anything by that expression they have hampered themselves before they were aware for they proceed in the very next lines to tell us they believe the crown of england being hereditary the next in blood have an undoubted right to succeed unless god make them or they make themselves uncapable of reigning so that according to them if either of those two impediments shall happen then it concerns the protestants of england to do that something which if they had spoken out had been direct treason here is fine legerdemain amongst them they have acknowledged a vote to be no more than the opinion of an house and yet from a debate which was abortive before it quickened into a vote they argue after the old song that there is something more to be done which you cannot chuse but guess in the next place there is no such thing as incapacity to be supposed in the immediate successor of the crown that is the rightful heir cannot be made uncapable on any account whatsoever to succeed it may please god that he may be inhabilis or inidoneus ad gerendam rempublicamunfit or unable to govern the kingdom but this is no impediment to his right of reigning he cannot either be excluded or deposed for such imperfection for the laws which have provided for private men in this case have also made provision for the sovereign and for the public and the council of state or the next of blood is to administer the kingdom for him charles the sixth of france for i think we have no english examples which will reach it forfeited not his kingdom by his lunacy though a victorious king of england was then knocking at his gates but all things under his name and by his authority were managed the case is the same betwixt a king non compos mentis and one who is nondum compos mentis a distracted or an infantking then the people cannot incapacitate the king because he derives not his right from them but from god only neither can any action much less opinion of a sovereign render him uncapable for the same reason excepting only a voluntary resignation to his immediate heir as in the case of charles the fifth for that of our richard the second was invalid because forced and not made to the next successor  neither does it follow as our authors urge that an unalterable succession supposes england to be the kings estate and the people his goods and chattels on it for the preservation of his right destroys not our propriety but maintains us in it he has tied himself by law not to invade our possessions and we have obliged ourselves as subjects to him and all his lawful successors by which irrevocable act of ours both for ourselves and our posterity we can no more exclude the successor than we can depose the present king the estate of england is indeed the kings and i may safely grant their supposition as to the government of england but it follows not that the people are his goods and chattels on it for then he might sell alienate or destroy them as he pleased from all which he has tied himself by the liberties and privileges which he has granted us by laws  there is little else material in this pamphlet for to say i would insinuate into the king a hatred to his capital city is to say he should hate his best friends the last and the present lord mayor our two honourable sheriffs the court of aldermen the worthy and loyal mr common serjeant with the rest of the officers who are generally well affected and who have kept out their factious members from its government to say i would insinuate a scorn of authority in the city is in effect to grant the parallel in the play for the authority of tumults and seditions is only scorned in itan authority which they derived not from the crown but exercised against it and for them to confess i exposed this is to confess that london was like paris  they conclude with a prayer to almighty god in which i therefore believe the poet did not club to libel the king through all the pamphlet and to pray for him in the conclusion is an action of more prudence in them than of piety perhaps they might hope to be forgiven as one of their predecessors was by king james who after he had railed at him abundantly ended his lampoon with these two verses    now god preserve our king queen prince and peers   and grant the author long may wear his ears42  to take a short review of the wholeit is manifest that there is no such parallel in the play as the faction have pretended that the story would not bear one where they have placed it and that i could not reasonably intend one so contrary to the nature of the play and so repugnant to the principles of the loyal party on the other side it is clear that the principles and practices of the public enemies have both formerly resembled those of the league and continue to hold the same resemblance it appears by the outcry of the party before the play was acted that they dreaded and foresaw the bringing of the faction upon the stage and by the hasty printing of mr hunts libel and the reflections before the tragedy was published that they were infinitely concerned to prevent any farther operation of it it appears from the general consent of the audiences that their party were known to be represented and themselves owned openly by their hissings that they were incensed at it as an object which they could not bear it is evident by their endeavours to shift off this parallel from their side that their principles are too shameful to be maintained it is notorious that they and they only have made the parallel betwixt the duke of guise and the duke of monmouth and that in revenge for the manifest likeness they find in the parties themselves they have carried up the parallel to the heads of the parties where there is no resemblance at all under which colour while they pretend to advert upon one libel they set up another for what resemblance could they suggest betwixt two persons so unlike in their descent the qualities of their minds and the disparity of their warlike actions if they grant not that there is a faction here which is like that other which was in france so that if they do not first acknowledge one common cause there is no foundation for a parallel the dilemma therefore lies strong upon them and let them avoid it if they canthat either they must avow the wickedness of their designs or disown the likeness of those two persons i do further charge those audacious authors that they themselves have made the parallel which they call mine and that under the covert of this parallel they have odiously compared our present king with king henry the third and farther that they have forced this parallel expressly to wound his majesty in the comparison for since there is a parallel as they would have it it must be either theirs or mine i have proved that it cannot possibly be mine and in so doing that it must be theirs by consequence under this shadow all the vices of the french king are charged by those libellers by a sidewind upon ours and it is indeed the bottom of their design to make the king cheap his royal brother odious and to alter the course of the succession  now after the malice of this sputtering triumvirate mr hunt and the two reflectors against the person and dignity of the king and against all that endeavour to serve him which makes their hatred to his cause apparent the very charging of our play to be a libel and such a parallel as these ignoramuses would render it is almost as great an affront to his majesty as the libellous picture itself by which they have exposed him to his subjects for it is no longer our parallel but the kings by whose order it was acted without any shuffling or importunity from the poets the tragedy cried the faction is a libel against such and such illustrious persons upon this the play was stopt examined acquitted and ordered to be brought upon the stage not one stroke in it of a resemblance to answer the scope and intent of the complaint there were some features indeed that the illustrious mr hunt and his brace of beagles the reflectors might see resembling theirs and no other parallel either found or meant but betwixt the french leaguers and ours and so far the agreement held from point to point as true as a couple of tallies but when neither the king nor my lord chamberlain with other honourable persons of eminent faith integrity and understanding upon a strict perusal of the papers could find one syllable to countenance the calumny up starts the defender of the charter c opens his mouth and says what do ye talk of the king hes abused hes imposed upon is my lord chamberlain and the scrutineers that succeed him to tell us when the king and the duke of york are abused what says my lord chief baron of ireland to the business what says the liveryman templer what says og the king of basan to it we are men that stand up for the kings supremacy in all causes and over all persons as well ecclesiastical as civil next and immediately under god and the people we are for easing his royal highness of his title to the crown and the cares that attend any such prospect and we shall see the king and the royal family paralleled at this rate and not reflect upon it  but to draw to an end upon the laying of matters fairly together what a king have these balderdash scribblers given us under the resemblance of henry the third how scandalous a character again of his majesty in telling the world that he is libelled and affronted to his face told ont pointed to it and yet neither he nor those about him can be brought to see or understand it there needs no more to expound the meaning of these people than to compare them with themselves when it will evidently appear that their lives and conversations their writings and their practices do all take the same bias and when they dare not any longer revile his majesty or his government point blank they have an intention to play the libellers in masquerade and do the same thing in a way of mystery and parable this is truly the case of the pretended parallel they lay their heads together and compose the lewdest character of a prince that can be imagined and then exhibit that monster to the people as the picture of the king in the duke of guise so that the libel passes for current in the multitude whoever was the author of it and it will be but common justice to give the devil his due but the truth is their contrivances are now so manifest that their party moulders both in town and country for i will not suspect that there are any of them left in court deluded wellmeaners come over out of honesty and small offenders out of common discretion or fear none will shortly remain with them but men of desperate fortunes or enthusiasts those who dare not ask pardon because they have transgressed beyond it and those who gain by confusion as thieves do by fires to whom forgiveness were as vain as a reprieve to condemned beggars who must hang without it or starve with it   footnotes 1 as the whole passage from davila is subjoined to the text in the    play the reader may easily satisfy himself of the accuracy of what    is here stated but although the scene may have been written in    1661 we must be allowed to believe that its extreme resemblance    to the late events occasioned its being revived and represented in    1682  2 the poem alluded to was probably the religio laici first    published in november l682  3 dryden and shadwell had once been friends in the preface to the    humourists acted according to mr malone in 1676 shadwell thus    mentions his great contemporary     and here i must make a little digression and take liberty to    dissent from my particular friend for whom i have a very great    respect and whose writings i extremely admire and though i will    not say his is the best way of writing yet i am sure his manner    of writing is much the best that ever was and i may say of him as    was said of a celebrated poet cui unquam poetarum magis proprium    fuit subito astro incalescere quis ubi incaluit fortius et    fæclicius debacchatur his verse is smoother and deeper his    thoughts more quick and surprising his raptures more mettled and    higher and he has more of that in his writings which plato calls    sôphrona manian than any other heroic poet and those who shall    go about to imitate him will be found to flutter and make a noise    but never to rise     such a compliment from a rival dramatist could only have been    extracted by previous good offices and kindly countenance    accordingly we find that dryden in 16789 wrote a prologue to    shadwells play of the true widow  4 the female prelate or pope joan is a bombast silly performance    of elkanah settle the catastrophe of which consists in the    accouchement of the pope in the streets of rome the aid necessary    in the conclusion of an english tragedy usually loudly called    for but never brought is of a surgical nature but here lucina    was the deity to be implored and the midwifes assistance most    requisite     shadwells comedy of the lancashire witches was popular for many    years after the revolution chiefly because the papists were    reflected upon in the character of teague odivelly an irish    priest the highchurch clergy ridiculed under that of smerk and    the whole tory faction generally abused through the play it is by    no means one of shadwells happiest efforts the introduction of    the witches celebrating their satanical sabbath on the stage    besides that the scene is very poorly and lamely written is at    variance with the authors sentiments as delivered through sir    edward hartfort a worthy hospitable true english gentleman of    good understanding and honest principles who ridicules the belief    in witches at all a different and totally inconsistent doctrine is    thus to be collected from the action of the piece and the    sentiments expressed by those whose sentiments are alone marked as    worthy of being attended to this obvious fault with many others    is pointed out in a criticism on the lancashire witches    published in the spectator the paper is said to have been written    by hughes but considerably softened by addison  5 halfacrown was then the box price       you visit our plays and merit the stocks      for paying halfcrowns of brass to our box      nay often you swear when places

the farce alluded to seems to have been the lancashire witches    see shadwells account of the reception of that piece from which    it appears that the charge of forming a party in the theatre was a    subject of mutual reproach betwixt the dramatists of the contending    parties  6 this single remark is amply sufficient to exculpate dryden from    having intended any general parallel between monmouth and the duke    of guise to have produced such a parallel it would have been    necessary to unite in one individual the daring political courage    of shaftesbury his capacity of seizing the means to attain his    object and his unprincipled carelessness of their nature with the    fine person chivalrous gallantry military fame and courteous    manners of the duke of monmouth had these talents as they were    employed in the same cause been vested in the same person the    duke of guise must have yielded the palm the partial resemblance    in one point of their conduct is stated by our poet not to have    been introduced as an intended likeness betwixt the duke of    guise and the protestant duke we may observe in the words of    bertran       the dial spoke notbut it made shrewd signs                                    spanish friar  7 alluding to a book called the parallel published by j    northleigh llb the same who afterwards wrote the triumph of the    monarchy and was honoured by a copy of verses from our author  8 julian the apostate with a short account of his life and a    parallel betwixt popery and paganism was a treatise written by    the rev samuel johnson chaplain to lord russell for the purpose    of forwarding the bill of exclusion by shewing the consequences to    christianity of a pagan emperor attaining the throne it would    seem that one of the sheriffs had mistaken so grossly as to talk    of julian the apostle or more probably such a blunder was    circulated as true by some tory wit wood surmises that hunt had    some share in composing julian ath ox ii p 729  9 this probably alludes to lestrange who answered hunt in the    lawyer outlawed  10 curse ye meroz was a text much in vogue among the fanatic    preachers in the

following lively    account the gentlemen of that worthy society held their evening    session continually at the kingshead tavern over against the    inner temple gate but upon occasion of the signal of a green    ribbon agreed to be worn in their hats in the days of secret    engagements like the coats of arms of valiant knights of old    whereby all the warriors of the society might be distinguished and    not mistake friends for enemies they were called also the green    ribbon club their seat was in a sort of carrefour at    chancerylane end a centre of business and company most proper    for such anglers of fools the house was doublebalconied in front    as may be yet seen for the clubsters to issue forth in fresco    with hats and no peruques pipes in their mouths merry faces and    diluted throats for vocal encouragement of the canaglia below at    bonfires on usual and unusual occasions they admitted all    strangers that were confidingly introduced for it was a main end    of their institution to make proselytes especially of the raw    estated youths newly come to town this copious society were to    the faction in and about london a sort of executive power and by    correspondence all over england the resolves of the more retired    councils and ministry of the faction were brought in here and    orally insinuated to the company whether it were lies    defamations commendations projects c and so like water    diffused spread over all the town whereby that which was digested    at the club over night was like nourishment at every assembly    male and female the next day and thus the younglings tasted of    political administration and took themselves for notable    counsellors examen p 572 the place of meeting is altered by    dryden from the kingshead to the deviltavern either because    he thought the name more appropriate or wished slightly to    disguise what he plainly insinuated  18 our author never omits an opportunity of twitting hunt with his    expected preferment of lord chief baron of exchequer in ireland    lestrange whose ready pen was often drawn for the court answered    hunts defence of the charter by a pamphlet entitled the lawyer    outlawed in which he fails not to twit his antagonist with the    same disappointment  19 the foul practice of taking away lives by false witness casts an    indelible disgrace on this period oates dugdale and turberville    were the perjured evidences of the popish plot to meet them with    equal arms counterplots were sworn against shaftesbury and    others by haines macnamara and other irishmen but the true    protestant juries would only swallow the perjuries which made for    their own opinions nay although they believed dugdale when he    zealously forswore himself for the cause of the protestant faith    they refused him credit when he bore false witness for the crown    thus says hume the two parties actuated by mutual rage but    cooped up within the narrow limits of the law levelled with    poisoned daggers the most deadly blows against each others breast    and buried in their factious divisions all regard to truth honour    and humanity  20 in the dramatis personæ to shadwells play of epsomwells we have    rains bevil woodly described as men of wit and pleasure  21 dryden had already distinguished shadwell and settle by those    names which were destined to consign the poor wights to a painful    immortality in the second part of absalom and achitophel    published in 1682  22 see note on p 222 vol vi describing this famous procession  23 this passage in hunts defence of the charter obviously alludes    to the duke of york whom he elsewhere treats with little ceremony    and to the king whose affection for his brother was not without a    mixture of fear inspired by his more stubborn and resolved temper  24 william viscount stafford the last who suffered for the popish    plot was tried and executed in 1680 it appears that his life was    foully sworn away by dugdale and turberville the manly and patient    deportment of the noble sufferer went far to remove the woful    delusion which then pervaded the people it would seem that hunt    had acted as his solicitor  25 a quip at his corpulent adversary shadwell  26 the infamous titus oates pretended amongst other more abominable    falsehoods to have taken a doctors degree at salamanca in 1679    there was an attempt to bring him to trial for unnatural practices    but the grand jury threw out the bill these were frequent subjects    of reproach among the tory

destroying the learned gentleman obviously meant that drydens    heroes whom he accounted tyrants resembled not the demigods but    the monsters whom they destroyed but the comma is so unhappily    placed after are as to leave the sense capable of the malicious    interpretation which dryden has put upon it  32 shadwell as he resembled ben jonson in extreme corpulence and    proposed him for the model of dramatic writing seems to have    affected the coarse and inelegant debauchery of his prototype he    lived chiefly in taverns was a gross sensualist in his habits and    brutal in his conversation his fine gentlemen all partake of their    parents grossness and vulgarity they usually open their dialogue    by complaining of the effects of last nights debauch he is    probably the only author who ever chose for his heroes a set of    riotous bloods or scowerers as they were then termed and    expected the public should sympathise in their brutal orgies true    it is that the heroes are whig scowerers and whilst breaking    windows stabbing watchmen and beating passengers do not fail to    express a due zeal for the protestant religion and the liberty of    the subject much of the interest also turns it must be allowed    upon the protestant scowerers aforesaid baffling and beating    without the least provocation a set of inferior scowerers who    were jacobites at least if not papists shadwell is thus described    in the sessions of the poets       next into the crowd tom shadwell does wallow      and swears by his guts his paunch and his tallow      tis he

 sworn upon the gospel invaded bulgaria at the instigation of the    cardinal legate he was slain and his army totally routed in the    bloody battle of warna where ten thousand christians fell before    the janissaries of amurath ii it is said that while the battle    remained undecided the sultan displayed the solemn treaty and    invoked the god of truth and the blessed name of jesus to revenge    the impious infidelity of the hungarian this battle would have    laid hungary under the turkish yoke had it not been for the    exploits of john corvinus huniades the white knight of walachia

have been extravagantly popular it would appear it    was suppressed at the request of the french ambassador several    speeches and even a whole scene seem to have been transplanted to    the duke of guise which were afterwards replaced when the    revolution rendered the massacre of paris again a popular topic    there were among others the description of the meeting of alva    and the queen mother at bayonne the sentiments expressed    concerning the assassination of cæsar and especially the whole    quarrelling scene between guise and grillon which in the    massacre of paris passes between guise and the admiral    chastillon in the preface to the princess of cleves which was    acted in 1689 lee gives the following account of the transposition    of these passages the duke of guise who was notorious for a    bolder fault has wrested two whole scenes from the original the    massacre just before mentioned which after the vacation he will    be forced to pay i was i confess through indignation forced to    limb my own child which time the true cure for all maladies and    injustice has set together again the play cost me much pains the    story is true and i hope the

the events which followed the restoration are rapidly but obviously and distinctly traced down to the death of charles and the quiet accession of his brother who after all the storms which had threatened to blast his prospects found himself enabled to mount the throne with ease sufficient to encourage him to the measures which precipitated him from that elevation the leading incidents of the busy and intriguing reign of charles ii are successively introduced in the following order the city of london is discovered occupied by the republicans and fanatics depicted under the allegorical

albanius the second act opens with a council of the fiends where the popish plot is hatched and democracy and zeal are dismissed to propagate it upon earth with oates the famous witness in their train the next entry presents augusta or london stung by a snake to intimate the revival of the popular faction in the metropolis democracy and zeal under the disguise of patriotism and religion insinuate themselves into the confidence of the city and are supposed to foment the parliamentary opposition which ending on the bill of exclusion rendered it necessary that the duke of york should leave the kingdom we have then in allegorical representation the internal feuds of the parties which from different causes opposed the crown the adherents of monmouth and the favourers of republican tenets are represented as disputing with each other until the latter by the flight of shaftesbury obtains a final ascendancy in the mean while charles or albion has recourse to the advice of proteus under which emblem an evil minded whig might suppose halifax and the party of trimmers to be represented actuated by whose versatile and timeserving politics charles gave way to each wave but remained buoyant amid the tempest the ryehouse plot is then presented in allegoryan unfit subject for exultation since the dark intrigues of the interior conspirators were made the instruments of the fall of sidney and russell the return of the duke of york with his beautiful princess and the rejoicings which were supposed to take place in heaven and earth upon charles attaining the pinnacle of uncontrolled power was originally the intended termination of the opera which as first written consisted of only one act introductory to the drama of king arthur but the eye and the ear of charles were never to be regaled by this flattering representation he died while the opera was in rehearsal a slight addition as the author has himself informed us adapted the conclusion of his piece to this new and unexpected event the apotheosis of albion and the succession of albanius to the uncontrouled domination of a willing people debased by circumstances expressing an unworthy triumph over deceased foes was substituted as the closing scene altered as it was to suit the fullblown fortune of james an ominous fatality attended these sugared scenes which were to present the exulting recapitulation of his difficulties and triumph while the opera was performing for the sixth time only news arrived that monmouth had landed in the west the audience dispersed and the players never attempted to revive a play which seemed to be of evil augury to the crown  our author appears to have found it difficult to assign a name for this performance which was at once to address itself to the eye the ear and the understanding the balladopera since invented in which part is sung part acted and spoken comes nearest to its description the plot of the piece contains nothing brilliantly ingenious the deities of greece and rome had been long hacknied machines in the masks and operas of the sixteenth century and it required little invention to paint the duchess of york as venus or to represent her husband protected by neptune and charles consulting with proteus but though the device be trite the lyrical diction of the opera is most beautifully sweet and flowing the reader finds none of these harsh inversions and awkward constructions by which ordinary poets are obliged to screw their verses into the fetters of musical time notwithstanding the obstacles stated by dryden himself every line seems to flow in its natural and most simple order and where the music required repetition of a line or a word the iteration seems to improve the sense and poetical effect neither is the piece deficient in the higher requisites of lyric poetry when music is to be married to immortal verse the poet too commonly cares little with how indifferent a yokemate he provides her but dryden probably less from a superior degree of care than from that divine impulse which he could not resist has hurried along in the full stream of real poetry the description of the desolation of london at the opening of the piece the speech of augusta in act second and many other passages fully justify this encomium  the music of the piece was entrusted to louis grabut or grabu the master of the kings band whom charles french in his politics his manners and his taste preferred to the celebrated purcell purcell however says an admirable judge having infinitely more fancy and indeed harmonical resources than the frenchified tuscan his predecessor now offered far greater pleasure and amusement to a liberal lover of music than can be found not only in the productions of cambert and grabu whom charles ii and to flatter his majesty dryden patronised in preference to purcell but in all the noisy monotony of the rhapsodist of quinaultburneys history of music vol iii p 500  it seems to be generally admitted that the music of albion and albanius was very indifferent from the preface as well as the stage directions it appears that a vast expence was incurred in shew dress and machinery downes informs us that owing to the interruption of the run of the piece in the manner already mentioned the half of the expence was never recovered and the theatre was involved considerably in debtrosc anglic p 40 the whigs against whom the satire was levelled the rival dramatists of the day and the favourers of the english school of music united in triumphing in its downfall1  mr luttrells manuscript note has fixed the first representation of albion and albanius to the 3d of june 1685 and the laudable accuracy of mr malone has traced its sixth night to saturday the 13th of the same month when an express brought the news of monmouths landing the opera was shortly after published in 1687 grabut published the music with a dedication to james ii2   footnotes 1 the following verses are rather better

thoughts and words1 then that definition will extend to all sorts of poetry and among the rest to this present entertainment of an opera propriety of thought is that fancy which arises naturally from the subject or which the poet adapts to it propriety of words is the clothing of those thoughts with such expressions as are naturally proper to them and from both these if they are judiciously performed the delight of poetry results an opera is a poetical tale or fiction represented by vocal and instrumental music adorned with scenes machines and dancing the supposed persons of this musical drama are generally supernatural as gods and goddesses and heroes which at least are descended from them and are in due time to be adopted into their number the subject therefore being extended beyond the limits of human nature admits of that sort of marvellous and surprising conduct which is rejected in other plays human impossibilities are to be received as they are in faith because where gods are introduced a supreme power is to be understood and second causes are out of doors yet propriety is to be observed even here the gods are all to manage their peculiar provinces and what was attributed by the heathens to one power ought not to be performed by any other phoebus must foretel mercury must charm with his caduceus and juno must reconcile the quarrels of the marriagebed to conclude they must all act according to their distinct and peculiar characters if the persons represented were to speak upon the stage it would follow of necessity that the expressions should be lofty figurative and majestical but the nature of an opera denies the frequent use of these poetical ornaments for vocal music though it often admits a loftiness of sound yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness or to distinguish yet more justly the recitative part of the opera requires a more masculine beauty of expression and sound the other which for want of a proper english word i must call the songish part must abound in the softness and variety of numbers its principal intention being to please the hearing rather than to gratify the understanding it appears indeed preposterous at first sight that rhyme on any consideration should take place of reason but in order to resolve the problem this fundamental proposition must be settled that the first inventors of any art or science provided they have brought it to perfection are in reason to give laws to it and according to their model all afterundertakers are to build thus in epic poetry no man ought to dispute the authority of homer who gave the first being to that masterpiece of art and endued it with that form of perfection in all its parts that nothing was wanting to its excellency virgil therefore and those very few who have succeeded him endeavoured not to introduce or innovate any thing in a design already perfected but imitated the plan of the inventor and are only so far true heroic poets as they have built on the foundations of homer thus pindar the author of those odes which are so admirably restored by mr cowley in our language ought for ever to be the standard of them and we are bound according to the practice of horace and mr cowley to copy him now to apply this axiom to our present purpose whosoever undertakes the writing of an opera which is a modern invention though built indeed on the foundation of ethnic worship is obliged to imitate the design of the italians who have not only invented but brought to perfection this sort of dramatic musical entertainment i have not been able by any search to get any light either of the time when it began or of the first author but i have probable reasons which induce me to believe that some italians having curiously observed the gallantries of the spanish moors at their zambras or royal feasts where music songs and dancing were in perfection together with their machines which are usual at their sortija or running at the ring and other solemnities may possibly have refined upon those moresque divertisements and produced this delightful entertainment by leaving out the warlike part of the carousals and forming a poetical design for the use of the machines the songs and dances but however it began for this is only conjectural we know that for some centuries the knowledge of music has flourished principally in italy the mother of learning and of arts2 that poetry and painting have been there restored and so cultivated by italian masters that all europe has been enriched out of their treasury and the other parts of it in relation to those delightful arts are still as much provincial to italy as they were in the time of the roman empire their first operas seem to have been intended for the celebration of the marriages of their princes or for the magnificence of some general time of joy accordingly the expences of them were from the purse of the sovereign or of the republic as they are still practised at venice rome and at other places at their carnivals savoy and florence have often used them in their courts at the weddings of their dukes and at turin particularly was performed the pastor fido written by the famous guarini which is a pastoral opera made to solemnise the marriage of a duke of savoy the prologue of it has given the design to all the french which is a compliment to the sovereign power by some god or goddess so that it looks no less than a kind of embassy from heaven to earth i said in the beginning of this preface that the persons represented in operas are generally gods goddesses and heroes descended from them who are supposed to be their peculiar care which hinders not but that meaner persons may sometimes gracefully be introduced especially if they have relation to those first times which poets call the golden age wherein by reason of their innocence those happy mortals were supposed to have had a more familiar intercourse with superior beings and therefore shepherds might reasonably be admitted as of all callings the most innocent the most happy and who by reason of the spare time they had in their almost idle employment had most leisure to make verses and to be in love without somewhat of which passion no opera can possibly subsist  it is almost needless to speak any thing of that noble language in which this musical drama was first invented and performed all who are conversant in the italian cannot but observe that it is the softest the sweetest the most harmonious not only of any modern tongue but even beyond any of the learned it seems indeed to have been invented for the sake of poetry and music the vowels are so abounding in all words especially in terminations of them that excepting some few monosyllables the whole language ends in them then the pronunciation is so manly and so sonorous that their very speaking has more of music in it than dutch poetry and song it has withal derived so much copiousness and eloquence from the greek and latin in the composition of words and the formation of them that if after all we must call it barbarous it is the most beautiful and most learned of any barbarism in modern tongues and we may at least as justly praise it as pyrrhus did the roman discipline and martial order that it was of barbarians for so the greeks called all other nations but had nothing in it of barbarity this language has in a manner been refined and purified from the gothic ever since the time of dante which is above four hundred years ago and the french who now cast a longing eye to their country are not less ambitious to possess their elegance in poetry and music in both which they labour at impossibilities it is true indeed they have reformed their tongue and brought both their prose and poetry to a standard the sweetness as well as the purity is much improved by throwing off the unnecessary consonants which made their spelling tedious and their pronunciation harsh but after all as nothing can be improved beyond its own species or farther than its original nature will allow as an ill voice though ever so thoroughly instructed in the rules of music can never be brought to sing harmoniously nor many an honest critic ever arrive to be a good poet so neither can the natural harshness of the french or their perpetual ill accent be ever refined into perfect harmony like the italian the english has yet more natural disadvantages than the french our original teutonic consisting most in monosyllables and those incumbered with consonants cannot possibly be freed from those inconveniencies the rest of our words which are derived from the latin chiefly and the french with some small sprinklings of greek italian and spanish are some relief in poetry and help us to soften our uncouth numbers which together with our english genius incomparably beyond the trifling of the french in all the nobler parts of verse will justly give us the preeminence but on the other hand the effeminacy of our pronunciation a defect common to us and to the danes and our scarcity of female rhymes have left the advantage of musical composition for songs though not for recitative to our neighbours  through these difficulties i have made a shift to struggle in my part of the performance of this opera which as mean as it is deserves at least a pardon because it has attempted a discovery beyond any former undertaker of our nation only remember that if there be no northeast passage to be found the fault is in nature and not in me or as ben jonson tells us in the alchymist when projection had failed and the glasses were all broken there was enough however in the bottoms of them to cure the itch so i may thus be positive that if i have not succeeded as i desire yet there is somewhat still remaining to satisfy the curiosity or itch of sight and hearing yet i have no great reason to despair for i may without vanity own some advantages which are not common to every writer such as are the knowledge of the italian and french language and the being conversant with some of their best performances in this kind which have furnished me with such variety of measures as have given the composer monsieur grabut what occasions he could wish to shew his extraordinary talent in diversifying the recitative the lyrical part and the chorus in all which not to attribute any thing to my own opinion the best judges and those too of the best quality who have honoured his rehearsals with their presence have no less commended the happiness of his genius than his skill and let me have the liberty to add one thing that he has so exactly expressed my sense in all places where i intended to move the passions that he seems to have entered into my thoughts and to have been the poet as well as the composer this i say not to flatter him but to do him right because amongst some english musicians and their scholars who are sure to judge after them the imputation of being a frenchman is enough to make a party who maliciously endeavour to decry him but the knowledge of latin and italian poets both which he possesses besides his skill in music and his being acquainted with all the performances of the french operas adding to these the good sense to which he is born have raised him to a degree above any man who shall pretend to be his rival on our stage when any of our countrymen excel him i shall be glad for the sake of old england to be shewn my error in the mean time let virtue be commended though in the person of a stranger3  if i thought it convenient i could here discover some rules which i have given to myself in writing of an opera in general and of this opera in particular but i consider that the effect would only be to have my own performance measured by the laws i gave and consequently to set up some little judges who not understanding thoroughly would be sure to fall upon the faults and not to acknowledge any of the beauties an hard measure which i have often found from false critics here therefore if they will criticise they shall do it out of their own fond but let them first be assured that their ears are nice for there is neither writing nor judgment on this subject without that good quality it is no easy matter in our language to make words so smooth and numbers so harmonious that they shall almost set themselves and yet there are rules for this in nature and as great a certainty of quantity in our syllables as either in the greek or latin but let poets and judges understand those first and then let them begin to study english when they have chewed a while upon these preliminaries it may be they will scarce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work for they will soon be satisfied that those are not of the nature of this sort of writing the necessity of double rhimes and ordering of the words and numbers for the sweetness of the voice are the main hinges on which an opera must move and both of these are without the compass of any art to teach another to perform unless nature in the first place has done her part by enduing the poet with that nicety of hearing that the discord of sounds in words shall as much offend him as a seventh in music would a good composer i have therefore no need to make excuses for meanness of thought in many places the italians with all the advantages of their language are continually forced upon it or rather affect it the chief secret is the choice of words and by this choice i do not here mean elegancy of expression but propriety of sound to be varied according to the nature of the subject perhaps a time may come when i may treat of this more largely out of some observations which i have made from homer and virgil who amongst all the poets only understood the art of numbers and of that which was properly called rhythmus by the ancients  the same reasons which depress thought in an opera have a stronger effect upon the words especially in our language for there is no maintaining the purity of english in short measures where the rhime returns so quick and is so often female or double rhime which is not natural to our tongue because it consists too much of monosyllables and those too most commonly clogged with consonants for which reason i am often forced to coin new words revive some that are antiquated and botch others as if i had not served out my time in poetry but was bound apprentice to some doggrel rhimer who makes songs to tunes and sings them for a livelihood it is true i have not been often put to this drudgery but where i have the words will sufficiently shew that i was then a slave to the composition which i will never be again it is my part to invent and the musicians to humour that invention i may be counselled and will always follow my friends advice where i find it reasonable but will never part with the power of the militia4  i am now to acquaint my reader with somewhat more particular concerning this opera after having begged his pardon for so long a preface to so short a work it was originally intended only for a prologue to a play of the nature of the tempest which is a tragedy mixed with opera or a drama written in blank verse adorned with scenes machines songs and dances so that the fable of it is all spoken and acted by the best of the comedians the other part of the entertainment to be performed by the same singers and dancers who were introduced in this present opera it cannot properly be called a play because the action of it is supposed to be conducted sometimes by supernatural means or magic nor an opera because the story of it is not sungbut more of this at its proper timebut some intervening accidents having hitherto deferred the performance of the main design i proposed to the actors to turn the intended prologue into an entertainment by itself as you now see it by adding two acts more to what i had already written the subject of it is wholly allegorical and the allegory itself so very obvious that it will no sooner be read than understood it is divided according to the plain and natural method of every action into three parts for even aristotle himself is contented to say simply that in all actions there is a beginning a middle and an end after which model all the spanish plays are built  the descriptions of the scenes and other decorations of the stage i had from mr betterton who has spared neither for industry nor cost to make this entertainment perfect nor for invention of the ornaments to beautify it  to conclude though the enemies of the composer are not few and that there is a party formed against him of his own profession i hope and am persuaded that this prejudice will turn in the end to his advantage for the greatest part of an audience is always uninterested though seldom knowing and if the music be well composed and well performed they who find themselves pleased will be so wise as not to be imposed upon and fooled out of their satisfaction the newness of the undertaking is all the hazard when operas were first set up in france they were not followed over eagerly but they gained daily upon their hearers till they grew to that height of reputation which they now enjoy the english i confess are not altogether so musical as the french and yet they have been pleased already with the tempest and some pieces that followed which were neither much better written nor so well composed as this if it finds encouragement i dare promise myself to mend my hand by making a more pleasing fable in the mean time every loyal englishman cannot but be satisfied with the moral of this which so plainly represents the double restoration of his sacred majesty                                postscript  this preface being wholly written before the death of my late royal master quem semper acerbum semper honoratum sic dii voluistis habebo i have now lately reviewed it as supposing i should find many notions in it that would require correction on cooler thoughts after four months lying by me i looked on it as no longer mine because i had wholly forgotten it but i confess with some satisfaction and perhaps a little vanity that i found myself entertained by it my own judgment was new to me and pleased me when i looked on it as another mans i see no opinion that i would retract or alter unless it be that possibly the italians went not so far as spain for the invention of their operas they might have it in their own country and that by gathering up the shipwrecks of the athenian and roman theatres which we know were adorned with scenes music dances and machines especially the grecian but of this the learned monsieur vossius who has made our nation his second country is the best and perhaps the only judge now living as for the opera itself it was all composed and was just ready to have been performed when he in honour of whom it was principally made was taken from us  he had been pleased twice or thrice to command that it should be practised before him especially the first and third acts of it and publicly declared more than once that the composition and choruses were more just and more beautiful than any he had heard in england how nice an ear he had in music is sufficiently known his praise therefore has established the reputation of it above censure and made it in a manner sacred it is therefore humbly and religiously dedicated to his memory  it might reasonably have been expected that his death must have changed the whole fabric of the opera or at least a great part of it but the design of it originally was so happy that it needed no alteration properly so called for the addition of twenty or thirty lines in the apotheosis of albion has made it entirely of a piece this was the only way which could have been invented to save it from botched ending and it fell luckily into my imagination as if there were a kind of fatality even in the most trivial things concerning the succession a change was made and not for the worse without the least confusion or disturbance and those very causes which seemed to threaten us with troubles conspired to produce our lasting happiness   footnotes 1 this definition occurs in the preface to the state of innocence    but although given by dryden and sanctioned by pope it has a very    limited resemblance to that

easy to believe that whatever was the nature of the    schemes nourished by monmouth russel and essex they could have    no concern with the low and sanguinary cabal of ramsay walcot and    rumbold who were all of them old republican officers and    commonwealths men the flight of shaftesbury whose bustling and    politic brain had rendered him the sole channel of communication    betwixt these parties as well as the means of uniting them in one    common design threw loose all connection between them so that    each after his retreat seems to have acted independantly of and    often in contradiction to the other  7 the reader may judge whether some distant and obscure allusion to    the trimming politics of halifax to whom the duke of york our    authors patron was hostile may not be here insinuated during    the stormy session of his two last parliaments charles was much    guided by his temporising and camelionlike policy  8 that is by fire see next note  9 the allegory of the oneeyed archer and the fire arising betwixt    him and albion will be made evident by the following extracts from    sprats history of the conspiracy in enumerating the persons    engaged in the ryehouse plot he mentions richard rumbold    maltster an old army officer a desperate and bloody ravaillac    after agitating several schemes for assassinating charles the    ryehouse was fixed upon as a spot which the king must necessarily    pass in his journey trom newmarket and which being a solitary    moated house in the actual occupation of rumbold afforded the    conspirators facility of previous concealment and subsequent    defence all other propositions as subject to far more casualties    and hazards soon gave place to that of the rye in herefordshire    a house then inhabited by the foresaid richard rumbold who    proposed that to be the seat of the action offering himself to    command the party that was to do the work him therefore as the    most daring captain and by reason of a blemish in one of his eyes    they were afterwards wont in common discourse to call hannibal    often drinking healths to hannibal and his boys meaning rumbold    and his hellish crew     immediately upon the coaches coming within the gates and hedges    about the house the conspirators were to divide into several    parties some before in the habit of labourers were to overthrow    a cart in the narrowest passage so as to prevent all possibility    of escape others were to fight the guards walcot chusing that    part upon a punctilio of honour others were to shoot at the    coachman postillion and horses others to aim only at his    majestys coach which party was to be under the particular    direction of rumbold himself the villain declaring beforehand    that upon that occasion he would make use of a very good    blunderbuss which was in wests possession and blasphemously    adding that ferguson should first consecrate it  but whilst    they were thus wholly intent on this barbarous work and proceeded    securely in its contrivance without any the least doubt of a    prosperous success behold on a sudden god miraculously    disappointed all their hopes and designs by the terrible    conflagration unexpectedly breaking out at newmarket in which    extraordinary event there was one remarkable passage that is not    so generally taken notice of as for the glory of god and the    confusion of his majestys enemies it ought to be     for after that the approaching fury of the flames had driven the    king out of his own palace his majesty at first removed into    another quarter of the town remote from the fire and as yet    free from any annoyance of smoke and ashes there his majesty    finding he might be tolerably well accommodated had resolved to    stay and continue his recreations as before till the day first    named for his journey back to london but his majesty had no sooner    made that resolution when the wind as conducted by an invisible    power from above presently changed about and blew the smoke and    cinders directly on his new lodging making them in a moment as    untenable as the other upon this his majesty being put to a new    shift and not finding the like conveniency elsewhere immediately    declared he would speedily return to whitehall as he did which    happening to be several days before the assassins expected him or    their preparations for the rye were in readiness it may justly    give occasion to all the world to acknowledge what one of the very    conspirators could not but do that it was a providential    firepages 51 et seq     the proprietor of the ryehouse for rumbold was but a tenant    shocked at the intended purpose for which it was to have been    used is said to have fired it with his own hand this is the    subject of a poem called the loyal incendiary or the generous    boutefeu  10 the total ruin of those who were directly involved in the    ryehouse was little to be regretted had it not involved the fate    of those who were pursuing reform by means more manly and    constitutionalthe fate of russel essex and sidney     rumbold the oneeyed archer fled to holland and came to    scotland with argyle on his illconcerted expedition he was    singled out and pursued after the dispersion of his companions in    a skirmish he defended himself with desperate resolution against    two armed peasants till a third coming behind him with a    pitchfork turned off his headpiece when he was cut down and    made prisoner exclaiming cruel countryman to use me thus while    my face was to mine enemy he suffered the doom of a traitor at    edinburgh and maintained on the scaffold with inflexible    firmness the principles in which he had lived he could never    believe he said that the many of human kind came into the world    bridled and saddled and the few with whips and spurs to ride them    his rooted ingrained opinion says fountainhall was for a    republic against monarchy to pull down which he thought a duty    and no sin at his death he declared that were every hair of his    head a man he would venture them all in the good old cause  11 i must not says langbaine take

confirmed by many proofs    elsewhere that the attribute for which james desired to be    distinguished and praised was that of openness of purpose and    stern undeviating inflexibility of conduct he scorned to disguise    his designs either upon the religion or the constitution of his    country he forgot that it was only the temporising concessions of    his brother which secured his way to the

a                                 tragedy                   nec tarda senectus               debilitat vires animi mutatque vigorem                                    virg                                 don sebastian   the following tragedy is founded upon the adventures supposed to have befallen sebastian king of portugal after the fatal battle of alcazar the reader may be briefly reminded of the memorable expedition of that gallant monarch to africa to signalize against the moors his chivalry as a warrior and his faith as a christian the ostensible pretext of invasion was the cause of muly mahomet son of abdalla emperor of morocco upon whose death his brother muly moluch had seized the crown and driven his nephew into exile the armies joined battle near alcazar the portuguese far inferior in number to the moors displayed the most desperate valour and had nearly won the day when muly moluch who though almost dying was present on the field in a litter fired with shame and indignation threw himself on horseback rallied his troops renewed the combat and being carried back to his litter immediately expired with his finger placed on his lips to impress on the chiefs who surrounded him the necessity of concealing his death the moors rallied by their sovereigns dying exertion surrounded and totally routed the army of sebastian mahomet the competitor for the throne of morocco was drowned in passing a river in his flight and sebastian as his body was never found probably perished in the same manner but where the region of historical certainty ends that of romantic tradition commences the portuguese to whom the memory of their warlike sovereign was deservedly dear grasped at the feeble hope which the uncertainty of his fate afforded and long with vain fondness expected the return of sebastian to free them from the yoke of spain this mysterious termination of a heros career as it gave rise to various political intrigues for several persons assumed the name and character of sebastian early afforded a subject for exercising the fancy of the dramatist and romance writer the battle of alcazar1 is known to the collectors of old plays a ballad on the same subject is reprinted in evanss collection and our author mentions a french novel on the adventures of don sebastian to which langbaine also refers  the situation of dryden after the revolution was so delicate as to require great caution and attention both in his choice of a subject and his mode of treating it his distressed circumstances and lessened income compelled him to come before the public as an author while the odium attached to the proselyte of a hated religion and the partizan of a depressed faction was likely upon the slightest pretext to transfer itself from the person of the poet to the labours on which his support depended he was therefore not only obliged to chuse a theme which had no offence in it and to treat it in a manner which could not admit of misconstruction but also so to exert the full force of his talents as by the conspicuous preeminence of his genius to bribe prejudice and silence calumny an observing reader will accordingly discover throughout the following tragedy symptoms of minute finishing and marks of accurate attention which in our authors better days he deigned not to bestow upon productions to which his name alone was then sufficient to give weight and privilege his choice of a subject was singularly happy the name of sebastian awaked historical recollections and associations favourable to the character of his hero while the dark uncertainty of his fate removed all possibility of shocking the audience by glaring offence against the majesty of historical truth the subject has therefore all the advantages of a historical play without the detects which either a rigid coincidence with history or a violent contradiction of known truth seldom fail to bring along with them dryden appears from his preface to have been fully sensible of this and he has not lost the advantage of a happy subject by treating it with the carelessness he sometimes allowed himself to indulge  the characters in don sebastian are contrasted with singular ability and judgment sebastian highspirited and fiery the soul of royal and military honour the soldier and the king almost embodies the idea which the reader forms at the first mention of his name dorax to whom he is so admirable a contrast is one of those characters whom the strong hand of adversity has wrested from their natural bias and perhaps no equally vivid picture can be found of a subject so awfully interesting born with a strong tendency to all that was honourable and virtuous the very excess of his virtues became vice when his own ill fate and sebastians injustice had driven him into exile by comparing as dryden has requested the character of dorax in the fifth act with that he maintains in the former part of the play the difference may be traced betwixt his natural virtues and the vices engrafted on them by headlong passion and embittering calamity there is no inconsistence in the change which takes place after his scene with sebastian as was objected by those whom the poet justly terms the more ignorant sort of creatures it is the same picture in a new light the same ocean in tempest and in calm the same traveller whom sunshine has induced to abandon his cloak which the storm only forced him to wrap more closely around him the principal failing of dorax is the excess of pride which renders each supposed wound to his honour more venomously acute yet he is not devoid of gentler affections though even in indulging these the hardness of his character is conspicuous he loves violante but that is a far subordinate feeling to his affection for sebastian indeed his love appears so inferior to his loyal devotion to his king that unless to gratify the taste of the age i see little reason for its being introduced at all it is obvious he was much more jealous of the regard of his sovereign than of his mistress he never mentions violante till the scene of explanation with sebastian and he appears hardly to have retained a more painful recollection of his disappointment in that particular than of the general neglect and disgrace he had sustained at the court of lisbon the last stage of a virtuous heart corroded into evil by wounded pride has been never more forcibly displayed than in the character of dorax when once induced to take the fatal step which degraded him in his own eyes all his good affections seem to be converted into poison the religion which displays itself in the fifth act in his arguments against suicide had in his efforts to justify his apostacy or at least to render it a matter of no moment been exchanged for sentiments approaching perhaps to atheism certainly to total scepticism his passion for violante is changed into contempt and hatred for her sex which he expresses in the coarsest terms his feelings of generosity and even of humanity are drowned in the gloomy and stern misanthropy which has its source in the selfdiscontent that endeavours to wreak itself upon others this may be illustrated by his unfeeling behaviour while alvarez and antonio well known to him in former days approach and draw the deadly lot which ratifies their fate no yielding of compassion no recollection of former friendship has power to alter the cold and sardonic sarcasm with which he sketches their characters and marks their deportment in that awful moment finally the zealous attachment of alonzo for his king which in its original expression partakes of absolute devotion is changed by the circumstances of dorax into an irritated and frantic jealousy which he mistakes for hatred and which in pursuing the destruction of its object is almost more inveterate than hatred itself nothing has survived of the original alonzo at the opening of the piece except the gigantic passion which has caused his ruin this character is drawn on a large scale and in a heroic proportion but it is so true to nature that many readers must have lamented even within the circle of domestic acquaintance instances of feelings hardened and virtues perverted where a high spirit has sustained severe and unjust neglect and disgrace the whole demeanour of this exquisite character suits the original sketch from the long stride and sullen port by which benducar distinguishes him at a distance to the sullen stubbornness with which he obeys or the haughty contempt with which he resists the commands of the peremptory tyrant under whom he had taken service all announce the untamed pride which had robbed dorax of virtue and which yet when benducar would seduce him into a conspiracy and in his conduct towards sebastian assumes the port and dignity of virtue herself in all his conduct and bearing there is that mixed feeling and impulse which constitutes the real spring of human action the true motive of alonzo in saving sebastian is not purely that of honourable hatred which he proposes to himself for to himself every man endeavours to appear consistent and readily find arguments to prove to himself that he is so neither is his conduct to be ascribed altogether to the gentler feelings of loyal and friendly affection relenting at the sight of his sovereigns ruin and impending death it is the result of a mixture of these opposite sensations clashing against each other like two rivers at their conflux yet urging their united course down the same channel actuated by a mixture of these feelings dorax meets sebastian and the art of the poet is displayed in that admirable scene by suggesting a natural motive to justify to the injured subject himself the change of the course of his feelings as his jealousy of sebastians favour and resentment of his unjust neglect was chiefly founded on the avowed preference which the king had given to henriquez the opportune mention of his rivals death by removing the cause of that jealousy gives the renegade an apology to his own pride for throwing himself at the feet of that very sovereign whom a moment before he was determined to force to combat they are little acquainted with human passions at least have only witnessed their operations among men of common minds who doubt that at the height of their very springtide they are often most susceptible of sudden changes revolutions which seem to those who have not remarked how nearly the most opposite feelings are allied and united the most extravagant and unaccountable muly moluch is an admirable specimen of that very frequent theatrical charactera stage tyrant he is fierce and boisterous enough to be sufficiently terrible and odious and that without much rant considering he is an infidel soldan who from the ancient deportment of mahomed and termagaunt as they appeared in the old mysteries might claim a prescriptive right to tear a passion to tatters besides the moorish emperor has fine glances of savage generosity and that free unconstrained and almost noble openness the only good quality perhaps which a consciousness of unbounded power may encourage in a mind so firm as not to be totally depraved by it the character of muly moluch like that of morat in aurengzebe to which it bears a strong resemblance was admirably represented by kynaston who had says cibber a fierce lionlike majesty in his port and utterance that gave the spectator a kind of trembling admiration it is enough to say of benducar that the cool fawning intriguing and unprincipled statesman is fully developed in his whole conduct and of alvarez that the little he has to say and do is so said and done as not to disgrace his commonplace character of the possessor of the secret on which the plot depends for it may be casually observed that the depositary of such a clew to the catastrophe though of the last importance to the plot is seldom himself of any interest whatever the haughty and highspirited almeyda is designed by the author as the counterpart of sebastian she breaks out with the same violence i had almost said fury and frequently discovers a sort of kindred sentiment intended to prepare the reader for the unfortunate discovery that she is the sister of the portuguese monarch  of the diction dr johnson has said with meagre commendation that it has some sentiments which leave a strong impression and others of excellence universally acknowledged this even when the admiration of the scene betwixt dorax and sebastian has been sanctioned by that great critic seems scanty applause for the chef doeuvre of drydens dramatic works the reader will be disposed to look for more unqualified praise when such a poet was induced by every pressing consideration to combine in one effort the powers of his mighty genius and the fruits of his long theatrical experience accordingly shakespeare laid aside it will be perhaps difficult to point out a play containing more animatory incident impassioned language and beautiful description than don sebastian of the former the scene betwixt dorax and the king had it been the only one ever dryden wrote would have been sufficient to insure his immortality there is notno perhaps not even in shakespearean instance where the chord which the poet designed should vibrate is more happily struck strains there are of a higher mood but not more correctly true in evidence of which we have known those whom distresses of a gentler nature were unable to move feel their stubborn feelings roused and melted by the injured pride and deep repentance of dorax the burst of anguish with which he answers the stern taunt of sebastian is one of those rare but natural instances in which hightoned passion assumes a figurative language because all that is familiar seems inadequate to express its feelings    dor thou hast dared   to tell me what i durst not tell myself   i durst not think that i was spurned and live   and live to hear it boasted to my face   all my long avarice of honour lost   heaped up in youth and hoarded up for age   has honours fountain then sucked back the stream   he has and hooting boys may dryshod pass   and gather pebbles from the naked ford   give me my love my honour give them back   give me revenge while i have breath to ask it  but i will not dwell on the beauties of this scene if any one is incapable of relishing it he may safely conclude that nature has not merely denied him that rare gift poetical taste but common powers of comprehending the ordinary feelings of humanity the love scene betwixt sebastian and almeyda is more purely conceived and expressed with more reference to sentiment than is common with our author the description which dorax gives of sebastian before his appearance coming from a mortal enemy at least from one whose altered love was as envenomed as hatred is a grand preparation for the appearance of the hero in many of the slighter descriptive passages we recognize the poet by those minute touches which a mind susceptible of poetic feeling is alone capable of bringing out the approach of the emperor while the conspirators are caballing is announced by orchan with these picturesque circumstances    i see the blaze of torches from afar   and hear the trampling of thickbeating feet   this way they move  the following account given by the slave sent to observe what passed in the castle of dorax believed to be dead or dying is equally striking    haly two hours i warily have watched his palace   all doors are shut no servant peeps abroad   some officers with striding haste past in   while others outward went on quick dispatch   sometimes hushed silence seemed to reign within   then cries confused and a joint clamour followed   then lights went gliding by from room to room   and shot like thwarting meteors cross the house   not daring further to inquire i came   with speed to bring you this imperfect news  the description of the midnight insurrection of the rabble is not less impressive    ham what you wish   the streets are thicker in this noon of night   than at the midday sun a drouzy horror   sits on their eyes like fear not well awake   all crowd in heaps as at a night alarm   the bees drive out upon each others backs   timboss their hives in clusters all ask news   their busy captain runs the weary round   to whisper orders and commanding silence   makes not noise cease but deafens it to murmurs  these illustrations are designedly selected from the parts of the lower characters because they at once evince the diligence and success with which dryden has laboured even the subordinate points of this tragedy  don sebastian has been weighed with reference to its tragic merits against love for love and one or other is universally allowed to be the first of drydens dramatic performances to the youth of both sexes the latter presents the most pleasing subject of emotion but to those whom age has rendered incredulous upon the romantic effects of love and who do not fear to look into the recesses of the human heart when agitated by darker and more stubborn passions don sebastian offers a far superior source of gratification  to point out the blemishes of so beautiful a tragedy is a painful though a necessary task the style here and there exhibits marks of a reviving taste for those frantic bursts of passion which our author has himself termed the dalilahs of the theatre the first speech of sebastian has been often noticed as an extravagant rant more worthy of maximin or almanzor than of a character drawn by our author in his advanced years and chastened taste    i beg no pity for this mouldering clay   for if you give it burial there it takes   possession of your earth   if burnt and scatterd in the air the winds   that strew my dust diffuse my royalty   and spread me oer your clime for where one atom   of mine shall light know there sebastian reigns  the readers discernment will discover some similar extravagancies in the language of almeyda and the emperor  it is a separate objection that the manners of the age and country are not adhered to sebastian by disposition a crusading knighterrant devoted to religion and chivalry becomes in the hands of dryden merely a gallant soldier and highspirited prince such as existed in the poets own days but what is worse the manners of mahometans are shockingly violated who ever heard of human sacrifices or of any sacrifices being offered up to mahomet2 and when were his followers able to use the classical and learned allusions which occur throughout the dialogue on this last topic addison makes the following observations in the guardian no 110    i have now mr drydens don sebastian before me in which i find   frequent allusions to ancient poetry and the old mythology of the   heathens it is not very natural to suppose a king of portugal would   be borrowing thoughts out of ovids metamorphoses when he talked   even to those of his own court but to allude to these roman fables   when he talks to an emperor of barbary seems very extraordinary   but observe how he defies him out of the classics in the following   lines      why didst not thou engage me man to man     and try the virtue of that gorgon face     to stare me into statue    almeyda at the same time is more booklearned than don sebastian   she plays an hydra upon the emperor that is full as good as the   gorgon      o that i had the fruitful heads of hydra     that one might bourgeon where another fell     still would i give thee work still still thou tyrant     and hiss thee with the last    she afterwards in allusion to hercules bids him lay down the   lions skin and take the distaff and in the following speech   utters her passion still more learnedly      no were we joined even though it were in death     our bodies burning in one funeral pile     the prodigy of thebes would be renewed     and my divided flame should break from thine    the emperor of barbary shews himself acquainted with the roman   poets as well as either of his prisoners and answers the foregoing   speech in the same classic strain      serpent i will engender poison with thee     our offspring like the seed of dragons teeth     shall issue armed and fight themselves to death    ovid seems to have been muleymolochs favourite author witness   the lines that follow      she still inexorable still imperious     and loud as if like bacchus born in thunder    i shall conclude my remarks on his part with that poetical   complaint of his being in love and leave my reader to consider how   prettily it would sound in the mouth of an emperor of morocco      the god of love once more has shot his fires     into my soul and my whole heart receives him    muley zeydan is as ingenious a man as his brother muley moloch as   where he hints at the story of castor and pollux      may we neer meet     for like the twins of leda when i mount     he gallops down the skies    as for the mufti we will suppose that he was bred up a scholar   and not only versed in the law of mahomet but acquainted with all   kinds of polite learning for this reason he is not at all surprised   when dorax calls him a phæton in one place and in another tells him   he is like archimedes    the mufti afterwards mentions ximenes albornoz and cardinal   wolsey by name the poet seems to think he may make every person   in his play know as much as himself and talk as well as he could   have done on the same occasion at least i believe every reader   will agree with me that the abovementioned sentiments to which i   might have added several others would have been better suited to   the court of augustus than that of muley moloch i grant they are   beautiful in themselves and much more so in that noble language   which was peculiar to this great poet i only observe that they are   improper for the persons who make use of them  the catastrophe of the tragedy may be also censured not only on the grounds objected to that of oedipus but because it does not naturally flow from the preceding events and opens in the fifth act a new set of persons and a train of circumstances unconnected with the preceding action in the concluding scene it was remarked by the critics that there is a want of pure taste in the lovers dwelling more upon the pleasures than the horrors of their incestuous connection  of the lighter scenes which were intended for comic dr johnson has said they are such as that age did not probably commend and as the present would not endure dryden has remarked with selfcomplacency the art with which they are made to depend upon the serious business this has not however the merit of novelty being not unlike the connection between the tragic and comic scenes of the spanish friar the persons introduced have also some resemblance though the gaiety of antonio is far more gross than that of lorenzo and morayma is a very poor copy of elvira it is rather surprising that when a gay libertine was to be introduced dryden did not avail himself of a real character the english stukely a wild gallant who after spending a noble fortune became the leader of a band of italian condottieri engaged in the service of sebastian and actually fell in the battle of alcazar collier complains and with very good reason that in the character of the mufti dryden has seized an opportunity to deride and calumniate the priesthood of every religion an opportunity which i am sorry to say he seldom fails to use with unjustifiable inveteracy the rabble scenes were probably given as our author himself says of that in cleomenes to gratify the more barbarous part of the audience indeed to judge from the practice of the drama at this time the representation of a riot upon the stage seems to have had the same charms for the popular part of the english audience which its reality always possesses in the streets  notwithstanding the excellence of this tragedy it appears to have been endured rather than applauded at its first representation although being judiciously curtailed it soon became a great favourite with the public3 and omitting the comic scenes may be again brought forward with advantage when the public shall be tired of children and of show the tragedy of don sebastian was acted and printed in 1690   footnotes 1 the battle of alcazar with captain stukelys death acted by the    lord high admirals servants 1594 4to baker thinks dryden might    have taken the hint of don sebastian from this old play    shakespeare drew from it some of the bouncing rants of pistol as   feed and be fat my fair callipolis c  2 in a zambra dance introduced in the conquest of granada our    author had previously introduced the moors bowing to the image of    jupiter a gross solecism hardly more pardonable as langbaine    remarks than the introduction of a pistol in the hand of    demetrius a successor of alexander the great which dryden has    justly censured  3 langbaine says it was acted with great applause but this must    refer to its reception after the first night for the authors own    expressions that the audience endured it with much patience and    were weary with much good nature and silence exclude the idea of    a brilliant reception on the first representation see the    beginning of the preface                                       to                           the right honourable                                 philip                        earl of leicester c1   far be it from me my most noble lord to think that any thing which my meanness can produce should be worthy to be offered to your patronage or that aught which i can say of you should recommend you farther to the esteem of good men in this present age or to the veneration which will certainly be paid you by posterity on the other side i must acknowledge it a great presumption in me to make you this address and so much the greater because by the common suffrage even of contrary parties you have been always regarded as one of the first persons of the age and yet not one writer has dared to tell you so whether we have been all conscious to ourselves that it was a needless labour to give this notice to mankind as all men are ashamed to tell stale news or that we were justly diffident of our own performances as even cicero is observed to be in awe when he writes to atticus where knowing himself overmatched in good sense and truth of knowledge he drops the gaudy train of words and is no longer the vainglorious orator from whatever reason it may be i am the first bold offender of this kind i have broken down the fence and ventured into the holy grove how i may be punished for my profane attempt i know not but i wish it may not be of ill omen to your lordship and that a crowd of bad writers do not rush into the quiet of your recesses after me every man in all changes of government which have been or may possibly arrive will agree that i could not have offered my incense where it could be so well deserved for you my lord are secure in your own merit and all parties as they rise uppermost are sure to court you in their turns it is a tribute which has ever been paid your virtue the leading men still bring their bullion to your mint to receive the stamp of their intrinsic value that they may afterwards hope to pass with human kind they rise and fall in the variety of revolutions and are sometimes great and therefore wise in mens opinions who must court them for their interest but the reputation of their parts most commonly follows their success few of them are wise but as they are in power because indeed they have no sphere of their own but like the moon in the copernican system of the world are whirled about by the motion of a greater planet this it is to be ever busy neither to give rest to their fellowcreatures nor which is more wretchedly ridiculous to themselves though truly the latter is a kind of justice and giving mankind a due revenge that they will not permit their own hearts to be at quiet who disturb the repose of all beside them ambitious meteors how willing they are to set themselves upon the wing and taking every occasion of drawing upward to the sun not considering that they have no more time allowed them for their mounting than the short revolution of a day and that when the light goes from them they are of necessity to fall how much happier is he and who he is i need not say for there is but one phoenix in an age who centering on himself remains immoveable and smiles at the madness of the dance about him he possesses the midst which is the portion of safety and content he will not be higher because he needs it not but by the prudence of that choice he puts it out of fortunes power to throw him down it is confest that if he had not so been born he might have been too high for happiness but not endeavouring to ascend he secures the native height of his station from envy and cannot descend from what he is because he depends not on another what a glorious character was this once in rome i should say in athens when in the disturbances of a state as mad as ours the wise pomponius transported all the remaining wisdom and virtue of his country into the sanctuary of peace and learning but i would ask the world for you my lord are too nearly concerned to judge this cause whether there may not yet be found a character of a noble englishman equally shining with that illustrious roman whether i need to name a second atticus or whether the world has not already prevented me and fixed it there without my naming not a second with a longo sed proximus intervallo not a young marcellus flattered by a poet into the resemblance of the first with a frons læta parum et dejecto lumina vultu and the rest that follows si qua fata aspera rumpas tu marcellus eris but a person of the same stamp and magnitude who owes nothing to the former besides the word roman and the superstition of reverence devolving on him by the precedency of eighteen hundred years one who walks by him with equal paces and shares the eyes of beholders with him one who had been first had he first lived and in spite of doating veneration is still his equal both of them born of noble families in unhappy ages of change and tumult both of them retiring from affairs of state yet not leaving the commonwealth till it had left itself but never returning to public business when they had once quitted it though courted by the heads of either party but who would trust the quiet of their lives with the extravagancies of their countrymen when they are just in the giddiness of their turning when the ground was tottering under them at every moment and none could guess whether the next heave of the earthquake would settle them on the first foundation or swallow it both of them knew mankind exactly well for both of them began that study in themselves and there they found the best part of human composition the worst they learned by long experience of the folly ignorance and immorality of most beside them their philosophy on both sides was not wholly speculative for that is barren and produces nothing but vain ideas of things which cannot possibly be known or if they could yet would only terminate in the understanding but it was a noble vigorous and practical philosophy which exerted itself in all the offices of pity to those who were unfortunate and deserved not so to be the friend was always more considered by them than the cause and an octavius or an antony in distress were relieved by them as well as a brutus or a cassius for the lowermost party to a noble mind is ever the fittest object of goodwill the eldest of them i will suppose for his honour to have been of the academic sect neither dogmatist nor stoick if he were not i am sure he ought in common justice to yield the precedency to his younger brother for stiffness of opinion is the effect of pride and not of philosophy it is a miserable presumption of that knowledge which human nature is too narrow to contain and the ruggedness of a stoick is only a silly affectation of being a godto wind himself up by pullies to an insensibility of suffering and at the same time to give the lie to his own experience by saying he suffers not what he knows he feels true philosophy is certainly of a more pliant nature and more accommodated to human use homo sum humani à me nihil alienum puto a wise man will never attempt an impossibility and such it is to strain himself beyond the nature of his being either to become a deity by being above suffering or to debase himself into a stock or stone by pretending not to feel it to find in ourselves the weaknesses and imperfections of our wretched kind is surely the most reasonable step we can make towards the compassion of our fellowcreatures i could give examples of this kind in the second atticus in every turn of state without meddling on either side he has always been favourable and assisting to opprest merit the praises which were given by a great poet to the late queenmother on her rebuilding somerset palace one part of which was fronting to the mean houses on the other side of the water are as justly his    for the distrest and the afflicted lie   most in his thoughts and always in his eye2  neither has he so far forgotten a poor inhabitant of his suburbs whose best prospect is on the garden of leicester house but that more than once he has been offering him his patronage to reconcile him to a world of which his misfortunes have made him weary3 there is another sidney still remaining though there can never be another spenser to deserve the favour but one sidney gave his patronage to the applications of a poet the other offered it unasked thus whether as a second atticus or a second sir philip sidney the latter in all respects will not have the worse of the comparison and if he will take up with the second place the world will not so far flatter his modesty as to seat him there unless it be out of a deference of manners that he may place himself where he pleases at his own table  i may therefore safely conclude that he who by the consent of all men bears so eminent a character will out of his inborn nobleness forgive the presumption of this address it is an unfinished picture i confess but the lines and features are so like that it cannot be mistaken for any other and without writing any name under it every beholder must cry out at first sightthis was designed for atticus but the bad artist has cast too much of him into shades but i have this excuse that even the greatest masters commonly fall short of the best faces they may flatter an indifferent beauty but the excellencies of nature can have no right done to them for there both the pencil and pen are overcome by the dignity of the subject as our admirable waller has expressed it    the heroes race transcends the poets thought  there are few in any age who can bear the load of a dedication for where praise is undeserved it is satire though satire on folly is now no longer a scandal to any one person where a whole age is dipt together yet i had rather undertake a multitude one way than a single atticus the other for it is easier to descend than it is to climb i should have gone ashamed out of the world if i had not at least attempted this address which i have long thought owing and if i had never attempted i might have been vain enough to think i might have succeeded in it now i have made the experiment and have failed through my unworthiness i may rest satisfied that either the adventure is not to be atchieved or that it is reserved for some other hand  be pleased therefore since the family of the attici is and ought to be above the common forms of concluding letters that i may take my leave in the words of cicero to the first of them me o pomponi valdè pænitet vivere tantùm te oro ut quoniam me ipse semper amàsti ut eodem amore sis ego nimirum idem sum inimici mei mea mihi non meipsum ademerunt cura attice ut valeas    dabam cal   jan 1690   footnotes 1 in order to escape as far as possible the odium which after the    revolution was attached to drydens politics and religion he seems    occasionally to have sought for patrons amongst those nobles of    opposite principles whom moderation or love of literature    rendered superior to the suggestions of party rancour or as he    himself has expressed it in the dedication of amphitryon who    though of a contrary opinion themselves blamed him not for    adhering to a lost cause and judging for himself what he could not    chuse but judge philip sidney the third earl of leicester had    taken an active part against the king in the civil wars had been    named one of his judges though he never look his seat among the    regicides and had been one of cromwells council of state he was    brother of the famous algernon sidney and although retired from    party strife during the violent contests betwixt the whigs and    tories in 16823 there can be no doubt which way his inclinations    leaned he died 6th march 16967 aged more than eighty years mr    malone has strongly censured the strain of this dedication because    it represents leicester as abstracted from parties and public    affairs notwithstanding his active share in the civil wars yet    dryden was not obliged to draw the portrait of his patron from his    conduct thirty years before and if leicesters character was to be    taken from the latter part of his life surely the praise of    moderation is due to him who during the factious contests of    charles iis reign in which his own brother made so conspicuous a    figure maintained the neutrality of pomponius atticus  2 when henrietta maria widow of charles i and queendowager of    england visited her son after the restoration she chose    somersethouse for her residence and added all the buildings    fronting the river cowley whom she had long patronised composed    a poem on the queens repairing somersethouse to which our    author refers mr malones accuracy has detected a slight    alteration in the verses as quoted by dryden and as written by    cowley       if any prouder virtuosos sense      at that part of my prospect take offence      by which the meaner cabanes are descried      of my imperial rivers humbler side      if they call that a blemish let them know      god and my godlike mistress

                            the                                 preface   whether it happened through a long disuse of writing that i forgot the usual compass of a play or that by crowding it with characters and incidents i put a necessity upon myself of lengthening the main action i know not but the first days audience sufficiently convinced me of my error and that the poem was insupportably too long it is an ill ambition of us poets to please an audience with more than they can bear and supposing that we wrote as well as vainly we imagine ourselves to write yet we ought to consider that no man can bear to be long tickled there is a nauseousness in a cityfeast when we are to sit four hours after we are cloyed i am therefore in the first place to acknowledge with all manner of gratitude their civility who were pleased to endure it with so much patience to be weary with so much goodnature and silence and not to explode an entertainment which was designed to please them or discourage an author whose misfortunes have once more brought him against his will upon the stage while i continue in these bad circumstances and truly i see very little probability of coming out i must be obliged to write and if i may still hope for the same kind usage i shall the less repent of that hard necessity i write not this out of any expectation to be pitied for i have enemies enow to wish me yet in a worse condition but give me leave to say that if i can please by writing as i shall endeavour it the town may be somewhat obliged to my misfortunes for a part of their diversion having been longer acquainted with the stage than any poet now living and having observed how difficult it was to please that the humours of comedy were almost spent that love and honour the mistaken topics of tragedy were quite worn out that the theatres could not support their charges that the audience forsook them that young men without learning set up for judges and that they talked loudest who understood the least all these discouragements had not only weaned me from the stage but had also given me a loathing of it but enough of this the difficulties continue they increase and i am still condemned to dig in those exhausted mines  whatever fault i next commit rest assured it shall not be that of too much length above twelve hundred lines have been cut off from this tragedy since it was first delivered to the actors they were indeed so judiciously lopped by mr betterton to whose care and excellent action i am equally obliged that the connection of the story was not lost but on the other side it was impossible to prevent some part of the action from being precipitated and coming on without that due preparation which is required to all great events as in particular that of raising the mobile in the beginning of the fourth act which a man of benducars cool character could not naturally attempt without taking all those precautions which he foresaw would be necessary to render his design successful on this consideration i have replaced those lines through the whole poem and thereby restored it to that clearness of conception and if i may dare to say it that lustre and masculine vigour in which it was first written it is obvious to every understanding reader that the most poetical parts which are descriptions images similitudes and moral sentences are those which of necessity were to be pared away when the body was swollen into too large a bulk for the representation of the stage but there is a vast difference betwixt a public entertainment on the theatre and a private reading in the closet in the first we are confined to time and though we talk not by the hourglass yet the watch often drawn out of the pocket warns the actors that their audience is weary in the last every reader is judge of his own convenience he can take up the book and lay it down at his pleasure and find out those beauties of propriety in thought and writing which escaped him in the tumult and hurry of representing and i dare boldly promise for this play that in the roughness of the numbers and cadences which i assure was not casual but so designed you will see somewhat more masterly arising to your view than in most if not any of my former tragedies there is a more noble daring in the figures and more suitable to the loftiness of the subject and besides this some newnesses of english translated from the beauties of modern tongues as well as from the elegancies of the latin and here and there some old words are sprinkled which for their significance and sound deserved not to be antiquated such as we often find in sallust amongst the roman authors and in miltons paradise amongst ours though perhaps the latter instead of sprinkling has dealt them with too free a hand even sometimes to the obscuring of his sense  as for the story or plot of the tragedy it is purely fiction for i take it up where the history has laid it down we are assured by all writers of those times that sebastian a young prince of great courage and expectation undertook that war partly upon a religious account partly at the solicitation of muley mahomet who had been driven out of his dominions by abdelmelech or as others call him muley moluch his nigh kinsman who descended from the same family of xeriffs whose fathers hamet and mahomet had conquered that empire with joint forces and shared it betwixt them after their victory that the body of don sebastian was never found in the field of battle which gave occasion for many to believe that he was not slain1 that some years after when the spaniards with a pretended title by force of arms had usurped the crown of portugal from the house of braganza a certain person who called himself don sebastian and had all the marks of his body and features of his face appeared at venice where he was owned by some of his countrymen but being seized by the spaniards was first imprisoned then sent to the gallies and at last put to death in private it is most certain that the portuguese expected his return for almost an age together after that battle which is at least a proof of their extreme love to his memory and the usage they had from their new conquerors might possibly make them so extravagant in their hopes and wishes for their old master2  this groundwork the history afforded me and i desire no better to build a play upon for where the event of a great action is left doubtful there the poet is left master he may raise what he pleases on that foundation provided he makes it of a piece and according to the rule of probability from hence i was only obliged that sebastian should return to portugal no more but at the same time i had him at my own disposal whether to bestow him in afric or in any other corner of the world or to have closed the tragedy with his death and the last of these was certainly the most easy but for the same reason the least artful because as i have somewhere said the poison and the dagger are still at hand to butcher a hero when a poet wants the brains to save him it being therefore only necessary according to the laws of the drama that sebastian should no more be seen upon the throne i leave it for the world to judge whether or no i have disposed of him according to art or have bungled up the conclusion of his adventure in the drawing of his character i forgot not piety which any one may observe to be one principal ingredient of it even so far as to be a habit in him though i shew him once to be transported from it by the violence of a sudden passion to endeavour a selfmurder this being presupposed that he was religious the horror of his incest though innocently committed was the best reason which the stage could give for hindering his return it is true i have no right to blast his memory with such a crime but declaring it to be fiction i desire my audience to think it no longer true than while they are seeing it represented for that once ended he may be a saint for aught i know and we have reason to presume he is on this supposition it was unreasonable to have killed him for the learned mr rymer has well observed that in all punishments we are to regulate ourselves by poetical justice and according to those measures an involuntary sin deserves not death from whence it follows that to divorce himself from the beloved object to retire into a desert and deprive himself of a throne was the utmost punishment which a poet could inflict as it was also the utmost reparation which sebastian could make for what relates to almeyda her part is wholly fictitious i know it is the surname of a noble family in portugal which was very instrumental in the restoration of don john de braganza father to the most illustrious and most pious princess our queendowager the french author of a novel called don sebastian has given that name to an african lady of his own invention and makes her sister to muley mahomet but i have wholly changed the accidents and borrowed nothing but the supposition that she was beloved by the king of portugal though if i had taken the whole story and wrought it up into a play i might have done it exactly according to the practice of almost all the ancients who were never accused of being plagiaries for building their tragedies on known fables thus augustus cæsar wrote an ajax which was not the less his own because euripides had written a play before him on that subject thus of late years corneille writ an oedipus after sophocles and i have designed one after him which i wrote with mr lee yet neither the french poet stole from the greek nor we from the frenchman it is the contrivance the new turn and new characters which alter the property and make it ours the materia poetica is as common to all writers as the materia medica to all physicians thus in our chronicles daniels history is still his own though matthew paris stow and hollingshed writ before him otherwise we must have been content with their dull relations if a better pen had not been allowed to come after them and writ his own account after a new and better manner  i must further declare freely that i have not exactly kept to the three mechanic rules of unity i knew them and had them in my eye but followed them only at a distance for the genius of the english cannot bear too regular a play we are given to variety even to a debauchery of pleasure my scenes are therefore sometimes broken because my underplot required them so to be though the general scene remainsof the same castle and i have taken the time of two days because the variety of accidents which are here represented could not naturally be supposed to arrive in one but to gain a greater beauty it is lawful for a poet to supersede a less  i must likewise own that i have somewhat deviated from the known history in the death of muley moluch who by all relations died of a fever in the battle before his army had wholly won the field but if i have allowed him another day of life it was because i stood in need of so shining a character of brutality as i have given him which is indeed the same with that of the present emperor muleyishmael as some of our english officers who have been in his court have credibly informed me  i have been listeningwhat objections had been made against the conduct of the play but found them all so trivial that if i should name them a true critic would imagine that i played booty and only raised up phantoms for myself to conquer some are pleased to saythe writing is dull but ætatem habet de se loquatur others that the double poison is unnatural let the common received opinion and ausonius his famous epigram answer that3 lastly a more ignorant sort of creatures than either of the former maintain that the character of dorax is not only unnatural but inconsistent with itself let them read the play and think again and if yet they are not satisfied cast their eyes on that chapter of the wise montaigne which is intitled de linconstance des actions humaines a longer reply is what those cavillers deserve not but i will give them and their fellows to understand that the earl of dorset was pleased to read the tragedy twice over before it was acted and did me the favour to send me word that i had written beyond any of my former plays and that he was displeased any thing should be cut away if i have not reason to prefer his single judgment to a whole faction let the world be judge for the opposition is the same with that of lucans hero against an army concurrere bellum atque virum  i think i may modestly conclude that whatever errors there may be either in the design or writing of this play they are not those which have been objected to it i think also that i am not yet arrived to the age of doting and that i have given so much application to this poem that i could not probably let it run into many gross absurdities which may caution my enemies from too rash a censure and may also encourage my friends who are many more than i could reasonably have expected to believe their kindness has not been very undeservedly bestowed on me this is not a play that was huddled up in haste and to shew it was not i will own that besides the general moral of it which is given in the four last lines there is also another moral couched under every one of the principal parts and characters which a judicious critic will observe though i point not to it in this preface and there may be also some secret beauties in the decorum of parts and uniformity of design which my puny judges will not easily find out let them consider in the last scene of the fourth act whether i have not preserved the rule of decency in giving all the advantage to the royal character and in making dorax first submit perhaps too they may have thought that it was through indigence of characters that i have given the same to sebastian and almeyda and consequently made them alike in all things but their sex but let them look a little deeper into the matter and they will find that this identity of character in the greatness of their souls was intended for a preparation of the final discovery and that the likeness of their nature was a fair hint to the proximity of their blood  to avoid the imputation of too much vanity for all writers and especially poets will have some i will give but one other instance in relation to the uniformity of the design i have observed that the english will not bear a thorough tragedy but are pleased that it should be lightened with underparts of mirth it had been easy for me to have given my audience a better course of comedy i mean a more diverting than that of antonio and morayma but i dare appeal even to my enemies if i or any man could have invented one which had been more of a piece and more depending on the serious part of the design for what could be more uniform than to draw from out of the members of a captive court the subject of a comical entertainment to prepare this episode you see dorax giving the character of antonio in the beginning of the play upon his first sight of him at the lottery and to make the dependence antonio is engaged in the fourth act for the deliverance of almeyda which is also prepared by his being first made a slave to the captain of the rabble  i should beg pardon for these instances but perhaps they may be of use to future poets in the conduct of their plays at least if i appear too positive i am growing old and thereby in possession of some experience which men in years will always assume for a right of talking certainly if a man can ever have reason to set a value on himself it is when his ungenerous enemies are taking the advantage of the times upon him to ruin him in his reputation and therefore for once i will make bold to take the counsel of my old master virgil    tu ne cede mails sed contrà audentior ito   footnotes 1 there was a portuguese prophecy to this purpose which they

either father or reverend father i heard you call him  joh once again how came you to name morayma  ant another damned mistake of mine for asking one of my fellowslaves who were the chief ladies about the house he answered me morayma and johayma but she it seems is his daughter with a pox to her and you are his beloved wife  joh say your beloved mistress if you please for thats the title i desire this moonshine grows offensive to my eyes come shall we walk into the arbour there we may rectify all mistakes  ant thats close and dark  joh and are those faults to lovers  ant but there i cannot please myself with the sight of your beauty  joh perhaps you may do better  ant but theres not a breath of air stirring  joh the breath of lovers is the sweetest air but you are fearful  ant i am considering indeed that if i am taken with you  joh the best way to avoid it is to retire where we may not be discovered  ant where lodges your husband  joh just against the face of this open walk  ant then he has seen us already for aught i know  joh you make so many difficulties i fear i am displeasing to you  ant aside if morayma comes and takes me in the arbour with her i have made a fine exchange of that diamond for this pebble  joh you are much fallen off let me tell you from the fury of your first embrace  ant i confess i was somewhat too furious at first but you will forgive the transport of my passion now i have considered it better i have a qualm of conscience  joh of conscience why what has conscience to do with two young lovers that have opportunity  ant why truly conscience is something to blame for interposing in our matters but how can i help it if i have a scruple to betray my master  joh there must be something more int for your conscience was very quiet when you took me for morayma  ant i grant you madam when i took you for his daughter for then i might have made you an honourable amends by marriage  joh you christians are such peeking sinners you tremble at a shadow in the moonshine  ant and you africans are such termagants you stop at nothing i must be plain with youyou are married and to a holy man the head of your religion go back to your chamber go back i say and consider of it for this night as i will do on my part i will be true to you and invent all the arguments i can to comply with you and who knows but at our next meeting the sweet devil may have more power over me i am true flesh and blood i can tell you that for your comfort  joh flesh without blood i think thou art or if any it is as cold as that of fishes but ill teach thee to thy cost what vengeance is in store for refusing a lady who has offered thee her lovehelp help there will nobody come to my assistance  ant what do you mean madam for heavens sake peace your husband will hear you think of your own danger if you will not think of mine  joh ungrateful wretch thou deservest no pityhelp help husband or i shall be ravished the villain will be too strong for me help help for pity of a poor distressed creature  ant then i have nothing but impudence to assist me i must drown her clamour whatever comes ont  he takes out his flute and plays                                     as loud as he can possibly and                                     she continues crying out    enter the mufti in his nightgown and two servants  muf o thou villain what horrible impiety art thou committing what ravishing the wife of my bosomtake him away ganch him5 impale him rid the world of such a monster    servants seize him  ant mercy dear master mercy hear me first and after if i have deserved hanging spare me not what have you seen to provoke you to this cruelty  muf i have heard the outcries of my wife the bleatings of the poor innocent lambseen nothing sayst thou if i see the lamb lie bleeding and the butcher by her with his knife drawn and bloody is not that evidence sufficient of the murder i come too late and the execution is already done  ant pray think in reason sir is a man to be put to death for a similitude no violence has been committed none intended the lambs alive and if i durst tell you so no more a lamb than i am a butcher  joh hows that villain darst thou accuse me  ant be patient madam and speak but truth and ill do any thing to serve you i say again and swear it too ill do any thing to serve you                                                   aside  joh aside i understand him but i fear it is now too late to save himpray hear him speak husband perhaps he may say something for himself i know not  muf speak thou has he not violated my bed and thy honour  joh i forgive him freely for he has done nothing what he will do hereafter to make me satisfaction himself best knows  ant any thing any thing sweet madam i shall refuse no drudgery  muf but did he mean no mischief was he endeavouring nothing  joh in my conscience i begin to doubt he did not  muf its impossiblethen what meant all those outcries  joh i heard music in the garden and at an unseasonable time of night and i stole softly out of my bed as imagining it might be he  muf hows that johayma imagining it was he and yet you went  joh why not my lord am not i the mistress of the family and is it not my place to see good order kept in it i thought he might have allured some of the sheslaves to him and was resolved to prevent what might have been betwixt him and them when on the sudden he rushed out upon me caught me in his arms with such a fury  muf i have heard enoughaway with him  joh mistaking me no doubt for one of his fellowslaves with that affrighted as i was i discovered myself and cried aloud but as soon as ever he knew me the villain let me go and i must needs say he started back as if i were some serpent and was more afraid of me than i of him  muf o thou corrupter of my family thats cause enough of deathonce again away with him  joh what for an intended trespass no harm has been done whatever may be he cost you five hundred crowns i take it  muf thou sayst true a very considerable sum he shall not die though he had committed folly with a slave it is too much to lose by him  ant my only fault has ever been to love playing in the dark and the more she cried the more i played that it might be seen i intended nothing to her  muf to your kennel sirrah mortify your flesh and consider in whose family you are  joh and one thing moreremember from henceforth to obey better  muf aside for all her smoothness i am not quite cured of my jealousy but i have thought of a way that will clear my doubts                               exit muf with joh and servants  ant i am mortified sufficiently already without the help of his ghostly counsel fear of death has gone farther with me in two minutes than my conscience would have gone in two months i find myself in a very dejected condition all over me poor sin lies dormant concupiscence is retired to his winterquarters and if morayma should now appeari say no more but alas for her and me                                     morayma comes out of the arbour                                      she steals behind him and claps                                      him on the back  mor and if morayma should appear as she does appearalas you say for her and you  ant art thou there my sweet temptation my eyes my life my soul my all  mor a mighty compliment when all these by your own confession are just nothing  ant nothing till thou camest to new create me thou dost not know the power of thy own charms let me embrace thee and thou shalt see how quickly i can turn wicked  mor stepping back nay if you are so dangerous it is best keeping you at a distance i have no mind to warm a frozen snake in my bosom he may chance to recover and sting me for my pains  ant consider what i have suffered for thy sake already and make me some amends two disappointments in a night o cruel creature  mor and you may thank yourself for both i came eagerly to the charge before my time through the backwalk behind the arbour and you like a freshwater soldier stood guarding the pass before if you missed the enemy you may thank your own dulness  ant nay if you will be using stratagems you shall give me leave to make use of my advantages now i have you in my power we are fairly met ill try it out and give no quarter  mor by your favour sir we meet upon treaty now and not upon defiance  ant if that be all you shall have carte blanche immediately for i long to be ratifying  mor no now i think ont you are already entered into articles with my enemy johaymaany thing to serve you madam i shall refuse no drudgerywhose words were those gentleman was that like a cavalier of honour  ant not very heroic but selfpreservation is a point above honour and religion too antonio was a rogue i must confess but you must give me leave to love him  mor to beg your life so basely and to present your sword to your enemy oh recreant  ant if i had died honourably my fame indeed would have sounded loud but i should never have heard the blastcome dont make yourself worsenatured than you are to save my life you would be content i should promise any thing  mor yes if i were sure you would perform nothing  ant can you suspect i would leave you for johayma  mor no but i can expect you would have both of us love is covetous i must have all of you heart for heart is an equal trick in short i am younger i think handsomer and am sure i love you better she has been my stepmother these fifteen years you think that is her face you see but it is only a daubed vizard she wears an armour of proof upon it an inch thick of paint besides the wash her face is so fortified that you can make no approaches to it without a shovel but for her constancy i can tell you for your comfort she will love till death i mean till yours for when she has worn you out she will certainly dispatch you to another world for fear of telling tales as she has already served three slaves your predecessors of happy memory in her favours she has made my pious father a threepiled cuckold to my knowledge and now she would be robbing me of my single sheep too  ant prythee prevent her then and at least take the shearing of me

thee and make a christian of thee thou pretty damned infidel  mor i mean you shall but no earnest till the bargain be made before witness there is love enough to be had and as much as you can turn you to never doubt but all upon honourable terms  ant i vow and swear by love and hes a deity in all religions  mor but never to be trusted in any he has another name too of a worse sound shall i trust an oath when i see your eyes languishing your cheeks flushing and can hear your heart throbbing no ill not come near you hes a foolish physician who will feel the pulse of a patient that has the plaguespots upon him  ant did one ever hear a little moppet argue so perversely against so good a cause come prythee let me anticipate a little of my revenue  mor you would fain be fingering your rents beforehand but that makes a man an ill husband ever after consider marriage is a painful vocation as you shall prove it manage your incomes as thriftily as you can you shall find a hard task ont to make even at the years end and yet to live decently  ant i came with a christian intention to revenge myself upon thy father for being the head of a false religion  mor and so you shall i offer you his daughter for your second but since you are so pressing meet me under my window tomorrow night body for body about this hour ill slip down out of my lodging and bring my father in my hand  ant how thy father  mor i mean all thats good of him his pearls and jewels his whole contents his heart and soul as much as ever i can carry ill leave him his alcoran thats revenue enough for him every page of it is gold and diamonds he has the turn of an eye a demure smile and a godly cant that are worth millions to him i forgot to tell you that i will have a slave prepared at the postern gate with two horses ready saddledno more for i fear i may be missed and think i hear them calling for meif you have constancy and courage  ant never doubt it and love in abundance to wander with thee all the world over  mor the value of twelve hundred thousand crowns in a casket  ant a heavy burden heaven knows but we must pray for patience to support it  mor besides a willing titt that will venture her corps

lips till we meet again  mor no frequent charities make bold beggars and besides i have learned of a falconer never to feed up a hawk when i would have him fly thats enough but if you would be nibbling heres a hand to stay your stomach                                kissing her hand  ant thus conquered infidels that wars may cease are forced to give their hands and sign the peace  mor thus christians are outwitted by the foe you had her in your power and let her go if you release my hand the faults not mine you should have made me seal as well as sign                       she runs off

this dreadful sentence to the world relate that unrepented crimes of parents dead are justly punished on their childrens head   footnotes 1 this whimsical account of the slavemarket is probably taken from    the following passage in the captivity and escape of adam elliot    maby sunrising next morning we were all of us who came    last to sallee driven to market where the moors sitting    taylorwise on stalls round about we were severally run up and    down by persons who proclaimed our qualities or trades and what    might best recommend us to the buyer i had a great black who was    appointed to sell me this fellow holding me by the hand coursed    me up and down from one person to another who called upon me at    pleasure to examine what trade i was of and to see what labour my

belief that dejection of spirits without cause    announces an impending violent death is simply but well expressed    in an old ballad called the warning to all murderers       and after this most bad pretence        the gentleman each day      still felt his heart to throb and faint        and sad he was alway       his sleep was full of dreadful dreams        in bed where he did lie      his

vision seems    to be borrowed from the story of one of the caliphs who before    his death dreamed that a sable hand and arm shook over his head a    handful of red earth and denounced that such was the colour of    the earth on which he should die when taken ill on an expedition    he desired to know the colour of the earth on which his tent was    pitched a negro slave presented him with a

following passage in the    continuation of the adventures of don sebastian     in moran an island some half league from venice there is an    abbot called capelo a gentleman of venice a grave personage and    of great authority hearing that the king laid wait for certain    jewels that he had lost hoping thereby to recover some of them    having a diamond in his keeping with the arms of

he said verily this    is mine and i either lost the same in flanders or else it was    stolen from me and when the king had put it upon his finger it    appeared otherwise engraven than before the abbot enquiring of him    that brought him the ring how he came by it he answered it is    true that the king hath said hence arose a strange rumour of a    ring that by turning the stone you might
