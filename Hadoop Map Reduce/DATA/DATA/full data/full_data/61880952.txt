translation                                 285     diderot  chapter i  other dialogues   we may now pass to performances that are nearer to the accepted surface of things a short but charming example of diderots taste for putting questions of morals in an interesting way is found in the conversation of a father with his children published in 1773 this little dialogue is perfect in the simple realism of its form its subject is the peril of setting ones own judgment of some special set of circumstances above the law of the land diderots venerable and wellloved father is sitting in his armchair before the fire he begins the discussion by telling his two sons and his daughter who are tending him with pious care how very near he had once been to destroying their inheritance an old priest had died leaving a considerable fortune there was believed to be no will and the next of kin were a number of poor people whom the inheritance would have rescued from indigence for the rest of their days they appointed the elder diderot to guard their interests and divide the property he finds at the bottom of a disused box of ancient letters receipts and other wastepaper a will made long years ago and bequeathing all the fortune to a very rich bookseller in paris there was every reason to suppose that the old priest had forgotten the existence of the will and it involved a revolting injustice would not diderot be fulfilling the dead mans real wishes by throwing the unwelcome document into the flames  at this point in the dialogue the doctor enters the room and interrupts the tale it appears that he is fresh from the bedside of a criminal who is destined to the gallows diderot the younger reproaches him for labouring to keep in the world an offender whom it were best to send out of it with all despatch the duty of the physician is to say to so execrable a patienti will not busy myself in restoring to life a creature whom it is enjoined upon me by natural equity the good of society the wellbeing of my fellowcreatures to give up die and let it never be said that through my skill there exists a monster the more on earth the doctor parries these energetic declamations with sufficient skill my business is to cure not to judge i shall cure him because that is my trade then the judge will have him hung because that is his trade this episodic discussion ended the story of the will is resumed the father when on the point of destroying it was seized with a scruple of conscience and hastened to a curé well versed in casuistry as in england the agents of the law itself not seldom play the part of arbitrary benevolence which the old diderot would fain have played against the law the scene may perhaps be worth transcribing       nothing is more praiseworthy sir than the sentiment of      compassion that touches you for these unfortunate people suppress      the testament and succour themgood but on condition of restoring      to the rightful legatee the exact sum of which you deprive him      neither more nor less who authorised you to give a sanction to      documents or to take it away who authorised you to interpret the      intentions of the dead       but then father bouin the old box       who authorised you to decide whether the will was thrown away on      purpose or mislaid by accident has it never happened to you to do      such a thing and to find at the bottom of a chest some valuable      paper that you had tossed there inadvertently       but father bouin the faroff date of the paper and its      injustice       who authorised you to pronounce on the justice or injustice of the      document and to regard the bequest as an unlawful gift rather      than as a restitution or any other lawful act which you may choose      to imagine       but these poor kinsfolk here on the spot and that mere      collateral distant and wealthy       who authorised you to weigh in your balance what the dead man owed      to his distant relations whom you dont know       but father bouin that pile of letters from the legatee which      the departed never even took the trouble to open       there is neither old box nor date nor letters nor father bouin      nor if nor but in the case no one has any right to infringe the      laws to enter into the intention of the dead or to dispose of      other peoples property if providence has resolved to chastise      either the heir or the legatee or the testatorwe cannot tell      whichby the accidental preservation of the will the will must      remain1      1 oeuv v 289  diderot the younger declaims against all this with his usual vehemence while his brother the abbé defends the supremacy of the law on the proper ground that to evade or defy it in any given case is to open the door to the sophistries of all the knaves in the universe at this point a journeyman of the neighbourhood comes in with a new case of conscience his wife has died after twenty years of sickness in these twenty years the cost of her illness has consumed all that he would otherwise have saved for the end of his days but as it happens the marriage portion that she brought him has lain untouched by law this ought to go to her family equity however seems to justify him in keeping what he might have spent if he had chosen he consults the party round the fire one bids him keep the money another forbids him a third thinks it fair for him to repay himself the cost of his wifes illness diderots father cries out that since on his own confession the detention of the inheritance has brought him no comfort he had better surrender it as speedily as possible and eat drink sleep work and make himself happy so       not i cried the journeyman abruptly i shall be off to      geneva       and dost thou think to leave remorse behind       i cant tell but to geneva i go       go where thou wilt there wilt thou find thy conscience       the hatter went away his odd answer became the subject of our      talk we agreed that perhaps distance of place and time had the      effect of weakening all the feelings more or less and stifling the      voice of conscience even in cases of downright crime the assassin      transported to the shores of china is too far off to perceive the      corpse that he has left bleeding on the banks of the seine       remorse springs perhaps less from horror of self than from fear of      others less from shame for the deed than from the blame and      punishment that would attend its discovery and what clandestine      criminal is tranquil enough in his obscurity not to dread the      treachery of some unforeseen circumstance or the indiscretion of      some thoughtless word what certainty can he have that he will not      disclose his secret in the delirium of fever or in dreams people      will understand him if they are on the scene of the action but      those about him in china will have no key to his words2      2 v 295 296  two other cases come up does the husband or wife who is the first to break the marriage vow restore liberty to the other diderot answered affirmatively the second case arose from a story that the abbé had been reading a certain honest cobbler of messina saw his country overrun by lawlessness each day was marked by a crime notorious assassins braved the public exasperation parents saw their daughters violated the industrious saw the fruits of their toil ravished from them by the monopolist or the fraudulent taxgatherer the judges were bribed the innocent were afflicted the guilty escaped unharmed the cobbler meditating on these enormities devised a plan of vengeance he established a secret court of justice in his shop he heard the evidence gave a verdict pronounced sentence and went out into the street with his gun under his cloak to execute it justice done he regained his stall rejoicing as though he had slain a rabid dog when some fifty criminals had thus met their doom the viceroy offered a reward of two thousand crowns for information of the slayer and swore on the altar that he should have full pardon if he gave himself up the cobbler presented himself and spoke thus i have done what was your duty tis i who condemned and put to death the miscreants that you ought to have punished behold the proofs of their crimes there you will see the judicial process which i observed i was tempted to begin with yourself but i respected in your person the august master whom you represent my life is in your hands dispose of it as you think right well cried the abbé the cobbler in spite of all his fine zeal for justice was simply a murderer diderot protested his father decided that the abbé was right and that the cobbler was an assassin  nothing short of a transcript of the whole would convey a right idea of the dramatic ease of this delightful dialogueits variety of illustration with unity of topic the naturalness of movement the pleasant lightness of touch at its close the old man calls for his nightcap diderot embraces him and in bidding him goodnight whispers in his ear strictly speaking father there are no laws for the sage all being open to exception tis for him to judge the cases in which we ought to submit to them or to throw them over i should not be sorry his father answers if there were in the town one or two citizens like thee but nothing would induce me to live there if they all thought in that way the conclusion is just and diderot might have verified it by the state of the higher society of his country at that very moment one cause of the moral corruption of france in the closing years of the old régime was undoubtedly the lax and shifting interpretations by which the jesuit directors had softened the rigour of general moral principles many generations must necessarily elapse before a habit of loosely superseding principles in individual cases produces widespread demoralisation but the result is inevitable sooner or later and this just in proportion as the principles are sound the casuists practically constructed a system for making the observance alike of the positive law and of the accepted ethical maxims flexible and conditional the diderot of the present dialogue takes the same attitude but has the grace to leave the demonstration of its impropriety to his wise and benevolent sire                                       ii we shall presently see that diderot did not shrink from applying a vigorous doubt to some of the most solidly established principles of modern society let us meanwhile in passing notice that short piece of plangent irony which did not appear until many years after his death 1798 and which he or some one else entitled on the inconsistency of the public judgment on our private actions this too is in the form of dialogue but the argument of the story is in its pith as follows desroches first an abbé then a lawyer lastly a soldier persuades a rich and handsome widow to marry him she is aware of his previous gallantries and warns him in very dramatic style before a solemn gathering of friends that if he once wounds her by an infidelity she will shut herself up and speedily die of grief he makes such vows as most men would make under such circumstances he presses her hands ardently to his lips bedews them with his tears and moves the whole company to sympathy with his own agitation the scene is absurd enough or seems so to us dull people of phlegmatic habit yet diderot even for us redeems it by the fine remark tis the effect of what is good and virtuous to leave a large assembly with only one thought and one soul how all respect one another love one another in such moments for instance how beautiful humanity is at the play ah why must we part so quickly men are so good so happy when what is worthy unites all their suffrages melts them makes them one3 for some time all went well and our pair were the happiest of men and women then various assaults were made on the faithfulness of desroches he resisted them until in endeavouring to serve a friend he was forced to sue for the goodwill of a lady with whom in his unregenerate days he had had passages of gallantry the old intrigue was renewed letters of damning proof fell by ill hazard into his wifes hands she reassembled her friends denounced the culprit and forthwith carried away her child to seek shelter with her aged mother desrochess fervent remorse was unheeded his letters were sent back unopened he was denied the door presently the aged mother died then the infant lastly the wife herself now says diderot to his interlocutor i pray you to turn your eyes to the publicthat imbecile crowd that pronounces judgment on us that disposes of our honour that lifts us to the clouds or trails us through the mud opinion passed through every phase about desroches the shifting event is ever their one measure of praise and blame a fault which nobody thought more than venial became gradually aggravated in their eyes by a succession of incidents which it was impossible for desroches either to foresee or to prevent at first opinion was on his side and his wife was thought to have carried things with too high a hand then after she had fallen ill and her child had died and her aged mother had passed away in the fulness of years he began to be held answerable for all this sea of troubles why had not desroches written to his wife beset her doors waylaid her as she went to church he had as matter of fact done all these things but the public did not know it the important thing is not to know but to talk then as it befell his wifes brother took desrochess place in his regiment there he was killed more exclamations as to the misfortune of being connected with such a man how was desroches responsible for the death of his motherinlaw already well stricken in years how could he foresee that a hostile ball would pierce his brotherinlaw in his first campaign but his wife he must be a barbarian a monster who had gradually pressed a poniard into the bosom of a divine woman his wife his benefactress and then left her to die without showing the least sign of interest or feeling and all this cries diderot for not knowing what was concealed from him and what was unknown and unsuspected even by those who were daily about her what presumption what bad logic what incoherence what unjustified veering and vacillation in all these public verdicts from beginning to end      3 oeuv v 342  yet we feel that diderots impetuous taunts fail to press to the root of the matter diderot excels in opening a subject he places it in a new light he furnishes telling concrete illustrations he thoroughly disturbs and unsettles the medium of conventional association in which it has become fixed but he does not leave the question readjusted his mind was not of that quality which is slow to complain where it cannot explain which does not quit a discussion without a calm and orderly review of the conditions that underlie the latest exhibition of human folly shortsightedness or injustice the public condemnation of desroches for consequences that were entirely strange to his one offence was indefensible on grounds of strict logic but then men have imagination as well as reason imagination is stronger than reason with most of them their imagination was touched by the series of disasters that followed madame desrochess abandonment of her husband they admit no plea of remoteness of damage such as law courts allow in a way that was loose and unreasonable but still easily intelligible the husband became associated with a sequel for which he was not really answerable if the worlds conduct in such cases were accurately expressed it would perhaps be found that people have really no intention to pronounce a judicial sentence they only mean that an individuals associations have become disagreeable and doubtful to them they may think proper to justify the grievously meagre definition of homo as animal rationale by varnishing their distaste with reasons the true reason is that the presence of a desroches disturbs their comfort by recalling questionable and disorderly circumstances that this selfish and rough method many a time inflicts horrible cruelty is too certain and those to whom the idea of conduct is serious and deepreaching will not fall into it a sensible man is aware of the difficulty of pronouncing wisely upon the conduct of others especially where it turns upon the intricate and unknowable relations between a man and a woman he will not however on that account break down the permanent safeguards for the sake of leniency in a given case a great enemy to indifference a great friend to indulgence said turgot of himself and perhaps it is what we should all do well to be able to say of ourselves  again though these ironical exposures of the fatuity and recklessness and inconsistency of popular verdicts are wholesome enough in their degree in all societies yet it has been and still remains a defect of some of the greatest french writers to expect a fruit from such performances which they can never bear in the long run a great body of men and women is improved less by general outcry against its collective characteristics than by the inculcation of broader views higher motives and sounder habits of judgment in such a form as touches each man and woman individually it is better to awaken in the individual a sense of responsibility for his own character than to do anything either by magnificent dithyrambs or penetrating satire to dispose him to lay the blame on society society is after all only a name for other people an instructive contrast might be drawn between the method of french writers of genius from diderot down to that mighty master of our own day victor hugo in pouring fulminant denunciations upon society and the other method of our best english writers from milton down to mill in impressing new ideas on the individual and exacting a vigorous personal answer to the moral or spiritual call  one other remark may be worth making it is characteristic of the immense sociability of the eighteenth century that when he saw desroches sitting alone in the public room receiving no answers to his questions never addressed by any of those around him avoided coldly eyed and morally proscribed diderot never thought of applying the artificial consolation of the stoic he never dreamed of urging that expulsion from the society of friends was not a hardship a true punishment and a genuine evil no one knew better than diderot that a man should train himself to face the disapprobation of the world with steadfast brow and unflinching gaze but he knew also that this is only done at great cost and is only worth doing for clear and farreaching objects life was real to diderot not in the modern canting sense of earnestness and making a hundred thousand pounds but in the sense of being an agitated scene of living passion interest sympathy struggle delight and woe in which the graceful ascetic commonplaces of the writer and the preacher barely touch the actual conditions of human experience or go near to softening the smart of chagrin failure mistake and sense of wrong any more than the sweet music of the birds poised in air over a field of battle can still the rage and horror of the plain beneath as was said by a good man who certainly did not fail to try the experimentspeciosa quidem ista sunt oblitaque rhetoricæ et musicæ melle dulcedinis tum tantum cum audiuntur oblectant sed miseris malorum altior sensus est itaque quum hæc auribus insonare desierint insitus animum moeror prægravat4      4 boethius                                       iii we may close this chapter with a short account of the supplement to bougainvilles travels which was composed in 1772 and published twentyfour years later the second title is a dialogue on the disadvantage of attaching moral ideas to certain physical actions which do not really comport with them those who believe that the ruling system of notions about marriage represents the last word that is to be said as to the relations between men and women will turn away from diderots dialogue with some impatience those on the contrary who hold that the present system is no more immovably fixed in ultimate laws of human nature no more final no more unimprovable no more sacred and no more indisputably successful than any other set of social arrangements and the corresponding moral ideas will find something to interest them though as it seems to the present writer very little to instruct bougainville was the first frenchman who sailed round the world he did in 176669 what captain cook did about the same time the narrative of his expedition appeared in 1771 and the picture of life among the primitive people of the southern seas touched diderot almost as deeply as if he had been rousseau as one says so often in this history of the intellectual preparation for the revolution the corruption and artificiality of parisian society had the effect of colouring the world of primitive society with the very hues of paradise diderot was more free from this besetting weakness than any of his contemporaries he never fell into voltaires fancy that china is a land of philosophers5 but he did not look very critically into the real conditions of life in the more rudimentary stages of development and for the moment he committed the sociological anachronism of making the poor people of otaheite into wise and benevolent patriots and sound reasoners the literary merit of the dialogue is at least as striking as in any of the pieces of which we have already spoken the realism of the scenes between the shipchaplain and his friendly savage with too kindly wife and daughters as kindly as either is full of sweetness simplicity and a sort of pathos a subject which easily takes on an air of grossness and which diderot sometimes handled very grossly indeed is introduced with an idyllic grace that to the pure will hardly be other than pure we have of course always to remember that diderot is an author for grownup people as are the authors of the bible or any other book that deals with more than the surface of human experience our english practice of excluding from literature subjects and references that are unfit for boys and girls has something to recommend it but it undeniably leads to a certain narrowness and thinness and to some most nauseous hypocrisy all subjects are evidently not to be discussed by all and one result in our case is that some of the most important subjects in the world receive no discussion whatever      5 see however above vol i p 274  the position which diderot takes up in the present dialogue may be inferred from the following extract the shipchaplain has been explaining to the astonished otaheitan the european usage of strict monogamy as the arrangement enjoined upon man by the creator of the universe and vigilantly guarded by the priest and the magistrate to which orou thus       these singular precepts i find opposed to nature and contrary to      reason they are contrary to nature because they suppose that a      being who thinks feels and is free can be the property of a      creature like itself dost thou not see that in thy land they have      confounded the thing that has neither sensibility nor thought nor      desire nor will that one leaves one takes one keeps one      exchanges without its suffering or complainingwith a thing that      is neither exchanged nor acquired that has freedom will desire      that may give or may refuse itself for the moment that complains      and suffers and that cannot become a mere article of commerce      unless you forget its character and do violence to nature and they      are contrary to the general law of things can anything seem more      senseless to thee than a precept which proscribes the law of change      that is within us and which commands a constancy that is      impossible and that violates the liberty of the male and the      female by chaining them together in perpetuityanything more      senseless than are oaths of immutability taken by two creatures of      flesh in the face of a sky that is not an instant the same under      vaults that threaten ruin at the base of a rock crumbling to      dust at the foot of a tree that is splitting asunder you may      command what is opposed to nature but you will not be obeyed you      will multiply evildoers and the unhappy by fear by punishment      and by remorse you will deprave mens consciences you will      corrupt their minds they will have lost the polar star of their      pathway 225  after this declamation he proceeds to put some practical questions to the embarrassed chaplain are young men in france always continent and wives always true and husbands never libertines the chaplains answers disclose the truth to the keeneyed orou       what a monstrous tissue is this that thou art unfolding to me and      even now thou dost not tell me all for as soon as men allow      themselves to dispose at their own will of the ideas of what is      just and unjust to take away or to impose an arbitrary character      on things to unite to actions or to separate from them the good      and the evil with no counsellor save capricethen come blame      accusation suspicion tyranny envy jealousy deception chagrin      concealment dissimulation espionage surprise lies daughters      deceive their parents wives their husbands husbands their wives      young women i dont doubt will smother their children suspicious      fathers will despise and neglect their children mothers will leave      them to the mercy of accident and crime and debauchery will show      themselves in every guise i know all that as if i had lived among      you it is so because it must be so and that society of thine in      spite of thy chief who vaunts its fine order is nothing but a      collection of hypocrites who secretly trample the laws under foot      or of unfortunate wretches who make themselves the instrument of      their own punishment by submitting to these laws or of imbeciles      in whom prejudice has absolutely stifled the voice of nature      227  the chaplain has the presence of mind to fall back upon the radical difficulty of all such solutions of the problem of family union as were practised in otaheite or were urged by philosophers in paris or are timidly suggested in our own times in the drollsounding form of marriages for terms of years with option of renewal that difficulty is the disposal of the children which are the fruit of such unions orou rejoins to this argument by a very eloquent account how valuable how sought after how prized is the woman who has her quiver full of them his contempt for the condition of europe grows more intense as he learns that the birth of a child among the bulk of the people of the west is rather a sorrow a perplexity a hardship than a delight and ground of congratulation  the reader sees by this time that in the present dialogue diderot is really criticising the most fundamental and complex arrangement of our actual western society from the point of view of an arbitrary and entirely fanciful naturalism rousseau never wrote anything more picturesque nor anything more dangerous nor more anarchic and superficially considered it is true that diderot at the close of the discussion is careful to assert that while we denounce senseless laws it is our duty to obey them until we have procured their reform he who of his own private authority infringes a bad law authorises every one else to infringe good laws there are fewer inconveniences in being mad with the mad than in being wise by oneself let us say to ourselves let us never cease to cry aloud that people attach shame chastisement and infamy to acts that in themselves are innocent but let us abstain from committing them because shame punishment and infamy are the greatest of evils and we hear diderots sincerest accents when he says above all one must be honest and true to a scruple with the fragile beings who cannot yield to our pleasures without renouncing the most precious advantages of society6      6 oeuv ii 249  this however does not make the philosophical quality of the discussion any more satisfactory whatever changes may ultimately come about in the relations between men and women we may at least be sure that such changes will be in a direction even still further away than the present conditions of marriage from anything like the naturalism of diderot and the eighteenthcentury school even ifwhat does not at present seem at all likely to happenthe idea of the family and the associated idea of private property should eventually be replaced by that form of communism which is to be seen at oneida creek still the discipline of the appetites and affections of sex will necessarily on such a system be not less but far more rigorous to nature than it is under prevailing western institutions7 orou would have been a thousand times more unhappy among the perfectionists under mr noyes than in paris or london we cannot pretend here to discuss the large group of momentous questions involved but we may make a short remark or two one reason why the movement if progressive must be in the direction of greater subordination of appetite is that all experience proves the position and moral worth of women taking society as a whole to be in proportion to the selfcontrol of their male companions nobody doubts that man is instinctively polygamous but the dignity and selfrespect and consequently the whole moral cultivation of women depends on the suppression of this vagrant instinct and there is no more important chapter in the history of civilisation than the record of the steps by which its violence has been gradually reduced      7 see nordhoffs communistic societies of the united states     london murray 1875 pp 259293 this grave and most instructive     book shows how modifiable are some of those facts of existing human     character which are vulgarly deemed to be ultimate and ineradicable  there is another side we admit the home of which sentimental philosophers love to talk is too often a ghastly failure the conjugal union so tender and elevating in its ideal is in more cases than we usually care to recognise the cruellest of bonds to the woman the most harassing deadening spiritbreaking of all possible influences to the man the purity of the family so lovely and dear as it is has still only been secured hitherto by retaining a vast and dolorous host of female outcasts when catholicism is praised for the additions which it has made to the dignity of womanhood and the family we have to set against that gain the frightful growth of this caste of poor creatures upon whose heads as upon the scapegoat of the hebrew ordinance we put all the iniquities of the children of the house and all their transgressions in all their sins and then banish them with maledictions into the foul outer wilderness and the land not inhabited  on this side there is much wholesome truth to be told in the midst of the complacent social cant with which we are flooded but diderot does not help us nothing can possibly be gained by reducing the attraction of the sexes to its purely physical elements and stripping it of all the moral associations which have gradually clustered round it and acquired such force as in many cases among the highest types of mankind to reduce the physical factor to a secondary place such a return to the nakedness of the brute must be retrograde and diderot as it happened was the writer who before all others habitually exalted the delightful and consolatory sentiment of the family nobody felt more strongly the worth of domestic ties when faithfully cherished it can only have been in a moment of elated paradox that he made one of the interlocutors in the dialogue on bougainville pronounce constancy the poor vanity of two children who do not know themselves and who are blinded by the intoxication of a moment to the instability of all that surrounds them and fidelity the obstinacy and the punishment of a good man and a good woman and jealousy the passion of a miser the unjust sentiment of man the consequence of our false manners and of a right of property extending over a feeling willing thinking free creature8      8 oeuv ii 243  it is a curious example of the blindness which reaction against excess of ascetic doctrine bred in the eighteenth century that diderot should have failed to see that such sophisms as these are wholly destructive of that order and domestic piety to whose beauty he was always so keenly alive it is curious too that he should have failed to recognise that the erection of constancy into a virtue would have been impossible if it had not answered first to some inner want of human character at its best and second to some condition of fitness in society at its best  how is it says one of the interlocutors that the strongest the sweetest the most innocent of pleasures is become the most fruitful source of depravation and misfortune this is indeed a question well worth asking and it is comforting after the anarchy of the earlier part of the dialogue to find so comparatively sensible a line of argument taken in answer as the following this evil result has been brought about he says by the tyranny of man who has converted the possession of woman into a property by manners and usages that have overburdened the conjugal union with superfluous conditions by the civil laws that have subjected marriage to an infinity of formalities by religious institutions that have attached the name of vices and virtues to actions that are not susceptible of morality if this means that human happiness will be increased by making the condition of the wife more independent in respect of property by treating in public opinion separation between husband and wife as a transaction in itself perfectly natural and blameless and often not only laudable but a duty and by abolishing that barbarous iniquity and abomination called restitution of conjugal rights then the speaker points to what has been justly described as the next great step in the improvement of society if it means that we do wrong to invest with the most marked serious and unmistakable formality an act that brings human beings into existence with uncounted results both to such beings themselves and to others who are equally irresponsible for their appearance in the world then the position is recklessly immoral and it is moreover wholly repugnant to diderots own better mind     chapter ii  romance   the president de brosses on a visit to paris in 1754 was anxious to make the acquaintance of that furious metaphysical head as he styled diderot buffon introduced him he is a good fellow said the president very pleasant very amiable a great philosopher a strong reasoner but given to perpetual digressions he made twentyfive digressions yesterday in my room between nine oclock and one oclock and so it is that a critic who has undertaken to give an account of diderot finds himself advancing from digression to digression through a chain of all the subjects that are under the sun the same diderot however is present amid them all and behind each of them the same fresh enthusiasm the same expansive sympathy the same large hospitality of spirit always too the same habitual reference of ideas systems artistic forms to the complex realities of life and to these realities as they figured to sympathetic emotions  it was inevitable that diderot should make an idol of the author of clarissa harlowe the spirit of reaction against the artificiality of the pseudoclassic drama which drove him to feel the way to a drama of real life in the middle class made him exult in the romance of ordinary private life which was invented by richardson it was no mere accident that the modern novel had its origin in england but the result of general social causes the modern novel essentially depends on the interest of the private life of ordinary men and women but this interest was only possible on condition that the feudal and aristocratic spirit had received its deathblow and it was only in england that such a revolution had taken place even partially it was only in england as yet that the middle class had conquered a position of consideration equality and independence only in england as has been said had every man the power of making the best of his own personality and arranging his own destiny according to his private goodwill and pleasure9 the greatest of richardsons successors in the history of english fiction adds to this explanation those says sir walter scott who with patience had studied rant and bombast in the folios of scuderi could not readily tire of nature sense and genius in the octavos of richardson the old french romances in which europe had found a dreary amusement were stories of princes and princesses it was to be expected that the first country where princes and princesses were shorn of divinity and made creatures of an act of parliament would also be the country where imagination would be most likely to seek for serious passion realistic interest and all the material for pathos and tragedy in the private lives of common individuals it is true that marivaux the author of marianne was of the school of richardson before richardson wrote a word but this was an almost isolated appearance and not the beginning of a movement richardsons popularity stamped the opening of a new epoch it was the landmark of a great social no less than a great literary transition when all england went mad with enthusiasm over the trials the virtue the triumph of a rustic ladiesmaid      9 hettners literaturgeschichte i 462  in the literary circles of france the enthusiasm for richardson was quite as great as it was in england there it was one of the signs of the certain approach of that transformation which had already taken place in england the transformation from feudalism to industrial democracy it may sound a paradox to say that a passion for richardson was a symbol that a man was truly possessed by the spirit of political revolution yet it is true voltaire was a revolter against superstition and the tyranny of the church but he never threw off the monarchic traditions of his younger days he was always a friend of great nobles he had no eye and no inclination for social overthrow and this is what voltaire said of clarissa harlowe it is cruel for a man like me to read nine whole volumes in which you find nothing at all i saideven if all these people were my relations and friends i could take no interest in them i can see nothing in the writer but a clever man who knows the curiosity of the human race and is always promising something from volume to volume in order to go on selling them in the same way and for exactly the same reasons he could never understand the enthusiasm for the new heloïsa the greatest of the romances that were directly modelled on richardson he had no vision for the strange social aspirations that were silently haunting the inner mind of his contemporaries of these aspirations in all their depth and significance diderot was the halfconscious oracle and unaccepted prophet it was not deliberate philosophical calculation that made him so but the spontaneous impulse of his own genius and temperament he was no conscious political destroyer but his soul was open to all those voices of sentiment to all those ideals of domestic life to those primary forces of natural affection which were so urgently pressing asunder the old feudal bonds and so swiftly ripening a vast social crisis thus his enthusiasm for richardson was at its root another side of that love of the life of peaceful industry which gave one of its noblest characteristics to the encyclopædia  to this enthusiasm diderot gave voice in half a dozen pages which are counted among his masterpieces richardson died in 1761 and diderot flung off a commemorative piece which is without any order and connection but this makes it more an echo as he called it of the tumult of his own heart here indeed he merits gautiers laudatory phrase and is as flamboyant as one could desire to understand the march of feeling in french literature and to measure the growth and expansion in criticism we need only compare diderots eloge on richardson with fontenelles éloge on dangeau or leibnitz the exaggerations of phrase the violences of feeling the broken apostrophes give to diderots éloge an unpleasant tone of declamation some of us may still prefer the moderation the subtlety the nice discrimination of the critics of another school still it would be a sign of narrowness and shortsight not to discern the sincerity the movement the real meaning underneath all that profusion of glaring colour       o richardson richardson unique among men in my eyes thou shalt      be my favourite all my life long if i am hard driven by pressing      need if my friend is overtaken by want if the mediocrity of my      fortune is not enough to give my children what is necessary for      their education i will sell my books but thou shalt remain to me      thou shalt remain on the same shelf with moses homer euripides      sophocles       o richardson i make bold to say that the truest history is full      of falsehoods and that your romance is full of truths history      paints a few individuals you paint the human race history sets      down to its few individuals what they have neither said nor done      whatever you set down to man he has both said and done no i      say that history is often a bad novel and the novel as you have      handled it is good history o painter of nature tis you who are      never false       you accuse richardson of being long you must have forgotten how      much trouble pains busy movement it costs to bring the smallest      undertaking to a good issueto end a suit to settle a marriage      to bring about a reconciliation think of these details what you      please but for me they will be full of interest if they are only      true if they bring out the passions if they display character      they are common you say it is all what one sees every day you      are mistaken tis what passes every day before your eyes and what      you never see  in richardsons work he says as in the world men are divided into two classes those who enjoy and those who suffer and it is always to the latter that he draws the mind of the reader it is due to richardson he cries if i have loved my fellowcreatures better and loved my duties better if i have never felt anything but pity for the bad if i have conceived a deeper compassion for the unfortunate more veneration for the good more circumspection in the use of present things more indifference about future things more contempt for life more love for virtue the works of richardson are his touchstone those who do not love them stand judged and condemned in his eyes yet in the midst of this tumult of admiration diderot admits that the number of readers who will feel all their value can never be great it requires too severe a taste and then the variety of events is such relations are so multiplied the management of them is so complicated there are so many things arranged so many personages o richardson if thou hast not enjoyed in thy lifetime all the reputation of thy deserts how great wilt thou be to our grandchildren when they see thee from the distance at which we now view homer then who will there be with daring enough to strike out a line of thy sublime work10 yet of the very moderate number of living persons who have ever read clarissa harlowe it would be safe to say that the large majority have read it in a certain abridgment in three volumes which appeared some years ago      10 the eloge de richardson is in diderots works v 212227  doctor johnson made the answer of true criticism to some one who complained to him that richardson is tedious why sir he said if you were to read richardson for the story your impatience would be so much frighted that you would hang yourself but you must read him for the sentiment and consider the story only as giving occasion to the sentiment and this is just what diderot and the paris of the middle of the eighteenth century were eager to do it was the sentiment that touched and delighted them in clarissa just as it was the sentiment that made the fortune of the great romance in their own tongue which was inspired by clarissa and yet was so different from clarissa rousseau threw into the new heloïsa a glow of passion of which the london printer was incapable and he added a beauty of external landscape and a strong feeling for the objects and movement of wild natural scenery that are very different indeed from the atmosphere of the cedarparlour and the flask walk at hampstead but the sentiment the adoration of the belle âme is the same and it was the belle âme that fascinated that curious society where rude logic and a stern antireligious dialectic went handinhand with the most tender and exalted sensibility11 it is singular that diderot says nothing about rousseaus famous romance and we can only suppose that his silence arose from his contempt for the private perversity and seeming insincerity of the author      11 the belle âme was the origin of the schöne seele that has     played such a part in german literature and life the reader will     find a history of the expression in an appendix to dr erich     schmidts study richardson rousseau und goethe jena 1875  diderot made one attempt of his own in which we may notice the influence of the minute realism and the tearful pathos of richardson the nun was not given to the world until 1796 when its author had been twelve years in his grave since then it has been reproduced in countless editions in france and belgium and has been translated into english spanish and german it fell in with certain passionate movements of the popular mind against some antisocial practices of the catholic church perhaps it is not unjust to suppose that the horrible picture of the depraved abbess has had some share in attracting a public  it is thoroughly characteristic of diderots dreamy heedless humour and of the sincerity both of his interest in his work for its own sake and of his indifference to the popular voice that he should have allowed this like so many other pieces to lie in his drawer or at most to circulate clandestinely among three or four of his more intimate friends it was written about 1760 and ingenious historians have made of it a signal for the great crusade against the church in truth as we have seen it was a strictly private performance and could be no signal for a public movement la religieuse was undoubtedly an expression of the strong feeling of the encyclopædic school about celibacy renunciation of the world and the burial of men and women alive in the cloister  the circumstances under which the story was written are worthy of a word or two among the friends of madame depinay grimm and diderot was a certain marquis de croismare he had deserted the circle and retired to his estates in normandy it occurred to one of them that it would be a pleasant stratagem for recalling him to paris to invent a personage who should be shut up in a convent against her will and then to make this personage appeal to the wellknown courage and generosity of the marquis de croismare to rescue her a previous adventure of the marquis suggested the fiction and made its success the more probable diderot composed the letters of the imaginary nun and the conspirators had the satisfaction of making merry at supper over the letters which the loyal and unsuspecting marquis sent in reply at length the marquiss interest became so eager that they resolved that the best way of ending his torment was to make the nun die when the marquis de croismare returned to paris the plot was confessed the victim of the mystification laughed at the joke and the friendship of the party seemed to be strengthened by their common sorrow for the woes of the dead sister but diderot had been taken in his own trap his imagination which he had set to work in jest was caught by the figure and the situation one day while he was busy about the tale a friend paid him a visit and found him plunged in grief and his face bathed in tears what in the world can be the matter with you cried the friend what the matter answered diderot in a broken voice i am filled with misery by a story that i am writing this capacity of thinking of imaginary personages as if they were friends living in the next street had been stirred by richardson his acquaintances would sometimes notice anxiety and consternation on his countenance and would ask him if anything had befallen his health his friends his family his fortune o my friends he would reply pamela clarissa grandison  it was in their world not in the rue taranne that he really lived when these brooding moods overtook him and while he was writing the nun sister susan and sister theresa the lady superior of longchamp and the libertine superior of saint eutropius were as alive to him as clarissa was alive to the score of correspondents who begged richardson to spare her honour not to let her die to make lovelace marry her or by no means to allow lovelace to marry her  the nun professes to be the story of a young lady whose family have thrust her into a convent and her narrative with an energy and reality that diderot hardly ever surpassed presents the odious sides of monastic life and the various types of superstition tyranny and corruption that monastic life engenders yet diderot had far too much genius to be tempted into the exaggerations of more vulgar assailants of monkeries and nunneries he may have begun his work with the purpose of attacking a mischievous and superstitious system that mutilates human life but he certainly continued it because he became interested in his creations diderot was a social destroyer by accident but in intention he was a truly scientific moralist penetrated by the spirit of observation and experiment he shrunk from no excess in dissection and found nothing in human pathology too repulsive for examination yet the nun has none of the artificial violences of the modern french school which loves moral disease for its own sake the action is all very possible and the types are all sufficiently human and probable the close realistic touches which flowed from the intensity of the writers illusion naturally convey a certain degree of the same illusion to the mind of the reader  existence as it goes on in these strange hives is caught with what one knows to be true fidelity its dulness its littleness its goings and comings its spite its reduction of the spiritual

all is undoubtedly the most disagreeable the most atrocious it is if you will the most infamous we can only endure it as we endure to traverse the ward for epileptics in an hospital for the insane it is appalling it fills you with horror it haunts you for days and nights it leaves a kind of stain on the memory it is a possibility of character of which the healthy the pure the unthinking have never dreamed such a portrait is not art that is true but it is science and that delivers the critic from the necessity of searching his vocabulary for the cheap superlatives of moral censure whether it be art or science however men cannot but ask themselves how diderot came to think it worth while to execute so painful a study the only answer is that the irregularities of human naturethose more shameful parts of it which in some characters survive the generations of social pressure that have crushed them down in civilised communitieshad an irresistible attraction for the curiosity of his genius the whole story is full of power it abounds in phrases that have the stamp of genius and suppressed vehemence lends to it strength but it is fatally wanting in the elements of tenderness beauty and sympathy if we chance to take it up for a second or for a tenth time it infallibly holds us but nobody seeks to return to it of his own will and it holds us under protest  if richardson created one school in france sterne created another the author of tristram shandy was himself only a follower of one of the greatest of french originals and a follower at a long distance even those who have the keenest relish for our goodhumoured civil nonsensical shandean kind of a book ought to admit how far it falls behind rabelais in exuberance force richness of extravagance breadth of colour fulness of blood they may claim however for sterne what in comparison with these great elements are the minor qualities of simplicity tenderness precision and finesse these are the qualities that delighted the french taste in 1762 sterne visited paris and found tristram shandy almost as well known there as in london and he instantly had dinners and suppers for a fortnight on his hands among them were dinners and suppers at holbachs where he made the acquaintance of diderot and where perhaps he made the discovery that notwithstanding the french make such a pother about the word sentiment they have no precise idea attached to it13 the sentimental journey appeared in 1768 and was instantly pronounced by the critics in both countries to be inimitable it is no wonder that a performance of such delicacy of literary expression united with so much goodnature such easy humane amiable feeling went to the hearts of the french of the eighteenth century my design in it said sterne was to teach us to love the world and our fellowcreatures better than we do so it runs most upon those gentle passions and affections which aid so much to it14 this exactly fell in with the reigning parisian modes and with such sentiment as that of diderot most of all there were several french imitations of the sentimental journey15 but the only one that has survived in popular esteem if indeed this can be said to have survived is diderots jacques le fataliste      13 sternes letters may 23 1765      14 nov 12 1767      15 eg le voyageur sentimental of vernes grimm corr lit     xiii 227  it seems to have been composed about the time 1773 of diderots journey to holland and st petersburg of which we shall have more to say in a later chapter its history is almost as singular as the history of rameaus nephew a contemporary speaks of a score of copies as existing in different parts of germany and we may conjecture that they found their way there from friends whom diderot made in holland and some of them were no doubt sent by grimm to his subscribers the first fragment of it that saw the light in print was in a translation that schiller made of its most striking episode in the year 1785 this is another illustration of the eagerness of the best minds of germany to possess and diffuse the most original products of french intelligence and hardihood diderot as we have said stands in the front rank along with rousseau along also with richardson sterne and goldsmith among those who in germany kindled the glow of sentimentalism both in its good and its bad forms it was in germany that the first complete version of the whole of jacques le fataliste appeared in 1792 not until four years later did the french obtain an original transcript this they owed to the generosity of prince henri of prussia the brother of frederick the great he presented it to the institute  there is going about here wrote goethe in 1780 while diderot was still alive a manuscript of diderots called jacques le fataliste et son maître and it is really firstratea very fine and exquisite meal prepared and dished up with great skill as if for the palate of some singular idol i set myself in the place of this bel and in six uninterrupted hours swallowed all the courses in the order and according to the intentions of this excellent cook and maître dhôtel16 he goes on to say that when other people came to read it some preferred one story and some another on the whole one is strongly inclined to judge that few modern readers will equal goethes unsparing appetite the reader sighs in thinking of the brilliant and unflagging wit the verve the wicked graces of candide and we long for the ease and simplicity and light stroke of the sentimental journey diderot has the german heaviness perhaps this is because he had too much conscience and laboured too deeply under the burdensome problems of the world he could not emancipate himself sufficiently from the tumult of his own sympathies at many a page both of jacques le fataliste and of others of his pieces we involuntarily recall the writers own contention that excess of sensibility makes a mediocre actor the same law is emphatically true of the artist diderot never writes as if his spirit were quite freeand perhaps it never was free if we are to enjoy these reckless outbursts of all that is bizarre and grotesque these defiances of all that is sane coherent and rational we must never feel conscious of a limitation or a possibility of stint or check the draught must seem to come from an exhaustless fountain of boisterous laughter irony and caprice perfect fooling is so rare an art that not half a dozen men in literature have really possessed it perhaps only aristophanes rabelais shakespeare candide wonderful as it is has many a stroke of malice and tristram shandy wonderful as that is too is not without tinges of selfconsciousness and neither malice nor selfconsciousness belongs to the greater gods of buffoonery cervantes and molière those great geniuses of finest temper still have none of the reckless buffoonery of such scenes as that between prince henry and the drawer or the mad extravagances of the merry wives still less of the wild topsyturvy of the birds or the peace they have not the note of true pantagruelism most critics again would find in swift a truculence sometimes latent and sometimes flagrant that would deprive him too of his place among these great masters of free and exuberant farce diderot at any rate must rank in the second class among those who have attempted to tread a measure among the whimsical zigzags of unreason the sincere sentimentalist makes a poor reveller      16 quoted in rosenkranz ii 326  we have spoken as many others have done before us of diderot as imitating our two english celebrities and in one sense that is a perfectly true description in jacques le fataliste whole sentences are transcribed in letter and word from tristram shandy yet imitation is hardly the right word for the process by which diderot showed that an author had seized and affected him la religieuse would not have been written if there had been no richardson nor jacques le fataliste if there had been no sterne yet diderots work is not really like the work of either of his celebrated contemporaries they gave him the suggestion of a method and a sentiment to start from and he mused and brooded over it until from among the clouds of his imagination there began to loom figures of his own moving along a path which was also his own this was the history of his adaptation of the natural son from goldoni we can only be sure that nothing became blithe in its passage through his mind he was too much of a preacher to be an effective humorist  there is in jacques le fataliste none of that gift of true creation which produced such figures as trim and my uncle toby and mr shandy jacquess master is a mere lay figure and jacques himself with his monotonous catchword il était écrit làhaut has no real personality he has none of the naturalness that wins us to corporal trim still less has he any touch of the profound humour of the immortal sancho the book is a series of stories rather than sternes subtle amalgam of pathos gentle irony and frank buffoonery and the stories themselves are for the most part either insipid or obscene there is perhaps one exception the longest and the most elaborate of them that which schiller translated is more like one of the modern french novels of a certain kind than any other production of the eighteenth century the adventure of madame de pommeraye and the marquis darcis is a crude foreshadowing of a style that has been perfected by m feydeau and m flaubert the marquis has been the lover of madame de pommeraye he grows weary of her and in time the lady discovers the bitter truth resignation is not among her virtues and in her rage and anguish she devises an elaborate plan of revenge which she carries out with the utmost tenacity and resolution it consists in leading him on by skilful incitements to marry a woman whom he supposes to be an angel of purity but whom madame de pommeraye triumphantly reveals to him on the morning after his marriage as a creature whose past history has been one of notorious depravity this disagreeable story of which balzac would have made a masterpiece is told in an interesting way and the humoristic machinery by which the narrative is managed is less tiresome than usual it is at least a story with meaning purpose and character it is neither a jumble without savour or point nor is it rank and gross like half the pages in the book your jacques diderot supposes some one to say to him is only a tasteless rhapsody of facts some real others imaginary written without grace and distributed without order how can a man of sense and conduct who prides himself on his philosophy find amusement in spinning out tales so obscene as these17 and this is exactly what the modern critic is bound to ask in rabelais there is at least puissant laughter in montaigne when he dwells on such matters there is naïveté in diderot we do not even feel that he is having any enjoyment in his grossnesses they have not even the bad excuse of seeming spontaneous and coming from the fulness of his heart reader he says i amuse myself in writing the follies that you commit your follies make me laugh and my book puts you out of humour to speak frankly to you i find that the more wicked of us two is not myself unhappily he does not convey the impression of amusement to his readers it has no infection in it and if his book puts us out of humour it is not by its satire on mankind but by its essential want of point and want of meaning either moral or æsthetic the few masters of this style have known how to bind the heterogeneous elements together if not by some deeplying purpose at least by some pervading mood of rich and mellow feeling in jacques le fataliste is neither      17 vi 221 222  that men of the stamp of goethe and schiller should have found such a book of delicious feast naturally makes the disparaging critic pause in truth we can easily see how it was like all the rest of diderots work it breaks roughly in upon that starved formalism which had for long lain so heavily both on art and life its hardihood its very license its contempt of conventions its presentation of common people and coarse passions and rough lives all made it a dissolvent of the thin dry and frigid rules which tyrannised over the world and interposed between the artist or the thinker and the real existence of man on the earth when we think of what european literature was it ceases to be wonderful that goethe should have been unable for six whole hours to tear himself away from a book that so few men today save under some compulsion could persuade themselves to read through on great wholesome minds the grossness left no stain and the interest of diderots singularities worked as a stimulus to a happier originality in men of more disciplined endowments and let us add of more poetic endowments it is the lack of poetry in jacques that makes its irony so heavy to us we only willingly suffer those to take us down into the depths who can also raise us on the wings of a beautiful fancy even rabelais has his poetic moments as in the picture of cupid selfdisarmed before the industrious serenity of the muses a single lovely image like sternes figure of the recording angel reconciles us to many a miry page but in jacques le fataliste diderot never raises his eye for an instant to the blue æther his ear catches no harmony of awe of hope nor even of a noble despair with a kind of clumsy jubilancy he holds us fast in the ways and language of thick and clogged sense the fatrasie of old france has its place in literature but it can never be restored in ages when a host of moral anxieties have laid siege to mens souls the uncommon is always welcome to the lover of art but it must justify itself jacques has the quality of the uncommon it is a curiously prepared dish as goethe said but it lacks the pinch of salt and the handful of herbs with sharp diffusive flavour     chapter iii  art   in 1759 diderot wrote for grimm the first of his criticisms on the exhibition of paintings in the salon at the beginning of the reign of lewis xv these exhibitions took place every year as they take place now but from 1751 onwards they were only held once in two years diderot has left his notes on every salon from 1759 to 1781 with the exception of that of 1773 when he was travelling in holland and russia  we have already seen how grimm made diderot work for him the nine salons are one of the results of this willing bondage and they are perhaps the only part of diderots works that has enjoyed a certain measure of general popularity mr carlyle describes them with emphatic enthusiasm what with their unrivalled clearness painting the picture over again for us so that we too see it and can judge it what with their sunny fervour inventiveness real artistic genius which wants nothing but a hand they are with some few exceptions in the german tongue the only pictorial criticisms we know of worth reading18 i only love painting in poetry madame necker said to diderot and it is into poetry that you have found out the secret of rendering the works of our modern painters even the commonest of them it would be a truly imperial luxury wrote a w schlegel to get a collection of pictures described for oneself by diderot      18 essays iv 303 ed 1869  there is a freshness a vivacity a zeal a sincerity a brightness of interest in his subject which are perhaps unique in the whole history of criticism he flings himself into the task with the perfection of natural abandonment to a joyous and delightful subject his whole personality is engaged in a work that has all the air of being overflowing pleasure and his pleasure is contagious his criticism awakens the imagination of the reader not only do we see the picture we hear diderots own voice in ecstasies of praise and storms of boisterous wrath there is such mass in his criticism so little of the mincing and niggling of the small virtuoso in facility of expression in animation in fecundity of mood in fine improvisation these pieces are truly incomparable there is such an impetus animi et quædam artis libido some of the charm and freedom may be due to the important circumstance that he was not writing for the public he was not exposed to the reaction of a large unknown audience upon style hence the absence of all the stiffness of literary pose but the positive conditions of such success lay in the resources of diderots own character  the sceptic the dogmatist the dialectician and the other personages of a heterogeneous philosophy who existed in diderots head all disappear or fall back into a secondary place and he surrenders himself with a curious freedom to such imaginative beauty as contemporary art provided for him diderot was perhaps the one writer of the time who was capable on occasion of rising above the strong prevailing spirit of the time capable of forgetting for a season the passion of the great philosophical and ecclesiastical battle no one save diderot could have been moved by sight of a picture to such an avowal as this       absurd rigorists do not know the effect of external ceremonies on      the people they can never have seen the enthusiasm of the      multitude at the procession of the fête dieu an enthusiasm that      sometimes gains even me i have never seen that long file of      priests in their vestments those young acolytes clad in their      white robes with broad blue sashes engirdling their waists and      casting flowers on the ground before the holy sacrament the crowd      as it goes before and follows after them hushed in religious      silence and so many with their faces bent reverently to the      ground i have never heard that grave and pathetic chant as it is      led by the priests and fervently responded to by an infinity of      voices of men of women of girls of little children without my      inmost heart being stirred and tears coming into my eyes there is      in it something i know not what that is grand solemn sombre      and mournful  thus to find the material of religious reaction in the author of jacques le fataliste and the centre of the atheistic group completes the circle of diderots immense and deeplying versatility and in his account of such a mood we see how he came to be so great and poetical a critic we see the sincerity the alertness the profound mobility with which he was open to impressions of colour of sound of the pathos of human aspiration of the solemn concourses of men  france has long been sovereign in criticism in its literary sense in that department she has simply never had and has not now any serious rival in the profounder historic criticism germany exhibits her one great peculiar and original gift in the criticism of art germany has at least three memorable names but save where history is concerned most modern german æsthetics are so clouded with metaphysical speculation as to leave the obscurity of a very difficult subject as thick as it was before in france the beginnings of artcriticism were literary rather than philosophic and with the exception of cousins worthless eloquence and of the writers whose philosophy cousin dictated and of m taines ingenious paradoxes diderot is the only writer who has deliberately brought a vivid spirit and a philosophic judgment to the discussion of the forms of beauty as things worthy of real elucidation as far back as the time of the english restoration dufresnoy had written in bad latin a poem on the art of painting which had the signal honour of being translated into good english by no less illustrious a master of english than dryden and it was again translated by mason the friend of reynolds and of gray imitations applied to the pictorial art of the immortal epistle to the pisos came thick in france in the eighteenth century19 but these effusions are merely literary and they are very bad literature indeed the abbé dubos published in 1719 a volume of critical reflections on poetry and painting including observations also on the relations of those arts to music lessing is known to have made use of this work in his laocöon and diderot gave it a place among the books which he recommended in his plan of a university20 this as it is the earliest seems to have been the best contribution to æsthetic thought before lessing and diderot daniel webb the english friend of raphael mengs published an enquiry into the beauties of painting 1760 and diderot wrote a notice of it21 but it appears to have made no mark on his mind andré a jesuit father wrote an essay on the beautiful 1741 which distributed the kinds of art with precision but omitted to say in what the beautiful consists the abbé batteux wrote a volume reducing the fine arts to a single principle and another volume attempting a systematic classification of them the first of these was the occasion of diderots letter on deaf mutes and diderot described their author as a good man of letters but without taste without criticism and without philosophy à ces bagatelles près le plus joli garçon du monde22      19 eg watelets

has been so slight and where production has been so noble so bounteous so superb published the story of what italy had shown to them madame de pompadour designed to make her brother the superintendent of fine arts and she despatched cochin the great engraver of the day to accompany him in a studious tour through the holy land of the arts cochin was away nearly two years and on his return produced three little volumes 1758 in which he deals such blows to some vaunted immortalities as made the idolators by convention not a little angry the abbé richard 1766 published six very stupid volumes on italy and such criticism on art as they contain is not worthy of serious remark the president de brosses spent a year in italy 173940 and wrote letters to his friends at home which may be read today with interest and pleasure for their graphic picture of italian society but the criticisms which they contain on the great works of art are those of a wellinformed man of the world taking many things for granted rather than of a philosophical critic industriously using his own mind his book recalls to us how true the eighteenth century was to itself in its hatred of gothic architecture that symbol and associate of mysticism and of the age which the eighteenth century blindly abhorred as the source of all the tyrannical laws and cruel superstitions that still weighed so heavily on mankind you

de brosses an eminent lawyer an acquaintance of diderot and an early friend of a conspicuous figure of a later time the illstarred vergniaud travelled in italy almost immediately before the revolution 1785 and his letters when read with those of de brosses are a curious illustration of the change that had come over the spirit of men in the interval he leaves the pictures of the pitti collection at florence and plunges into meditation in the famous gardens behind the palace rejoicing with much expansion in the glories of light and air in greenery and the notes of birds and finally sums all up in one rapturous exclamation of the vast superiority of nature over art24      24 dupatys lettres sur litalie no 40 in talking of rome he     complains in a very diderotian spirit of the want of le beau

pare avec tant de raffinement et de peine les écrits les     discours les passions enfin toute la vie publique et privée  it is impossible in reading how deeply diderot was affected by fifthrate paintings and sculpture not to count it among the great losses of literature that he saw few masterpieces he never made the great pilgrimage he was never at venice florence parma rome a journey to italy was once planned in which grimm and rousseau were to have been his travelling companions25 the project was not realised and the strongest critic of art that his country produced never saw the greatest glories of art if diderot had visited florence and rome even the mighty painter of the last judgment and the creator of those sublime figures in the new sacristy at san lorenzo would have found an interpreter worthy of him but it was not to be it is rare he once wrote for an artist to excel without having seen italy just as a man seldom becomes a great writer or a man of great taste without having given severe study to the ancients26 diderot at least knew what he lost      25 x 514 n      26 xi 241  french art was then as art usually is the mirror of its time reproducing such imaginative feeling as society could muster when the republic and the empire came and twenty years of battle and siege then the art of the previous generation fell into a degree of contempt for which there is hardly a parallel pictures that had been the delight of the town and had brought fortunes to their painters rotted on the quays or were sold for a few pence at low auctions fragonard who had been the darling of his age died in neglect and beggary david and his hideous art of the empire utterly effaced what had thrown the contemporaries of diderot into rapture27 every one knows all that can be said against the french paintings of diderots time they are executed hastily and at random they abound in technical defects of colour of drawing of composition their feeling is light and shallow watteau died in 1721at the same premature age as raphaelbut he remained as the dominating spirit of french art through the eighteenth century of course the artists went to rome but they changed sky and not spirit the pupils of the academy came back with their portfolios filled with sketches in which we see nothing of the lone mother of dead empires nothing of the vast ruins and the great sombre desolate campagna but only rome turned into a decoration for the scenes of a theatre or the panels of a boudoir the olympus of homer and of virgil as has been well said becomes the olympus of ovid strength sublimity even stateliness disappeared unless we admit some of the first two qualities in the landscapes of vernet not only is beauty replaced by prettiness but by prettiness in season and out of season the common incongruity of introducing a spirit of elegance and literature into the simplicities of the true pastoral was condemned by diderot as a mixture of fontenelle with theocritus we do not know what name he would have given to that still more curious incongruity of taste which made a publisher adorn a treatise on differential and integral calculus with amusing plates by cochin and introduce dainty little vignettes into a demonstration of the properties of the cycloid      27 goncourts lart au 18ième siècle i  there is one true story that curiously illustrates the spirit of french art in those equivocal days when madame de pompadour made up her mind to play pander to the jaded appetites of the king she had a famous female model of the day introduced into a holy family which was destined for the private chapel of the queen the portrait answered its purpose it provoked the curiosity and desire of the king and the model was invited to the parcauxcerfs28 this was typical of the service that painting was expected to render to the society that adored it and paid for it all is daintiness delicate caressing for delicate senses even down to the external decoration of life down to the sinuous lines the wanton apparel the refined commodity of rooms and furniture in such a place and in such company it is enough to be together to feel at

admiration for titian rembrandt raphael and the rest of the gods and demigods refuse at least a measure of historic tolerance to these light and graceful creations boucher whose dreams of rose and blue were the delight of his age came away from rome saying raphael is a woman michael angelo is a monster one is paradise the other is hell they are painters of another world it is a dead language that nobody speaks in our day we others are the painters of our own age we have not common sense but we are charming this account of them was not untrue they filled up the space between the grandiose pomp of le brun and the sombre pseudoantique of david just as the incomparable grace and sparkle of voltaires lighter verse filled up the space in literature between racine and chénier they have a poetry of their own they are cheerful sportive full of fancy and like everything else of that day intensely sociable they are at any rate even the most sportive of them far less unwholesome and degrading than the acres of martyrdoms emaciations bad crucifixions bad pietas that make some galleries more disgusting than a lazarhouse30      30 si tous les tableaux de martyrs que nos grands

pictures were submitted to him imperiously to command ces magots là to be taken out of his sight  greuze b 1725 d 1805 of all the painters of the time was diderots chief favourite diderot was not at all blind to greuzes faults to his repetitions his frequent want of size and amplitude the excess of gray and of violet in his colouring but all these were forgotten in transports of sympathy for the sentiment as we glance at a list of greuzes subjects we perceive that we are in the very heart of the region of the domestic the moral lhonnête the homely pathos of the common people the death of a father of a family regretted by his children the death of an unnatural father abandoned by his children the beloved mother caressed by her little ones a child weeping over its dead bird a paralytic tended by his family or the fruit of a good educationdiderot was ravished by such themes the last picture he describes as a proof that compositions of that kind are capable of doing honour to the gifts and the sentiments of the artist31 the girl bewailing her dead bird throws him into raptures o the pretty elegy he begins the charming poem the lovely idyll and so forth until at length he breaks into a burst of lyric condolence addressed to the weeping child that would fill four or five of these pages32      31 x 143      32 x 343  no picture of the eighteenth century was greeted with more enthusiasm than greuzes accordée de village which was exhibited in 1761 it seems to tell a story and therefore even today in spite of its dulled pink and lustreless blue it arrests the visitor to one of the less frequented halls of the louvre33 paris weary of mythology and sated with pretty indecencies was fascinated by the simplicity of greuzes village tale on se sent gagner dune émotion douce en le regardant said diderot and this gentle emotion was dear to the cultivated classes in france at that moment of the century it was the year of the new heloïsa      33 no 260 of the french school  the subject is of the simplest a peasant paying the dowermoney of his daughter the fatherit is prudent of us to borrow diderots descriptionis seated in the great chair of the house before him his soninlaw standing and holding in his left hand the bag that contains the money the betrothed standing also with one arm gently passed under the arm of her lover the other grasped by her mother who is seated between the mother and the bride a younger sister standing leaning on the bride and with an arm thrown round her shoulders behind this group a child standing on tiptoes to see what is going on to the extreme left in the background and at a distance from the scene two womenservants who are looking on to the right a cupboard with its usual contentsall scrupulously clean a wooden staircase leading to the upper floor in the foreground near the feet of the mother a hen leading her young ones to whom a little girl throws crumbs of bread a basin full of water and on the edge of it one of the small chickens with its beak up in the air so as to let the water go down diderot then proceeds to criticise the details telling us the very words that he hears the father addressing to the bridegroom and as a touch of observation of nature that while one of the old mans hands of which we see the back is tanned and brown the other of which we see the palm is white to the bride the painter has given a face full of charm of seemliness of reserve she is dressed to perfection that apron of white stuff could not be better there is a trifle of luxury in her ornament but then it is a weddingday you should note how true are the folds and creases in her dress and in those of the rest the charming girl is not quite straight but there is a light and gentle inflexion in all her figure and her limbs that fills her with grace and truth indeed she is pretty and very pretty if she had leaned more towards her lover it would have been unbecoming more to her mother and her father and she would have been false she has her arm half passed under that of her future husband and the tips of her fingers rest softly on his hand that is the only mark of tenderness that she gives him and perhaps without knowing it herself it is a delicate idea in the painter34      34 x 151156 dr waagen pronounces this picture to be as truly     an expression of das nationalfranzösiche as wilkies paintings are     of das englische see his kunstwerke und künstler in paris p     675  courage my good greuze he cries fais de la morale en peinture what has not the pencil been long enough and too long consecrated to debauchery and vice ought we not to be delighted at seeing it at last unite with dramatic poetry in instructing us correcting us inviting us to virtue35 it has been sometimes said that diderot would have exulted in the paintings of hogarth and we may admit that he would have sympathised with the spirit of such moralities as the idle and the industrious apprentice the rakes progress and mariage à la mode the intensity and power of that terrible genius would have had their attraction but the minute ferocities of hogarths ruthless irony would certainly have revolted him such a scene as lord squanderfields visit to the quack doctor or as the rakes debauch would have filled him with inextinguishable horror he could never have forgiven an artist who in the ghastly pathos of a little child straining from the arms of its nurse towards the mother as she lies in the very article of death could still find in his heart to paint on it the dark patches of foul disease he would have fled with shrieks from those appalling scenes of murder torture madness bestial drunkenness rapacity furyfrom that delirium of scrofula palsy entrails the windingsheet and the graveworm diderots method was to improve men not by making their blood curdle but by warming and softening the domestic affections      35 x 208  diderot as a critic seems always to have remembered a pleasant remonstrance once addressed at the salon by the worthy chardin to himself and grimm gently good sirs gently out of all the pictures that are here seek the very worst and know that two thousand unhappy wretches have bitten their brushes in two with their teeth in despair of ever doing even as badly parrocel whom you call a dauber and who for that matter is a dauber if you compare him to vernet is still a man of rare talent relatively to the multitude of those who have flung up the career in which they started with him and then the artist recounts the immense labours the exhausting years the boundless patience attention tenacity that are the conditions even of a mediocre degree of mastery we are reminded of the scene in a famous work of art in our own day where herr klesmer begs miss gwendolen harleth to reflect how merely to stand or to move on the stage is an art that requires long practice o le triste et plat métier que celui de critique diderot cries on one occasion il est si difficile de produire une chose même médiocre il est si facile de sentir la médiocrité36 no doubt as experience and responsibility gather upon us we learn how hard in every line is even moderate skill the wise are perhaps content to find what a man can do without making it a reproach to him that there is something else which he cannot do      36 x 177  but diderot knew well enough that chardins kindly principle might easily be carried too far in general he said criticism displeases me it supposes so little talent what a foolish occupation that of incessantly hindering ourselves from taking pleasure or else making ourselves blush for the pleasure that we have taken and that is the occupation of criticism37 yet in one case he writes a score of pages of critical dialogue in which the chief interlocutor is a painter who avenges his own failure by stringent attacks on the work of happier rivals of the year and speaking in his own proper person diderot knows how to dismiss incompetence with the right word sometimes of scorn more often of goodnatured remonstrance bad painters a parrocel a brenet fare as ill at his hands as they deserved to do he remarks incidentally that the condition of the bad painter and the bad actor is worse than that of the bad man of letters the painter hears with his own ears the expressions of contempt for his talent and the hisses of the audience go straight to the ears of the actor whereas the author has the comfort of going to his grave without a suspicion that you have cried out at every page the fool the animal the jackass and have at length flung his book into a corner there is nothing to prevent the worst author as he sits alone in his library and reads himself over and over again from congratulating himself on being the originator of a host of rare and felicitous ideas38      37 xii 8 79      38 xi 149  the one painter whom diderot never spares is boucher who was an idol of the time and made an income of fifty thousand livres a year out of his popularity he laughs at him as a mere painter of fans an artist with no colours on his palette save white and red he admits the fecundity the fougue the ease of boucher just as sir joshua reynolds admits his grace and beauty and good skill in composition39 boucher says diderot is in painting what ariosto is in poetry and he who admires the one is inconsistent if he is not mad for the other what is wanting is disciplined taste more variety more severity yet he cannot refuse to concede about one of bouchers pictures that after all he would be glad to possess it every time you saw it he says you would find fault with it yet you would go on looking at it40 this is perhaps what the severest modern amateur as he strolls carelessly through the french school at his leisure would not in his heart care to deny      39 see reynoldss twelfth discourse p 106      40 x 102  fragonard whose picture of coresus and callirrhoë made a great sensation in its day and still attracts some small share of attention in the french school was not a favourite with diderot the callirrhoë inspired an elaborate but not very felicitous criticism then the painter changed his style in the direction of boucher and as far away as possible from lhonnête and le beau moral and diderot turned away from him at last describing an oval picture representing groups of children in heaven as une belle et grande omelette denfants heads legs thighs arms bodies all interlaced together among yellowish cloudsbien omelette bein douillette bein jaune et bien brûlée41      41 xi 296 for the callirrhoë see x 397  on the whole we cannot wonder either that painters hold literary talk about their difficult and complex art so cheap or that the lay public prizes it so much above its intrinsic worth it helps the sluggish imagination and dull sight of the one while it is apt to pass ignorantly over both the true difficulties and the true successes of the other diderot unlike most of those who have come after him had carefully studied the conditions prescribed to the painter by the material in which he works although he was a master of the literary criticism of art he had artists among his intimate companions and was too eager for knowledge not to wring from them the secrets of technique just as he extorted from weavers and dyers the secrets of their processes and instruments he makes no ostentatious display of this special knowledge yet it is present giving a firmness and accuracy to what would otherwise be too like mere arbitrary lyrics suggested by a painting and not really dealing with it his special gift was the transformation of scientific criticism into something with the charm of literature take for instance a picture by vien       psyche approaching with her lamp to surprise love in his      sleepthe two figures are of flesh and blood but they have      neither the elegance nor the grace nor the delicacy that the      subject required love seems to me to be making a grimace psyche      is not like a woman who comes trembling on tiptoe i do not see on      her face that mixture of surprise fear love desire and      admiration which ought all to be there it is not enough to show      in psyche a curiosity to see love i must also perceive in her the      fear of awakening him she ought to have her mouth half open and      to be afraid of drawing her breath tis her lover that she      seesthat she sees for the first time at the risk of losing him      for ever what joy to look upon him and to find him so fair oh      what little intelligence in our painters how little they      understand nature the head of psyche ought to be inclined towards      love the rest of her body drawn back as it is when you advance      towards a spot where you fear to enter and from which you are      ready to flee back one foot planted on the ground and the other      barely touching it and the lamp ought she to let the light fall      on the eyes of love ought she not to hold it apart and to shield      it with her hand to deaden its brightness moreover that would      have lighted the picture in a striking way these good people do      not know that the eyelids have a kind of transparency they have      never seen a mother coming in the night to look at her child in the      cradle with a lamp in her hand and fearful of awakening it42      42 x 121  there have been many attempts to imitate this manner since diderot no less a person than m thiers tried it when it fell to him as a young writer for the newspapers to describe the salon of 1822 one brilliant poet novelist traveller critic has succeeded and diderots artcriticism is at least equalled in théophile gautiers pages on titians assunta and bellinis madonna at venice or murillos saint anthony of padua at seville43      43 voyage en italie 230 voyage en espagne 330 see the same     critics abécédaire du salon de 1861  just as in his articles in the encyclopædia here too diderot is always ready to turn from his subject for a moral aside even the modern reader will forgive the discursive apostrophe addressed to the judges of the unfortunate calas the almost lyric denunciation of an atrocity that struck such deep dismay into the hearts of all the brethren of the encyclopædia44 but diderots asides are usually in less tragic matter a picture of michael van loos reminds him that van loo had once a friend in spain this friend took it into his head to equip a vessel for a trading expedition and van loo invested all his fortune in his friends vessel the vessel was wrecked the fortune was lost and the master was drowned when van loo heard of the disaster the first word that came to his mouth wasi have lost a good friend and on this diderot sails off into a digression on the grounds of praise and blame      44 xi 309  here are one or two illustrations of the same moralising       the effect of our sadness on others is very singular have you not      sometimes noticed in the country the sudden stillness of the      birds if it happens that on a fine day a cloud comes and lingers      over the spot that was resounding with their music a suit of deep      mourning in company is the cloud that as it passes causes the      momentary silence of the birds it goes and the song is resumed       we should divide a nation into three classes the bulk of the      nation which forms the national taste and manners those who rise      above these are called madmen originals oddities those who fall      below are noodles the progress of the human mind causes the level      to shift and a man often lives too long for his reputation he      who is too far in front of his generation who rises above the      general level of the common manners must expect few votes he      ought to be thankful for the oblivion that rescues him from      persecution those who raise themselves to a great distance above      the common level are not perceived they die forgotten and      tranquil either like everybody else or far away from everybody      else that is my motto45       but vernet will never be more than vernet a mere man no and for      that very reason all the more astonishing and his work all the      more worthy of admiration it is no doubt a great thing is this      universe but when i compare it with the energy of the productive      cause if i had to wonder at aught it would be that its work is      not still finer and still more perfect it is just the reverse when      i think of the weakness of man of his poor means of the      embarrassments and of the short duration of his life and then of      certain things that he has undertaken and carried out46      45 xi 294      46 xi 102  these digressions are one source of the charm of diderots criticism they impart ease and naturalness to it because they evidently reproduce the free movement of his mind as it really was and not as the supposed dignity of authorship might require him to pretend there is no stiffness nor sense as we have said of literary strain and yet there is no disturbing excess of what is random broken décousu the digression flows with lively continuity from the main stream and back again into it leaving some cheerful impression or curious suggestion behind it something we cannot tell what draws him off to wonder whether there is not as much verve in the first scene of terence and in the antinoüs as in any scene of molière or any work of michael angelo i once answered this question but rather too lightly every moment i am apt to make a mistake because language does not furnish me with the right expression for the truth at the moment i abandon a thesis for lack of words that shall supply my reasons i have one thing in the bottom of my heart and i find myself saying another there is the advantage of living in retirement and solitude there a man speaks asks himself questions listens to himself and listens in silence his secret sensation develops itself little by little then when he is about to speak of one of greuzes pictures he bethinks himself of greuzes vanity and this leads him to a vein of reflection which it is good for all critics whether public or private to hold fast in their minds if you take away greuzes vanity you will take away his verve you will extinguish his fire his genius will undergo an eclipse nos qualités tiennent de prés à nos défauts and of this important truth the base of wise tolerance there follow a dozen graphic examples47      47 x 342 he says elsewhere of greuze xviii 247 that he is un     excellent artiste mais une bien mauvaise téte  grétry the composer more than once consulted diderot in moments of perplexity it was not always safe he says to listen to the glowing man when he allowed his imagination to run away with him but the first burst was of inspiration divine48 painters found his suggestions as potent and as hopeful as the musician found them he delighted in being able to tell an artist how he might change his bad picture into a good one49 chardin la grenée greuze and others says diderot have assured me and artists are not given to flattering men of letters that i was about the only one whose images could pass at once to canvas almost exactly as they came into my head and he gives illustrations how he instantly furnished to la grenée a subject for a picture of peace to greuze a design introducing a nude figure without wounding the modesty of the spectator to a third a historical subject50 the first of the three is a curious example of the difficulty which even a strong genius like diderot had in freeing himself from artificial traditions for peace he cried to la grenée show me mars with his breastplate his sword girded on his head noble and firm place standing by his side a venus full divine voluptuous smiling on him with an enchanting smile let her point to his casque in which her doves have made their nest is it not singular that even diderot sometimes failed to remember that mars and venus are dead that they can never be the source of a fresh and natural inspiration and that neither artist nor spectator can be moved by cold and vapid allegories in an extinct dialect if diderot could have seen such a treatment of la grenées subject as landseers peace with its children playing at the mouth of the slumbering gun he would have been the first to cry out how much nearer this came to the spirit of his own æsthetic methods than all the pride of mars and all the beauty of venus he is truer to himself in the subject with which he met greuzes perplexity in the second of his two illustrations he bade greuze paint the honest model a girl sitting to an artist for the first time her poor garments on the ground beside her her head resting on one of her hands and a tear rolling down each cheek the mother whose dress betrays the extremity of indigence is by her side and with her own hands and one of the hands of her daughter covers her face the painter witness of the scene softened and touched lets his palette or his brush fall from his hand greuze at once exclaimed that he saw his subject and we may at least admit that this pretty bit of commonplace sentimentalism is more in diderots vein than pagan gods and goddesses      48 quoted in diderots oeuv v 460 n      49 eg oeuv xi 258      50 xi 74  diderot is never more truly himself than when he takes the subject of a picture that is before him and shows how it might have been more effectively handled thus       the flight into egypt is treated in a fresh and piquant manner      but the painter has not known how to make the best of his idea the      virgin passes in the background of the picture bearing the infant      jesus in her arms she is followed by joseph and the ass carrying      the baggage in the foreground are the shepherds prostrating      themselves their hands upturned towards her and wishing her a      happy journey ah what a fine painting if the artist had known      how to make mountains at the foot of which the virgin had passed      if he had known how to make the mountains very steep escarped      majestic if he had covered them with moss and wild shrubs if he      had given to the virgin simplicity beauty grandeur nobleness if      the road that she follows had led into the paths of some forest      lonely and remote if he had taken his moment at the rise of day      or at its fall51      51 x 115  the picture of saint benedict by deshayswhom at one moment diderot pronounces to be the first painter in the nationstirs the same spirit of emendation diderot thinks that in spite of the pallor of the dying saints visage one would be inclined to give him some years yet to live       i ask whether it would not have been better that his legs should      have sunk under him that he should have been supported by two or      three monks that he should have had the arms extended the head      thrown back with death on his lips and ecstasy on his brow if the      painter had given this strong expression to his saint benedict      consider my friend how it would have reflected itself on all the      rest of the picture that slight change in the principal figure      would have influenced all the others the celebrant instead of      being upright would in his compassion have leaned more forward      distress and anguish would have been more strongly depicted in all      the bystanders there is a piece from which you could teach young      students that by altering one single circumstance you alter all      others or else the truth disappears you could make out of it an      excellent chapter on the force of unity you would have to      preserve the same arrangement the same figures and to invite them      to execute the picture according to the different changes that were      made in the figure of the communicant52      52 x 125  the admirable salons were not diderots only contributions to æsthetic criticism he could not content himself with reproductions in eloquent language upon paper of the combinations of colour and form upon canvas no one was further removed from vague or indolent expansion he returns again and again to examine with keenness and severity the principles the methods the distinctions of the fine arts and though he is often a sentimentalist and a declaimer he can also when the time comes transform himself into an accurate scrutiniser of ideas and phrases a seeker after causes and differences a discoverer of kinds and classes in art and of the conditions proper to success in each of them in short the fact of being an eloquent and enthusiastic critic of pictures did not prevent him from being a truly philosophical thinker about the abstract laws of art with the thinkers genius for analysis comparison classification who that has read them can ever forget the dialogues that are set among the landscapes of vernet in the salons of 176753 the critic supposes himself unable to visit the salon of the year and to be staying in a gay countryhouse amid some fine landscapes on the seacoast he describes his walks among these admirable scenes and the strange and varying effects of light and colour and all the movements of the sky and ocean and into the descriptions he weaves a series of dialogues with an abbé a tutor of the children of the house upon art and landscape and the processes of the universe nothing can be more excellent and lifelike it is not until the end that he lets the secret slip that the whole fabric has been a flight of fancy inspired by no real landscape but by the seapieces sent to the exhibition by vernet      53 xi 98149  this is an illustration of the variety of approach which makes diderot so interesting so refreshing a critic he never sinks into what is mechanical and the evidence of this is that his mind while intent on the qualities of a given picture yet moves freely to the outside of the picture and is ever cordially open to the most general thoughts and moods while attending with workmanlike fidelity to what is particular in the object before him54      54 eg xi 223  in the light of modern speculation upon the philosophy of the fine arts diderot makes no commanding figure because he is so egregiously unsystematic but as goethe said in a piece where he was withstanding diderot to the face die höchste wirkung des geistes ist den geist hervorzurufenthe highest influence of mind is to call out mind this stimulating provocation of the intelligence was the master faculty in diderot for the sake of that men are ready to pardon all excesses and to overlook many offences against the law of measure from such a point of view goethes treatment of diderots essay on painting written in 1765 but not given to the world until 1796 is an instructive lesson diderots essay he wrote to schiller is a magnificent work and it speaks even more usefully to the poet than to the painter though for the painter too it is a torch of powerful illumination yet diderots critical principle in the essay was exactly opposite to goethes and when goethe translated some portions of it he was forced to add a commentary of stringent protest diderot as usual energetically extols nature as the one source and fountain of true artistic inspiration even in what looks to us like defect and monstrosity she is never incorrect if she inflicts on the individual some unusual feature she never fails to draw other parts of the system into coordination and a sort of harmony with the abnormal element we say of a man who passes in the street that he is illshapen yes according to our poor rules but according to nature it is another matter we say of a statue that it is of fine proportions yes according to our poor rules but according to nature55      55 x 481 462  in the same vein he breaks out against the practice of drawing from the academic model all these academic positions affected constrained artificial as they are all these actions coldly and awkwardly expressed by some poor devil and always the same poor devil hired to come three times a week to undress himself and to play the puppet in the hands of the professorwhat have these in common with the positions and actions of nature what is there in common between the man who draws water from the well in your courtyard and the man who pretends to imitate him on the platform of the drawingschool if diderot thought the seven years passed in drawing the model no better than wasted he was not any more indulgent to the practice of studying the minutiæ of the anatomy of the human frame he saw the risk of the artist becoming vain of his scientific acquirement of his eye being corrupted of his seeking to represent what is under the surface of his forgetting that he has only the exterior to show a practice that is intended to make the student look at nature most commonly tends to make him see nature other than she really is to sum up mannerism would disappear from drawing and from colour if people would only scrupulously imitate nature mannerism comes from the masters from the academy from the school and even from the antique56      56 x 467 for a more respectful view of the antique and of     winckelmanns position see salon de 1765 x 418  we may easily believe how many fallacies were discerned in such lessons as these by the author of iphigenie and the passionate admirer of the ancient marbles diderots fundamental error said goethe is to confound nature and art completely to amalgamate nature with art now nature organises a living an indifferent being the artist something dead but full of significance nature something real the artist something apparent in the works of nature the spectator must import significance thought effect reality in a work of art he will and must find this already there a perfect imitation of nature is in no sense possible the artist is only called to the representation of the surface of an appearance the outside of the vessel the living whole that speaks to all our faculties of mind and sense that stirs our desire elevates our intelligencethat whose possession makes us happy the vivid potent finished beautifulfor all this is the artist appointed in other words art has its own laws as it has its own aims and these are not the laws and aims of nature to mock at rules is to overthrow the conditions that make a painting or a statue possible to send the pupil away from the model to the life of the street the gaol the church is to send him forth without teaching him for what to look to make light of the study of anatomy in art is like allowing the composer to forget thorough bass in his enthusiasm or the poet in his enthusiasm to forget the number of syllables in his verse again though art may profit by a free and broad method yet all artistic significance depends on the more and the less beauty is a narrow circle in which one may only move in modest measure and of this modest measure the academy the school the master above all the antique are the guardians and the teachers57      57 diderots versuch über die malerei goethes werke xxv     309 etc  it is unnecessary to labour the opposition between the two great masters of criticism goethe as usual must be pronounced to have the last word of reason and wisdom the word which comprehends most of the truth of the matter and it is delivered in that generous and loyal spirit which nobody would have appreciated more than the freehearted diderot himself the drift of goethes contention is in fact the thesis of diderots paradox on the comedian but the state of painting in franceand goethe admits itmay have called for a line of criticism which was an exaggeration of what diderot if he had been in goethes neutral position would have found in his better mind58      58 and of course on occasion did actually find see xi 101 sir     joshua reynolds who was too sincere a lover of his art not to be     above mere patriotic prejudice describes the condition of things     i have heard painters acknowledge that they could do better without     nature than with her or as they expressed themselves it only put     them out our neighbours the french are much in this practice of     extempore invention and their dexterity is such as even to excite     admiration if not envy but how rarely can this praise be given to     their finished pictures twelfth discourse p 105  there is a passage in one of the salons which sheds a striking sidelight on the difference between these two great types of genius the difference between the mere virtuoso and the deep critic is that in the latter behind views on art we discern farreaching thoughts on life and in diderot no less than in goethe art is ever seen in its associations with character aspiration happiness and conduct       the sun which was on the edge of the horizon disappeared over      the sea there came all at once an aspect more sombre and solemn      twilight which is at first neither day nor nightan image of our      feeble thoughts and an image that warns the philosopher to stay in      his speculationswarns the traveller too to turn his steps towards      home so i turned back and as i continued the thread of my      thoughts i began to reflect that if there is a particular morality      belonging to each species so perhaps in the same species there is      a different morality for different individuals or at least for      different kinds and collections of individuals and in order not to      scandalise you by too serious an example it came into my head that      there is perhaps a morality peculiar to artists or to art and that      this morality might well be the very reverse of the common      morality yes my friend i am much afraid that man marches      straight to misery by the very path that leads the imitator of      nature to the sublime to plunge into extremesthat is the rule      for poets to keep in all things the just meanthere is the rule      for happiness one must not make poetry in real life the heroes      the romantic lovers the great patriots the inflexible      magistrates the apostles of religion the philosophers à toute      outranceall these rare and divine insensates make poetry in      their life and that is their bane it is they who after death      provide material for great pictures they are excellent to paint      experience shows that nature condemns to misery the man to whom she      has allotted genius and whom she has endowed with beauty it is      they who are the figures of poetry then within myself i lauded      the mediocrity that shelters one alike from praise and blame and      yet why i asked myself would no one choose to let his sensibility      go and to become mediocre o vanity of man59      59 x 124 125  goethes tasso a work so full of finished poetry and of charm is the idealised and pathetic version of the figure that diderot has thus conceived for genius the dialogues between the hapless poet and antonio the man of the world are a skilful lofty and impressive statement of the problem that often vexed diderot goethe sympathised with antonios point of view he had in his nature so much of the spirit of conduct of saneness of the common reason of the world and in art he was a lover of calm ideals in diderot as our readers by this time know these things were otherwise  the essay on beauty in the encyclopædia is less fertile than most of diderots contributions to the subject60 it contains a careful account of two or three other theories especially that of hutcheson the object is to explain the source of beauty diderots own conclusion is that this is to be found in relations our words for the different shades of the beautiful are expressive of notions acquired by experience through the senses of order proportion symmetry unity and so forth but after all the real question remains unansweredwhat makes some relations beautiful and others not so and the same objects beautiful to me and indifferent to you and the same object beautiful to me today and indifferent or disgusting to me tomorrow diderot does it is true enumerate twelve sources of such diversity of judgment in different races ages individuals moods but their force depends upon the importation into the conception of beauty of some more definite element than the bare idea of relation some sentences show that he came very near to the famous theory of alison that beauty is only attributed to sounds and sights where and because they recall what is pleasing sublime pathetic and set our ideas and emotions flowing in one of these channels but he does not get fairly on the track of either alisons or any other decisive and marking adjective with which to qualify his rapports he wastes some time moreover in trying to bring within the four corners of his definition some uses of the terms of beauty which are really only applied to objects by way of analogy and are not meant to predicate the beautiful in any literal or scientific sense      60 oeuv x  there is no more interesting department of æsthetic inquiry than the relations of the arts to one another and the nature of the delimitations of the provinces of poetry painting sculpture music diderot from the very beginning of his career had turned his thoughts to this intricate subject in his letter on deaf mutes 1751 he had stated the problemto collect the common beauties of poetry painting and music to show their analogies to explain how the poet the painter and the musician render the same image to seize the fugitive emblems of their expression why should a situation that is admirable in a poem become ridiculous in a painting61 for instance what is it that prevents a painter from reproducing the moment when neptune raises his head above the tossing waters as he is represented in virgil            interea magno misceri murmure pontum     emissamque hiemem sensit neptunus et imis     stagna refusa vadis graviter commotus et alto     prospiciens summâ placidum caput extulit undâ      61 it is to be observed also that he shows true perspicacity in     connecting the difficulty of transforming a poetic into a pictorial     description with the kindred difficulty of translating a finished     poem in one language into another language see also xi 107  diderots answer to the question is an anticipation of the main position of the famous little book which appeared fifteen years afterwards and which has been well described as the organum of æsthetic cultivation in laocoön lessing contends against spence the author of polymetis against caylus and others of his contemporaries that poetry and painting are divided from one another in aim in effects in reach by the limits set upon each by the nature of its own material62 so diderot says that the painter could not seize the virgilian moment because a body that is partially immersed in water is disfigured by an effect of refraction which a faithful painter would be bound to reproduce because the image of the body could not be seen transparently through the stormy waters and therefore the god would have the appearance of being decapitated because it is indispensable if you would avoid the impression of a surgical amputation that some visible portion of hidden limbs should be there to inform us of the existence of the rest63 he takes another instance where a description that is admirable in poetry would be insupportable in painting who he asks could bear upon canvas the sight of polyphemus grinding between his teeth the bones of one of the companions of ulysses who could see without horror a giant holding a man in his enormous mouth with blood dripping over his head and breast      62 lessing appears to have been directly led to this by aristotle     see gotschlichs lessings aristotelische studien p 120      63 oeuv i 382 403  among the many passages in which diderot touches on the differences between poetry and painting none is more just and true than that in which he implores the poet not to attempt description of details true taste fastens on one or two characteristics and leaves the rest to imagination tis when armida advances with noble mien in the midst of the ranks of the army of godfrey and when the generals begin to look at one another with jealous eyes that armida is beautiful to us it is when helen passes before the old men of troy and they all cry outit is then that helen is beautiful and it is when ariosto describes alcina from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet that notwithstanding the grace the facility the soft elegance of his verse alcina is not beautiful he shows me everything he leaves me nothing to do he makes me wearied and impatient if a figure walks describe to me its carriage and its lightness i will undertake the rest if it is stooping speak to me only of arms and shoulders i will take all else on myself if you do more you confuse the kinds of work you cease to be a poet and become a painter or sculptor one single trait a great trait leave the rest to my imagination that is true taste great taste64 and then he quotes with admiration ovids line of the goddess of the seas                      nec brachia longo     margine terrarum porrexerat amphitrite      64 oeuv xi 328  quel image quels bras quel prodigieux mouvement quelle figure and so forth after diderots manner  nobody will compare these detached and fragmentary deliverances with the full and easy mastery which lessing in laocöon and its unfinished supplements exhibits over the many ramifications of his central idea we can only notice that diderot had a foot on the track along which lessing afterwards made such signal progress the reader who cares to measure the advantage of lessings more serious and concentrated attention to his subject may compare the twelfth chapter of laocöon with diderots criticism on doyens painting of the battle between diomede and aeneas65 as we see how near diderot came to the real and decisive truths of all these matters and yet how far he remains from the full perception of what a little consecutive study must have revealed to his superior genius we can only think painfully of his avowali have not the consciousness of having employed the half of my strength jusquà présent je nai que

should spend all his life in going up from the cellars to the attics and going down from attics to cellar instead of sitting quietly in the midst of his family that is the image of the traveller yet diderot whose words these are resolved at the age of sixty to undertake no less formidable a journey than to the remote capital on the shores of the neva it had come into his head or perhaps others had put it into his head that he owed a visit to his imperial benefactress whose bounty had rendered life easier to him he had recently made the acquaintance of two russian personages of consideration one of them was the princess dashkow who was believed to have taken a prominent part in that confused conspiracy of 1762 which ended in the murder of peter iii by alexis orloff and the elevation of catherine ii to the throne her services at that critical moment had not prevented her disgrace if indeed they were not its cause and in 1770 the princess set out on her travels horace walpole has described the curiosity of the london world to see the muscovite alecto the accomplice of the northern athaliah the amazon who had taken part in a revolution when she was only nineteen in england she made a pleasant impression in spite of eyes of a very catiline fierceness she was equally delighted with england and when she went on from london to paris she took very little trouble to make friends

declaiming until the early hours of the next morning the hurricanes of his enthusiastic nature delighted her and she remembered for years afterwards how on one occasion she excited him to such a pitch

prince galitzin was one of those foreigners like holbach grimm galiani who found themselves more at home in paris than anywhere else in the world living mostly among artists and men of letters he became an established favourite with diderots assistance 1767 he acquired for the empress many of the pictures that adorn the great gallery at st petersburg and diderot praises his knowledge of the fine arts the reason being that he has that great principle of true taste the belle âme67 he wrote eclogues in french and he attempted the more useful but more difficult task of writing in the halfformed tongue of his own country an account of the great painters of italy and holland68 diderot makes the pointed remark about him that he believed in equality of ranks by instinct which is better than believing in it by reflection69 it was through the medium of this friendly and intelligent man that the empress had acted in the purchase of diderots library in 1769 he was appointed russian minister at the hague and his chief ground for delight at the appointment was that it brought him within reach of his friends in paris      67 oeuv xviii 239      68 grimm cor lit xv 18

capital then at the distance of a four days journey from paris here he remained for many weeks in some doubt whether or not to persist in the project of a more immense journey he passed most of his time with the prince and princess galitzin as between a good brother and a good sister their house he notices had once been the residence of barneveldt men like diderot are the last persons to think of their own historic position else we might have expected to find him musing on the saving shelter which this land of freedom and tolerance had given to more than one of his great precursors in the literature of emancipation descartes had found twenty years of priceless freedom 16291649 among the dutch burghers the ruling ideas of the encyclopædia came in direct line from bayle d 1706 and locke d 1704 and both bayle and locke though in different measures owed their security to the stout valour with which the dutch defended their own land and taught the english how to defend theirs against the destructive pretensions of catholic absolutism of these memories diderot probably thought no more than descartes thought about the learning of grotius or the art of rembrandt it was not the age nor was his the mind for historic sentimentalism the more i see of this country he wrote to his good friends in paris the more i feel at home in it the soles fresh herrings turbot perch are all the best people in the world the walks are charming i do not know whether the women are all very sage but with their great straw hats their eyes fixed on the ground and the enormous fichus spread over their bosoms they have the air of coming back from prayers or going to confession diderot did not fail to notice more serious things than this his remarks on the means of travelling with most profit are full of sense and the account which he wrote of holland shows him to have been as widely reflective and observant as we should have expected him to be70 it will be more convenient to say something on this in connection with the stay which he again made at the hague on his return from his pilgrimage to russia      70 oeuv xviii 365 471  after many hesitations the die was cast nariskin a court

while to digress for a few moments to mark shortly the difference in social and intellectual conditions between the philosophers own city and the city for which he was bound and to touch on the significance of his journey we can only in this way understand the position of the encyclopædists in europe and see why it is interesting to the student of the history of western civilisation to know something about them it is impossible to have a clear idea of the scope of the revolutionary philosophy as well as of the singular preeminence of paris over the western world until we have placed ourselves not only at ferney and grandval and in the parlours of madame geoffrin and mademoiselle lespinasse but also in palaces at florence berlin vienna and st petersburg  from holland with its free institutions its peaceful industry its husbanded wealth its rich and original art its great political and literary tradition to go to russia was to measure an arc of western progress and to retrace the steps of the genius of civilisation the political capital of russia represented a forced and artificial union between old and new conditions in st petersburg says an onlooker were united the age of barbarism and the age of civilisation the tenth century and the eighteenth the manners of asia and the manners of europe the rudest scythians and the most polished europeans a brilliant and proud aristocracy and a people sunk in servitude on one side were elegant fashions magnificent dresses sumptuous repasts splendid feasts theatres like those which gave grace and animation to the select circles of london or paris on the other side shopkeepers in asiatic dress coachmen servants and peasants clad in sheepskins wearing long beards fur caps and long fingerless gloves of skin with short axes hanging from their leathern girdles the thick woollen bands round their feet and legs resembled a rude cothurnus and the sight of these uncouth figures reminded one who had seen the basreliefs on trajans column at rome of the scythians the dacians the goths the roxolani who had been the terror of the empire71 literary cultivation was confined to almost the smallest possible area oriental as russia was in many respects it was the opposite of oriental in one women were then as they are still sometimes said to be in russia more cultivated and advanced than men many of them could speak half a dozen languages could play on several instruments and were familiar with the works of the famous poets of france italy and england among the men on the contrary outside of a few exceptional families about the court the vast majority were strangers to all that was passing beyond the limits of their own country the few who had travelled and were on an intellectual level with their century were as far removed from the rest of their countrymen as englishmen are removed from iroquois      71 ségurs mem ii 230  to paint the court of catherine in its true colours it has been said that one ought to

one another there is not one of you who does not richly deserve to have his head cut off a certain princess was notorious for her inhuman barbarity one day she discovered that one of her attendants was with child in a frenzy she pursued the hapless callisto from chamber to chamber came up with her dashed in her skull with a heavy weapon and finally in a delirium of passion ripped up her body when two nobles had a quarrel they fell upon one another then and there like drunken navvies and potemkin had an eye gouged out in a court brawl such horrors give us a measure of the superior humanity of versailles and enable us also in passing to see how duelling could be a sign of a higher civilisation the reigning passions were love of money and the gratification of a coarse vanity friendship

quote clarke and tillotson at the divan of constantinople as invoke the authority of puffendorf and grotius here  the character of the empress herself has been more disputed than that of the society

record of the creation of that vast empire which begins with prussia and ends with china we have not here to speak the materials for knowing her and judging her are only in our own time becoming accessible72 as usual the mythic elements that surrounded her like a white fog from the northern seas out of which she loomed like a portent are rapidly disappearing and are replaced by the outlines of ordinary humanity with more than the ordinary human measure of firmness resolution and energetic grasp of the facts of her position in the world      72 the imperial historical society are

mixture of courage and weakness of knowledge and incompetence of firmness and irresolution passing in turn from the most opposite extremes she presented a thousand diverse surfaces until at last the observer had to content himself with putting her down as a consummate comedian she had no ready apprehension too refined a pleasantry was thrown away upon her and there was always a chance of her reversing its drift no playful reference to the finances or the military force or even to the climate of her empire was ever taken in good part73 the political part was the serious part of her nature catherine had the literary tastes but not the literary skill of frederick she is believed on good evidence to have written for the use of her grandsons not only an abridgment of russian history but a volume of moral tales74 the composition of moral tales was entirely independent of morality just as lewis xv had a long series of châteauroux pompadours dubarrys so catherine had her orloffs and potemkins and a countless host of obscure and miscellaneous wassiltchikows zavadowskys zoriczes korsaks on the serious side lewis xiv was her great pattern and idol she resented criticism on that renowned memory as something personal to herself to her business as sovereignmon petit ménage as she called the control of her huge formless empireshe devoted as much indefatigable industry as lewis himself had done in his best days notwithstanding all her efforts to improve her country she was not popular and never won the affection of her subjects but she probably cared less for the opinion and sentiment of russia than for the applause of europe tragedy displeases her writes the french minister and comedy wearies her she does not like music her table is without any sort of exquisiteness in a garden she cares only for roses her only taste is to build and to drill her court for the taste that she has for reigning and for making a great figure in the universe is really not so much taste as a downright absorbing passion      73 mém du prince de ligne p 101      74 ségur 219  gunning the english chargé daffaires insists that the motive of all her patriotic labours was not benevolence but an insatiable and unbounded thirst for fame if it were not so we must charge her with an inconsistency amounting to madness for undertaking so many immense works of public utility such as the foundation of colleges and academies on a most extensive plan and at an enormous outlay and then leaving them incomplete not even finishing the buildings for them they had served the purpose of making foreigners laud the glory of the semiramis of the north and that was enough the arts and sciences said the french minister have plenty of academies here but the academies have few subjects and fewer pupils how could there be pupils in a country where there is nobody who is not either a courtier a soldier or a slave the princess sophie of anhalt long before she dreamed of becoming the czarina catherine ii had been brought up by a french governess and the tastes that her governess had implanted grew into a passion for french literature which can only be compared to the same passion in frederick the great catherine only continued a movement that had already in the reign of her predecessor gone to a considerable length the social reaction against german political predominance had been accompanied by a leaning to france french professors in art and literature had been tempted to moscow the nobles sent to paris for their clothes and their furniture and a french theatre was set up in st petersburg where the nobles were forced to attend the performances under pain of a fine absentees and loiterers were hurried to their boxes by horsepatrols  catherine was more serious and intelligent than this in her pursuit of french culture she had begun with the books in which most of the salt of old france was to be found with rabelais scarron montaigne she cherished molière and corneille and of the writers of the eighteenth century apart from voltaire the author of gil blas was her favourite such a list tells its own tale of a mind turned to what is masculine racy pungent and thoroughly sapid i am a gauloise of the north she said i only understand the old french i do not understand the new i made up my mind to get something out of your gentry the learned men in ist i have tried them i made some of them come here i occasionally wrote to them they wearied me to death and never understood me there was only my good protector voltaire do you know it was voltaire who made me the fashion75 this was a confidential revelation made long after most of the philosophers were dead we might have penetrated the secret of her friendship for such a man as diderot even with less direct evidence than this it was the vogue of the philosophers and not their philosophy that made catherine their friend they were the great interest of europe at this time just as greek scholars had been its interest in one century painters in another great masters of religious controversy in a third what makes the great merit of france said voltaire what makes its unique superiority is a small number of sublime or delightful men of genius who cause french to be spoken at vienna at stockholm and at moscow your ministers your intendants your chief secretaries have no part in all this glory this vogue of the philosophers brought the whole literature of their country into universal repute in the depths of the crimea a khan of the tartars took a delight in having tartufe and the bourgeois gentilhomme read aloud to him76      75 to the prince de ligne      76 rambaud p 573  as soon as catherine came into power 1762 she at once applied herself to make friends in this powerful region it was a matter of course that she should begin with the omnipotent pontiff at ferney graceful verses from voltaire were as indispensable an ornament to a crowned head as a diadem and catherine answered with compliments that were perhaps more sincere than his verses she wonders how she can repay him for a bundle of books that he had sent to her and at last bethinks herself that nothing will please the lover of mankind so much as the introduction of inoculation into the great empire so she sends for dr dimsdale from england and submits to the unfamiliar rite in her own sacred person presents of furs are sent to the hermit of the alps and he is told how fortunate the imperial messenger counts himself in being despatched to ferney what flattered voltaire more than furs was catherines promptitude and exactness in keeping him informed of her military and political movements against turkey it made him a centre of european intelligence in more senses than one and helped him in his lifelong battle to pose in his letters at least as the equal of his friend the king of prussia for dalembert the empress professed an admiration only less than she felt for voltaire she was eager that he should come to russia to superintend the instruction of the young grand duke but dalembert was too prudent to go to st petersburg as he was too prudent to go to berlin montesquieu had died five years before her accession but his influence remained she habitually called the spirit of laws the breviary of kings and when she drew up her instruction for a new code she acknowledged how much she had pillaged from montesquieu i hope she said that if from the other world he sees me at work he will forgive my plagiarism for the sake of the twenty millions of men who will benefit by it in truth the twenty millions of men got very little benefit indeed by the code montesquieus own method might have taught her that not even absolute power can force the civil system of free labour into a society resting on serfdom but it is not surprising that catherine was no wiser than more democratic reformers who had drunk from the french springs or probably she had a lower estimate in her own heart of the value of her code for practical purposes than it suited her to disclose to a parisian philosopher  catherine did not forget that though the french at this time were preeminent in the literature of new ideas yet there were meritorious and useful men in other countries one of her correspondents was zimmermann of hanover whose essay on solitude the shelves of no secondhand booksellers shop is ever without she had tried hard to bribe beccaria to leave florence for st petersburg she succeeded in persuading euler to return to a capital whither he had been invited many years before by the first catherine and where he now remained  both catherines position and her temperament made the society of her own sex of little use or interest to her i dont know whether it is custom or inclination she wrote but somehow i can never carry on conversation except with men there are only two women in the world with whom i can talk for half an hour at once yet among her most intimate correspondents was one woman well known in the encyclopædic circle she kept up an active exchange of letters with madame geoffrinthat interesting personage who though belonging to the bourgeoisie and possessing not a trace of literary genius yet was respectfully courted not only by catherine but by stanislas gustavus and joseph ii77      77 see m mouys introduction to her correspondence with     stanislas  on the whole then we must regard catherines european correspondence as at least in some measure the result of political calculation its purposes as has been said were partly those to which in our own times some governments devote a reptilefund there is a letter from the duchesse de choiseul to madame du deffand her intimate friend and the friend of so many of the literary circle in which the secret of the relations between catherine and the men of letters is very plainly told all that she writesprotection of arts and sciencesis mere luxury and a caprice of fashion in our age all such pompous jargon is the product of vanity not of principles or of reflection the empress of russia has another object in protecting literature she has had sense enough to feel that she had need of the protection of the men of letters she has flattered herself that their base praises would cover with an impenetrable veil in the eyes of her contemporaries and of posterity the crimes with which she has astonished the universe and revolted humanity the men of letters on the other hand flattered cajoled caressed by her are vain of the protection that they are able to throw over her and dupes of the coquetries that she lavishes on them these people who say and believe that they are the instructors of the masters of the world sink so low as actually to take a pride in the protection that this monster seems in her turn to accord to them simply because she sits on a throne78      78 corresp complète de mdme du deffand i 115 ed 1877     june 1767  in short the monarchs of the north understood and used the new forces of the men of letters whom their own sovereign only recognised to oppress the contrast between the liberalism of the northern sovereigns and the obscurantism of the court of france was never lost from sight marmontels belisarius was condemned by the sorbonne and burnt at the foot of the great staircase of the palace of justice in russia a group of courtiers hastened to translate it and the empress herself undertook one chapter of the work diderot who was not allowed to enter the french academy was an honoured guest at the russian palace for all this catherine was handsomely repaid when diderot visited st petersburg voltaire congratulated the empress on seeing that unique man but diderot is not he added the only frenchman who is an enthusiast for your glory we are lay missionaries who preach the religion of saint catherine and we can boast that our church is tolerably universal79 we have already seen catherines generosity in buying diderots books and paying him for guarding them as her librarian i should never have expected she says that the purchase of a library would bring me so many fine compliments all the world is bepraising me about m diderots library but now confess you to whom humanity is indebted for the strong support that you have given to innocence and virtue in the person of calas that it would have been cruel and unjust to separate a student from his books80 ah madam replies the most graceful of all courtiers let your imperial majesty forgive me no you are not the aurora borealis you are assuredly the most brilliant star of the north and never was there one so beneficent as you andromeda perseus callisto are not your equals all these stars would have left diderot to die of starvation he was persecuted in his own country and your benefactions came thither to seek him lewis xiv was less munificent than your majesty he rewarded merit in foreign countries but other people pointed it out to him whereas you madame go in search of it and find it for yourself your generous pains to establish freedom of conscience in poland are a piece of beneficence that the human race must ever celebrate81      79 november 1 1773      80 november 1766      81 december 22 1766  when the first partition of poland took place seven years later catherine found that she had not cultivated the friendship of the french philosophers to no purpose the action of the dominant party in poland enabled catherine to take up a line which touched the french philosophers in their tenderest part the polish oligarchy was catholic and imposed crushing disabilities on the noncatholic part of the population at the slightest attempt in favour of the noncatholics king stanislas writes to madame geoffrin of the diet of 1764 there arose such a cry of fanaticism the difficulty as to the naturalisation of foreigners the contempt for roturiers and the oppression of them and catholic intolerance are the three strongest national prejudices that i have to fight against in my countrymen they are at bottom good folk but their education and ignorance render them excessively stubborn on these three heads82 poland in short reproduced in an aggravated and more barbaric form those evils of catholic feudalism in which the philosophers saw the archcurse of their own country catherine took the side of the dissidents and figured as the champion of religious toleration toleration was chief among the philosophic watchwords and seeing that great device on her banners the encyclopædic party asked no further questions so with the significant exception of rousseau they all abstained from the cant about the partition which has so often been heard from european liberals in later days and so with reference to more questionable transactions of an earlier date no one could guess from the writings of the philosophers that catherine had ever been suspected of uniting with her husband in a plot to poison the empress elizabeth and then uniting with her lover in a plot to strangle her husband i am quite aware said voltaire that she is reproached with some bagatelles in the matter of her husband but these are family affairs with which i cannot possibly think of meddling      82 corresp pp 135 144 etc  one curious instance of catherines sensibility to european opinion is connected with her relations to diderot rulhière afterwards well known in literature as a historian began life as secretary to breteuil in the french embassy at st petersburg an eyewitness of the tragedy which seated catherine on the throne he wrote an account of the events of the revolution of 1762 this piquant narrative composed by a young man who had read tacitus and sallust was circulated in manuscript among the salons of paris 1768 diderot had warned rulhière that it was infinitely dangerous to speak about princes that not everything that is true is fit to be told that he could not be too careful of the feelings of a great sovereign who was the admiration and delight of her people catherine pretended that a mere secretary of an embassy could know very little about the real springs and motives of the conspiracy diderot had described the manuscript as painting her in a commanding and imperious attitude there was nothing of that sort she said it was only a question of perishing with a madman or saving oneself with the multitude who insisted on coming to the rescue what she saw was that the manuscript must be bought and she did her best first to buy the author and then when this failed to have him locked up in the bastille she succeeded in neither the french government were not sorry to have a scourge to their hands all that diderot could procure from rulhière was a promise that the work should not be published during the empresss lifetime it was actually given to the world in 1797 when diderot was at st petersburg the empress was importunate to know the contents of the manuscript which he had seen but of which she was unable to procure a copy as far as you are concerned he said if you attach great importance madame to the decencies and virtues the wornout rags of your sex this work is a satire against you but if large views and masculine and patriotic designs concern you more the author depicts you as a great princess the empress answered that this only increased her desire to read the book diderot himself truly enough described it as a historic romance containing a mixed tissue of lies and truths that posterity would compare to a chapter of tacitus83 perhaps the only piece of it that posterity will really value is the page in which the writer describes catherines personal appearance her broad and open brow her large and slightly double chin her hair of resplendent chestnut her eyes of a brilliant brown into which the reflections of the light brought shades of blue pride he says is the true characteristic of her physiognomy the amiability and grace which are there too only seem to penetrating eyes to be the effect of an extreme desire to please and these seductive expressions somehow let the design of seducing be rather too clearly seen      83 satire i sur les caractères etc oeuv vi 313  the first frenchman whom catherine welcomed in person to her court was falconet of whose controversy with the philosopher we shall have a few words to say in a later chapter this introduction to her was due to diderot she had entreated him to find for her a sculptor who would undertake a colossal statue of peter the great falconet was at the height of his reputation in his own country in leaving it he seems to have been actuated by no other motive than the desire of an opportunity of erecting an immense monument of his art though diderots eloquence was not wanting falconet had the proverbial temperament of artistic genius diderot called him the jean jacques of sculpture he had none of the rapacity for money which has distinguished so many artists in their dealings with foreign princes but he was irritable turbulent restless intractable he was a chivalrous defender of poorer brethren in art and he was never a respecter of persons his feuds with betzki the empresss faithful factotum were as acrid as the feuds between voltaire and maupertuis betzki had his own ideas about the statue that was to do honour to the founder of the empire and he insisted that the famous equestrian figure of marcus aurelius should be the model falconet was a man of genius and he retorted that what might be good for marcus aurelius would not be good for peter the great the courtly battle does not concern us though some of its episodes offer tempting illustrations of biting french malice falconet had his own way and after the labour of many years a colossus of bronze bestrode a charger rearing on a monstrous mass of unhewn granite catherine took the liveliest interest in her artists work frequently visiting his studio and keeping up a busy correspondence with him as with the others she insisted that he should stand on no ceremony and should not spin out his lines with epithets on which she set not the smallest value she may be said to have encouraged him to pester her with a host of his obscure countrymen in search of a living and a little colony of frenchmen whose names tell us nothing hung about the russian capital diderots account of this group of his countrymen at st petersburg recalls the picture of a corresponding group at berlin most of the french who are here rend and hate one another and bring contempt both on themselves and their nation tis the most unworthy set of rascals that you can imagine84      84 oeuv xx 58  diderot reached st petersburg towards the end of 1773 and he remained some five months until the beginning of march 1774 his impulsive nature was shocked by a chilly welcome from falconet but at the palace his reception was most cordial as his arrival had been eagerly anticipated the empress always professed to detest ceremony and state in a letter to madame geoffrin she insists as we have already seen her doing with falconet on being treated to no oriental prostrations as if she were at the court of persia there is nothing in the world so ugly and detestable as greatness when i go into a room you would say that i am the head of medusa everybody turns to stone i constantly scream like an eagle against such ways yet the more i scream the less are they at their ease if you came into my room i should say to youmadame be seated let us chatter at our ease you would have a chair in front of me there would be a table between us et puis des bâtons rompus tant et plus cest mon fort  this is an exact description of her real behaviour to diderot on most days he was in her society from three in the afternoon until five or six etiquette was banished diderots simplicity and vehemence were as conspicuous and as unrestrained at tsarskoeselo as at grandval or the rue taranne if for a moment the torrent of his improvisation was checked by the thought that he was talking to a great lady catherine encouraged him to go on allons she cried entre hommes tout est permis the philosopher in the heat of exposition brought his hands down upon the imperial knees with such force and iteration that catherine complained that he made them black and blue she was sometimes glad to seek shelter from such zealous enforcement of truth behind a strong table watchful diplomatists could not doubt that such interviews must have reference to politics cathcart the english ambassador writes to his government that m diderot is still with the empress at tsarskoeselo pursuing his political intrigues and amazing as it may seem the french minister and the french ambassador both of them believed that they had found in this dreaming rhapsodical genius a useful diplomatic instrument the interviews between catherine and diderot follow one another incessantly and go on from day to day he told me and i have reasons for believing that he is speaking the truth that he has painted the danger of the alliance of russia with the king of prussia and the advantage of an alliance with us the empress far from blaming this freedom encouraged him by word and gesture you are not fond of that prince she said to diderot no he replied he is a great man but a bad king and a dealer in counterfeit coin oh said she laughing i have had my share of his coin  the first partition of poland had been finally consummated in the polish diet in the autumn of 1773 a few weeks before diderots arrival at st petersburg lewis xv now drawing very near to his end and daiguillon his minister had some uneasiness at this opening of the great era of territorial revolution and looked about in a shiftless way for an ally against russia and prussia england sensibly refused to stir then france as we see was only anxious to detach catherine from frederick all was shiftless and feeble and the french government can have known little of the empress if they thought that diderot was the man to affect her strong and positive mind she told ségur in later years what success diderot had with her as a politician  i talked much and frequently with him said catherine but with more curiosity than profit if i had believed him everything would have been turned upside down in my kingdom legislation administration financesall to be turned topsyturvy to make room for impracticable theories yet as i listened more than i talked any witness who happened to be present would have taken him for a severe pedagogue and me for his humble scholar probably he thought so himself for after some time seeing that none of these great innovations were made which he had recommended he showed surprise and a haughty kind of dissatisfaction then speaking openly i said to him mr diderot i have listened with the greatest pleasure to all that your brilliant intelligence has inspired and with all your great principles which i understand very well one would make fine books but very bad business you forget in all your plans of reform the difference in our positions you only work on paper which endures all things it opposes no obstacle either to your imagination or to your pen but i poor empress as i am work on the human skin which is irritable and ticklish to a very different degree i am persuaded that from this moment he pitied me as a narrow and vulgar spirit for the future he only talked about literature and politics vanished from our conversation85      85 ségur iii 34  catherine was mistaken as we shall see in supposing that diderot ever thought her less than the greatest of men cathcart the english ambassador writes in a sour strain all his letters are filled with panegyrics of the empress whom he depicts as above humanity his flatteries of the grand duke have been no less gross but be it said to the young princes honour he has shown as much contempt for such flatteries as for the mischievous principles of this pretended philosopher  frederick tells dalembert that though the empress overwhelms diderot with favours people at st petersburg find him tiresome and disputatious and talking the same rigmarole over and over again in her letters to voltaire catherine lets nothing of this be seen she finds diderots imagination inexhaustible and ranks him among the most extraordinary men that have ever lived she delights in his conversation and his visits have given her the most uncommon pleasure all this was perhaps true enough catherine probably rated the philosopher at his true worth as a great talker and a singular and original genius but this did not prevent her any more than it need prevent us from seeing the limits and measure she was not one of the weaker heads who can never be content without either wholesale enthusiasm or wholesale disparagement  diderot had a companion who pleased her better than diderot himself grimm came to st petersburg at this time to pay his first visit and had a great success the empress wrote madame geoffrin to king stanislas lavished all her graces on grimm and he has everything that is needed to make him worthy of them diderot has neither the fineness of perception nor the delicate tact that grimm has and so he has not had the success of grimm diderot is always in himself and sees nothing in other people that has not some reference to himself he is a man of a great deal of understanding but his nature and turn of mind make him good for nothing and more than that would make him a very dangerous person in any employment grimm is quite the contrary86      86 mouys corresp du roi stanislas p 501  in truth as we have said before grimm was one of the shrewdest heads in the encyclopædic party he had much knowledge a judgment both solid and acute and a certain easy fashion of social commerce free from raptures and full of good sense yet he was as devoted and ecstatic in his feelings about the empress as his more impetuous friend here he says was no conversation of leaps and bounds in which idleness traverses a whole gallery of ideas that have no connection with one another and weariness draws you away from one object to skim a dozen others they were talks in which all was bound together often by imperceptible threads but all the more naturally as not a word of what was to be said had been led up to or prepared beforehand grimm cannot find words to describe her verve her stream of brilliant sallies her dashing traits her eagles coup doeil no wonder that he used to quit her presence so electrified as to pass half the night in marching up and down his room beset and pursued by all the fine and marvellous things that had been said how much of all this is true and how much of it is the voice of the bewildered courtier it might be hard to decide but the rays of the imperial sun did not so far blind his prudence as to make him accept a pressing invitation to remain permanently in catherines service when diderot quitted st petersburg grimm went to italy after an interlude there he returned to russia and was at once restored to high favour when the time came for him to leave her the empress gave him a yearly pension of two thousand roubles or about ten thousand livres and with a minute considerateness that is said not to be common among the great she presently ordered that it should be paid in such a form that he should not lose on the exchange between france and russia whether she had a special object in keeping grimm in good humour we hardly know what is certain is that from 1776 until the fall of the french monarchy she kept up a voluminous correspondence with him and that he acted as an unofficial intermediary between her and the ministers at versailles every day she wrote down what she wished to say to grimm and at the end of every three months these daily sheets were made into a bulky packet and despatched to paris by a special courier who returned with a similar packet from grimm this intercourse went on until the very height of the revolution when grimm at last in february 1792 fled from paris the empresss helpful friendship continued to the end of her life 179687      87 mémoire historique printed in vol i of the new edition     1877 of the correspondence of grimm and diderot by m maurice     tourneux  diderot arrived at the hague on his return from russia in the first week of april 1774 after making a rapid journey of seven hundred leagues in three weeks and a day dalembert had been anxious that frederick of prussia should invite diderot to visit him at berlin frederick had told him that intrepid reader as he was he could not endure to read diderots books there reigns in them a tone of selfsufficiency and an arrogance which revolt the instinct of my freedom it was not in such a style that plato aristotle cicero locke gassendi bayle and newton wrote dalembert replied that the king would judge more favourably of the philosophers person than of his works that he would find in diderot along with much fecundity imagination and knowledge a gentle heat and a great deal of amenity88 frederick however did not send the invitation and diderot willingly enough went homeward by the northern route by which he had come he passed königsberg where if he had known it kant was then meditating the critic of pure reason it is hardly probable that diderot met the famous worthy who was destined to deal so heavy a blow to the encyclopædic way of thinking and to leave a name not less illustrious than frederick or catherine a court official was sent in charge of the philosopher the troubles of posting by the searoad between königsberg and memel had moved him to the composition of some very bad verses on his first journey and the horror of crossing the dwina inspired others that were no better on his return the weather was hard four carriages were broken in the journey he expected to be drowned as the ice creaked under his horses feet at riga and he thought that he had broken an arm and a shoulder as he crossed the ferry at mittau but all ended well and he found himself once more under the roof of prince galitzin at the hague hence he wrote to his wife and his other friends in paris that it must be a great consolation to them to know that he was only separated from them by a journey of four days that journey was not taken however for nearly four months diderot had promised the empress that he would publish a set of the regulations for the various institutions which she had founded for the improvement of her realm this could only be done or could best be done in holland his life there was spent as usual in the slavery of proofsheets tempered by daily bursts of conversation rhapsody discussion and dreamy contemplation he made the acquaintance of a certain björnstähl a professor of oriental languages at the university of lund in sweden and a few pages in this obscure writers obscure book contain the only glimpse that we have of the philosopher on his travels89 diderot was as ecstatic in conversation as we know him to have been in his correspondence in praise of the august friend whom he had left the least of his compliments was that she united the charms of cleopatra to the soul of cæsar or sometimes it was to the soul of brutus      88 dalembert au roi de prusse feb 14 1774      89 briefe aus seinen ausländischen reisen iii 217233     leipsic 1780a german translation from the swedish  at the hague says björnstähl we go about every day with m diderot he has views extending over an incredibly wide field possesses a vivacity that i cannot describe is pleasant and friendly in intercourse and has new and unusual observations to make on every subject who could fail to prize him he is so bright so full of instruction has so many new thoughts and suggestions that nobody can help admiring him but willingly as he talks when one goes to him he shows to little advantage in large companies and that is why he did not please everybody at st petersburg you will easily see the reason why this incomparable man in such companies where people talk of fashion of clothes of frippery and all other sorts of triviality neither gives pleasure to others nor finds pleasure himself and the friendly swede rises to the height of generalisation in the quaint maxim where an empty head shines there a thoroughly cultivated man comes too short  björnstähl quotes a saying of voltaire that diderot would have been a poet if he had not wished to be a philosophera remark that was rather due perhaps to voltaires habitual complaisance than to any serious consideration of diderots qualities but if he could not be a poet himself at least he knew pindar and homer by heart and at the hague he never stirred out without a horace in his pocket and though no poet he was full of poetic sentiment scheveningen the little bathingplace a short distance from the hague was diderots favourite spot it was there he writes that i used to see the horizon dark the sea covered with white haze the waves rolling and tumbling and far out the poor fishermen in their great clumsy boats on the shore a multitude of women frozen with cold or apprehension trying to warm themselves in the sun when the work was at an end and the boats had landed the beach was covered with fish of every kind these good people have the simplicity the openness the filial and fraternal piety of old time as the men come down from their boats their wives throw themselves into their arms they embrace their fathers and their little ones each loads himself with fish the son tosses his father a codfish or a salmon which the old man carries off in triumph to his cottage thanking heaven that it has given him so industrious and worthy a son when he has gone indoors the sight of the fish rejoices the old mans mate it is quickly cut in pieces the less lucky neighbours invited it is speedily eaten and the room resounds with thanks to god and cheerful songs90      90 xvii 449  these scenes with their seabackground their animation their broad strokes of the simple tender and real in life may well have been after diderots own heart he often told me says björnstähl that he never found the hours pass slowly in the company of a peasant or a cobbler or any handicraftsman but that he had many a time found them pass slowly enough in the society of a courtier for of the one he said one can always ask about useful and necessary things but the other is mostly so far as anything useful is concerned empty and void  the characteristics of the european capitals a century ago were believed to be hit off in the saying that each of them would furnish the proper cure for a given defect of character the overelegant were to go to london savages to paris bigots to berlin rebels to st petersburg people who were too sincere to rome the overlearned to brussels and people who were too lively to the hague yet the dulness thus charged against the hague was not universally admitted impartial travellers assigned to the talk of cultivated circles there a rank not below that of similar circles in france and england some went even farther and declared holland to have a distinct advantage because people were never embarrassed either by the levity and sparkling wit of france on the one hand nor by the depressing reserve and taciturnity of england on the other91 yet holland was fully within the sphere of the great intellectual commonwealth of the west and was as directly accessible to the literary influences of the time as it had ever been if diderot had inquired into the vernacular productions of the country he would have found that here also the wave of reaction against french conventions the tide of english simplicity and domestic sentimentalism had passed into literature the spectator and clarissa harlowe inspired the writers of holland as they had inspired diderot himself92      91 george forsters ansichten vom niederrhein etc ii 396     1790      92 jonckbloets gesch d niederland lit german trans ii     502 etc  in erudition it was still what even after the death of scaliger it had remained through the seventeenth century the most learned state of europe and the elder hemsterhuys with such pupils as ruhnken and valckenaer kept up as well as he could the scholarly tradition of gronovius and grævius but the eighteenth century was not the century of erudition scholarship had given way to speculation  among the interesting persons whom diderot saw at the hague the most interesting is the amiable and learned son of the elder hemsterhuys himself by the way not dutch but the son of a frenchman hemsterhuys had been greatly interested in what he had heard of diderots character93 though we have no record of the impression that was made by personal acquaintance if diderot was playfully styled the french socrates the younger hemsterhuys won from his friends the name of the dutch plato the hollanders pointed to this meditative figure to his great attainments in the knowledge of ancient literature and art to his mellowed philosophising to his gracious and wellbred style as a proof that their country was capable of developing both the strength and the sensibility of human nature to their highest point94 and he has a place in the history of modern speculation as we think of him and diderot discussing we feel ourselves to be placed at a point that seems to command the diverging streams and eddying currents of the time in this pair two great tides of thought meet for a moment and then flow on in their deep appointed courses for hemsterhuys born a platonist to the core became a leader of the reaction against the french philosophy of illuminationof sensation of experience of the verifiable he contributed a marked current to the mysticism and pietism which crept over germany before the french revolution and to that religious philosophy which became a point of patriotic honour both in germany and at the russian court after the revolutionary war had seemed to identify the rival philosophy of the encyclopædists with the victorious fury of the national enemy jacobi a chief of the mystic tribe had begun the attack on the french with weapons avowedly borrowed from the sentimentalism of rousseau but by and by he found in hemsterhuys more genuinely intellectual arguments for his vindication of feeling and the heart against the encyclopædist claim for the supremacy of the understanding      93 oeuv phil de fr hemsterhuys iii 141 ed meyboom      94 forster ii 398 galiani corresp ii 189  diderots hostess at the hague is a conspicuous figure in the history of this movement prince galitzin had married the daughter of fredericks fieldmarshal schmettau goethe who saw her 1797 many years after diderot was dead describes her as one of those whom one cannot understand without seeing as a person not rightly judged unless considered not only in connection but in conflict with her time if she was remarkable to goethe when fifty years had set their mark upon her she was even more so to the impetuous diderot in all the flush and intellectual excitement of her youth it was to the brilliance and versatility of the princess galitzin that her husbands house owed its consideration and its charm she is very lively said diderot very gay very intelligent more than young enough instructed and full of talents she has read she knows several languages as germans usually do she plays on the clavecin and sings like an angel she is full of expressions that are at once ingenuous and piquant she is exceedingly kindhearted95 but he could not persuade her to take his philosophy on trust diderot is said by the princesss biographer to have been a fervid proselytiser eager to make people believe his poems about eternally revolving atoms through whose accidental encounter the present ordering of the world was developed the princess met his brilliant eloquence with a demand for proof her everrepeated why and how are said to have shown the hero of atheism his complete emptiness and weakness96 in the long run diderot

of the peculiar devotion and admiration which a clever and sympathetic woman may arouse in philosophic minds of a certain calibrein a condillac a joubert a dalembert a mill though hemsterhuys himself never advanced from a philosophy of religion to the active region of dogmatic professions his disciple could not find contentment on his austere heights in the very year of diderots death 1784 the princess galitzin became a catholic and her son became not only a catholic but a zealous missionary of the faith in america      95 oeuv xix 342      96 dr katerkamps denkwürdigkeiten aus dem leben

noble in sweden as it was in russia diderot replied that he would greatly have liked to see on the throne the sovereign gustavus iii who was so nearly coming to pay him a visit on his own fourth storey in paris but he confessed that he was growing homesick and stockholm must remain unvisited in september 1774 diderot set his face homewards i shall gain my fireside he wrote on the eve of his

let us try to economise the seven that are left for the repose and the small happinesses that a man may promise himself on the wrong side of sixty the guess was a good one diderot lived ten years more and although his own work in the world was done they were years of great moment both to france and the world they witnessed the establishment of a republic in the american colonies and they witnessed the final stage in the decay of the old monarchy in france turgot had been made controllergeneral in the months before diderots return and turgots ministry was the last serious experiment in the direction of orderly reform the crash that followed resounded almost as loudly at st petersburg and in holland as in france itself and catherine in 1792 ordered all the busts of voltaire that had adorned the saloons and corridors of her palace to be thrust ignominiously down into the cellars     chapter v  helvÉtius   before proceeding to the closing chapter of diderots life i propose to give a short account of three remarkable books of all of which he was commonly regarded as the inspirer which were all certainly the direct and natural work of the encyclopædic school and which all play a striking part in the intellectual commotions of the century  the great attack on the encyclopædia was made as we have already seen in 1758 after the publication of the seventh volume the same prosecution levelled an angrier blow at helvétiuss famous treatise lesprit it is not too much to say that of all the proscribed books of the century that excited the keenest resentment this arose partly because it came earliest in the literature of attack it was an audacious surprise the censor who had allowed it to pass the ordeal of official approval was cashiered and the author was dismissed from an honorary post in the queens household97 the indictment described the book as the code of the most hateful and infamous passions as a collection into one cover of everything that impiety could imagine calculated to engender hatred against christianity and catholicism the court condemned the book to be burnt and as if to show that the motive was not mere discontent with helvétiuss paradoxes the same fire consumed voltaires fine poem on natural religion less prejudiced authorities thought nearly as ill of the book as the lawyers of the parliament and the doctors of the sorbonne had thought rousseau pronounced it detestable wrote notes in refutation of its principles and was inspired by hatred of its doctrine to compose some of the most fervid pages in the savoyard vicars glowing profession of faith98 even diderot though his friendly feeling for the writer and his general leaning to speculative hardihood warped his judgment so far as to make him rank lesprit along with montesquieus spirit of laws and buffons natural history among the great books of the century still perceived and showed that the whole fabric rested on a foundation of paradox and that though there might be many truths of detail in the book very many of its general principles are false99 turgot described it as a book of philosophy without logic literature without taste and morality without goodness100      97 barbier vii 137      98 oeuv xii 301      99 ib ii 267274      100 ib ii 795  in the same weighty piece of criticism which contains in two or three pages so much permanently valuable truth turgot proceedswhen people wish to attack intolerance and injustice it is essential in the first place to rest upon just ideas for inquisitors have an interest in being intolerant and viziers and subviziers have an interest in maintaining all the abuses of the government as they are the strongest you only give them a good excuse by sounding the tocsin against them right and left i hate despotism as much as most people but it is not by declamations that despotism ought to be attacked and even in despotism there are degrees there is a multitude of abuses in despotism in which the princes themselves have no interest there are others which they only allow themselves to practise because public opinion is not yet fixed as to their injustice and their mischievous consequences people deserve far better from a nation for attacking these abuses with clearness with courage and above all by interesting the sentiment of humanity than for any amount of eloquent reproach where there is no insult there is seldom any offence there is no form of government without certain drawbacks which the governments themselves would fain have it in their power to remedy or without abuses which they nearly all intend to repress at least at some future day we may therefore serve them all by treating questions of the public good in a calm and solid style not coldly still less with extravagance but with that interesting warmth which springs from a profound feeling for justice and love of order101      101 oeuv ii 795798  of course it is a question whether even in 1758 a generation before the convulsion it was possible for the french monarchy spontaneously to work out the long list of indispensable improvements still at that date turgot might be excused for thinking that the progress which he desired might be attained without the violence to which helvétiuss diatribes so unmistakably pointed his words in any case are worth quoting for their own grave and universal sense and because they place us exactly at the point of view for regarding lesprit rightly he seizes on its political aspect its assault on government and the social ordering of the time as containing the books real drift in this as in the rest of the destructive literature of the first sixty years of the century the church was no doubt that part of the social foundations against which the assault was most direct and most vindictive and it was the church in the case of helvétiuss book that first took alarm indeed we may say that from the very nature of things in whatever direction the revolutionary host moved they were sure to find themselves confronted by the church it lay across the track of light at every point voltaire pierced its dogma rousseau shamed its irreligious temper diderot brought into relief the vicious absoluteness of its philosophy then came helvétius and holbach not merely with criticism but with substitutes holbach brought a new dogma of the universe matter and motion and fortuitous shapes helvétius brought a theory of human character and a new analysis of moralsinterest the basis of justice pleasure the true interpretation of interest and character the creature of education and laws  to press such positions as these was to recast the whole body of opinions on which society rested as the church was the organ of the old opinions helvétiuss book was instantly seized by the ecclesiastical authorities in accordance with a perfectly right instinct and was made the occasion for the first violent raid upon a wholesale scale when however we look beyond the smoke of the ecclesiastical battle and weigh lesprit itself on its own merits we see quite plainly that helvétius was thinking less of the theological disputes of the day than of bringing the philosophy of sensation the philosophy of locke and condillac into the political field and of deriving from it new standards and new forces for social reconstruction and in spite of its shallowness and paradoxes his book did contain the one principle on which if it had been generally accepted the inevitable transition might have taken place without a reign of terror  it was commonly said by his enemies and by his alarmed friends that vanity and a restless overweening desire for notoriety was the inspiring motive of helvétius he came from a german stock his greatgrandfather settled in holland where he cured his patients by cunning elixirs by the powder of ground stags horn and the subtle virtues of crocodiles teeth his grandfather went to push his fortunes in paris where he persuaded the public to accept the healing properties of ipecacuanha and lewis xiv 1689 gave him a short patent for that drug102 the medical tradition of the family was maintained in a third generation for helvétiuss father was one of the physicians of the queen and on one occasion performed the doubtful service to humanity of saving the life of lewis xv helvétius who was born in 1715 turned aside from the calling of his ancestors and by means of the favour which his father enjoyed at court obtained a position as farmergeneral this at once made him a wealthy man but wealth was not enough to satisfy him without fame he made attempts in various directions in each case following the current of popularity for the hour maupertuis was the hero of a day and helvétius accordingly applied himself to become a geometer voltaires brilliant success brought poetry into fashion and so helvétius wrote half a dozen long cantos on happiness montesquieu caught and held the ear of the town by the spirit of laws 1748 and helvétius was acute enough to perceive that speculation upon society would be the great durable interest of his time103 he at once set to work and this time he set to work without hurry in 1751 he threw up his place as farmergeneral and with it an income of between two or three thousand pounds a year104 and he then devoted himself for the next seven years to the concoction of a work that was designed to bring him immortal glory helvétius sweated a long time to write a single chapter if we may believe one of his intimates he would compose and recompose a passage a score of times more facile writers looked at him with amazement in his countryhouse ruminating for whole mornings on a single page and pacing his room for hours to kindle his ideas or to strike out some curious form of expression105 the circle of his friends in paris amused themselves in watching his attempts to force the conversation into the channel of the question that happened to occupy him for the moment they gave him the satisfaction of discussion and then they drew him to express his own views then says marmontel he threw himself into the subject with warmthas simple as natural as sincere as he is systematic and sophistic in his works nothing is less like the ingenuousness of his character and ordinary life than the artificial and premeditated simplicity of his works helvétius was the very opposite in his character of what he professes to believe he was liberal generous unostentatious and benevolent106      102 see jals dict crit p 676 there is a comparison in     lesprit which we may assume to have been due to family     reminiscence like those physicians who in their jealousy of the     discovery of the emetic abused the credulity of a few prelates to     excommunicate a remedy of which the service is so prompt and so     salutary etcii 23      103 hume however tells a story to the effect that helvétius     tried to dissuade montesquieu from publishing his great book as     being altogether unworthy of his previous reputation      104 barbier v 57      105 morellet i 71      106 marmontel ii 116  as it happens there is a very different picture in one of diderots writings while diderot was on a journey he fell in with a lady who knew helvétiuss country she told us that the philosopher at his country seat was the unhappiest of men he is surrounded by peasants and by neighbours who hate him they break the windows of his mansion they ravage his property at night they cut his trees and break down his fences he dares not sally out to shoot a rabbit without an escort you will ask me why all this it comes of an unbridled jealousy about his game his predecessors kept the estate in order with a couple of men and a couple of guns helvétius has fourandtwenty and yet he cannot guard his property the men have a small premium for every poacher that they catch and they resort to every possible vexation in order to multiply their sorry profit they are for that matter no better than so many poachers who draw wages the border of his woods was peopled with the unfortunate wretches who had been driven from their homes into pitiful hovels it is these repeated acts of tyranny that have raised up against him enemies of every kind and all the more insolent as madame n said for having found out that the good philosopher is a trifle pusillanimous i cannot see what he has gained by such a way of managing his property he is alone on it he is hated he is in a constant state of fright ah how much wiser our good madame geoffrin when she said of a trial that tormented her finish my case they want my money i have some give them money and what can i do better with money than buy tranquillity with it in helvétiuss place i should have said they kill a few hares or a few rabbits let them kill the poor creatures have no shelter save my woods let them remain there107      107 voyage à bourbonne oeuv xvii 344  on the other hand there are wellattested stories of helvétiuss munificence there is one remarkable testimony to his wide renown for goodnature after the younger pretender had been driven out of france he had special reasons on some occasion for visiting paris he wrote to helvétius that he had heard of him as a man of the greatest probity and honour in france and that to helvétius therefore he would trust himself helvétius did not refuse the dangerous compliment and he concealed the prince for two years in his house108 he was as benevolent where his vanity was less pleasantly flattered more than one man of letters including marivaux was indebted to him for a yearly pension and his house was as open to the philosophic tribe as holbachs morellet has told us that the conversation was not so good and so consecutive as it was at the barons the mistress of the house drawing to her side the people who pleased her best and not choosing the worst of the company rather broke the party up she was no fonder of philosophy than madame holbach was fond of it but the latter by remaining in a corner without saying a word or else chatting in a low voice with her friends was in nobodys way whereas madame helvétius with her beauty her originality and her piquant turn of nature threw out anything like philosophic discussion helvétius had not the art of sustaining or animating it he used to take one of us to a window open some question that he had in hand and try to draw out either some argument for his own view or some objection to it for he was always composing his book in society or more frequently still he would go out shortly after dinner to the opera or elsewhere leaving his wife to do the honours of the house109 in spite of all this helvétiuss social popularity became considerable this however followed his attainment of celebrity for when lesprit was published diderot scarcely met him twice in a year and dalemberts acquaintance with him was of the slightest and there must we should suppose have been some difficulty in cordially admitting even a penitent member of the abhorred class of farmersgeneral among the esoteric group of the philosophic opposition there was much point in turgots contemptuous question why he should be thankful to a declaimer like helvétius who showers vehement insults and biting sarcasms on governments in general and then makes it his business to send to frederick the great a whole colony of revenue clerks it was the stringent proceedings against his book that brought to helvétius both vogue with the public and sympathy from the encyclopædic circle      108 burtons hume ii 464      109 morellet i 141 a peculiarly graphic account of madame     helvétius in her later years is to be found in mrs adams     letters quoted in partons life of franklin ii 429  to us it is interesting to know that helvétius had a great admiration for england holbach as we have already seen above vol i p 270 did not share this and he explained his friends enthusiasm by the assumption that what helvétius really saw in our free land was the persecution that his book had drawn upon him in france110 horace walpole in one of his letters announced to sir horace mann that helvétius was coming to england bringing two miss helvétiuses with fifty thousand pounds apiece to bestow on two immaculate members of our most august and incorruptible senate if he could find two in this virtuous age who would condescend to accept his money well he adds in a spirit of sensible protest against these unprofitable international comparisons we may be dupes to french follies but they are ten times greater fools to be the dupes of our virtues111 gibbon met helvétius 1763 and found him a sensible man an agreeable companion and the worthiest creature in the world besides the merits of having a pretty wife and a hundred thousand livres a year warburton was invited to dine with him at lord mansfields but he could not bring himself to countenance a professed patron of atheism a rascal and a scoundrel112      110 oeuv xix 187      111 corresp iv 119      112 walpoles corresp iv 217  let us turn to the book which had the honour of bringing all this censure upon its author whether vanity was or was not helvétiuss motive the vanity of an author has never accounted for the interest of his public and we may be sure that neither those who approved nor those who abhorred would have been so deeply and so universally stirred unless they had felt that he touched great questions at the very quick and first let a word be said as to the form of his book  grimm was certainly right in saying that a man must be without taste or sense to find either the morality or the colouring of diderot in lesprit it is tolerably clear that helvétius had the example of fontenelle before his eyesfontenelle who had taught astronomical systems in the forms of elegant literature and of whom it was said that il nous enjôle à la vérité he coaxes us to the truth lesprit is perhaps the most readable book upon morals that ever was written for persons who do not care that what they read shall be scientifically true hume who by the way had been invited by helvétius to translate the book into english wrote to adam smith that it was worth reading not for its philosophy which he did not highly value but for its agreeable composition113 helvétius intended that it should be this and accordingly he stuffed it with stories and anecdotes many of them are very poor many are inapposite some are not very decent others are spoiled in telling but still stories and anecdotes they remain and they carry a lightminded reader more or less easily from page to page and chapter to chapter but an ingenuous student of ethics who should take helvétius seriously could hardly be reconciled by lively anecdotes to what in his particular formula seems a most depressing doctrine madame roland read the celebrated book in her romantic girlhood and her impression may be taken for that of most generous natures helvétius made me wretched he annihilated the most ravishing illusions he showed me everywhere repulsive selfinterest yet what sagacity she continues i persuaded myself that helvétius painted men such as they had become in the corruption of society i judged that it was good to feed ones self on such an author in order to be able to frequent what is called the world without being its dupe but i took good care not to adopt his principles merely in order to know man properly socalled i felt myself capable of a generosity which he never recognises with what delight i confronted his theories with the great traits in history and the virtues of the heroes that history has immortalised114      113 burton ii 57      114 oeuv de mdme roland i 108  we have ventured to say that lesprit contained the one principle capable of supplying such a system of thinking about society as would have taught the french of that time in what direction to look for reforms there is probably no instance in literature of a writer coming so close to a decisive body of salutary truth and then losing himself in the byways of the most repulsive paradox that a perverse ingenuity could devise we are able to measure how grievous was this miscarriage by reflecting that the same instrument which helvétius actually held in his hand but did not know how to use was taken from him by a man of genius in another country and made to produce reforms that saved england from a convulsion nobody pretends that helvétius discovered utilitarianism humes name for instance occurs too often in his pages for even the author himself to have dreamed that his principle of utility was a new invention of his own it would as mill has said imply ignorance of the history of philosophy and of general literature not to be aware that in all ages of philosophy one of its schools has been utilitarian not only from the time of epicurus but long before but what is certain and what would of itself be enough to entitle helvétius to consideration is that from helvétius the idea of general utility as the foundation of morality was derived by that strong and powerful english thinker who made utilitarianism the great reforming force of legislation and the foundation of jurisprudence bentham himself distinctly avowed the source of his inspiration115      115 to that book lesprit mr bentham has often been heard     to say he stood indebted for no small portion of the zeal and     ardour with which he advocated his happinessproducing theory it     was from thence he took encouragement  it was there he learned to     persevere etc etcdeontology i 296  a fatal discredit fastened upon a book which yet had in it so much of the root of the matter from the unfortunate circumstance that helvétius tacked the principle of utility on to the very crudest farrago to be found in the literature of psychology what happened then was that rousseau swept into the field with a hollow version of a philosophy of reform so eloquently loftily and powerfully enforced as to carry all before it the democracy of sentimentalism took the place that ought to have been filled in the literature of revolutionary preparation by the democracy of utility rousseaus fiction of the sovereignty of the people was an arbitrary and intrinsically sterile rendering of the real truth in helvétiuss illstarred book  to establish the proper dependence of laws upon one another says helvétius it is indispensable to be able to refer them all to a single principle such as that of the utility of the public that is to say of the greatest number of men submitted to the same form of government a principle of which no one realises the whole extent and fertility a principle that contains all morality and legislation116      116 disc ii chap xvii  a man is just when all his actions tend to the public good to be virtuous it is necessary to unite nobleness of soul with an enlightened understanding whoever combines these gifts conducts himself by the compass of public utility this utility is the principle of all human virtues and the foundation of all legislations it ought to inspire the legislator and to force the nations to submit to his laws117      117 ib ii 6  the principle of public utility is invariable though it is pliable in its application to all the different positions in which in their succession a nation may find itself118      118 disc ii 17  the public interest is that of the greatest number and this is the foundation on which the principles of sound morality ought invariably to rest119      119 ib ii chap xxiii  these extracts and extracts in the same sense might easily be multiplied show us the basis on which helvétius believed himself to be building why did bentham raise upon it a fabric of such value to mankind while helvétius covered it with useless paradox the answer is that bentham approached the subject from the side of a practical lawyer and proceeded to map out the motives and the actions of men in a systematic and objective classification to which the principle of utility gave him the key helvétius on the other hand instead of working out the principle that actions are good or bad according as they do or do not serve the public interest of the greatest number contented himself with reiterating in as many ways as possible the proposition that selflove fixes our measure of virtue the next thing to do after settling utility as the standard of virtue and defining interest as a term applied to whatever can procure us pleasures and deliver us from pains120 was clearly to do what bentham didto marshal pleasures and pains in logical array instead of this helvétius starting from the proposition that to judge is to feel launched out into a complete theory of human character which laboured under at least two fatal defects first it had no root in a contemplation of the march of collective humanity and second it considered only the purely egoistic impulses to the exclusion of the opposite half of human tendencies apart from these radical deficiencies helvétius fell headlong into a fallacy which has been common enough among the assailants of the principle of utility namely of confounding the standard of conduct with its motive and insisting that because utility is the test of virtue therefore the prospect of selfgratification is the only inducement that makes men prefer virtue to vice      120 ib ii 1 note b  this was what madame du deffand called telling everybodys secret we approve conduct in proportion as it conduces to our interest friendship espritdecorps patriotism humanity are names for qualities that we prize more or less highly in proportion as they come more or less close to our own happiness and the scale of our preferences is in the inverse ratio of the number of those who benefit by the given act if it affects the whole of humanity or of our country our approval is less warmly stirred than if it were an act specially devoted to our own exclusive advantage if you want therefore to reach men and to shape their conduct for the public good you must affect them through their pleasures and pains  to this position which roused a universal indignation that amazed the author there is no doubt a true side it is worth remembering for instance that all penal legislation in so far as deterrent and not merely vindictive assumes in all who come whether actually or potentially within its sphere the very doctrine that covered helvétius with odium and there is more to be said than this as m charles comte has expressed it if the strength with which we resent injury were not in the ratio of the personal risk that we run we should hardly have the means of selfpreservation and if the acts which injure the whole of humanity gave us pain equal to that of acts that injure us directly we should be of all beings the most miserable for we should be incessantly tormented by conduct that we should be powerless to turn aside and again if the benefits of which we are personally the object did not inspire in us a more lively gratitude than those which we spread over all mankind we should probably experience few preferences and extend few preferences to others and in that case egoism would grow to its most overwhelming proportions121      121 traité de législation i 243  this aspect of helvétiuss doctrine however is one of those truths which is only valid when taken in connection with a whole group of different truths and it was exactly that way of asserting a position in itself neither indefensible nor unmeaning which left the position open to irresistible attack helvétiuss errors had various roots and may be set forth in as many ways the most general account of it is that even if he had insisted on making selflove the strongest ingredient in our judgment of conduct he ought at least to have given some place to sympathy for though it is possible to contend that sympathy is only an indirect kind of selflove or a shadow cast by selflove still it is selflove so transformed as to imply a wholly different set of convictions and to require a different name  lesprit is one of the most striking instances in literature of the importance of care in choosing the right way of presenting a theory to the world it seems as if helvétius had taken pains to surround his doctrine with everything that was most likely to warn men away from it for example he begins a chapter of cardinal importance with the proposition that personal interest is the only motive that could impel a man to generous actions it is as impossible for him to love good for goods sake as evil for the sake of evil the rest of the chapter consists of illustrations of this and what does the reader suppose that they are the first is brutus of all the people in the world he sacrificed his son for the salvation of rome because his passion for his country was stronger than his passion as a father and this passion for his country enlightening him as to the public interest made him see what a service his rigorous example would be to the state the other instances of the chapter point the same moral that true virtue consists in suppressing inducements to gratify domestic or friendly feeling when that gratification is hostile to the common weal122      122 disc ii 5  it may be true that the ultimate step in a strictly logical analysis reduces the devotion of the hero or the martyr to a deliberate preference for the course least painful to himself because religion or patriotism or inborn magnanimity have made selfsacrifice the least painful course to him but to call this heroic mood by the name of selflove is to single out what is absolutely the most unimportant element in the transaction and to insist on thrusting it under the onlookers eye as the vital part of the matter and it involves the most perverse kind of distortion for the whole issue and difference between the virtuous man and the vicious man turns not at all upon the fact that each behaves in the way that habit has made least painful to him but upon the fact that habit has made selfishness painful to the first and selfsacrifice painful to the second that selflove has become in the first case transformed into an overwhelming interest in the good of others and in the second not so was there ever a greater perversity than to talk of selfinterest when you mean beneficence or than to insist that because beneficence has become bound up with a mans selflove therefore beneficence is nothing but selflove in disguise as if the fruit or the flower not only depends on a root as one of the conditions among others of its development but is itself actually the root apart from the error in logic what an error in rhetoric to single out the formula best calculated to fill a doctrine with odious associations and then to make that formula the most prominent feature in the exposition without any gain in clearness or definiteness or firmness the reader is deliberately misled towards a form that is exactly the opposite of that which helvétius desired him to accept  in other ways helvétius takes trouble to wound the generous sensibility and affront the sense of his public nothing can be at once more scandalously cynical and more crude than a passage intended to show that if we examine the conduct of women of disorderly life from the political point of view they are in some respects extremely useful to the public that desire to please which makes such a woman go to the draper the milliner and the dressmaker draws an infinite number of workmen from indigence the virtuous women by giving alms to mendicants and criminals are far less wisely advised by their religious directors than the other women by their desire to please the latter nourish useful citizens while the former who at the best are useless are often even downright enemies to the nation123 all this is only a wordy transcript of mandevilles coarse sentences about the sensual courtier that sets no limits to his luxury and the fickle strumpet that invents new fashions every week we cannot wonder that all people who were capable either of generous feeling or comprehensive thinking turned aside even from truth when it was mixed in this amalgam of destructive sophistry and cynical illustration      123 disc ii 15  we can believe how the magnanimous youth of madame roland and others was discouraged by pages sown with mean anecdote helvétius tells us with genuine zest of parmenio saying to philotas at the court of alexander the greatmy son make thyself small before alexander contrive for him now and again the pleasure of setting thee right and remember that it is only to thy seeming inferiority that thou wilt owe his friendship the king of portugal charged a certain courtier to draw up a despatch on an affair with which he had himself dealt comparing the two despatches the king found the courtiers much the better of the two the courtier makes a profound reverence and hastens to take leave of his friends it is all over with me he said the king has found out that i have more brains than he has124 only mediocrity succeeds in the world sir said a father to his son you are getting on in the world and you suppose you must be a person of great merit to lower your pride know to what qualities you owe this success you were born without vices without virtues without character your knowledge is scanty your intelligence is narrow ah what claims you have my son to the goodwill of the world125      124 see diderots truer version oeuv ii 482      125 disc iv 13 etc  it lies beyond the limits of our task to enter into a discussion of helvétiuss transgressions in the region of speculative ethics from any dogmatic point of view their nature is tolerably clear helvétius looked at man individually as if each of us came into the world naked of all antecedent predispositions and independent of the medium around us next he did not see that virtue justice and the other great words of moral science denote qualities that are directly related to the fundamental constitution of human character as diderot said126 he never perceived it to be possible to find in our natural requirements in our existence in our organisation in our sensibility a fixed base for the idea of what is just and unjust virtuous and vicious he clung to the facts that showed the thousand different shapes in which justice and injustice clothed themselves but he closed his eyes on the nature of man in which he would have recognised their character and origin again although his book was expressly written to show that only good laws can form virtuous men and that all the art of the legislator consists in forcing men through the sentiment of selflove to be just to one another127 yet helvétius does not perceive the difficulty of assuming in the moralising legislator a suppression of selflove which he will not concede to the rest of mankind the crucial problem of political constitutions is to counteract the selfishness of a governing class helvétius vaulted over this difficulty by imputing to a legislator that very quality of disinterestedness whose absence in the bulk of the human race he made the fulcrum of his whole moral system128      126 oeuv ii 270      127 disc ii 24      128 as mr henry sidgwick has put thiseven the indefatigable     patience and inexhaustible ingenuity of bentham will hardly succeed     in defeating the sinister conspiracy of selfpreferences in fact     unless a little more sociality is allowed to an average human being     the problem of combining these egoists into an organisation for     promoting their common happiness is like the old task of making     ropes of sand the difficulty that hobbes vainly tried to settle     summarily by absolute despotism is hardly to be overcome by the     democratic artifices of his more inventive successor  into this field of criticism it is not i repeat our present business minutely to enter the only question for us attempting to study the history of opinion is what helvétius meant by his paradoxes and how they came into his mind no serious writer least of all a frenchman in the eighteenth century ever sets out with anything but such an intention for good as is capable of respectable expression and we ask ourselves what good end helvétius proposed to himself of what was he thinking when he perpetrated so singular a misconstruction of his own meaning as that inversion of beneficence into selflove of which we have spoken we can only explain it in one way in saying that it is impossible to love good for goods sake helvétius was thinking of the theologians their doctrine that man is predisposed to love evil for evils sake removes conduct from the sphere of rational motive as evinced in the ordinary course of human experience helvétius met this by contending that both in good and bad conduct men are influenced by their interest and not by mystic and innate predisposition either to good or to evil he sought to bring morals and human conduct out of the region of arbitrary and superstitious assumption into the sphere of observation he thought he was pursuing a scientific as opposed to a theological spirit by placing interest at the foundation of conduct both as matter of fact and of what ought to be the fact instead of placing there the love of god or the action of grace or the authority of the church  we may even say that helvétius shows a positive side which is wanting in the more imposing names of the century here for instance is a passage which in spite of its inadequateness of expression contains an unmistakable germ of true historical appreciationhowever stupid we may suppose the peoples to be it is certain that being enlightened by their interests it was not without motives that they adopted the customs that we find established among some of them the bizarre nature of these customs is connected then with the diversity of interests among these peoples in fact if they have always understood in a confused way by the name of virtue the desire of public happiness if they have in consequence given the name of good to actions that are useful to the country and if the idea of utility has always been privately associated with the idea of virtue then we may be sure that their most ridiculous and even their most cruel customs have always had for their foundation the real or seeming utility of the public good129      129 disc ii 13  if we contrast this with the universal fashion among helvétiuss friends of denouncing the greater portion of the past history of the race we cannot but see that crude as is the language of such a passage it contains the allimportant doctrine which voltaire rousseau and diderot alike ignored that the phenomena of the conduct of mankind even in its most barbarous phases are capable of an intelligible explanation in terms of motive that shall be related to their intellectual forms exactly as the motives of the most polished society are related to the intellectual forms of such a society there are not many passages in all the scores of volumes written in france in the eighteenth century on the origin of society where there is such an approach as this to the modern view  helvétiuss position was that of a man searching for a new basis for morals it was hardly possible for any one in that century to look to religion for such a base and least of all was it possible to helvétius it is fanaticism he says in an elaborately wrought passage that puts arms into the hands of christian princes it orders catholics to massacre heretics it brings out upon the earth again those tortures that were invented by such monsters as phalaris as busiris as nero in spain it piles and lights up the fires of the inquisition while the pious spaniards leave their ports and sail across distant seas to plant the cross and spread desolation in america turn your eyes to north or south to east or west on every side you see the consecrated knife of religion raised against the breasts of women of children of old men and the earth all smoking with the blood of victims immolated to false gods or to the supreme being and presenting one vast sickening horrible charnelhouse of intolerance now what virtuous man what christian if his tender soul is filled with the divine unction that exhales from the maxims of the gospel if he is sensible of the cries of the unhappy and the outcast and has sometimes wiped away their tearswhat man could fail at such a sight to be touched with compassion for humanity and would not use all his endeavour to found probity not on principles so worthy of respect as those of religion but on principles less easily abused such as those of personal interest would be130      130 disc ii 24  this then is the point best worth seizing in a criticism of helvétius the direction of morality by religion had proved a failure helvétius as the organ of reaction against asceticism and against mysticism appealed to positive experience and to mens innate tendency to seek what is pleasurable and to avoid what is painful the scientific imperfection of his attempt is plain but that at any rate is what the attempt signified in his own mind  the same feeling for social reform inspired the second great paradox of lesprit this is to the effect that of all the sources of intellectual difference between one man and another organisation is the least influential intellectual differences are due to diversity of circumstance and to variety in education it is not felicity of organisation that makes a great man there is nobody in whom passion interest education and favourable chance could not have surmounted all the obstacles of an unpromising nature and there is no great man who in the absence of passion interest education and certain chances would not have been a blockhead in spite of his happier organisation it is only in the moral region that we ought to seek the true cause of inequality of intellect genius is no singular gift of nature genius is common it is only the circumstances proper to develop it that are rare the man of genius is simply the product of the circumstances in which he is placed the inequality in intelligence esprit that we observe among men depends on the government under which they live on the times in which their destiny has fallen on the education that they have received on the strength of their desire to achieve distinction and finally on the greatness and fecundity of the ideas which they happen to make the object of their meditations131      131 disc iii  here again it would be easy to show how many qualifications are needed to rectify this egregious overstatement of propositions that in themselves contain the germ of a wholesome doctrine diderot pointed out some of the principal causes of helvétiuss errors summing them up thus the whole of this third discourse seems to imply a false calculation into which the author has failed to introduce all the elements that have a right to be there and to estimate the elements that are there at their right value he has not seen the insurmountable barrier that separates a man destined by nature for a given function from a man who only brings to that function industry interest and attention132 in a work published after his death 1774 and entitled de lhomme helvétius restated at greater length and with a variety of new illustrations this exaggerated position diderot wrote an elaborate series of minute notes in refutation of it taking each chapter point by point and his notes are full of acute and vigorous criticism133 every reader will perceive the kind of answers to which the proposition that character is independent of organisation lies open yet here as in his paradox about selflove helvétius was looking and looking moreover in the right direction for a rational principle of moral judgment moral education and moral improvement of the two propositions though equally erroneous in theory it was certainly less mischievous in practice to pronounce education and institutions to be stronger than original predisposition than to pronounce organisation to be stronger than education and institutions it was allimportant at that moment in france to draw peoples attention to the influence of institutions on character to do that was both to give one of the best reasons for a reform in french institutions and also to point to the spirit in which such a reform should be undertaken if helvétius had contented himself with saying that whatever may be the force of organisation in exceptional natures yet in persons of average organisation these predispositions are capable of being indefinitely modified by education by laws and by institutions then he would not only have said what could not be disproved but he would have said as much as his own object required william godwin drew one of the most important chapters of his once famous treatise on political justice from helvétius but what helvétius exaggerated into a paradox which nobody in his senses could seriously accept godwin expressed as a rational halftruth without which no reformer in education or institutions could fairly think it worth while to set to work134      132 oeuv ii 271      133 ib ii 275456      134 political justice bk i chap ivthe characters of men     originate in their external circumstances  the reader of benjamin constants adolphe that sombre little study of a miserable passion may sometimes be reminded of helvétius it begins with the dry surprise of youth at the opening world for we need time he says to accustom ourselves to the human race such as affectation vanity cowardice interest have made it then we soon learn only to be surprised at our old surprise we find ourselves very well off in our new conditions just as we come to breathe freely in a crowded theatre though on entering it we were almost stifled yet the author of this parching sketch of the distractions of an egoism that just fell short of being complete suddenly flashes on us the unexpected but penetrating and radiant moral la grande question dans la vie cest la douleur que lon causethe great question in life is the pain that we strike into the lives of others we are not seldom refreshed when in the midst of helvétiuss narrowest grooves by some similar breath from the wider air among the host of sayings true false trivial profound which are scattered over the pages of helvétius is one subtle and farreaching sentence which made a strong impression upon bentham in order to love mankind he writes we must expect little from them this might on the lips of a cynic serve for a formula of that kind of misanthropy which is not more unamiable than it is unscientific but in the mouth of helvétius it was a plea for considerateness for indulgence and above all it was meant for an inducement to patience and sustained endeavour in all dealings with masses of men in society every man he says so long as his passions do not obscure his reason will always be the more indulgent in proportion as he is enlightened he knows that men are what they must be that all hatred against them is unjust that a fool produces follies just as a wild shrub produces sour berries that to insult him is to reproach the oak for bearing acorns instead of olives135 all this is as wise and humane as words can be so and it really represents the aim and temper of helvétiuss teaching unfortunately for him and for his generation his grasp was feeble and unsteady he had not the gift of accurate thinking and his book is in consequence that which of all the books of the eighteenth century unites most of wholesome truth with most of repellent error      135 disc ii 10     chapter vi  holbachs system of nature   the system of nature was published in 1770 eight years before the death of voltaire and of rousseau and it gathered up all the scattered explosives of the criticism of the century into one thundering engine of revolt and destruction it professed to be the posthumous work of mirabaud who had been secretary to the academy this was one of the common literary frauds of the time its real author was holbach it is too systematic and coherently compacted to be the design of more than one man and it is too systematic also for that one man to have been diderot as has been so often assumed at the same time there are good reasons for believing that not only much of its thought but some of the pages were the direct work of diderot the latest editor of the heedless philosopher has certainly done right in placing among his miscellanea the declamatory apostrophe which sums up the teachings of this remorseless book the rumour imputing the authorship to diderot was so common and diderot himself was so disquieted by it that he actually hastened away from paris to his native langres and to the baths of bourbonne in order to be ready to cross the frontier at the first hint of a warrant being out against him136 diderot has recorded his admiration of his friends work i am disgusted he said with the modern fashion of mixing up incredulity and superstition what i like is a philosophy that is clear definite and frank such as you have in the system of nature the author is not an atheist in one page and a deist in another his philosophy is all of one piece137      136 oeuv xvii 329      137 ib ii 398  no book has ever produced a more widespread shock everybody insisted on reading it and almost everybody was terrified it suddenly revealed to men like the blaze of lightning to one faring through darkness the formidable shapes the unfamiliar sky the sinister landscape into which the wanderings of the last fifty years had brought them unsuspecting they had had half a century of such sharp intellectual delight as had not been known throughout any great society in europe since the death of michael angelo and had perhaps north of the alps never been known at all and now it seemed to many of them as they turned over the pages of holbachs book as if they stood face to face with the devil of the mediæval legend come to claim their souls satire of job and david banter about joshuas massacres and solomons concubines invective against blind pastors of blinder flocks zeal to place newton on the throne of descartes and locke upon the pedestal of malebranche wishes that the last jansenist might be strangled in the bowels of the last jesuitall this had given zest and savour to life in the midst of their high feast holbach pointed to the finger of their own divinity reason writing on the wall the appalling judgments that there is no god that the universe is only matter in spontaneous movement and most grievous word of all that what men call their souls die with the death of the body as music dies when the strings are broken  galiani the witty neapolitan who had so many good friends in the philosophic circle anticipated the wellknown phrase of a writer of our own day the author of the system of nature he said is the abbé terrai of metaphysics he makes deductions suspensions of payment and causes the very bankruptcy of knowledge of pleasure and of the human mind but you will tell me that after all there were too many rotten securities that the account was too heavily overdrawn that there was too much worthless paper on the market that is true too and that is why the crisis has come138 goethe then a student at strasburg has told us what horror and alarm the system of nature brought into the circle there but we could not conceive he says how such a book could be dangerous it came to us so gray so cimmerian so corpselike that we could hardly endure its presence we shuddered before it as if it had been a spectre it struck us as the very quintessence of musty age savourless repugnant139      138 corresp de galiani i 142      139 wahrheit und dichtung bk xi  if this was the light in which the book appeared to the young man who was soon to be the centre of german literature the brilliant veteran who had for two generations been the centre of the literature of france was both shocked by the audacity of the new treatise and alarmed at the peril in which it involved the whole encyclopædic brotherhood with the patriarch at their head voltaire had no sooner read the system of nature than he at once snatched up his everready pen and plunged into refutation140 at the same time he took care that the right persons should hear what he had done he wrote to his old patron and friend richelieu that it would be a great kindness if he would let the king know that the abused voltaire had written an answer to the book that all the world was talking about i think he says that it is always a good thing to uphold the doctrine of the existence of a god who punishes and rewards society has need of such an opinion there is a curious disinterestedness in the notion of lewis the fifteenth and richelieu two of the wickedest men of their time being anxious for the demonstration of a dieu vengeur voltaire at least had a very keen sense of the meaning of a court that rewarded and punished the author of the system of nature he wrote to grimm ought to have felt that he was undoing his friends and making them hateful in the eyes of the king and the court141 this came true in the case of the great philosopherking himself frederick of prussia was offended by a book which spared political superstitions as little as theological dogma and treated kings as boldly as it treated priests though keenly occupied in watching the war then waging between russia and turkey and already revolving the partition of poland he found time to compose a defence of theism tis a good sign voltaire said to him when a king and a plain man think alike their interests are often so hostile that when their ideas do agree they must certainly be right142      140 see the article dieu in the dict philosophique      141 voltaires corr nov 1 1770      142 july 27 1770  the philosophic meaning of holbachs propositions was never really seized by voltaire he is as has been justly said the representative of ordinary common sense which with all its declamations and its appeals to the feelings is wholly without weight or significance as against a philosophic way of considering things however humble the philosophy may be143 he hardly took more pains to understand holbach than johnson took to understand berkeley in truth it was a characteristic of voltaire always to take the social rather than the philosophic view of the great issues of the theistic controversy one day when present at a discussion as to the existence of a deity in which the negative was being defended with much vivacity he astonished the company by ordering the servants to leave the room and then proceeding to lock the door gentlemen he explained i do not wish my valet to cut my throat tomorrow morning it was not the truth of the theistic belief in itself that voltaire prized but its supposed utility as an assistant to the police dalembert on the other hand viewed the dispute as a matter of disinterested speculation as for the existence of a supreme intelligence he wrote to frederick the great i think that those who deny it advance far more than they can prove and scepticism is the only reasonable course he goes on to say however that experience invincibly proves both the materiality of the soul and a material deitylike that which mr mill did not repudiateof limited powers and dependent on fixed conditions144      143 langes gesch d materialismus i 369 where the author     shows how entirely voltaire failed to touch holbachs position as to     the meaning of order in the universe      144 oeuv v 296 303 etc  let us now turn to the book itself and first as to its author the reader of the new heloïsa will remember that the heroine after her repentance and her marriage has only one chagrin in the world that is the blank disbelief of her husband in the two great mysteries of a supreme being and another world wolmar the husband has always been supposed to stand for rousseaus version of holbach and holbach would hardly have complained of the portrait the wolmar of the novel is benevolent active patient tranquil friendly and trustful the nicely combined conjunction of the play of circumstance with the action of men pleases him just as the fine symmetry of a statue or the skilful contrivance of dramatic effects would please him if he has any dominant passion it is a passion for observation he delights in reading the hearts of men145      145 nouvelle héloise iv xii  all this seems to have been as true of the real holbach as of the imaginary wolmar we have already seen him as the intimate friend and constant host of diderot he was one of the bestinformed men of his time 172389 he had an excellent library a collection of pictures and a valuable cabinet of natural history and his poorer friends were as freely welcome to the use of all of them as the richest his manners were cheerful courteous and easy he was a model of simplicity and kindliness was written on every feature his hospitality won him the wellknown nickname of the maître dhôtel of philosophy and his house was jestingly called the café de leurope on sundays and thursdays without prejudice to other days from ten to a score of men of letters and eminent foreign visitors including hume wilkes shelburne garrick franklin priestley used to gather round his good dishes and excellent wine it was noted as a mark of the attractiveness of the company that the guests who came at two in the afternoon constantly remained until as late as seven and eight in the evening to one of those guests who afterwards became the powerful enemy of the encyclopædic group the gaiety the irreverence the hardihood of speculation and audacity of discourse were all as gall and wormwood rousseau found their atheistic sallies offensive beyond endurance their hard rationalism was odious to the great emotional dreamer and after he had quarrelled with them all he transformed his own impressions of the dreariness of atheism into the passionate complaint of julie conceive the torment of living in retirement with the man who shares our existence and yet cannot share the hope that makes existence dear of never being able with him either to bless the works of god or to speak of the happy future that is promised us by the goodness of god of seeing him while doing good on every side still insensible to everything that makes the delight of doing good of watching him by the most bizarre of contradictions think with the impious and yet live like a christian think of julie walking with her husband the one admiring in the rich and splendid robe of the earth the handiwork and the bounteous gifts of the author of the universe the other seeing nothing in it all save a fortuitous combination the product of blind force alas she cries the great spectacle of nature for us so glorious so animated is dead in the eyes of the unhappy wolmar and in that great harmony of being where all speaks of god in accents so mild and so persuasive he only perceives eternal silence146      146 nouvelle héloise v v  yet it is fair to the author of this most eloquent ignoratio elenchi to notice that he honestly fulfilled the object with which he professed to set outnamely to show to both the religious and philosophical parties that their adversaries were capable of leading upright useful and magnanimous lives whether he would have painted the imaginary wolmar so favourably if he could have foreseen what kind of book the real holbach had in his desk is perhaps doubtful for holbachs opinions looked more formidable and sombre in the cold deliberateness of print than they had sounded amid the interruptions of lively discourse                                       it is needless to say to begin with that the writer has the most marked of the philosophic defects of the school of the century perhaps we might put it more broadly and call the disregard of historic opinion the natural defect of all materialistic speculation from epicurus downwards147 like all others of his school holbach has no perception nor sense of the necessity of an explanation how the mental world came to be what it is nor how men came to think and believe what they do think and believe he gives them what he deems unanswerable reasons for changing their convictions but he never dreams of asking himself in what elements of human character the older convictions had their root and from what fitness for the conduct of life they drew the current of their sap yet unless this aspect of things had been well considered his unanswerable reasons were sure to fall wide of the mark opinions as men began to remember after social movement had thrown the logical century into discredit have a history as well as a logic they are bound up with a hundred transmitted prepossessions and they have become identified with a hundred social customs that are the most dearly cherished parts of mens lives nature had as much to do with the darkness of yesterday as with the light of today she is as much the accomplice of superstition as she is the oracle of reason it was because they forgot all this that holbachs school now seem so shallow and superficial the whole past was one long working of the mystery of iniquity the sum of the woes of the human race was not diminishedon the contrary it was increased by its religions by its governments by its opinions in a word by all the institutions that it was led to adopt on the plea of ameliorating its lot148 on lui fit adopter but who were the on and how did they work with what instruments and what fulcrum never was the convenience of this famous abstract substantive more fatally abused and if religion government and opinion had all aggravated the miseries of the human race what had lessened them for the encyclopædic school never attempted as rousseau did to deny that the world had as a matter of fact advanced towards happiness it was because the holbachians looked on mankind as slaves held in an unaccountable bondage which they must necessarily be eager to throw off that their movement after doing at the revolution a certain amount of good in a bad way led at last to a mischievous reaction in favour of catholicism      147 see lange i 85      148 syst de la nat i xvi  far more immediately significant than the philosophy of the system of nature were the violence directness and pertinacity of its assault upon political government voltaire as has so often been noticed had always abstained from meddling with either the theory or the practical abuses of the national administration all his shafts had been levelled at ecclesiastical superstition rousseau indeed had begun the most famous of his political speculations by crying that man who was born free is now everywhere in chains but rousseau was vague abstract and sentimental in the system of nature we have a clear presage of the trenchant and imperious invective which twenty years after its publication rang in all mens ears from the gardens of the palais royal and the benches of the jacobins hall the writer has plainly made up his mind that the time has at last come for dropping all the discreet machinery of apologue and parable and giving to his words the edge of a sharpened sword the vague disguises of political speculation and the mannered reservations of a utopia or new atlantis are exchanged for a passionate biting and loudly practical indictment all over the world men are under the yoke of masters who neglect the instruction of their people or only seek to cheat and deceive them the sovereigns in every part of the globe are unjust incapable made effeminate by luxury corrupted by flattery depraved by license and impunity destitute of talent manners or virtue indifferent to their duties which they usually know nothing about they are scarcely concerned for a single moment of the day with the wellbeing of their people their whole attention is absorbed by useless wars or by the desire to find at each instant new means of gratifying their insatiable rapacity the state of society is a state of war between the sovereign and all the rest of its members in every country alike the morality of the people is wholly neglected and the one care of the government is to render them timorous and wretched the common man desires no more than bread he wins it by the sweat of his brow joyfully would he eat it if the injustice of the government did not make it bitter in his mouth by the insanity of governments those who are swimming in plenty without being any the happier for it yet wring from the tiller of the soil the very fruits that his arms have won from it injustice by reducing indigence to despair drives it to seek in crime resources against the woes of life an iniquitous government breeds despair in mens souls its vexations depopulate the land the fields remain untilled famine contagion and pestilence stalk over the earth then embittered by misery mens minds begin to ferment and effervesce and what inevitably follows is the overthrow of a realm149      149 syst de la nat i xiv xvi etc etc  if france had been prosperous all this would have passed for the empty declamation of an excited man of letters as it was such declamation only described in language as accurate as it was violent and stinging the real position of the country in the urgency of a present material distress men were not overcareful that the basis of the indictment should be laid in the principles of a sound historical philosophy of society we can hardly wonder at it what is interesting and what we do not notice earlier in the century is that in the system of nature the revolt against the impotence of society and the revolt against the omnipotence of god made a firm coalition that coalition came to a bloody end for the time fourandtwenty years after holbachs book proclaimed it when the committee of public safety despatched hébert and better men than hébert to the guillotine for being atheists atheism as robespierre assured them was aristocratic  holbachs work may be said to spring from the doctrine that the social deliverance of man depends on his intellectual deliverance and that the key to his intellectual deliverance is only to be found in the substitution of naturalism for theism what he means by naturalism we shall proceed shortly to explain the style we may remark notwithstanding the energy and coherence of the thought is often diffuse and declamatory some one said of the system of nature that it contained at least four times too many words yet voltaire while professing extreme dislike of its doctrine admitted that the writer had somehow caught the ear of the learned of the ignorant and of women he is often clear said voltaire and sometimes eloquent yet he may justly be reproached with declamation with repeating himself and with contradicting himself like all the rest of them150 galiani made an oversubtle criticism on it when he complained of the want of coolness and selfpossession in the style and then said that it looked as if the writer were pressed less to persuade other people than to persuade himself this was a crude impression nobody can have any doubt of the writers profound sincerity or of his earnest desire to make proselytes he knows his own mind and hammers his doctrines out with a hard and iterative stroke that hits its mark yet his literary tone in spite of its declamatory pitch not seldom sinks into a drone holbachs contemporaries were in too fierce contact with the tusks and hooked claws of the church to have any mind for the rhythm of a champions sentences or the turn of his periods but now that the efforts of the heterodox have taught the churches to be better christians than they were a hundred years ago we can afford to admit that holbach is hardly more captivating in style and not always more edifying in temper than some of the christian fathers themselves      150 dict phil s v dieu § 4  what then is the system of nature and what is that naturalism which is to replace the current faith in the deities outside of observable nature the writer makes no pretence of feeling a tentative way towards an answer from the very outset his spirit is that of dogmatic confidence he is less a seeker than an expounder less a philosopher than a preacher and he boldly dismisses proof in favour of exhortation  let man cease to search outside the world in which he dwells for beings who may procure him a happiness that nature refuses to grant let him study that nature let him learn her laws and contemplate the energy and the unchanging fixity with which she acts let him apply his discoveries to his own felicity and submit in silence to laws from which nothing can withdraw him let him consent to ignore the causes surrounded as they are for him by an impenetrable veil let him undergo without a murmur the decrees of universal force  science derived from experience is the source of all wise action it is physical science la physique and experience that man ought to consult in religion morals legislature as well as in knowledge and the arts it is by our senses that we are bound to universal nature it is by our senses that we discover her secrets the moment that we first experience them we fall into a void where our imagination leads us endlessly astray  movement is what establishes relations between our organs and external objects every object has laws of movement that are peculiar to itself everything in the universe is in movement no part of nature is really at rest151      151 holbach confesses his obligation on this head to tolands     letters to serena 1704  whence does nature receive this movement from herself since she is the great whole outside of which consequently nothing can exist motion is a fashion of being which flows necessarily from the essence of matter matter moves by its own energy its motion is due to forces inherent in it the variety of its movements and of the phenomena resulting from them comes from variation of the properties the qualities the combinations originally found in the different primitive matters of which nature is the assemblage  whence came matter matter has existed from all eternity and a motion is one of the inherent and constitutive qualities of matter motion also has existed from eternity  the abstract idea of matter must be decomposed instead of regarding matter as a unique existence rude passive incapable of moving itself of combining itself we ought to look upon it as a kind of existence of which the various individual members comprising the kind in spite of their having some common properties such as extension divisibility figure etc still ought not to be ranged in a single class nor comprised in a single denomination  what is natures process continual movement from the stone which is formed in the bowels of the earth by the intimate combination as they approach one another of analogous and similar molecules up to the sun that vast reservoir of heated particles that gives light to the firmament from the numb oyster up to manwe observe an uninterrupted progression a perpetual chain of combination and movements from which there result beings that only differ among one another by the variety of their elementary matters and of the combination and proportion of these elements from this variety springs an infinite diversity of ways of existing and acting in generation nutrition preservation we can see nothing but different sorts of matter differently combined each of them endowed with its own movements each of them regulated by fixed laws that cause them to undergo the necessary changes  let us notice here three of the authors definitions 1 motion is an effort by which a body changes or tends to change its place 2 of the ultimate composition of matter holbach says nothing definite though he assumes molecular movement as its first law he contents himself properly enough perhaps in view of the destination of his treatise with a definition relatively to us relatively to us then matter in general is all that affects our senses in any fashion whatever and the qualities that we attribute to different kinds of matter are founded on the different impressions that they produce on us 3 when i say that nature produces an effect i do not mean to personify this nature which is an abstraction i mean that the effect of which i am speaking is the necessary result of the properties of some one of those beings that compose the great whole under our eyes thus when i say that nature intends man to work for his own happiness i mean by this that it is of the essence of a being who feels thinks wills and acts to work for his own happiness by essence i mean that which constitutes a being what it is the sum of its properties or the qualities according to which it exists and acts as it does  all phenomena are necessary no creature in the universe in its circumstances and according to its given property can act otherwise than as it does act fire necessarily burns whatever combustible matter comes within the sphere of its action man necessarily desires what either is or seems to be conducive to his comfort and wellbeing there is no independent energy no isolated cause no detached activity in a universe where all beings are incessantly acting on one another and which is itself only one eternal round of movement imparted and undergone according to necessary laws in a storm of dust raised by a whirlwind in the most violent tempest that agitates the ocean not a single molecule of dust or of water finds its place by chance or is without an adequate cause for occupying the precise point where it is found so again in the terrible convulsions that sometimes overthrow empires there is not a single action word thought volition or passion in a single agent of such a revolution whether he be a destroyer or a victim which is not necessary which does not act precisely as it must act and which does not infallibly produce the effects that it is bound to produce conformably to the place occupied by the given agent in the moral whirlwind152      152 almost the very words of this passage are to be found in     diderot see above vol i p 237  order and disorder are abstract terms and can have no existence in a nature where all is necessary and follows constant laws order is nothing more than necessity viewed relatively to the succession of actions disorder in the case of any being is nothing more than its passage to a new order to a succession of movements and actions of a different sort from those of which the given being was previously susceptible hence there can never be either monsters or prodigies either marvels or miracles in nature by the same reasoning we have no right to divide the workings of nature into those of intelligence and those of chance where all is necessary chance can mean nothing save the limitation of mans knowledge  the writer next has a group of chapters vix on man his composition relations and

common to him with the other beings known to us but before a true and comprehensive idea of the unity of nature was possible to him he was so seized by the variety and complication of his organism and its movements that it never came into his mind to realise that they existed in a chain of material necessity binding him fast to all other forces and modes of being men think that they remedy their ignorance of things by inventing words so they explained the working of matter in mans case by associating with matter a hypothetical substance which is in truth much less intelligible than matter itself they regarded themselves as double a compound of matter and something else miraculously united with it to which they give the name of mind or soul and then they proudly looked on themselves as beings apart from the rest of creation in plain truth mind is only an occult force invented to explain occult qualities and actions and really explaining nothing by mind they mean no more than the unknown cause of phenomena that they cannot explain naturally just as the red indians believed that it was spirits who produced the terrible effects of gunpowder and just as the ignorant of our own day believe in angels and demons how can we figure to ourselves a form of being which though not matter still acts on matter without having points of contact or analogy with it and on the other hand itself receives the impulsions of matter through the material organs that warn it of the presence of external objects how can we conceive the union of body and soul and how can this material body enclose bind constrain determine a fugitive form of being that escapes every sense to resolve these difficulties by calling them mysteries and to set them down as the effects of the omnipotence of a being still more inconceivable than the human soul itself is merely a confession of absolute ignorance  it is worth noticing that with the characteristic readiness of the french materialist school to turn metaphysical and psychological discussion to practical uses holbach discerned the immense new field which the materialist account of mind opened to the physician if people consulted experience instead of prejudice medicine would furnish morality with the key of the human heart and in curing the body it would be often assured of curing the mind too the dogma of the spirituality of the soul has turned morality into a conjectural science which does not in the least help us to understand the true way of acting on mens motives man will always be a mystery for those who insist on regarding him with the prejudiced eyes of theology and on attributing his actions to a principle of which they can never have any clear ideas ch ix it is certainly true as a historical fact that the rational treatment of insane persons and the rational view of certain kinds of crime were due to men like pinel trained in the materialistic school of the eighteenth century and it was clearly impossible that the great and humane reforms in this field could have taken place before the decisive decay of theology theology assumes perversity as the natural condition of the human heart and could only regard insanity as an intolerable exaggeration of this perversity secondly the absolute independence of mind and body which theology brought into such overwhelming relief naturally excluded the notion that by dealing with the body you might be doing something to heal the mind perhaps we are now in some danger of overlooking the potency of the converse illustration of what holbach says namely the efficacy of mental remedies or preventives in the case of bodily disease  if you complainto resume our expositionthat the mechanism is not sufficient to explain the principle of the movements and faculties of the soul the answer is that it is in the same case with all the bodies in nature in them the simplest movements the most ordinary phenomena the commonest actions are inexplicable mysteries whose first principles are for ever sealed to us how shall we flatter ourselves that we know the first principle of gravity by virtue of which a stone falls what do we know of the mechanism that produces the attraction of some substances and the repulsion of others but surely the incomprehensibility of natural effects is no reason for assigning to them a cause that is still more incomprehensible than any of those within our cognisance  it is not given to man to know everything it is not given to him to know his own origin nor to penetrate into the essence of things nor to mount up to the first principle of things what is given to him is to have reason to have good faith to concede frankly that he is ignorant of what he cannot know and not to supplement his lack of certainty by words that are unintelligible and suppositions that are absurd  suns go out and planets perish new suns are kindled and new planets revolve in new paths and maninfinitely small portion of a globe that is itself only a small point in immensitydreams that it is for him that the universe has been made imagines that he must be the confidant of nature and proudly flatters himself that he must be eternal o man wilt thou never conceive that thou art but an insect of a day all changes in the universe nature contains not a form that is constant and yet thou wouldst claim that thy species can never disappear and must be excepted from the great universal law of incessant change  we may pause for a moment to notice how in their deliberate humiliation of the alleged pride of man the orthodox theologian and the atheistic holbach use precisely the same language but the rebuke of the latter was sincere it was indispensable in order to prepare mens minds for the conception of the universe as a whole with the theologian the rebuke has now become little more than a hollow shift in order to insinuate the miracle of grace the preacher of naturalism replaces a futile vanity in being the end and object of the creation by a fruitful reverence for the supremacy of human reason and a right sense of the value of its discreet and disciplined use the theologian restores this absurd and misleading egoism of the race by representing the creator as above all else concerned to work miracles for the salvation of a creature whose understanding is at once pitifully weak and odiously perverse and whose heart is from the beginning wicked corrupt and given over to reprobation the difference is plainly enormous the theologian discourages men they are to wait for the miracle of conversion inert or desperate the naturalist arouses them he supplies them with the most powerful of motives for the energetic use of the most powerful of their endowments men would always have grace says holbach with excellent sense if they were well educated and well governed and he exclaims on the strange morality of those who attribute all moral evil to original sin and all the good that we do to grace no wonder he says that a morality founded on hypotheses so ridiculous should prove to be of no efficacy153      153 ch xi  this brings us to holbachs treatment of morals the moment had come to france which was reached at an earlier period in english speculation when the negative course of thought in metaphysics drove men to consider the basis of ethics how were right and wrong to hold their own against the new mechanical conception of the universe the same question is again urgent in mens minds because the darwinian hypothesis and the mass of evidence for it have again given a tremendous shake to theological conceptions and startled men into a sense of the precariousness of the official foundations of virtue and duty  holbach begins by a most unflinching exposure of the inconsistency with all that we know of nature of the mysterious theory of free will this remains one of the most effective parts of the book and perhaps the work has never been done with a firmer hand the conclusion is expressed with a decisiveness that almost seems crude there is declared to be no difference between a man who throws himself out of the window and the man whom i throw out except this that the impulse acting on the second comes from without and that the impulse determining the fall of the first comes from within his own mechanism you have only to get down to the motive and you will invariably find that the motive is beyond the actors own power or reach the inexorable logic with which the author presses the freewiller from one retreat to another and from shift to shift leaves his adversary at last exactly as naked and defenceless before holbachs vigorous and thoroughly realised naturalism as the same adversary must always be before jonathan edwardss vigorous theism the system of mans liberty holbach says ii ii with some pungency seems only to have been invented in order to put him in a position to offend his god and so to justify god in all the evil that he inflicted on man for having used the freedom which was so disastrously conferred upon him  if man be not free what right have we to punish those who cannot help committing bad actions or to reward others who cannot help committing good actions holbach gives to this and the various other ways of describing fatalism as dangerous to society the proper and perfectly adequate answer he turns to the quality of the action and connects with that the social attitude of praise and blame merit and demerit are associated with conduct according as it is thought to affect the common welfare advantageously or the reverse my indignation and my approval are as necessary as the acts that excite these sentiments my feelings are neither more nor less spontaneous than the deciding motives of the actor whatever be the necessitating cause of our actions i have a right to do my best by praise and blame by reward and punishment to strengthen or to weaken to prolong or to divert the motives that are the antecedents of the action exactly as i have a right to dam up a stream or to divert its course or otherwise deal with it to suit my own convenience penal laws for instance are ways of offering to men strong motives to weigh in the scale against the temptation of an immediate personal gratification holbach does not make it quite distinct that the object of penal legislation is in some cases to give the offender as well as other people a strong reason for thinking twice before he repeats the offence yet in other cases where the punishment is capital the legislation does not aim at influencing the mind of the offender at all but the minds of other people only this is only a side illustration of a common weakness in most arguments on this subject a thorough vindication of the penal laws on the principles of a systematic fatalism can only be successful if we think less of the wrongdoer in any given case than of affecting general motives and building up a right habit of avoiding or accepting certain classes of action  the writer then justly connects his scientific necessarianism in philosophy with humanity in punishment he protests against excessive cruelty in the infliction of legal penalties and especially against the use of torture on two grounds first that experience demonstrates the uselessness of these superfluous rigours and second that the habit of witnessing atrocious punishments familiarises both criminals and others with the idea of cruelty the acquiescence of paris for a few months in the cruelties of the terror was no doubt due on holbachs perfectly sound principle to the far worse cruelties with which the laws had daily made paris familiar down to the last years of the monarchy and holbach was justified in expecting a greater degree of charitable and considerate judgment from the establishment in mens minds of a necessarian theory we are no longer vindictive against the individual doer we wax energetic against the defective training and the institutions which allowed wrong motives to weigh more heavily with him than right ones punishment on the theory of necessity ought always to go with prevention and is valued just because it is a force on prevention and not merely an element in retribution  holbach answers effectively enough the common objection that his fatalism would plunge mens souls into apathy if all is necessary why shall i not let things go and myself remain quiet as if we could stay our hands from action if our feelings were trained to proper sensibility and sympathy as if it were possible for a man of tender disposition not to interest himself keenly in all that concerns the lot of his fellowcreatures how does our knowledge that death is necessary prevent us from deploring the loss of a beloved one how does my consciousness that it is the inevitable property of fire to burn prevent me from using all my efforts to avert a conflagration  finally when people urge that the doctrine of necessity degrades man by reducing him to a machine and likening him to some growth of abject vegetation they are merely using a kind of language that was invented in ignorance of what constitutes the true dignity of man what is nature itself but a vast machine in which our human species is no more than one weak spring the good man is a machine whose springs are adapted so to fulfil their functions as to produce beneficent results for his fellows how could such an instrument not be an object of respect and affection and gratitude  in closing this part of holbachs book while not dissenting from his conclusions we will only remark how little conscious he seems of the degree to which he empties the notions of praise and blame of the very essence of their old contents it is not a modification but the substitution of a new meaning under the old names praise in its new sense of admiration for useful and pleasuregiving conduct or motive is as powerful a force and as adequate an incentive to good conduct and good motives as praise in the old sense of admiration for a deliberate and voluntary exercise of a freeacting will but the two senses are different the old ethical association is transformed into something which usage and the requirements of social selfpreservation must make equally potent but which is not the same if holbach and others who hold necessarian opinions were to perceive this more frankly and to work it out fully they would prevent a confusion that is very unfavourable to them in the minds of most of those whom they wish to persuade it is easy to see that the work next to be done in the region of morals is the readjustment of the ethical phraseology of the volitional stage to fit the ideas proper to the stage in which man has become as definitely the object of science as any of the other phenomena of the universe  the chapter xiii on the immortality of the soul examines this memorable growth of human belief with great vigour and a most destructive penetration as we have seen the author repudiates the theory of a double energy in man one material and the other spiritual just as he afterwards repudiates the analogous hypothesis of a double energy in nature one of the two being due to a spiritual mover outside of the external phenomena of the universe consistently with this renunciation of a separate spiritual energy in man holbach will listen to no talk of a spiritual energy surviving the destruction of the mechanical framework to say that the soul will feel think enjoy suffer after the death of the body is to pretend that a clock broken into a thousand pieces can continue to strike or to mark the hours and having emphatically proclaimed his own refusal to share the common belief he proceeds with good success to carry the war into the country of those who profess that belief and defend it as the safeguard of society we need not go through his positions they are substantially those which are familiar to everybody who has read the third book of lucretiuss poem and remembers those magnificent passages which are not more admirable in their philosophy than they are noble and moving in their poetic expression      nam veluti pueri trepidant atque omnia caecis     in tenebris metuunt sic nos in luce timemus     interdum nilo quae sunt metuenda magis quam     quae pueri in tenebris pavitant finguntque futura     hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necessest     non radii solis neque lucida tela diei     discutiant sed naturae species ratioque  and so forth down to the exquisite lines      jam jam non domus accipiet te laeta neque uxoi     optima nec dulces occurrent oscula nati     praeripere et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent     non poteris factis florentibus esse tuisque     praesidium misero misere aiunt omnia ademit     una dies infesta tibi tot praemia vitae     illud in his rebus non addunt nec tibi earum     jam desiderium rerum super insidet una     quod bene si videant animo dictisque sequantur     dissolvant animi magno se angore metuque     tu quidem ut es leto sopitus sic eris aevi     quod superest cunctis privatu doloribus aegris     at nos horrifico cinefactum te prope busto     insatiabiliter deflevimus aeternumque     nulla dies nobis maerorem e pectore demet     illud ab hoc igitur quaerendum est quid sit amari     tanto opere ad somnum si res redit atque quietem     cur quisquam æterno possit tabescere luctu  we may regret that holbach in dealing with these solemn and touching things should have been so devoid of historic spirit as to buffet david mahomet chrysostom and other holy personages as superstitious brigands and we may believe that he has certainly been too sweeping in denying any deterrent efficacy whatever to the fires of hell but where holbach found one person in 1770 he would find a thousand in 1880 to agree with him that it is possible to think of commendations and inducements to virtue that shall be at least as efficacious as the fiction of eternal torment without being as cruel as wicked as infamous to the gods and as degrading to men  from his attack on immortality holbach naturally turns with new energy as do all who have passed beyond that belief to the improvement of the education the laws the institutions which are to strengthen and implant the true motives for turning men away from wrong and inspiring them to right he draws a stern and prolonged indictment against the kings of the earth in words that we have already quoted above as unjust incapable depraved by license and impunity one passage in this chapter is the scripture of a terrible prophecy the very handwriting on the wall which was to be so accurately fulfilled almost in the lifetime of the writerthe state of society is now a state of war of the sovereign against all and of each of its members against the other man is bad not because he was born bad but because he is made so the great and the powerful crush with impunity the needy and the unfortunate and these in turn seek to repay all the ill that has been done to them they openly or privily attack a native land that is a cruel stepmother to them she gives all to some of her children while others she strips of all sorely they punish her for her partiality they show her that the motives borrowed from another life are powerless against the passions and the bitter wrath engendered by a corrupt administration in the life here and that all the terror of the punishments of this world is impotent against necessity against criminal habits against a dangerous organisation that no education has ever been applied to correct ch xiv in another place a society enjoys all the happiness of which it is susceptible so soon as the greater number of its members are fed clothed housed are able in a word without an excessive toil to satisfy the wants that nature has made necessities to them their imagination is content so soon as they have the assurance that no force can ravish from them the fruits of their industry and that they labour for themselves by a sequence of human madness whole nations are forced to labour to sweat to water the earth with their tears merely to keep up the luxury the fancies the corruption of a handful of insensates a few useless creatures so have religious and political errors changed the universe into a valley of tears this is an incessant refrain that sounds with hoarse groundtone under all the ethics and the metaphysics of the book there are scores of pages in which the same idea is worked out with a sombre vehemence that makes us feel as if robespierre were already haranguing in the national assembly camille desmoulins declaiming in the gardens of the palais royal and danton thundering at the club of the cordeliers we already watch the smoke of the flaming châteaux going up like a savoury and righteous sacrifice to the heavens  from this point to the end of the first part of the book it is not so much philosophy as the literature of a political revolution there is a curious parenthesis in vindication not only of a contempt for death but even of suicide the writer pointing out with some malice that samson eleazar and other worthies caused their own death and that jesus christ himself if really the son of god dying of his own free grace was a suicide to say nothing of the various ascetic penitents who have killed themselves by inches154 the fear of death after all he says summing up his case will only make cowards the fear of its alleged consequences will only make fanatics or melancholy pietists as useless to themselves as to others death is a resource that we do ill to take away from oppressed virtue reduced as many a time it is by the injustice of men to desperation this was the doctrine in which the revolutionary generation were brought up and the readiness with which men in those days inflicted death on themselves and on others showed how profoundly it had entered their souls155 we think as we read of vergniaud and condorcet carrying their doses of poison of barbaroux with his pistol and valazé with his knife of roland walking forth from rouen among the trees on the paris road and there driving a canesword into his breast as calmly as if he had been throwing off a useless vesture      154 this is not original in holbach diderots article on suicide     in the encyclopædia oeuv xvii 235 contains the usual     arguments of the church against suicide with some casuistic     illustrations but it also contains an account of dr donnes     vindication of suicide called biathanatos 1651 in which these     remarks of holbach occur verbatim hallam found donnes book so dull     and pedantic that he declares no one would be induced to kill     himself by reading such a book unless he were threatened with     another volume      155 humes suppressed essay on suicide see the edition by mr     green and mr grose 1875 vol ii 405 is a much more exhaustive     argument than holbachs though the language of the two pieces is     sometimes curiously alike rousseau in this as in so many other     moralitiesmarriage for instancewas on the side of the church     only allowing suicide where a man happens to be stricken by a     painful and incurable disease see the two famous letters in the     new heloïsa pt iii 21 22  holbach has been accused of reducing virtue to a farsighted egoism156 and detached and crude propositions may be quoted that perhaps give a literal warrant for the charge nominally he bases morality on happiness but his real base is the happiness of the greatest number to borrow mr sidgwicks classification holbach is a universalistic and not an egoistic hedonist the spirit of what he says is in fact not individualist but social the good man is he to whom true ideas have shown his own interest or his own happiness to lie in such a way of acting that others are forced to love and approve for their own interest it is man who is most necessary to the wellbeing of man merit and virtue are founded on the nature of man on his needs it is by virtue that we are able to earn the goodwill the confidence the esteem of all those with whom we have relations in a word no man can be happy alone to be virtuous is to place ones interest in what accords with the interest of others it is to enjoy the benefits and the delights that one is the means of diffusing among them the sentiments of selflove become a hundred times more delicious when we see them shared by all those with whom our destiny binds us the habit of virtue excites wants within us that only virtue can satisfy thus it is that virtue is ever its own recompense and pays itself with the blessings that it procures for others ch xv      156 taines ancien régime p 287  surely it is a childish or pedantic misinterpretation to represent this as egoism whether armed or not with keen sight and still worse to talk of it as overthrowing the barriers that keep in the throng of selfish appetites every citizen should be made to feel that the section of which he is a member is a whole that cannot subsist and be happy without virtue experience should teach him at every moment that the wellbeing of the members can only result from that of the whole body ch xv to say of such a doctrine as this that it is to invite every individual to make himself happy after his own will and fashion and to pull down the barriers of the selfish appetites is the very absurdity of philosophic prejudice it is for us to look at holbachs ethical doctrine in its widest practical application and if we place ourselves at a social point of view we cannot but perceive that the principle laid down in the words that we have just quoted was the indispensable weapon against the antisocial selfishness of the oppressive privileged class these words represent the ethical side of every popular and democratic movement you may class holbachs morality as the morality of selfinterest if you please but its true base lay in social sympathy to proclaim happiness as the test of virtue was to develop the doctrine of naturalism for happiness is the outcome of a conformity to the natural condition of things on the other hand to insist that virtue lies in promoting the happiness of the body social as a whole was to preach the most sovereign of all truths in a state of things where the body social as a whole was kept distracted and miserable by the selfishness of a scanty few of its members the church nominally built upon the morality of the golden rule was perverted into being the great organ of sinister selfinterest the atheists apparently formulating the morality of the epicureans were in effect the teachers of public spirit and beneficence and taught in such circumstances public spirit could only mean revolution we may doubt whether holbach had thought out the very different questions that may be fused under the easy phrase of a basis for morals what are the sanctions of moral precepts why ought each to seek the happiness of all what is the mark of the difference between right and wrong what is the foundation of conscience or that habit of mind which makes right as such seem preferable to wrong clearly these are all entirely separate topics yet holbach it is obvious had not divided them in his own mind and he seems to think that one and the same answer will serve for what he mistook for one and the same question he found it enough to say that every individual wishes to be happy and that he cannot be happy unless he is on good terms with his neighbours this reciprocity of needs and services he called the basis of morals for a rough and commonsense view of the matter such as holbach sought to impress on his readers this perhaps will do very well but it is not the product of accurate and scientific thinking  it is not necessary again to point out how holbach while expounding the system of nature left out of sight the great natural process by which the moral acquisition of one generation becomes the startingpoint of further acquisitions in the next he forgot the stages he talks of man as if all the races and eras of man were alike and also as if each individual deliberately worked out sums in happiness on his own account it would not only have been more true according to modern opinions but more in accordance with holbachs own view of necessity and of the irremovable chain that binds a mans conduct fast to a series of conditions that existed before he was born if he had recognised conscience moral preferences interest in the public good and all that he called the basis of morals as coming to a man with the rest of the apparatus that the past imposes on the present and not as due to any process of personal calculation  holbach had not clearly thought out the growth the changes varieties and transformations among moral ideals he was of course far too much in the full current of the eighteenth century not to feel that exultation in life and its most exuberant manifestations which the conventional moralists of the theological schools had set down and proscribed as worldliness and fleshliness action he says in this very chapter action is the true element of the human mind no sooner does man cease to act than he falls into pain and weariness of spirit no doubt this is too absolutely stated if we are to take some millions of orientals into our account of the human mind but it has been true of the nations of the west yet the recognition of this law did not prevent the writer from occasionally falling into some of the old canting commonplaces about people being happiest who have fewest wants as if on the contrary that action which he describes as the true element of man were not directly connected with the incessant multiplication of wants we may take this however as a casual lapse into the common form of moralists of ascetic ages in substance the system of nature is essentially a protest against ascetic and quietist ideals                                       the second half of the system of nature treats of the deity the proofs of his existence his attributes the manner in which he influences the happiness of men what is remarkable is that here we have an onslaught not merely on the church with its overgrowth of abuses nor on christianity with its overgrowth of superstitions but on that great conception which is enthroned on unseen heights far above any church and any form of christianity it is theism in its purest as in its impurest shape that the writer condemns no more elaborate trenchant and unflinching attack on the very fundamental propositions of theology natural or revealed is to be found in literature pure rationalism has nothing to add to this destructive onslaught the tone is not truly philosophic because the writer habitually regards the notion of a god as an abnormal and morbid excrescence and not as a natural growth in human development he takes no trouble and it would have been an incredible departure from the mental fashion of the time if he had taken any trouble to explain theology or to penetrate behind its forms to those needs aspirations and qualities of human constitution in which theology had its best justification if not its earliest source he regards it as an enemy to be mercilessly routed not as a force with which he has to make his account still as a piece of rough and remorseless polemic the second part of the system of nature remains full of remarkable energy and power the most eager nescient or denier to be found in the ranks of the assailants of theology in our own day is timorous and moderate compared with this direct and onpressing swordsman and the attack on its own purely rationalistic ground is thoroughly comprehensive it is not made on an outwork here or an outwork there it encircles the whole compass of the defence the conception of god is examined and resisted from every possible sidecosmological ethical metaphysical to say that the argument is onesided is only to say that it is an attack but the fact that the writer omits the contributions made under the temporal shelter of theology to morality and civilisation does not alter the other fact that he states with unsurpassed vigour all that can be said against the intellectual absurdities and moral obliquities that theology has nourished and approved and only too firmly planted  of the elaborate examination of the proofs of the existence of a god adduced by descartes samuel clarke malebranche and newton ch iv and v we need only say that its whole force might have been summed up in the single proposition that the author once for all repudiates any à priori basis for any beliefs whatever it would have been sufficient for philosophic purposes if he had contented himself with justifying and establishing that position the fabric of orthodox demonstration would have fallen to the ground after the destruction of its foundations holbach rejected the whole à priori system it was a matter of course therefore that he rejected each one of the twelve propositions which clarke had invented by the à priori method holbach held that experience is the source and limit of knowledge reasoning and belief and rejected as a fantastic impertinence of dreamy metaphysicians the assumption that our conceptions measure the necessities of objective existence from that point of view merely to state was to empty of all demonstrating quality such assertions as that something has existed from all eternity an independent and immutable being has existed from all eternity this immutable and independent being exists by himself and is incomprehensible the being existing necessarily is necessarily single and uniqueand so forth even if we accept this à priori method and accept the first assumption that something must have existed from all eternity it was open to holbach to say as locke said on setting himself to examine descartes proof of a god i found that by it senseless matter might be the first eternal being and cause of all things as well as an immaterial intelligent spirit but what we feel is that the whole controversy is being conducted between two disputants on two different planes of thought between two creatures dwelling in different elements to apply to clarkes propositions or to the slightly different propositions of malebranche the test of experience to measure them by the principle of relativity must be fatal in the minds of such persons as already accept experience as the only right test in such a matter it is exactly as if the action of an italian opera should be criticised in the light of the conditions of real life the whole performance must in an instant figure as an absurdity no partisan of the lyric drama would consent to have it so judged and the philosophic partisans of theology would perhaps have been wiser to keep clear of pretensions to prove their master thesis they might have been content to keep it as an emotional creation an imaginative hypothesis a noble simplification of the chimeras of the primitive consciousness of the race  as it was neither side could be convinced by the other for they had no common criterion they had hardly even a common language the only effect of holbachs blows was to persuade the bystanders who thronged round the lists in that eager time that the socalled proofs with which the high philosophic names were associated were only proofs to those who accepted a way of thinking which it was the very characteristic of that age decisively to reject the controversial force of this part of the attack simply lay in the piercing thoroughness with which the irreconcilable discrepancies between the seventeenth century notion of demonstration and that notion in the eighteenth were forced upon the readers attention  one other remark may be made whatever we may think of the success of the authors assault on the theistic hypothesis of the universe it is impossible to deny that he at least succeeds in repelling the various assaults levelled on what is vulgarly termed atheism he rightly urges the unreasonableness of taxing those who have formed to themselves intelligible notions of the moving power of the universe with denying the existence of such a power the absurdity of charging the very men who found everything that comes to pass in the world on fixed and constant laws with attributing everything to chance if by atheist he says you mean a man who would deny the existence of a force inherent in matter and without which you cannot conceive nature and if to this moving force you give the name of god then an atheist would be a madman holbach then describes the sense in which atheists both exist and as he thinks may well justify their existence their qualities are as follows to be guided only by experience and the testimony of their senses and to perceive nothing in nature except matter essentially active and mobile and capable of producing all the beings that we see to forego all search for a chimerical cause and not to mistake for better knowledge of the moving force of the universe merely a separate attribution of it to a being placed outside of the great whole to confess in good faith that their mind can neither conceive nor reconcile the negative attributes and theological abstractions with the human and moral qualities that are ascribed to the divinity  the chapter ix on the superiority of naturalism over theism as a basis for the most wholesome kind of morality is still worth reading by men in search of weapons against the presumptuous commonplaces of the pulpit in this sphere holbach is as earnest and severe as the most rigorous moralist that ever wrote people who talk of the moral levity of the destructive literature of the eighteenth century would be astonished if they could bring themselves to read the books about which they talk by the elevation of the system of nature the writer points out the necessarily evil influence upon morals of a book popularly taken to be inspired in which the divinity is represented as now prescribing virtue but now again prescribing crime and absurdity who is sometimes the friend and sometimes the enemy of the human race who is sometimes pictured as reasonable just and beneficent and at other times as insensate unjust capricious and despotic such divinities and the priests of such divinities are incapable of being the models types and arbiters of virtue and righteousness no we must seek a base for morality in the necessity of things whatever the cause that placed man in the abode in which he dwells and endowed him with his facultieswhether we regard the human species as the work of nature or of some intelligent being distinct from naturethe existence of man such as we see him to be is a fact we see in him a being who feels thinks has intelligence has selflove who strives to make life agreeable to himself and who lives in society with beings like himself beings whom by his conduct he may make his friends or his enemies it is on these universal sentiments that you ought to base morality which is nothing more nor less than the science of the duties of man living in society the moment you attempt to find a base for morals outside of human nature you go wrong no other is solid and sure the aid of the socalled sanctions of theology is not only needless but mischievous the alliance of the realities of duty with theological phantoms exposes duty to the same ruin which daylight brings to the superstition that has been associated with duty it sets up the arbitrary demands of a varying something named piety in place of the plain requirements of right as for saying that without god man cannot have moral sentiments or in other words cannot distinguish between vice and virtue it is as if one said that without the idea of god man would not feel the necessity of eating and drinking  the writer then breaks out into a long and sustained contrast from which we may make a short extract to illustrate the heat to which the battle had now come  nature invites man to love himself incessantly to augment the sum of his happiness religion orders him to love only a formidable god who is worthy of hatred to detest and despise himself and to sacrifice to his terrible idol the sweetest and most lawful pleasures nature bids man consult his reason and take it for his guide religion teaches him that this reason is corrupted that it is a faithless truthless guide implanted by a treacherous god to mislead his creatures nature tells man to seek light to search for the truth religion enjoins upon him to examine nothing to remain in ignorance nature says to man cherish glory labour to win esteem be active courageous industrious religion says to him be humble abject pusillanimous live in retreat busy thyself in prayer meditation devout rites be useless to thyself and do nothing for others nature proposes for her model men endowed with noble energetic beneficent souls who have usefully served their fellowcitizens religion makes a show and a boast of the abject spirits the pious enthusiasts the phrenetic penitents the vile fanatics who for their ridiculous opinions have troubled empires nature tells children to honour to love to hearken to their parents to be the stay and support of their old age religion bids them prefer the oracle of their god and to trample father and mother under foot when divine interests are concerned nature commands the perverse man to blush for his vices for his shameless desires his crimes religion says to the most corrupt fear to kindle the wrath of a god whom thou knowest not but if against his laws thou hast committed crime remember that he is easy to appease and of great mercy go to his temple humble thyself at the feet of his ministers expiate thy misdeeds by sacrifices offerings prayers these will wash away thy stain in the eyes of the eternal  of course philosophical criticism would have much to say about this glowing mass of furious propositions for the first voice of nature hardly whispers into the ear of the primitive man all these high and generous promptings but if by nature we here understand the encyclopædists and by religion the catholic church in france at that moment then holbachs fiery antitheses are a tolerably fair account of the matter and the political side of the indictment was hardly less just though its hardihood appalled men like voltaire  nature says to man thou art free and no power on earth can lawfully strip thee of thy rights religion cries to him that he is a slave condemned by god to groan under the rod of gods representatives nature bids man to love the country that gave him birth to serve it with all loyalty to bind his interests to hers against every hand that might be raised upon her religion commands him to obey without a murmur the tyrants that oppress his country to take their part against her to chain his fellowcitizens under their lawless caprices yet if the sovereign be not devoted enough to his priests religion instantly changes her tone she incites the subjects to rebellion she makes resistance a duty she cries aloud that we must obey god rather than man if the nature of man were consulted on politics which supernatural ideas have so shamefully depraved it would contribute far more than all the religion in the world to make communities happy powerful and prosperous under reasonable authority this nature would teach princes that they are men and not gods that they are citizens charged by their fellowcitizens with watching over the safety of all instead of attributing to the divine vengeance all the wars the famines the plagues that lay nations low would it not have been more useful to show them that such calamities are due to the passions the indolence the tyranny of their princes who sacrifice the nations to their hideous delirium natural evils demand natural remedies ought not experience therefore long ago to have undeceived mortals as to those supernatural remedies those expiations prayers sacrifices fastings processions that all the peoples of the earth have so vainly opposed to the woes that overwhelmed them let us recognise the plain truth then that it is these supernatural ideas that have obscured morality corrupted politics hindered the advance of the sciences and extinguished happiness and peace even in the very heart of man                                       holbach was a vigorous propagandist two years after the appearance of his masterwork he drew up its chief propositions in a short and popular volume called good sense or natural ideas opposed to supernatural his zeal led him to write and circulate a vast number of other tractates and short volumes the bare list of which would fill several of these pages all inciting their readers to an intellectual revolt against the reigning system in church and state he lived to get a glimpse of the very edge and sharp bend of the great cataract he died in the spring of 1789 if he had only lived five years longer he would have seen the great church of notre dame solemnly consecrated by legislative decree to the worship of reason bishops publicly trampling on crosier and ring amid universal applause and vast crowds exulting in processions whose hero was an ass crowned with a mitre     chapter vii  raynals history of the indies   since montesquieus esprit des lois says grimm in his chronicle our literature has perhaps produced no monument that is worthier to pass to the remotest posterity and to consecrate the progress of our enlightenment and diligence for ever than raynals philosophical and political history of european settlements and commerce in the two indies yet it is perhaps safe to say that not one hundred persons now living have ever read two chapters of the book for which this immortal future was predicted  when the revolutionary floods gradually subsided some of the monuments of the previous age began to show themselves above the surface of the falling waters they had lost amid the stormy agitation of the deluge the shining splendour of their first days still men found something to attract them after the revolution as their grandfathers had done before it in the pages of the spirit of laws of the new heloïsa and the endless satires romances and poems of the great voltaire raynals book was not among these dead glories that came to life again it disappeared utterly nor can it be said that it deserved a kinder fate its only interest now is for those who care to know the humour of mens minds in those prærevolutionary days when they could devour a long political and commercial history as if it had been a novel or a play and when the turn of mens interests made of such a book the bible of two worlds for nearly twenty years  raynal is no commanding figure born in 1711 he came to paris from southern france and joined the troop of needy priests who swarmed in the great city hopefully looking out for the prizes of the church raynal is the hero of an anecdote which is told of more than one abbé of the time whether literally true or not it is probably a correct illustration of the evil pass to which ecclesiastical manners had come he had it was said nothing to live upon save the product of a few masses the abbé prévost received twenty sous for saying a mass he paid the abbé laporte fifteen sous to be his deputy the abbé laporte paid eight sous to raynal to say it in his stead but the adventurer was not destined to remain in this abject case parasite humbly feeding on parasite he turned bookmaker and wrote a history of the stadtholderate a volume about the english parliament and of all curious subjects for a man of letters of that date an account of the divorce of king henry the eighth of england he visited this country more than once and had the honour in 1754 of being chosen a fellow of the royal society of london157 we have some difficulty in understanding how he came by such fame just as we cannot tell how the man who had been glad to earn a few pence by saying masses came shortly to be rich and independent he is believed to have engaged in some colonial ventures and to have had good luck his enemies spread the dark report that he had made money in the slave trade but in those days of incensed party spirit there was no limit to virulent invention it is at least undeniable that raynal put his money to generous uses among other things he had the current fancy of the time that the world could be made better by the copious writing of essays and he delighted in founding prizes for them at the provincial academies it was at lyons that he proposed the famous thesis not unworthy of consideration even at this day has the discovery of america been useful or injurious to the human race      157 the biographie universelle followed by the encyclopædia     britannica tells a story of raynal visiting the house of commons     the speaker says the writer learning that he was in the gallery     suspended the discussion until a distinguished place had been found     for the french philosopher this must be set down as a myth the     journals have been searched and there is no official confirmation     of the statement improbable enough on the face of it  raynal was one of the most assiduous of the guests at the philosophic meals of baron holbach and helvétius he was very goodhumoured easy to live with and free from that irritable selfconsciousness and selflove which is too commonly the curse of the successful writer as of other successful persons he did not go into company merely to make the hours fly with him as with helvétius society was a workshop he pressed every one with questions as to all matters great or small with which the interlocutor was likely to be familiar158 horace walpole met him at dull holbachs and the abbé at once began to tease him across the table as to the english colonies walpole knew as little about them as he knew about coptic so he made signs to his tormentor that he was deaf on another occasion raynal dined at strawberry hill and mortified the vanity of his host by looking at none of its wonders himself and keeping up such a fire of talk and crossexamination as to prevent anybody else from looking at them there never was such an impertinent and tiresome old gossip cried our own gossip159      158 morellet i 221      159 walpoles corresp vi 147 and 445  raynal failed to give better men than horace walpole the sense of power when his greatest work took the public by storm nobody would believe that he had written it just as in the case of the system of nature so people set down the history of the indies to diderot and even the most moderate critics insisted that he had at any rate written not less than onethird of it many less conspicuous scribes were believed to have been raynals drudges we can have no difficulty in supposing that so bulky a work engaged many hands there is no unity of composition no equal scale no regularity of proportion on the contrary rhapsody and sober description history and moral disquisition commerce law physics and metaphysics are all poured in almost as if by hazard we seem to watch half a dozen writers each dealing with matters according to his own individual taste and his own peculiar kind of knowledge  indeed it is a curious and most interesting feature in the literary activity of france in the eighteenth century that the egoism and vanity of authorship were reduced by the conditions of the time to a lower degree than in any other generation since letters were invented the suppression of self by the jesuits was hardly more complete than the suppression of self by the most brilliant and effective of the insurgents against jesuitry such intimate association as exists in our day between a given book and a given personality was then thoroughly shaken by the constant necessity for secrecy as we have seen people hardly knew who set up that momentous landmark the system of nature voltaire habitually and vehemently denied every one of his most characteristic pieces and though in the buzz of parisian gossip the right name was surely hit upon for such unique performances as voltaires yet the fame was far too broken and uncertain to reward his vanity if the better part of himself had not been fully and sincerely engaged in public objects in which vanity had no part rousseau was an exception but then rousseau was in truth a reactionist and not a loyal member of the great company of reformers as for diderot he valued the authors laurel so cheaply as we have seen that with a gigantic heedlessness and saturnian weariness of the plaudits or hisses of the audience while supremely interested in the deeper movements of the tragicomic drama of the world he left some of his masterpieces lying unknown in forgotten chests again in the case of the encyclopædia as we have also seen turgot as well as less eminent men bargained that their names should not be made public wherever a telling blow was to be dealt with the sword or a new stone to be laid with the trowel men were always found ready to spend themselves and be spent without taking thought whether their share in the work should be nicely measured and publicly identified or absorbed and lost in the whole of which it was a part  whatever may have been the secret of the authorship of raynals book and whether or no even the general conception of such a performance was due to raynal it is at least certain that the original author whoever he may have been divined a remarkable literary opportunity this divination is in authorship what felicity of experiment is to the scientific discoverer the book came into immediate vogue it was published in 1772 a second edition was demanded within a couple of years and it is computed that more than twenty editions as well as countless pirated versions were exhausted before the universal curiosity and interest were satisfied as the subject took the writer over the whole world so he found readers in every part of the habitable globe and among them were men for whom destiny had lofty parts in store zeal carried one young reader so far that he collected all the boldest passages into a single volume and published it as lesprit de raynal an achievement for which as he was a member of a religious congregation he afterwards got into some trouble160 franklin read and admired the book in london black toussaint louverture in his slavecabin at hayti laboriously spelled his way through its pages and found in their story of the wrongs of his race and their passionate appeal against slavery the first definite expression of thoughts which had already been dimly stirred in his generous spirit by the brutalities that were every day enacted under his eyes gibbon solemnly immortalised raynal by describing him in one of the great chapters of the decline and fall as a writer who with a just confidence had prefixed to his own history the honourable epithets of political and philosophical161 robertson whose excellent history of america covering part of raynals ground was not published until 1777 complimented raynal on his ingenuity and eloquence and reproduced some of raynals historical speculations162      160 hédouin by name      161 ch xxi      162 works xii 189 edition of 1822  frederick the great began to read it and for some days spoke enthusiastically to his french satellites at dinner of its eloquence and reason all at once he became silent and he never spoke a word about the book again he had suddenly come across half a dozen pages of vigorous rhapsodising delivered for his own good  oh frederick frederick thou wast gifted by nature with a bold and lively imagination a curiosity that knew no bounds a passion for industry humanity everywhere in chains everywhere cast down wiped away her tears at the sight of thy earliest labours and seemed to find a solace for all her woes in the hope of finding in thee her avenger on the dread theatre of war thy swiftness skill and order amazed all nations thou wast regarded as the model of warriorkings there exists a still more glorious name the name of citizenking once more open thy heart to the noble and virtuous sentiments that were the delight of thy young days he then rebukes frederick for keeping money locked up in his military chest instead of throwing it into circulation for his violent and arbitrary administration and for the excessive imposts under which his people groaned dare still more give rest to the earth let the authority of thy mediation and the power of thy arms force peace on the restless nations the universe is the only country of a great man and the only theatre for thy genius become then the benefactor of nations163      163 book v § 31  in after days when raynal visited berlin overflowing with vanity and selfimportance he succeeded with some difficulty in procuring an interview with the king and then frederick took his revenge he told raynal that years ago he had read the history of the stadtholderate and of the english parliament raynal modestly interposed that since those days he had written more important works i dont know them said the king in a tone that closed the subject164      164 thiébault iii 172 where there is a long and most     disparaging account of raynal by no means incredible though we     must remember that a competent judge has pronounced thiébault to be     stupid incorrect and the prey of stupidities  more disinterested persons than frederick set as low a value on raynals performance one writer even compares the book to a quack mounted on a waggon retailing to the gaping crowd a number of commonplaces against despotism and religion without a single curious thing about them except their hardihood165 but the instinct of the gaping crowd was sound measured by the standard and requirements of modern science raynals history is no high achievement it may perhaps be successfully contended that the true conception of history has on the whole gone back rather than advanced within the last hundred years there have been many signs in our own day of its becoming narrow pedantic and trivial it threatens to degenerate from a broad survey of great periods and movements of human societies into vast and countless accumulations of insignificant facts sterile knowledge and frivolous antiquarianism in which the spirit of epochs is lost and the direction meaning and summary of the various courses of human history all disappear voltaires essai sur les moeurs shows a perfectly true notion of what kind of history is worth either writing or reading robertsons view of the progress of society in europe from the fall of the roman empire to the sixteenth century iswith all its imperfectionsadmirably just sensible and historic in its whole scope and treatment raynal himself though far below such writers as voltaire and robertson in judgment and temper yet is not without a luminous breadth of outlook and does not forget the superior importance of the effect of events on european development over any possible number of minute particularities in the events themselves he does not forget for instance in describing the portuguese conquests in the east indies to point out that the most remarkable and momentous thing about them was the check that they inflicted on the growth of the ottoman power at a moment in european history when the christian states were least able to resist and least likely to combine against the designs of solyman166 this is really the observation best worth making about the portuguese conquests and it illustrates raynals habit and the habit of the good minds of that century of incessantly measuring events by their consequences to western enlightenment and freedom and of dropping out of sight all irrelevancies of detail      165 sénac de meilhan 123      166 book i § 7 robertson works out this reflection in his     historical disquisition concerning ancient india iv § 8  this signal merit need not blind us to raynals shortcomings in the other direction there are very few dates the total absence of references and authorities was condemned by gibbon as the unpardonable blemish of what is otherwise a most entertaining book there is no criticism as raynal was a mere literary compiler it was not to be expected that he should rise above the common deficiencies in the thought and methods of his time it was not to be expected that he should deal with the various groups of phenomena among primitive races in the scientific spirit of modern anthropology it is true that he was contemporary with de brosses who ranks among the founders of the study of the origins of human culture one sentence of de brosses would have warned raynal against a vicious method which made nearly all that was written about primitive men by him and everybody else of the same school utterly false worthless and deluding it is not in possibilities said de brosses it is in man himself that we must study man it is not for us to imagine what man might have done or ought to have done but to observe what he did of the origin and growth of a myth for example raynal had no rational idea when he found a myth what he did was to reduce it to the terms of human action and then coolly to describe it as historical the ancient peruvian legend that laws and arts had been brought to their land by two divine children of the sun mancocapac and his sisterwife mancaoello is transformed into a grave and prosaic narrative in which mancocapacs achievements are minutely described with as much assurance as if that sage had been frederick the great or pombal or any statesman living before the eyes of the writer endless illustrations some of them amusing enough might be given of this euhemeristic fashion of dealing with the primitive legends of human infancy  on the other hand if raynal turns myth into history he constantly resorts to the opposite method and turns the hard prose of real life into doubtful poetry if he reduces the demigods to men he delights also in surrounding savage men with the joyous conditions of the pastoral demigods he can never resist an opportunity of introducing an idyll it was the fashion of the time begun by rousseau and perfected by the author of paul and virginia the taste for idylls of savage life had at least one merit it was a way of teaching people that the life of savages is something normal systematic coherent and not mere chaos formless and void unrelated to the life of civilisation a recent traveller had given an account of an annual ceremony in china which raynal borrowed without acknowledgment167 m poivré had described how the emperor once every year went forth into the fields and there with his own hand guided the plough as it traced the long furrows raynal elaborated this formality into a characteristic rhapsody on peace simplicity plenty and the father of his people as a caustic critic of m poivré remarked if a chinese traveller had arrived at versailles on the morning of holy thursday he would have found the king of france humbly washing the feet of twelve poor and aged men yet as frenchmen knew this would be no occasion for rapturous exultation over the lowliness and humanity of the french court      167 voyage dun philosophe etc a work published in 1768 and     in great vogue for some time partly because it furnished material     for the speculations of raynal helvétius and the rest see de     lhomme ii xiii etc grimm v 450  in the same spirit raynal made no scruple in filling his pages with the sentimental declamations in which the reaction of that day against the burden of a decaying system of social artifice found such invariable relief and satisfaction none of these imaginary pieces of high sentiment was more popular than the episode of polly baker it occurs in the chapters which describe the foundation of new england168 the fanaticism and intolerance of the puritan fathers of that famous land are set forth with the holy rage that always moved the reformers of the eighteenth century against the reformers of the seventeenth religion is boldly spoken of as a dreadful malady whose severity extended even to the most indifferent objects it may be admitted that the cruel persecution of the quakers and the grotesque horrors of witchfinding in new salem gave raynal at least as good a text against protestantism as he had found against catholicism in the infernal doings in the west indian islands or in peru even after this bloody fever had abated says raynal the inhabitants still preserved a kind of rigorism that savours of the sombre days in which the puritan colonies had their rise he illustrates this by the case of a young woman who was brought before the authorities for the offence of having given birth to a child out of wedlock it was her fifth transgression raynal conceiving history after the manner of the author of the immortal speeches of pericles put into the mouth of the unfortunate sinner a long and eloquent apology at the risk of her life she cries she has brought five children into existence i have devoted myself with all the courage of a mothers solicitude to the painful toil demanded by their weakness and their tender years i have formed them to virtue which is only another name for reason already they love their country as i love it is it a crime then to be fruitful as the earth is fruitful the common mother of us all and how am i not to cry out against the injustice of my lot when i see that he who seduced and ruined me after being the cause of my destruction enjoys honour and power and is actually seated in the tribunal where they punish my misfortune with rods and with infamy who was that barbarous lawgiver who deciding between the two sexes kept all his wrath for the weaker for that luckless sex which pays for a single pleasure by a thousand dangersand so forth it need hardly be said that this is far too much in the vein and almost in the words of diderot to have any authenticity and as it happens there is a piece of external evidence on the matter which illustrates raynals curious lightheartedness as to historic veracity franklin and silas deane were one day talking together about the many blunders in raynals book when the author himself happened to step in they told him of what they had been speaking nay says raynal i took the greatest care not to insert a single fact for which i had not the most unquestionable authority deane then fell on the story of polly baker and declared of his own certain knowledge that there had never been a law against bastardy in massachusetts raynal persisted that he must have had the whole case from some source of indisputable trustworthiness until franklin broke in upon him with a loud laugh and explained that when he was a printer of a newspaper they were sometimes short of news and to amuse his customers he invented fictions that were as welcome to them as facts one of these fictions was the legend of raynals heroine the abbé was not in the least disconcerted very well doctor he replied i would rather relate your stories than other mens truths169      168 book xvii      169 jefferson quoted in partons life of franklin ii 418  when all has been said that need be said about the glaring shortcomings of the history of the indies its popularity still remains to be accounted for if we ask for the causes of this striking success they are perhaps not very far to seek for one thing the book is remarkable both for its variety and its animation horace walpole wrote about it to lady aylesbury in terms that do not at all overstate its liveliness it tells one everything in the world how to make conquests invasions blunders settlements bankruptcies fortunes etc tells you the natural and historical history of all nations talks commerce navigation tea coffee china mines salt spices of the portuguese english french dutch danes spaniards arabs caravans persians indians of louis xiv and the king of prussia of la bourdonnais dupleix and admiral saunders of rice and women that dance naked of camels gingham and muslin of millions of millions of lires pounds rupees and cowries of iron cables and circassian women of law and the mississippi and against all governments and religions170      170 walpoles letters v 421  all this is really not too highly coloured and raynals cosmorama exactly hit the tastes of the hour the readers of that day were full of a new curiosity about the world outside of france and the less known families of the human stock it was no doubt more like the curiosity of keenwitted children than the curiosity of science montesquieu first stirred this interest in the unfamiliar forms of custom institution creed motive and daily manners but while montesquieu treated such matters fragmentarily and in connection with a more or less abstract discussion on polity raynal made them the objects of a vivid and concrete picture and presented them in the easier shape of a systematic history again if the reading class in france were intelligently curious it must be added we fear that they were not without a certain lubricity of imagination which was pleasantly tickled by sensuous descriptions of the ways of life that were strange to the iron restraints of civilisation finally the public of that day always chose to veil and confuse the furtive voluptuousness of the time by moral disquisition and a light and busy meddling with the insoluble perplexities of philosophy here too the dexterous raynal knew how to please the fancies of his patrons and whether diderot was or was not the writer of those pages of moral sophism and paradox there is something in them which incessantly reminds us of his supplement to bougainvilles voyages  among the superficial causes of the popularity of raynals history we cannot leave out the circumstance that it was composed after a very interesting and critical moment in the colonial relations of france the seven years war ended in the expulsion of the french from canada and from their possessions in the east indies when the peace of 1763 was made this was counted the most disastrous part of that final record and sealing of misfortune when we see with what attachment the ordinary frenchman of today regards what is as yet the thankless possession of algeria we might easily have guessed even if the correspondence of the time had set it forth less distinctly than it does with what deep concern and mortification the french of that day saw the white flag and its lilies driven for ever from the banks of the st lawrence in the west and the coast of coromandel in the east raynal himself tells us with what zealous impatience the government attempted to make the nation forget its calamities by stirring the hope of a better fortune in the region to which they gave the magnificent name of equinoctial france the establishment of a free and national population among the scented forests and teeming swamps of guiana was to bring rich compensation for the icy tracts of canada this utopia of a brilliant settlement in guiana has steadily invested the minds of french statesmen from choiseul down to louis napoleon and its history is a striking monument of perversity and folly but from 1763 to 1770 while raynal was writing his book mens minds were full of the heroic design and this augmented their interest in the general themes which raynal handledcolonisation commerce and the overthrow and settlement of new worlds by the old  however much all these things may have quickened the popularity of raynals history yet the true source of it lay deeper lay in the fuel which the book supplied to the two master emotions of the hourthe hatred and contempt for religion and the passion for justice and freedom the subject easily lent itself to these two strong currents or we may say that hatred of religion and passion for justice and freedom were in fact the subjects and that the commercial establishments and political relations of the new worlds in the east and west were only the setting and framework raynal was perhaps the first person to see that the surest way of discrediting catholicism was to write some chapters of its history gibbon resorted to the same device shortly afterwards and found in the contemptuous analysis of heresies and the selfish and violent motives of councils and prelates as good an occasion of piercing the church as raynal found in painting the abominable fraud and cruelty that made the presence of christians so dire a curse to the helpless inhabitants of the new lands and the same reproachful background which gibbon so artistically introduced in the humane intelligent and happy epoch of the pagan antonines raynal invented for the same purpose of making christianity seem uglier in the imaginary simplicity and unbroken gladness of the native races whose blood was shed by christian aggressors as if it had been water  it would perhaps have been singular at a moment when men were looking round on every side for such weapons as might come to their hand if they had missed the horrible action of catholicism when brought into contact with the lower races of mankind there is no more deplorable chapter in the annals of the race and there is none which the historian of christianity should be less willing to pass over lightly the ruthless cruelty of the spanish conquerors in the new world is a profoundly instructive illustration of the essential narrowness of the papal christianity its pitiful exclusiveness its low and bad morality and above all its incurable unfitness for dealing with the spirit and motives of men in face of the violent temptations with which the wealth of the new world now assailed and corrupted them catholicism had held triumphant possession of the conscience of europe for a dozen centuries and more the stories of the american archipelago of mexico of peru even if told by calmer historians than raynal show how little power amid all this triumph of the ecclesiastical letter had been won by the christian spirit over the rapacity the lust the bloody violence of the natural man they show what a superficial thing the professed religion of the ages of faith had been how enormous a task remained and how much the most arduous part of this task was to make catholicism itself civilised and moral for it is hardly denied that christianity had done worse than merely fail to provide an effective curb on the cruel passions of men the spanish conquerors showed that it had nursed a still more cruel passion than the rude interests of material selfishness had ever engendered by making the extermination or enslavement of these hapless people a duty to the catholic church and a savoury sacrifice in the nostrils of the most high  it is true that a philosophic historian will have to take into account the important consideration that the reckless massacres perpetrated by the subjects of the most catholic king were less horrible and less permanently depraving than the daily offering of the bleeding hearts of human victims in the temples of huitzilopochtli and tezcatlipuk he would have to remember as even raynal does that if the slavedrivers and murderers were catholics so also was las casas the apostle of justice and mercy still the fact remains that the doctrine of moral obligations towards the lower races had not yet taken its place in europe any more than the doctrine of our obligation to the lower animals our ministers and companions has yet taken its place among italians and spaniards the fact remains that the old christianity in the sixteenth century was unable to deal effectively with the new conditions in which the world found itself as catholicism now in france in the eighteenth century proved itself unable to harmonise the new moral aspirations and new social necessities of the time with the ancient tradition raynal was right in telling over again the afflicting story of her earlier failure and in identifying the creed that murdered calas and la barre before their own eyes with the creed that had blasted the future of the fairest portion of the new world two centuries before  the mere circumstance however that the book was one long and powerful innuendo against the church would not have been enough to secure its vast popularity attacks on the church had become cheap by this time the eighteenth century as it is one of the chief aims of these studies to show had a positive side of at least equal importance and equal strength with its negative side as we have so often said its writers were inspired by zeal for political justice for humanity for better and more equal laws for the amelioration of the common lota zeal which in energy sincerity and disinterestedness has never been surpassed raynals work was perhaps on the whole the most vigorous and sustained of all the literary expressions that were given to the great social ideas of the century it wholly lacked the strange and concentrated glow that burned in the pages of the social contract on the other hand it was more full of movement of reality of vivid and picturesque incident it was popular and it was concrete raynals story went straight to the hearts of many people to whom rousseaus arguments were only half intelligible and wholly dreary it was that book of the eighteenth century which brought the lower races finally within the pale of right and duty in the common opinion of france the engravings that face the titlepage in each of the seven volumes give the keynote to the effect that the seven volumes produced in one we see a philosopher writing on a column those old words of dolorous pregnancy auri sacra fames while in the distance spanish and portuguese ships ride at anchor and on the shore white men massacre blacks in another we see a fair woman typifying bounteous nature giving her nourishment to a white infant at one breast and to a black infant at the other while she turns a pitiful eye to a scene in the background where a gang of negro slaves work among the sugarcanes under the scourge and the goad of ruthless masters a third frontispiece gives us the story of inkle and yarico which raynal sets down to some english poet but as no english poet is known to have touched that moving tale until the younger colman dramatised it in 1787 we may suspect that raynal had remembered it from steeles paper in the spectator the last of these pieces represents a cultivated landscape adorned with villages and its ports thronged with shipping in the foreground are two quakers one of them benignly embracing some young indians the other casting indignantly away from him a bow and its arrows the symbols of division and war  the most effective chapters in the book were in truth eloquent sermons on these simple and pathetic texts they brought negroes and indians within the relations of human brotherhood they preached a higher morality towards these poor children of bondage they inspired a new pity they moved more generous sympathies and they did this in such a way as not merely to affect mens feelings about indians and negroes slavelabour and the yet more hateful slavetrade but at the same time to develop and strengthen a general feeling for justice equality and beneficence in all the arrangements and relations of the social union all over the world the same movement which brought the suffering blacks of the new world within the sphere of moral duty and invested them with rights intensified the same notion of rights and duties in association with the suffering people of france this was the sentiment that reigned during the boyhood and youth of those who were destined some twenty years after raynals book was first placed in their hands to carry that sentiment out into a fiery and victorious reality  montesquieu had opened the various questions connected with slavery we can have no better measure of the increased heat in france between 1750 and 1770 than the difference in tone between two authors so equal in popularity if so unequal in merit as raynal and montesquieu the latter without justifying the abuses or even the usage of slavery in any shape had still sought to give a rational account of its growth as an institution171 raynal could not read this with patience he typifies all the passion of the revolt against the historic method montesquieu he says could not make up his mind to treat the question of slavery seriously in fact it is a degradation of reason to employ it i will not say in defending but even in combating an abuse so contrary to all reason whoever justifies so odious a system deserves from the philosopher the deepest contempt and from the negro a daggerstroke if you put a finger on me i will kill myself said clarissa to lovelace and i would say to the man that should assail my freedom if you come near me i poniard you will any one tell me that he who seeks to make me a slave is only using his rights where are they these rights who has stamped on them a mark sacred enough to silence mine if thou thinkest thyself authorised to oppress me because thou art stronger and craftier than ithen do not complain when my strong arms shall tear thy breast open to find thy heart do not complain when in thy spasmriven bowels thou feelest the deadly doom which i have passed into them with thy food be thou a victim in thy turn and expiate the crime of the oppressor172      171 book xv of the esprit des lois      172 book xi § 30  raynal then asks the political question how we can hope to throw down an edifice that is propped up by universal passion by established laws by the rivalries of powerful nations and by the force of prejudices more powerful still to what tribunal he cries shall we carry the sacred appeal he can find no better answer than that of turgot and the economists it is to kings that we must look for the redress of these monstrous abominations it is for kings to carry fire and sword among the oppressors your armies he cries anticipating the famous expression of a writer of our own day will be filled with the holy enthusiasm of humanity in a more practical vein raynal then warns his public of the terrible reckoning which awaits the whites if the blacks ever rise to avenge their wrongs the negroes only need a chief courageous enough to lead them to vengeance and carnage where is he that great man whom nature owes to the honour of the human race where is he that new spartacus who will find no crassus then the black code will vanish how terrible will the white code be we may easily realise the effect which vehement words like these had upon toussaint and upon those for whom toussaint reproduced them  men have constantly been asking themselves what the great literary precursors of the revolution would have thought and how they would have acted if they could have survived to the days of the terror what would voltaire have said of robespierre how would rousseau have borne himself at the jacobin club would diderot have followed the procession of the goddess of reason to ask whether these famous men would have sanctioned the terror is to insult great memories but there is no reason to suppose that their strong spirits would have faltered one or two of the younger generation of the famous philosophic party did actually see the breakup of the old order condorcet faced the storm with a heroism of spirit that has never been surpassed disgust at the violent excesses of bad men could never make him unfaithful to the beneficence of the movement which their frenzy distorted  raynal was of weaker mould and showed that there had been a stratum of cant and borrowed formulas in his eloquence he lived into the very darkest days and watched the succession of events with a keen eye his heart began to quail very early long before the bloodier times of the internecine war between the factions and on the eve of the attempted flight of the king he addressed a letter to the national assembly may 31 1791 the letter is not wanting in firm and courageous phrases i have long dared he began to tell kings of their duties let me today tell the people of its errors and the representatives of the people of the perils that menace us all he then proceeded to inveigh in his old manner but with a new purpose and a changed destination this time it was not kings and priests whom he denounced but a government enslaved by popular tyranny soldiers without discipline chiefs without authority ministers without resources the rudest and most ignorant of men daring to settle the most difficult political questions how comes it he asks that after declaring the dogma of the liberty of religious opinions you allow priests to be overwhelmed by persecution and outrage because they do not follow your religious opinions in the same energetic vein he protests against the failure of the constituent assembly to found a stable and vigorous government and to put an end to the vengeances the seditions the outbreaks that filled the air with confusion and menace it was in short a vigorous pamphlet written in the interest of malouet and the constitutional royalists the assembly listened but not without some rude interruptions robespierre hastened to the tribune after condemning the tone of raynals letter he disclaimed any intention of calling down the severity either of the assembly or of public opinion upon a man who still preserved a great name he thought that a sufficient excuse for the writers apostasy might be found in his advanced age the assembly agreed with robespierre and passed to the order of the day173      173 hamels robespierre i 456458  raynal lived to see his predictions fulfilled with a terrible bitterness of fulfilment in spite of the anger which he had roused in the breasts of powerful personages the aged man was not guillotined he was not even imprisoned all his property was taken from him and he died in abject poverty in the spring of 1796 let us hope that the misery of his end was assuaged by the recollection that he had once been a powerful pleader for noble causes     chapter viii  diderots closing years   at the end of a long series of notes and questions on points in anatomy and physiology which he had been collecting for many years diderot wound up with a strange outburst  i shall not know until the end what i have lost or gained in this vast gaminghouse where i shall have passed some threescore years dicebox in hand tesseras agitans  what do i perceive forms and what besides forms of the substance i know nothing we walk among shadows ourselves shadows to ourselves and to others  if i look at a rainbow traced on a cloud i can perceive it for him who looks at it from another angle there is nothing  a fancy common enough among the living is to dream that they are dead that they stand by the side of their own corpse and follow their own funeral it is like a swimmer watching his garments stretched out on the shore  philosophy that habitual and profound meditation which takes us away from all that surrounds us which annihilates our own personality is another apprenticeship for death174      174 elémens de physiologie oeuv ix 428  this was now to be seen diderot as we have said came back from his expedition to russia in the autumn of 1744 tranquilly counting on half a score more years to make up the tale of his days he remained in temper and habit through this long evening of his life what he had been in its morning and noontidefriendly industrious cheerful exuberant in conversation keenly interested in the march of liberal and progressive ideas on his return his wife and daughter found him thin and altered a few months of absence so often suffice to reveal that our friend has grown old and that time is casting long shadows age seems to have come in a day like sudden winter he was as gay and as kindly as ever some of his friends had declared that he would never bethink himself of returning at all time and space in his eyes said galiani are as in the eyes of the almighty he thinks that he is everywhere and that he is eternal175 they had predicted for diderot at st petersburg the fate of descartes at the court of queen christina but the philosopher triumphantly vindicated his character my good wife said he when he had reached the old familiar fourth floor prithee count my things thou wilt find no reason for scolding i have not lost a single handkerchief176      175 corresp ii 180      176 oeuv i 54  this cheerfulness however did not hide from his friends that he was subject to a languor which had been unknown before his journey to russia it was not the peevish fatigue that often brings life to an unworthy close he remained true to the healthy temper of his prime and found himself across the threshold of old age without repining as the veteran cephalus said to socrates regrets and complaints are not in a mans age but in his temper and he who is of a happy nature will scarcely feel the burden of the years  in 1762 diderot had written to mdlle voland a page of affecting musings on the great pathetic theme       you ask me why the more our life is filled up and busy the less      are we attached to it if that is true it is because a busy life      is for the most part an innocent life we think less about death      and so we fear it less without perceiving it we resign ourselves      to the common lot of all the beings that we watch around us dying      and being born again in an incessant ever renewing circle after      having for a season fulfilled the tasks that nature year by year      imposes on us we grow weary of them and release ourselves      energies fade we become feebler we crave the close of life as      after working hard we crave the close of the day living in harmony      with nature we learn not to rebel against the orders that we see      in necessary and universal execution there is nobody among us      who having worn himself out in toil has not seen the hour of rest      approach with supreme delight life for some of us is only one long      day of weariness and death a long slumber and the coffin a bed of      rest and the earth only a pillow where it is sweet when all is      done to lay ones head never to raise it again i confess to you      that when looked at in this way and after the long endless      crosses that i have had death is the most agreeable of prospects      i am bent on teaching myself more and more to see it so177      177 letter to mdlle voland sept 23 1762 xix 136 137  again we are reminded by diderots words on this last gentle epilogue to a harassing performance of platos picture of aged cephalus sitting in a cushioned chair with the garland round his brows i was in the country almost alone free from cares and disquiet letting the hours flow on with no other object than to find myself by the evening as sometimes one finds ones self in the morning after a night that has been busy with a pleasant dream the years had left me none of the passions that are our torment none of the weariness that follows them i had lost my taste for all the frivolities that are made so important by our hope that we shall enjoy them long i said to myself if the little that i have done and the little that is left for me to do should perish with me what would the human race be the loser what should i be the loser myself178      178 the dedication of the règnes de claude et de néron to     naigeon iii 9  this was the mood in which diderot wrote his singular apology for the life and character of seneca rosenkranz makes the excellent reflection that though diderot attained to a more free comprehension of greek art and especially of homer than most of his contemporaries yet even with him the roman element was dominant it was horace terence lucretius tacitus seneca who to the very end came closer to him than any of the greeks the moralising reflection the satirical tendency the declamatory form of the romans all had an irresistible attraction for him179 both roger bacon and francis bacon had preceded him in admiration for seneca and montaigne found cicero tiresome and unprofitable compared with the author of the epistles to lucilius when there comes any misfortune to a european says the imaginary oriental of montesquieus persian letters his only resource is the reading of a philosopher called seneca180      179 diderots leben ii 357      180 see mr brewers preface to roger bacon p 73 montaignes     chapter des livres and the defense de sénèque et de plutarque     let pers 33  but diderot was not a man to admire by halves and to literary praise of senecas writings he added a thoroughgoing vindication of his career in his early days he had referred disparagingly to seneca181 but reflection or accident had made him change his mind the cheap severity of abstract ethics has always abounded against seneca and this severity was what diderot had all his life found insupportable holbach had induced lagrange a young man of letters whom he had rescued from want to undertake the translation of seneca and when lagrange died holbach prevailed on naigeon diderots fervid disciple to complete and revise the work which still remains the best of the french versions that done then both holbach and naigeon urged diderot to write an account of the philosopher      181 essai sur le mérite et la vertu oeuv i 118 note  the essay on the reigns of claudius and nero182 is marked by as much vehemence as much sincerity of enthusiasm as if seneca had been diderots personal friend there is a flame a passion about it an ingenuous air of conviction which are not common in historical apologies it is inevitable as the composition is diderots that it should have many a rambling and declamatory page his paraphrases of tacitus are the most curious case in literature of the expansion of a style of sombre poetic concentration into the style of exuberant rhetoric both grimm and a russian princess of the blood urged him even to translate the whole of tacituss works but it is certain that nobody in the world had ever less of tacitean quality still the history is alive i do not compose diderot said in the dedication i am no author i read or i converse i ask questions and i give answers the writer throws himself into the historic situation with the vivid freshness of a contemporary and if the criticism is sophistical at least the picture is admirably dramatic senecas position as the minister of nero seemed exactly one of those cases which always excited diderots deepest interesta case we mean in which the general rules of morality condemn but common sense acquits      182 the first edition 1778 was entitled essai sur la vie de     sénèque le philosophe sur ses écrits et sur le règne de claude et     de néron in the second edition 1782 this was changed into essai     sur les règnes de claude et de néron et sur la vie et les écrits de     sénèque  diderot as we have already pointed out183 was always very near to the position that there is no such thing as an absolute rule of right and wrong defining classes of acts unconditionally but each act must be judged on its merits with reference to all the circumstances of the given case senecas career tests this way of looking at things very severely his connivance with the minor sensualities of neros youth as a means of restraining him from downright crime and of keeping a measure of order in the government will perhaps be pardoned by most of those who realise the awful perils of the empire as diderot says nobody blames fénelon or bossuet for remaining at the court of lewis xiv in its days of license but connivance with a kings amours however degrading it may be from a certain point of view is a very different thing from acquiescence in a kings murder of his mother even here diderots impetuosity carries him in two or three bounds over every obstacle the various courses open to the minister after the murder of agrippina are discussed and dismissed what after nero had slain his mother was there nothing left to be done by a firm just and enlightened man with an immense burden of affairs on his back and capable by his courage and benevolence of bearing succour repairing misfortunes hindering depredations removing the incompetent and giving power to men of virtue knowledge and ability if he had only saved the honour of a single good woman or the life or fortune of a single good citizen if he could bring a day of tranquillity to the provinces or cross for a week the designs of the miscreants by whom the emperor was surrounded then seneca would have been blamed and would have deserved blame if he had either retired from court or put an end to his life184 this is all true enough and if seneca had been only a statesman the world would probably have applauded him for clinging to the helm at all cost unhappily he was not only a statesman but a moralist the two characters are always hard to reconcile as perhaps any parliamentary candidate might tell us the contrast between lofty writing and slippery policy has been too violent for senecas good fame as it was for francis bacons it is ever at his own proper risk and peril that a man dares to present high ideals to the world      183 above vol ii chap i      184 iii 110 111  one of the strangest of the many strange digressions in which the essay on claudius and nero abounds brings us within the glare of the great literary quarrel of the century soon after rousseau settled in paris for the last time on his return from england and the subsequent vagabondage it was known that he had written the confessions dealing at least as freely with the lives of others as with his own he had even in 1770 and 1771 given readings of certain passages from them until madame depinay and perhaps also the maréchale de luxemburg prevailed on the authorities to interfere no one was angrier than diderot and in the first edition of the essay published in the year of rousseaus death 1778 he incongruously placed in the midst of his disquisitions on the philosopher of the first century a long and acrimonious note upon the perversities of the reactionary philosopher of the eighteenth he was believed by those who talked to him to be in dread of the appearance of the confessions and we may accept this readily enough without assuming that diderot was conscious of hidden enormities which he was afraid of seeing publicly uncovered rousseau as diderot well knew was so wayward so strangely oblique both in vision and judgment that innocence was no security against malice and misrepresentation  rousseaus name has never lacked fanatical partisans down to our own day and diderot was attacked by some of the earliest of them for his note of disparagement the first part of the confessionsall that diderot ever sawappeared in 1782 and in the same year diderot published a second edition of the essay on claudius and nero so augmented by replies inserted in season and out of season to the diatribes of the party of rousseau that as it now stands the reader may well doubt whether the substance and foundation of the book is an apology for seneca or a vindication of denis diderot as grimm said we have to make up our minds to see the author suddenly pass from the palace of the cæsars to the garret of mm royou grosier and company from paris to rome and from rome back again to paris from the reign of claudius to the reign of lewis xv from the college of the sorbonne to the college of the augurs to turn now to the masters of the world and now to the yelping curs of literature to see him in his dramatic enthusiasm making the one speak and the others answer apostrophising himself and apostrophising his readers and leaving them often enough in perplexity as to the personage who is speaking and the personage whom he addresses185 we may agree with grimm that this gives an air of originality to the performance but such originality is of a kind to displease the serious student without really attracting the few readers who have a taste for rebelling against the pedantries of literary form we become confused by the long strain of uncertainty whether we are reading about the roman emperor or the french king about seneca burrhus and thrasea or turgot malesherbes and necker      185 grimm corr lit xi 77  diderots candour simplicity happy bonhommie and sincerity in real interests raised him habitually above the pettiness the bustling malice the vain selfconsciousness the personalities that infest all literary and social cliques it is surprising at first that diderot who had all his life borne the sting of the gnats of grub street with decent composure should have been so moved by rousseau or by meaner assailants whom rousseau himself would have rudely disclaimed the explanation seems to lie in this fact of human character that a man of diderots temperament while entirely heedless of criticism directed against his opinions or his public position is specially sensitive to innuendoes against his private benevolence and loyalty an insult to the force of his understanding was indifferent to him but an affront to ones belle âme is beyond pardon it was hard that a man who had prodigally thrown away the forces of his life for others should be charged with malignity of heart and an incapacity for friendship this was the harder because it was the moral fashion of that day to place friendliness amiability the desire to please and to serve at the very head of all the virtues the whole correspondence of the time is penetrated to an incomparable degree by a caressing spirit it is sometimes too elaborate and farfetched in expression but it marks a vivid sociability and even a true humanity that softens and harmonises the sharpness of mens egotism  again though diderot himself is not ungenerously handled in the confessions there are passages about madame depinay and madame dhoudetot which not only stamp rousseau with ingratitude towards two women who had treated him kindly but which were calculated to make practical mischief among people still living all this was atrocious in itself and the atrocity seemed more black to diderot than to others because he had for some years known madame depinay as a friendly creature and above all because grimm was her lover perhaps we may add among the reasons that stirred him to pen these diatribes a consciousness of the harm that rousseaus sentimentalism had done to sound and positive thinking but this we may be sure would be infinitely less potent than the motives that sprang from diderots own sentimentalism the quarrel for all save a few foolish partisans is now dead and we may leave the dust once more to settle thick upon it diderots own way of reading history is not unworthy of imitation and it is capable of application in spirit to private conduct no less than to the history of great public events does the narrative present me with some fact that dishonours humanity then i examine it with the most rigorous severity whatever sagacity i may be able to command i employ in detecting contradictions that throw suspicion on the story it is not so when an action is beautiful lofty noble then i never think of arguing against the pleasure that i feel in sharing the name of man with one who has done such an action i will say more it is to my heart and perhaps too it is only conformable to justice to hazard an opinion that tends to whiten an illustrious personage in the face of authorities that seem to contradict the tenour of his life of his doctrine and of his general repute186      186 oeuv iii 57  the elaborate outbreak against rousseau is perhaps diderots only breach of what ought thus to be a rule for all magnanimous men diderot or his shade paid the penalty la harpe retaliated for some slight wound to pitiful literary vanity by a lecture on seneca in which he raked up all the old accusations against senecas champion la harpe for various reasons into which we need not now more particularly enter got the ear of the european public in the years of reaction after he had himself deserted his old philosophic friends and gone over to the conservative camp he found the world eager to listen to all that could be said against men who were believed to have corrupted their age and his bitter misrepresentations not seldom invigorated by lies were the origin of much of the vulgar prejudice that has only begun to melt away in our own generation  rousseau died in 1778 the more versatile literary genius of the century had died a couple of months earlier in the same year it was not until the occasion of voltaires triumphant visit to paris after an absence of sevenandtwenty years that he and diderot at length met their correspondence had been less constant and less cordial than was common where voltaire was concerned but though their sympathy was imperfect there was no lack of mutual goodwill and admiration the poet is said to have done his best to push diderot into the academy but the king was incurably hostile and diderot was not anxious for an empty distinction he had none of that vanity nor eagerness for recognitionpardonable enough for that matterwhich such distinctions gratify and he perhaps agreed with voltaire himself who said of academies and parliaments that when men come together their ears instantly become elongated after diderots return from russia voltaire wrote to him i am eightythree years of age and i repeat that i am inconsolable at the thought of dying without ever having seen you i have tried to collect around me as many of your children as possible but i am a long way from having the whole family we are not so far apart at bottom and it only needs a conversation to bring us to an understanding187      187 dec 8 1776  of such conversations we have almost nothing to tell no sacred bard has commemorated the salutation of the heroes we only know that at the end of their first interview diderots facility of discourse had been so copious that after he had taken his leave voltaire said the man is clever assuredly but he lacks one talent and an essential talentthat of dialogue diderots remark about voltaire was more picturesque he is like one of those old haunted castles which are falling into ruins in every part but you easily perceive that it is inhabited by some ancient sorcerer188 they had a dispute as to the merits of shakespeare and diderot displeased the patriarch by repeating the expression that we have already quoted vol i p 330 about shakespeare being like the statue of st christopher at notre dame unshapely and rude but such a giant that ordinary men could pass between his legs without touching him189      188 métras corresp secrète vi 292      189 see diderots oeuv xix 465 note  there was one man who might have told us a thousand interesting things both about diderots conversations with voltaire and his relations with other men this man was naigeon to whom diderot gave most of his papers and who always professed down to his death in 1814 to be diderots closest adherent and most authoritative expounder diderot was as he always knew and said less an author than a talker not a talker like johnson but like coleridge if naigeon could only have contented himself with playing reporter and could have been blessed by nature with the rare art of boswell we wanted as carlyle says to see and know how it stood with the bodily man the working and warfaring denis diderot how he looked and lived what he did what he said instead of which nothing but a dull sulky snuffling droning interminable lecture on atheistic philosophy delivered with the vehemence of some pulpitdrumming gowkthrapple or precious mr jabesh rentowel naigeon belonged to the too numerous class of men and women overabundantly endowed with unwise intellect he was acute diligent and tenacious fond of books especially when they had handsome margins and fine bindings above all things he was the most fanatical atheist and the most indefatigable propagandist and eager proselytiser which that form of religion can boast we do not know the date of his first acquaintance with diderot190 we only know that at the end of diderots days he had no busier or more fervent disciple than naigeon to us at all events whatever it may have been to diderot the acquaintance and discipleship have proved good for very little      190 the biographie universelle after giving 1738 as the date of     naigeons birth absurdly attributes to him the article on Âme in     the encyclopædia which was published in 1752 when naigeon was     fourteen years old  our last authentic glimpse of diderot is from the pen of a humane and enlightened englishman whose memory must be held in perpetual honour among us samuel romilly then a young man of fourandtwenty visited paris in 1781 he made the acquaintance of the namesake who had written the articles on watchmaking in the encyclopædia and whose son had written the more famous articles on toleration and virtue by this honest man romilly was introduced to dalembert and diderot the former was in weak health and said very little diderot on the contrary was all warmth and eagerness and talked to his visitor with as little reserve as if he had been long and intimately acquainted with him he spoke on politics religion and philosophy he praised the english for having led the way to sound philosophy but the adventurous genius of the french he said had pushed them on before their guides you others he continued mix up theology with your philosophy that is to spoil everything it is to mix up lies with truth il faut sabrer la théologiewe must put theology to the sword he was ostentatious romilly says of a total disbelief in the existence of a god he quoted plato the author of all the good theology that ever existed in the world as saying that there is a vast curtain drawn over the heavens and that men must content themselves with what passes beneath that curtain without ever attempting to raise it and in order to complete my conversion from my unhappy errors he read me all through a little work of his ownof which we shall presently speak on politics he talked very eagerly and inveighed with great warmth against the tyranny of the french government he told me that he had long meditated a work upon the death of charles the first that he had studied the trial of that prince and that his intention was to have tried him over again and to have sent him to the scaffold if he had found him guilty but that he had at last relinquished the design in england he would have executed it but he had not the courage to do so in france dalembert as i have observed was more cautious he contented himself with observing what an effect philosophy had in his own time produced on the minds of the people the birth of the dauphin known afterwards as lewis xvii the unhappy prisoner of the temple afforded him an example he was old enough he said to remember when such an event had made the whole nation drunk with joy 1729 but now they regarded with great indifference the birth of another master191      191 memoirs of sir samuel romilly i 63 179 etc  it was thus clear to the two veterans of the encyclopædia that the change for which they had worked was at hand the press literally teemed with pamphlets treatises poems histories all shouting from the housetops open destruction to beliefs which fifty years before were actively protected against so much as a whisper in the closet every form of literary art was seized and turned into an instrument in the remorseless attack on linfâme the conservative or religious opposition showed a weakness that is hardly paralleled in the long history of the mighty controversy ability adroitness vigour and character were for once all on one side palissot was perhaps after all the best of the writers on the conservative side192 with all his faults he had the literary sense some of what he said was true and some of the thirdrate people whom he assailed deserved the assault his criticism on diderots drama the natural son was not a whit more severe than that bad play demanded193 not seldom in the course of this work we have wished with palissot that the excellent diderot were less addicted to prophetic and apocalyptical turns of speech that there were less of chaos round his points of burning and shining light and that he had less title to the hostile name of the lycophron of philosophy194 but the comedy of the philosophers was a scandalous misrepresentation introducing diderot personally on the stage and putting into his mouth a mixture of folly and knavery that was as foreign to diderot as to any one else in the world in 1782 the satirist again attacked his enemy now grown old and weary in le satyrique valère a spiteful and hypocritical poetaster is intended partially at least for diderot a colporteur not illnamed as m pamphlet comes to urge payment of his bill      192 see above vol i p 362      193 petites lettres sur de grands philosophes ii      194 oeuv de palissot i 445 iv 244

footnote to the effect that people who might be surprised that a serious man like valère should have written works of this licentious and frivolous kind will conceive that in a moment of leisure a philosopher should write les bijoux indiscrèts for instance and the next day follow it by a treatise on morality195as diderot unhappily had done      195 le satyrique iii p 84 note  palissot was not so good as molière boileau and pope as he was fatuous enough to suppose but he was certainly better than the scribbler who asked      mais enfin de quoi se glorifie     ce siècle de mollesse et de

monument of scandal and the work of darkness the archbishop of vienne forbade the faithful of his diocese to subscribe to it under pain of mortal sin in the general assembly of the clergy which opened in the summer of 1780 the bishops in memorials to the king deplored the homage paid to the famous writer who was less known for the beauty of his genius and the superiority of his talents than for the persevering and implacable war which for sixty years he had waged against the lord and his christ they cursed in solemn phrase the revolting blasphemies of raynals history of the indies and declared that the publication of a new edition of that celebrated book with the name and the portrait of its author showed that the most elementary notions of shame and decency lay in profound sleep  in the midst of those prolonged cries of distress we have no word of recognition that the only remedy for a moral disease is a moral remedy the single resource that occurred to their debilitated souls was the familiar armoury of suppression menace violence and tyranny sire they cried it is time to put a term to this deplorable lethargy they reminded the king of the declaration of 1757 which inflicted on all persons who printed or circulated writings hostile to religion the punishment of death but their paternal bowels shuddered at the sight of these severe enactments all that they sought was plenty of rigorous imprisonment ruinous fining and diligent espionage197 if the reader is revolted by the rashness of diderots expectation of the speedy decay of the belief in a god198 he may well be equally revolted by the obstinate infatuation of the men who expected to preserve the belief in a god by the spies of the department of police much had no doubt been done for the church in past times by cruelty and oppression but the folly of the french bishops after the reign of voltaire and the apostolate of the encyclopædia lay exactly in their blindness to the fact that the old methods were henceforth impossible in france and impossible for ever how can we wonder at the hatred and contempt felt by men of the social intelligence of diderot and dalembert for this desperate union of impotence and malignity      197 see for abundant matter of the same kind m rocquains     lesprit révolutionnaire avant la révolution bk x pp 382 390     etc      198 montesquieu more sensibly had

sternness on a society hurrying incorrigibly with joyful speed along the path of destruction had passed away two years before 1781 voltaire the great intellectual director of europe for fifty years and rousseau the great emotional reactionist had both as we know died in 1778 the little companies in which from adrienne lecouvreur the marquise de lambert and madame de tencin in the first half of the century groups of intelligent men and women had succeeded in founding informal schools of disinterested opinion and in finally removing the centre of criticism and intellectual activity from versailles to paris had now nearly all come to an end madame du deffand died in 1780 madame geoffrin in 1779 and in 1776 mdlle lespinasse whose letters will long survive her as giving a burning literary note to the vagueness of suffering and pain of soul one of diderots favourite companions in older days galiani the antiquary the scholar the politician the incomparable mimic the shrewdest

unpromising title a piece of literature which for its verve rapidity wit dialectical subtlety and real strength of thought has hardly been surpassed by masterpieces of a wider recognition voltaire vowed that plato and molière must have combined to produce a book that was as amusing as the best of romances and as instructive as the best of serious books diderot who had a hand in retouching the dialogues for the press200 went so far as to pronounce them worthy of a place along with the provincial letters of pascal and declared that like those immortal pieces galianis dialogues would remain as a model of perfection in their own kind long after both the subject and the personages concerned had lost their interest201 the prophecy has not come quite true for the world is busy and heedless and much the prey of accident and capricious tradition in the books that it reads yet even now although galiani was probably wrong on the special issue between himself and the economists it would be well if people would turn to his demolition as wise as witty of the doctrine of absolute truths in political economy galianis constant correspondent was madame depinay the kindly benefactress of rousseau a quarter of a century earlier the friend of diderot the more than friend of grimm in 1783 she died and either in that year or the next mademoiselle voland who had filled so great a space in the life of diderot the ghosts and memories of his friends became the majority and he consoled himself that he should not long survive      199 grimm died in 1807 holbach in 1789 catherine in 1796 and     frederick in 1786      200 see oeuv xix 317 326      201 oeuv vi 442 where diderot gives a sketch of this     interesting man  the days of intellectual excitement and philanthropic hope seemed at their very height but in fact they were over nobody said talleyrand who has not lived before 1789 knows how sweet life can be the old world had its last laugh over the marriage of figaro april 1784 but in the laugh of figaro there is a strange ring under all its gaiety its liveliness its admirable naïveté was something sombre it was pregnant with menace its fooling was the ironical enforcement of raynals trenchant declaration that the law is nothing if it be not a sword gliding indistinctly over the heads of all and striking down whatever rises above the horizontal plane along which it moves  diderot himself is commonly accused of having fomented an atrocious spirit by the horrible couplet      et ses mains ourdiraient les entrailles du prêtre     au défaut dun cordon pour étrangler les rois202      202 is it not possible that the virtuous and moderate proposal to     strangle the last jesuit in the bowels of the last jansenist might     do something towards reconciling mattersvoltaire to helvétius     may 11 1761  that the verses could have actually excited the spirit of the terrorists is impossible for they were not given to the world until 1795 and in the second place so far as diderots intention is concerned any one who reads the piece from which the lines are taken will perceive that the whole performance is in a vein of playful phantasy and that the particular verses are placed dramatically in the mouth of a proclaimed eleutheromane or maniac for liberty203 diderot was not likely to foresee that what he designed for an illustration of the frenzy of the pindaric dithyramb would so soon be mistaken for a short formula of practical politics204      203 les eleutheromanes ou les furieux de la liberté oeuv     ix 16      204 it is a curious illustration of the carelessness with which     the socalled negative school have been treated that so     conscientious a writer as m henri martin hist de france xvi     146 should have taxed diderot among other sinister maxims with     this that the public punishment of a king changes the spirit of a     nation for ever now the words occur in a collection of     observations on government which diderot wrote on the margin of his     copy of tacitus and which are entitled principes de politique des     souverains 1775 some of the most pungent maxims are obviously     intended for irony on the military and machiavellian policy of     frederick the great while others on the policy of the roman     emperors are shrewd and sagacious the maxim from which m martin     quotes is the 147th and in it the sombre words of his quotation     follow thislet the people never see royal blood flow for any     cause whatever the public punishment of a king etc see     oeuv ii 486  in 1780 his townsmen of langres paid him a compliment which showed that the sage was not without honour in his own country they besought him to sit for his portrait to be placed among the worthies in the town hall diderot replied by sending them houdons bronze bust which was received with all distinction and honour naigeon hints that in the last years of his life diderot paid more attention to money than he had ever done before205 not that he became a miser but because like many other persons he had not found out until the close of a lifes experience that care of money really means care of the instrument that procures some of the best ends in life for a moment we may regret that he was too much occupied in attending to his affairs to take the unwise naigeons wise counsel that he should devote himself to a careful revision of all that he had written perhaps diderots instinct was right among the distractions of old age he had turned back to his letter on the blind and read it over again without partiality he found as was natural some defects in a piece that was written threeandthirty years before but he abstained from attempting to remove them for fear that the page of the young man should be made the worse by the retouching of the old man there comes a time he reflects when taste gives counsels whose justice you recognise but which you have no longer strength to follow it is the pusillanimity that springs from consciousness of weakness or else it is the idleness that is one of the results of weakness and pusillanimity which disgusts me with a task that would be more likely to hurt than to improve my work      solve senescentem mature sanus equum ne     peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat  and so he contented himself with some rough notes of phenomena that were corroborative of the speculation of his youth206      205 mém sur la vie et les ouvrages de diderot p 412      206 grimm corr lit xi 120  in the early spring of 1784 diderot had an attack which he knew to be the presage of the end dropsy set in and he lingered until the summer the priest of saint sulpice the centre of the philosophic quarter came to visit him two or three times a week hoping to achieve at least the semblance of a conversion diderot did not encourage conversation on theology but when pressed he did not refuse it one day when they found as two men of sense will always find that they had ample common ground in matters of morality and good works the priest ventured to hint that an exposition of such excellent maxims accompanied by a slight retractation of diderots previous works would have a good effect on the world i daresay it would monsieur le curé but confess that i should be acting an impudent lie and no word of retractation was ever made as the end came suddenly the priest escaped from the necessity of denying the funeral rites of the church  for thirty years diderot had been steadfast to his quarters on an upper floor in the rue taranne and even now when the physicians told him that to climb such length of staircase was death to him he still could not be induced to stir it would have been easier his daughter says to effect a removal from versailles itself grimm at length asked the empress of russia to provide a house for her librarian and when the request was conceded diderot who could never be ungracious allowed himself to be taken from his garret to palatial rooms in the rue de richelieu he enjoyed them less than a fortnight though visibly growing weaker every day he did all that he could to cheer the people around him and amused himself and them by arranging his pictures and his books in the evening to the last he found strength to converse on science and philosophy to the friends who were eager as ever for the last gleanings of his prolific intellect in the last conversation that his daughter heard him carry on his last words were the pregnant aphorism that the first step towards philosophy is incredulity  on the evening of the 30th of july 1784 he sat down to table and at the end of the meal took an apricot his wife with kindly solicitude remonstrated mais quel diable de mal veuxtu que cela me fasse he said and ate the apricot then he rested his elbow on the table trifling with some sweetmeats his wife asked him a question on receiving no answer she looked up and saw that he was dead he had died as the greek poet says that men died in the golden agegreek thnêskon d hôs hypnô dedmêmenoi they passed away as if mastered by sleep it had always been his opinion that an examination of the organs after death is a useful practice and his wish that the operation should take place in his own case was respected nothing interesting or remarkable was revealed and his remains were laid in the vaults of the church of saint roche  so the curtain fell upon this strange tragicomedy of a man of letters there is no better epilogue than words of his ownwe fix our gaze on the ruins of a triumphal arch of a

very bronze     chapter ix  conclusion   a few more pages must be given to one or two of diderots writings which have not hitherto been mentioned an exhaustive survey of his works is out of the question nor would any one be repaid for the labour of criticism a mere list of the topics that he handled would fill a long chapter a redaction of a long treatise on harmony a vast sheaf of notes on the elements of physiology a collection of miscellanea on the drama a still more copious collection of miscellanea on a hundred points in literature and art a fragment on the exercise of young russians an elaborate plan of studies for a proposed russian universityno less panurgic and less encyclopædic a critic than diderot himself could undertake to sweep with ever so light a wing over this vast area everybody can find something to say about the collection of tales in which diderot thought that he was satirising the manners of his time after the fashion of rabelais montaigne la mothelevayer and swift but not everybody is competent to deal for instance with the five memoirs on different subjects in mathematics 1748 with which diderot hoped to efface the scandal of his previous performance   i  decidedly the most important of the pieces of which we have not yet spoken must be counted the thoughts on the interpretation of nature 1754 his study of bacon and the composition of the introductory prospectus of the encyclopædia had naturally filled diderots mind with ideas about the universe as a whole the great problem of mans knowledge of this universethe limits the instruments the meaning of such knowledge came before him with a force that he could not evade maupertuis had in 1751 under the assumed name of baumann an imaginary doctor of erlangen published a dissertation on the universal system of nature in which he seems to have maintained that the mechanism of the universe is one and the same throughout modifying itself or being modified by some vital element within in an infinity of diverse ways207 leibnitzs famous idea of making nature invariably work with the minimum of action was seized by maupertuis expressed as the law of thrift and made the startingpoint of speculations that led directly to holbach and the system of nature208 the loi depargne evidently tended to make unity of all the forces of the universe the keynote or the goal of philosophical inquiry at this time of his life diderot resisted maupertuiss theory of the unity of vital force in the universe or perhaps we should rather say that he saw how open it was to criticism his resistance has none of his usual air of vehement conviction however that may be the theory excited his interest and fitted in with the train of meditation which his thoughts about the encyclopædia had already set in motion and of which the pensées philosophiques of 1746 were the cruder prelude      207 as to the precise drift of maupertuiss theme see lange     gesch d materialismus i 413 n 37 also rosenkranz i 134      208 in 1765 grimm describes the principle of leibnitz and     maupertuis as gaining on us on every sidecorr lit iv 186  the thoughts on the interpretation of nature are in form as in title imitated from those famous aphorismi de interpretatione naturæ et regni hominis which are more shortly known to all men as bacons novum organum209 the connection between the aphorisms is very loosely held diderot began by premising that he would let his thoughts follow one another under his pen in the order in which the subjects came up in his mind and he kept his word their general scope so far as it is capable of condensed expression may be described as a reconciliation between the two great classes into which diderot found thinkers upon nature to be divided those who have many instruments and few ideas and those who have few instruments and many ideasin other words between men of science without philosophy and philosophers without knowledge of experimental science      209 palissot in the philosophers concocted some very strained     satire on the too pompous opening of the interpretation of nature     act i sc 2  in the region of science itself again diderot foresees as great a change as in the relations between science and philosophy we touch the moment of a great revolution in the sciences from the strong inclination of mens minds towards morals literature the history of nature and experimental physics i would almost venture to assert that before the next hundred years are over there will not be three great geometers to be counted in europe this science will stop short where the bernouillis the eulers the maupertuis the clairauts the fontaines the dalemberts the lagranges have left it they will have fixed the pillars of hercules people will go no further those who have read comtes angry denunciations of the perversions of geometry by means of algebra and of the waste of intellectual force in modern analysis210 will at least understand how such a view as diderots was possible and no one will be likely to deny that whether or not the pillars of the geometrical hercules were finally set a hundred years ago the great discoveries of the hundred years since diderot have been as he predicted in the higher sciences the great misfortune of france was that the supremacy of geometry coincided with the opening of the great era of political discussion the definitions of montesquieus famous book which opened the political movement in literature have been shown to be less those of a jurisconsult than of a geometer211 social truths with all their profound complexity were handled like propositions in euclid and logical deductions from arbitrary premises were treated as accurate representations of real circumstance the repulse of geometry to its proper rank came too late      210 comtes system of positive polity i 380 etc english     translation 1875      211 by f sclopis quoted in m vians hist de montesquieu p     51  comte always liberally recognised diderots genius and any reader of comtes views on the necessities of subjective synthesis will discern the germ of that doctrine in the following remarkable section       when we compare the infinite multitude of the phenomena of nature      with the limits of our understandings and the weakness of our      organs can we ever expect anything else from the slowness of our      work from the long and frequent interruptions and from the rarity      of creative genius than a few broken and separated pieces of the      great chain that binds all things together experimental philosophy      might work for centuries of centuries and the materials that it      had heaped up finally reaching in their number beyond all      combination would still be far removed from an exact enumeration      how many volumes would it not need to contain the mere terms by      which we should designate the distinct collections of phenomena if      the phenomena were known when will the philosophic language be      complete if it were complete who among men would be able to know      it if the eternal to manifest his power still more plainly than      by the marvels of nature had deigned to develop the universal      mechanism on pages traced by his own hand do you suppose that this      great book would be more comprehensible to us than the universe      itself how many pages of it all would have been intelligible to      the philosopher who with all the force of head that had been      conferred upon him was not sure of having grasped all the      conclusions by which an old geometer determined the relation of the      sphere to the cylinder we should have in such pages a fairly good      measure of the reach of mens minds and a still more pungent      satire on our vanity we should say fermat went to such a page      archimedes went a few pages further       what then is our end the execution of a work that can never be      achieved and which would be far beyond human intelligence if it      were achieved are we not more insensate than the first inhabitants      of the plain of shinar we know the immeasurable distance between      the earth and the heavens and still we insist on rearing our      tower       but can we presume that there will not come a time when our pride      will abandon the work in discouragement what appearance is there      that narrowly lodged and ill at its ease here below our pride      should obstinately persist in constructing an uninhabitable palace      beyond the earths atmosphere even if it should so insist would      it not be arrested by the confusion of tongues which is already      only too perceptible and too inconvenient in natural history      besides it is utility that circumscribes all it will be utility      that in a few centuries will set bounds to experimental physics as      it is on the eve of setting bounds to geometry i grant centuries      to this study because the sphere of its utility is infinitely more      extensive than that of any abstract science and it is without      contradiction the base of our real knowledge212      212 oeuv ii 12 13 § 6 see the same idea in the     encyclopædia above vol i pp 225227  we cannot wonder that when comte drew up his list of the hundred and fifty volumes that should form the good positivists library in the nineteenth century he should have placed diderots interpretation of nature on one side of descartes discourse on method with bacons novum organum on the other  the same spirit finds even stronger and more distinct expression in a later aphorismsince the reason cannot understand everything imagination foresee everything sense observe everything nor memory retain everything since great men are born at such remote intervals and the progress of science is so interrupted by revolution that whole ages of study are passed in recovering the knowledge of the centuries that are goneto observe everything in nature without distinction is to fail in duty to the human race men who are beyond the common run in their talents ought to respect themselves and posterity in the employment of their time what would posterity think of us if we had nothing to transmit to it save a complete insectology an immense history of microscopic animals noto the great geniuses great objects little objects to the little geniuses § 54  diderot while thus warning inquirers against danger on one side was alive to the advantages of stubborn and unlimited experiment on the other when you have formed in your mind he says one of those systems which require to be verified by experience you ought neither to cling to it obstinately nor abandon it lightly people sometimes think their conjectures false when they have not taken the proper measures to find them true obstinacy even has fewer drawbacks than the opposite excess by multiplying experiments if you do not find what you want it may happen that you will come on something better never is time employed in interrogating nature entirely lost § 42 the reader will not fail to observe that this maxim is limited by the condition of verifiableness of any system that could not be verified by experience diderot would have disdained to speak in connection with the interpretation of nature  this of course did not prevent him from hypothesis and prophecy which he himself had not the means of justifying for example he said that just as in mathematics by examining all properties of a curve we find that they are one and the same property presented under different faces so in nature when experimental physics are more advanced people will recognise that all the phenomena whether of weight or elasticity or magnetism or electricity are only different sides of the same affection § 44 but he was content to leave it to posterity and to build no fabric on unproved propositions  in the same scientific spirit he penetrated the hollowness of every system dealing with final causes       the physicist whose profession is to instruct and not to edify      will abandon the why and will busy himself only with the      how how many absurd ideas false suppositions chimerical      notions in those hymns which some rash defenders of final causes      have dared to compose in honour of the creator instead of sharing      the transports of admiration of the prophet and crying out at the      sight of the unnumbered stars that light up the midnight sky the      heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his      handiwork they have given themselves up to the superstition of      their conjectures instead of adoring the allpowerful in the      creation of nature they have prostrated themselves before the      phantoms of their imagination if any one doubts the justice of my      reproach i invite him to compare galens treatise on the use of      parts of the human body with the physiology of boerhaave and the      physiology of boerhaave with that of haller i invite posterity to      compare the systematic or passing views of haller with what will be      the physiology of future times man praises the eternal for his own      poor views and the eternal who hears from the elevation of his      throne and who knows his own design accepts the silly praise and      smiles at mans vanity § 56  the world has advanced rapidly along this path since diderots day and has opened out many new and unsuspected meanings by the way perhaps the advance has been less satisfactory in working out in a scientific way the philosophy that is implied in the following adaptation of the leibnitzian and maupertuisian suggestion of the law of economy in natural forcesastonishment often comes from our supposing several marvels where in truth there is only one from our imagining in nature as many particular acts as we can count phenomena whilst nature has perhaps in reality never produced more than one single act it seem even that if nature had been under the necessity of producing several acts the different results of such acts would be isolated that there would be collections of phenomena independent of one another and that the general chain of which philosophy assumes the continuity would break in many places the absolute independence of a single fact is incompatible with the idea of an all and without the idea of a whole there can be no philosophy § 11  at length diderot concludes by a series of questions which he thinks that philosophers may perhaps count worthy of discussion what is the difference for example between living matter and dead does the energy of a living molecule vary by itself or according to the quantity the quality the forms of the dead or living matter with which it is united we need not continue the enumeration because diderot himself suddenly brings them to an end with a truly admirable expression of his sense of how unworthy they are of the attention of serious men who are able to measure the difference between a wise and beneficent use of intelligence and a foolish and wasteful misuse of it when i turn my eyes he says to the works of men and see the cities that are built on every side all the elements yoked to our service languages fixed nations civilised harbours constructed lands and skies measuredthen the world seems to me very old when i find man uncertain as to the first principles of medicine and agriculture as to the properties of the commonest substances as to knowledge of the maladies that afflict him as to the pruning of trees as to the best form for the plough then it seems as if the earth had only been inhabited yesterday and if men were wise they would at last give themselves up to such inquiries as bear on their wellbeing and would not take the trouble to answer my futile questions for a thousand years at the very soonest or perhaps even considering the very scanty extent that they occupy in space and time they would never deign to answer them at all   ii  in 1769 diderot composed three dialogues of which he said that with a certain mathematical memoir they were the only writings of his own with which he was contented the first is a dialogue between himself and dalembert the second is dalemberts dream in which dalembert in his sleep continues the discussion while mdlle lespinasse who is watching by his bedside takes down the dreamers words in the third mdlle lespinasse and the famous physician bordeu conclude the matter213 it is impossible diderot said to mdlle voland to be more profound and more mad it is at once a supreme extravagance and the most deepreaching philosophy he congratulated himself on the cleverness of placing his ideas in the mouth of a man who dreams on the ground that we must often give to wisdom the air of madness in order to secure admittance mdlle lespinasse was not so complacent she made dalembert insist that the dialogue should be destroyed and diderot believed that he had burned the only existing copy as a matter of fact the manuscript was not published until 1830 when all the people concerned had long been reduced to dust there are five or six pages diderot said to mdlle voland which would make your sisters hair stand on end a man may be much less squeamish than mdlle volands sister and still pronounce the imaginative invention of dalemberts dream and the sequel to be as odious as anything since the freaks of filthy diogenes in his tub two remarks may be made on this strange production first diderot never intended the dialogues for the public eye he would have been as shocked as the archbishop of paris himself if he had supposed that they would become accessible to everybody who knows how to read second though they are in form the most ugly and disgusting piece in the literature of philosophy they testify in their own way to diderots sincerity of interest in his subject science is essentially unsparing and unblushing and dalemberts dream plunged exactly into those parts of physiology which are least fit to be handled in literature the attempt to give an air of polite comedy to functions and secretions must be pronounced detestable in spite of the dialectical acuteness and force with which diderot pressed his point      213 oeuv ii  it would be impossible in a book not exclusively designed for a public of professors to give a full account of these three dialogues it is indispensable to describe their drift because it is here that diderot figures definitely as a materialist diderot was in no sense the originator of the french materialism of the eighteenth century he was preceded by maupertuis by robinet and by la mettrie and we have already seen that when he composed the thoughts on the interpretation of nature 1754 he did not fully accept maupertuiss materialistic thesis lange has shown that at a very early period in the movement the most consistent materialism was ready and developed while such leaders of the movement as voltaire and diderot still leaned either on deism or on a mixture of deism and scepticism214 the philosophy of dalemberts dream is definite enough and far enough removed alike from deism and scepticism      214 gesch d materialismus i 309 310 etc  the thinking man is like a musical instrument suppose a clavecin to have sensibility and memory and then say whether it would not repeat of itself the airs that you have played on its keys we are instruments endowed with sensibility and memory our senses are so many keys pressed by the nature that surrounds them and they often press one another and this according to my judgment is all that passes in a clavecin organised as you and i are organised  there is only one substance in the world the marble of the statue makes the flesh of the man and conversely reduce a block of marble to impalpable powder mix this powder with humus or vegetable earth knead them well together water the

germ itself is only an inert fluid how does this mass pass to another organisation to life to sensibility by heat what will produce heat movement what will be the successive effects of movement first an oscillating point a thread that extends the flesh the beak and so forth  then follows the application of the same ideas to the reproduction of mana region whither it is not convenient to follow the physiological inquirer the result as to the formation of the organic substance in man is as unflinching as the materialism of büchner       but doctor cries mdlle lespinasse what becomes of vice and

fact that german books are written for a public of specialists allows dr rosenkranz to criticise these dialogues with a freedom equal to diderots own and his criticism is as full as usual of candour patience and weight an english writer must be content to pass on and his contentment may well be considerable for the subject is perhaps that on which above all others it is most difficult to say any wise word   iii  the plan of a university for the government of russia was the work of diderots last years but no copy of it was given to the public before 181314 when m guizot published extracts from an autograph manuscript confided to him by suard diderot with a characteristic respect for competence with which no egotism can ever interfere in minds of such strength and veracity as his began by urging the empress to consult ernesti of leipsic the famous editor of cicero and no less famous in his day 17071781 for the changes that he introduced into the system of teaching in the german universities of oxford and cambridge diderot spoke more kindly than they then deserved  the one strongly marked idea of the plan is what might have been expected from the editor of the encyclopædia namely the elevation of what the germans call real or technological instruction and the banishment of pure literature as a subject of study from the first to the last place in the course in the faculty of arts the earliest course begins with arithmetic algebra the calculation of probabilities and geometry next follow physics and mechanics then astronomy fourthly natural history and experimental physics in the fifth class chemistry and anatomy in the sixth logic and grammar in the seventh the language of the country and it was not until the eighth that greek and latin eloquence and poetry took their place among the objects or instruments of education parallel with this course the student was to follow the first principles of metaphysics of universal morality and of natural and revealed religion here too history and geography had a place in a third parallel perspective and drawing accompanied the science of the first and the philosophy and history of the second  in the thorny field of religious instruction diderot expresses no opinion of his own beyond saying that it is natural for the empresss subjects to conform to her way of thinking as her majesty thinks that the fear of pains to come has much influence on mens actions and is persuaded that the total of small daily advantages produced by belief outweighs the total of evils wrought by sectarianism and intolerance therefore students ought to be instructed in the mystery of the distinction of the two substances in the immortality of the soul and so forth216      216 oeuv iii 490  there is a story that one evening at st petersburg diderot was declaiming with stormy eloquence against the baseness of those who flatter kings for such he said there ought to be a deeper and a fiercer hell tell me diderot said the empress by and by what they say in paris about the death of my husband instead of telling her the plain truth that everybody said that peter had been murdered by her orders the philosopher poured out a stream of the smoothest things come now said catherine suddenly confess if you are not walking along the path that leads to your deep hell you are certainly coming very close to purgatory diderots elaborate concessions to her majestys political religion would it is to be feared have brought him still further in the same sulphureous track  as we have often had to bewail diderots diffuseness it is as well to remark that a long passage in the sketch of which we are speaking shows how close and concentrated he could be upon occasion the two pages in which he demolishes the incorrigible superstition about latin and greek217 contain a thoroughly exhaustive summary of all the arguments and the answers in the immense discussion about latin and greek that has taken place in the hundred years since diderots time it is tolerably safe to say that not a single point has been brought forward which diderot did not in these most pithy and conclusive pages attempt to deal with he winds up with the position that even for the man of letters the present system of teaching latin and greek is essentially sterile i am perfectly sure he says that voltaire who is not exactly a mediocrity as a man of letters knows extremely little greek and that he is not twentieth nor even hundredth among the latinists of the day218      217 ib iii 469471      218 oeuv iii 473  following this sketch is printed a letter to the countess of forbach on the education of children it is full of rich wisdom on its special subject nobody can read it without feeling that quality in diderot which made his friends love him and we see how when he was called to practical counsel he banished into their own sphere the explosive paradoxes with which he delighted to amuse his hours of speculative dreaming   iv  romilly has told us that diderot was bent on converting him from the error of his religious ways and with that intention read to him a conversation with the maréchale de219 it is believed to be an idealised version of a real conversation with madame de broglie and was first printed almost as soon as written 1777 in the correspondence in which métra in imitation of grimm informed a circle of foreign subscribers what was going on in paris the admirers of diderot profess to look on this conversation as one of the most precious pearls in his philosophic casket it turns upon the conditions of belief and unbelief represented by the two interlocutors respectively and is a terse and graphic summary of the rationalistic objections to the creed of the church the most conspicuous literary passage in it is a parable which has been attributed to rousseau but with which rousseau had really nothing to do beyond reproducing the spirit of its argument in the ever famous creed of the savoyard vicar      219 ib ii 505528       a young mexican tired of his work was sauntering one day on the      seashore he spied a plank with one end resting on the land and      the other dipping into the water he sat down on the plank and      there gazing over the vast space that lay spread out before him he      said to himself it is certain that my old grandmother is talking      nonsense with her history of i know not what inhabitants who at      i know not what time landed here from i know not where from some      country far beyond our seas it is against common sense do i not      see the ocean touch the line of the sky and can i believe against      the evidence of my senses an old fable of which nobody knows the      date which everybody arranges according to his fancy and which is      only a tissue of absurdities about which people are ready to tear      out one anothers eyes as he was reasoning in this way the      waters rocked him gently on his plank and he fell asleep as he      slept the wind rose the waves carried away the plank on which he      was stretched out and behold our youthful reasoner embarked on a      voyage       la maréchalealas that is the image of all of us we are each      on our plank the wind blows and the flood carries us away       che was already far from the mainland when he awoke no one      was ever so surprised as our young mexican to find himself out on      the open sea and he was mightily surprised too when having lost      from sight the shore on which he had been idly walking only an      instant before he saw the sea touching the line of the sky on      every side then he began to suspect that he might have been      mistaken and that if the wind remained in the same quarter      perhaps he would be borne to that very shore and among those      dwellers on it about whom his grandmother had so often told him       la maréchaleand of his anxiety you say nothing       che had none he said to himself what does it matter      provided that i find land i have reasoned like a giddypate      granted but i have been sincere with myself and that is all that      can be required of me if it is no virtue to have understanding at      any rate it is no crime to be without it meanwhile the wind      continued the man and the plank floated on and the unknown shore      came into sight he touched it and behold him again on land       la maréchaleah we shall all of us see one another there one      of these days       ci hope so madam wherever it may be i shall always be very      proud to pay you my homage hardly had he quitted his plank and      put his foot on the sand when he perceived a venerable old man      standing by his side he asked him where he was and to whom he had      the honour of speaking i am the sovereign of the country      replied the old man you have denied my existenceyes it is      trueand that of my empireit is truei forgive you      because i am he who sees the bottom of all hearts and i have read      at the bottom of yours that you are of good faith but the rest of      your thoughts and your actions are not equally innocent then the      old man who held him by the ear recalled to him all the errors      of his life and as each was mentioned the young mexican bowed      himself upon the ground beat his breast and besought forgiveness   v  of falconet220 we have already spoken as a sculptor of genius and as one of diderots most intimate friends writing to sophie voland nov 21 1765 diderot informs her that some pleasantries of falconets have induced him to undertake very seriously the defence of the sentiment of immortality and respect for posterity221 this apology was carried on in an energetic correspondence which lasted from the end of 1765 to 1767 falconets letters were burned by his granddaughter for reasons unknown and we have only such passages from them as are more specially referred to by diderot himself falconet flattered himself that he had the best of the argument and was eager that they should be published but diderot was sluggish or busy the correspondence was imparted to catherine of russia who took a lively interest in it and to some others but it was not given to the publicand then only partiallyuntil 1830      220 above vol ii p 104      221 xix 200  diderots position in these twelve letters may be described in general terms as being that the sentiment of immortality and respect for posterity move the heart and elevate the soul they are two germs of great things two promises as solid as any other and two delights as real as most of the delights of life but more noble more profitable and more virtuous what diderot means by immortality is not the religious dogma that the individual personality will be objectively preserved and prolonged in some other mode of existence on the contrary it was his disbelief in this dogma of the churches that gave a certain keenness to his pleading for that other kind of immortality which prolongs our personality only in the grateful and admiring memories of other people who come after us he intended by the sentiment of immortality the desire to surround ones name with lustre among posterity to be the admiration and the talk of centuries to come to obtain after death the same honours as we pay to those who have gone before us to furnish a fine line to the historian to inscribe ones own name by the side of those which we never pronounce without shedding a tear heaving a sigh or being touched by regret to secure for ourselves the blessings that we have such a thrill in bestowing on sully henry iv and all the other benefactors of the human race222 the sphere that surrounds us and in which the world admires us the time in which we exist and listen to praise the number of those who directly address to us the eulogy that we have deserved of themall this is too small for the capacity of our ambitious souls by the side of those whom we see prostrated before us we place those who are not yet in the world it is only this uncounted throng of adorers that can satisfy a mind whose impulses are ever towards the infinite at night it is sweet to hear a distant concert of which only snatches reach the ear all to be bound into a melodious whole by the imagination which is all the more charmed as the work is in the main its own even if all this were but the sweetness of a lovely dream is then the sweetness of a dream as nothing and am i to count for nothing a sweet dream that lasts as long as my life and holds me in perpetual intoxication      222 xviii 94  falconets answer was hard and positive contemporary glory suffices what is fame if i am not there to enjoy the fear of contempt and disgrace is as strong a motive as you need to incite men to great work glory after death is chimerical and uncertain think of all the great names that are clean forgotten of all the great workers whose achievements are lost or effaced of all the others whose works are attributed to those who did not execute them your posterity is no better than a lottery  no cries diderot with redoubled eloquence rising to his noblest height223 the present is an indivisible point that cuts in two the length of an infinite line it is impossible to rest on this point and to glide gently along with it never looking on in front and never turning the head to gaze behind the more man ascends through the past and the more he launches into the futurethe greater he will be and all these philosophers and ministers and truthtelling men who have fallen victims to the stupidity of nations the atrocities of priests the fury of tyrants what consolation was left for them in death this that prejudice would pass and that posterity would pour out the vial of ignominy upon their enemies o posterity holy and sacred stay of the unhappy and the oppressed thou who art just thou who art incorruptible who avengest the good man who unmaskest the hypocrite who draggest down the tyrant may thy sure faith thy consoling faith never never abandon me posterity is for the philosopher what the other world is for the devout      223 xviii pp 113 and 100     appendix  rameaus nephew a translation  see vol i p 348   i have omitted such pages in the following translation as refer simply to personages who have lost all possibility of interest for our generation nor did any object seem to be served by reproducing the technical points of the musical discussion enough is given and given as faithfully as i know how to show the reader what rameaus nephew is       in all weathers wet or fine it is my practice to go towards five      oclock in the evening to take a turn in the palais royal i am he      whom you may see any afternoon sitting by himself and musing in      dargensons seat i keep up talk with myself about politics love      taste or philosophy i leave my mind to play the libertine      unchecked and it is welcome to run after the first idea that      offers sage or gay just as you see our young beaux in the foy      passage following the steps of some gay nymph with her saucy mien      face all smiles eyes all fire and nose a trifle turned up then      quitting her for another attacking them all but attaching      themselves to none my thoughtsthese are the wantons for me if      the weather be too cold or too wet i take shelter in the regency      coffeehouse there i amuse myself by looking on while they play      chess nowhere in the world do they play chess so skilfully as in      paris and nowhere in paris as they do at this coffeehouse tis      here you see légal the profound philidor the subtle mayot the      solid here you see the most astounding moves and listen to the      sorriest talk for if a man may be at once a wit and a great      chessplayer like légal you may also be a great chessplayer and      a sad simpleton like joubert and mayot       one day i was there after dinner watching intently saying little      and hearing the very least possible when there approached me one      of the most eccentric figures in the country where god has not      made them lacking he is a mixture of elevation and lowness of      good sense and madness the notions of good and bad must be mixed      up together in strange confusion in his head for he shows the good      qualities that nature has bestowed on him without any ostentation      and the bad ones without the smallest shame for the rest he is      endowed with a vigorous frame a particular warmth of imagination      and an astonishing strength of lungs if you ever meet him and if      you are not arrested by his originality you will either stuff your      fingers into your ears or else take to your heels heavens what a      monstrous pipe nothing is so little like him as himself one time      he is lean and wan like a patient in the last stage of      consumption you could count his teeth through his cheeks you      would say he must have passed several days without tasting a      morsel or that he is fresh from la trappe a month after he is      stout and sleek as if he had been sitting all the time at the      board of a financier or had been shut up in a bernardine      monastery today in dirty linen his clothes torn or patched with      barely a shoe to his foot he steals along with a bent head you      are tempted to hail him and fling him a shilling tomorrow all      powdered curled in a fine coat he marches past with head erect      and open mien and you would almost take him for a decent worthy      creature he lives from day to day from hand to mouth downcast or      sad just as things may go his first care in a morning when he      gets up is to know where he will dine and after dinner he begins      to think where he may pick up a supper night brings disquiets of      its own either he climbs to a shabby garret that he has unless      the landlady weary of waiting for her rent has taken the key away      from him or else he slinks to some tavern on the outskirts of the      town where he waits for daybreak over a piece of bread and a mug      of beer when he has not threepence in his pocket as sometimes      happens he has recourse either to a hackney carriage belonging to      a friend or to the coachman of some man of quality who gives him      a bed on the straw beside the horses in the morning he still has      bits of his mattress in his hair if the weather is mild he      measures the champs elysées all night long with the day he      reappears in the town dressed over night for the morrow and from      the morrow sometimes dressed for the rest of the week       i do not rate these originals very highly other people make      familiar acquaintances and even friends of them they detain me      perhaps once in a twelvemonth if i happen to fall in with them      their character stands out from the rest of the world and breaks      that wearisome uniformity which our bringingup our social      conventions and our arbitrary fashions have introduced if one of      them makes his appearance in a company he is a piece of leaven      which ferments and restores to each a portion of his natural      individuality he stirs people up moves them invites to praise or      blame he is the means of bringing out the truth he gives honest      people a chance of showing themselves he unmasks the rogues this      is the time when a man of sense listens and distinguishes his      company       i had known my present man long ago he used to frequent a house to      which his clever parts had opened the door there was an only      daughter he swore to the father and mother that he would marry      their daughter they shrugged their shoulders laughed in his face      told him he was out of his senses and i saw in an instant that his      business was done he wanted to borrow a few crowns from me which      i gave him he worked his way i cannot tell how into some houses      where he had his plate laid for him but on condition that he      should never open his lips without leave he held his tongue and      ate away in a towering rage it was excellent to watch him in this      state of constraint if he could not resist breaking the treaty      and ever began to open his mouth at the first word all the guests      called out rameau then fury sparkled in his eyes and he turned      to his plate in a worse passion than ever you were curious to know      the mans name and now you know it tis rameau pupil of the      famous man who delivered us from the plainsong that we had been      used to chant for over a hundred years who wrote so many      unintelligible visions and apocalyptic truths on the theory of      music of which neither he nor anybody else understood a word and      from whom we have a certain number of operas that are not without      harmony refrains random notions uproar triumphs glories      murmurs breathless victories and dancetunes that will last to      all eternity and who after burying lulli the florentine will be      himself buried by the italian virtuosia fate that he had a      presentiment of which made him gloomy and chagrined for nobody is      in such illhumour not even a pretty woman who awakes with a      pimple on her nose as an author threatened with loss of his      reputation       he comes up to me ah ah here you are my philosopher and what      are you doing among this pack of idlers can it be possible that      you too waste your time in pushing the wood       ino but when i have nothing better to do i amuse myself by      watching people who push it well       hein that case you are amusing yourself with a vengeance      except philidor and légal there is not one of them who knows      anything about it       iwhat of m de bussy       hehe is as a chessplayer what mademoiselle clairon is as an      actress they know of their playing one and the other as much as      anybody can learn       iyou are hard to please and i see you can forgive nothing      short of the sublimities       hetrue in chess women poetry eloquence music and all      such fiddlefaddle what is the use of mediocrity in these matters       ilittle enough i agree but the thing is that there must be a      great number of men at work for us to make sure of the man of      genius he is one out of a multitude but let that pass tis an      age since i have seen you though i do not often think about you      when you are out of sight yet it is always a pleasure to me to      meet you what have you been about       hewhat you i and everybody else are aboutsome good some      bad and nothing at all then i have been hungry and i have eaten      when opportunity offered after eating i have been thirsty and      now and then have had something to drink besides that my beard      grew and as it grew i had it shaved       ithere you were wrong it is the only thing wanting to make a      sage of you       heay ay i have a wide and furrowed brow a glowing eye a      firm nose broad cheeks a black and bushy eyebrow a clean cut      mouth a square jaw cover this enormous chin with amplitude of      beard and i warrant you it would look vastly well in marble or in      bronze       iby the side of a cæsar a marcus aurelius a socrates       henay i should be better between diogenes laïs and phryne      i am brazenfaced as the one and i am happy to pay a visit to the      others       iare you always well       heyes commonly but i am no great wonders today       iwhy you have a paunch like silenus and a face like       hea face you might take for i dont know what the ill humour      that dries up my dear master seems to fatten his dear pupil       iand this dear master do you ever see him now       heyes passing along the street       idoes he do nothing for you       heif he has done anything for anybody it is without knowing      it he is a philosopher after his fashion he thinks of nobody but      himself his wife and his daughter may die as soon as they please      provided the church bells that toll for them continue to sound the      twelfth and the seventeenth all will be well it is lucky for      him and that is what i especially prize in your men of genius      they are only good for one thing outside of that nothing they do      not know what it is to be citizens fathers mothers kinsfolk      friends between ourselves it is no bad thing to be like them at      every point but we should not wish the grain to become common we      must have men but men of genius no no on my word of them we      need none tis they who change the face of the globe and in the      smallest things folly is so common and so almighty that you cannot      mend it without an infinite disturbance part of what they have      dreamt comes to pass and part remains as it was hence two      gospels the dress of a harlequin the wisdom of rabelaiss moral      is the true wisdom both for his own repose and that of other      people to do ones duty so so always to speak well of the prior      and to let the world go as it lists it must go well for most      people are content with it if i knew history enough i should      prove to you that evil has always come about here below through a      few men of genius but i do not know history no more than i know      anything else the deuce take me if i have learnt anything or if      i find myself a pin the worse for not having learnt anything i was      one day at the table of the minister of the king of who has      brains enough for four and he showed as plain as one and one make      two that nothing was more useful to people than falsehood nothing      more mischievous than truth i dont remember his proofs very      clearly but it evidently followed from them that men of genius are      detestable and that if a child at its birth bore on its brow the      mark of that dangerous gift of nature it ought to be smothered or      else thrown to the ducks       iyet such people foes as they are to genius all lay claim to      it       hei daresay they think so in their own minds but i doubt if      they would venture to admit it       iah that is their modesty so you conceived from that a      frightful antipathy to genius       heone that i shall never get over       iyet i have seen the time when you were in despair at the      thought of being only a common man you will never be happy if the      pro and the con distress you alike you should take your side and      keep to it though people will agree with you that men of genius      are usually singular or as the proverb says there are no great      wits without a grain of madness yet they will always look down on      ages that have produced no men of genius they will pay honour to      the nations among whom they have existed sooner or later they      rear statues to them and regard them as the benefactors of the      human race with all deference to the sublime minister whom you      have cited i still believe that if falsehood may sometimes be      useful for a moment it is surely hurtful in the longrun and so      on the other hand truth is surely useful in the longrun though      it may sometimes chance to be inconvenient for the moment whence i      should be tempted to conclude that the man of genius who cries down      a general error or wins credit for a great truth is always a      creature that deserves our veneration it may happen that such an      one falls a victim to prejudice and the laws but there are two      sorts of laws the one of an equity and generality that is      absolute the other of an incongruous kind which owe all their      sanction to the blindness or exigency of circumstance the latter      only cover the culprit who infringes them with passing ignominy an      ignominy that time pours back on the judges and the nations there      to remain for ever whether is socrates or the authority that bade      him drink the hemlock in the worst dishonour in our day       henot so fast was he any the less for that condemned or any      the less put to death or any the less a bad citizen by his      contempt for a bad law did he any the less encourage blockheads to      despise good ones or was he any the less an audacious eccentric      you were close there upon an admission that would have done little      for men of genius       ibut listen to me my good man a society ought not to have      bad laws and if it had only good ones it would never find itself      persecuting a man of genius i never said to you that genius was      inseparably bound up with wickedness any more than wickedness is      with genius a fool is many a time far worse than a man of parts      even supposing a man of genius to be usually of a harsh carriage      awkward prickly unbearable even if he be thoroughly bad what      conclusion do you draw       hethat he ought to be drowned       igently good man now i will not take your uncle rameau for      an instance he is harsh he is brutal he has no humanity he is a      miser he is a bad father bad husband bad uncle but it has never      been settled that he is particularly clever that he has advanced      his art or that there will be any talk of his works ten years      hence but racine now he at any rate had genius and did not pass      for too good a man and voltaire       hebeware of pressing me for i am not one to shrink from      conclusions       iwhich of the two would you prefer that he should have been a      worthy soul identified with his till like briasson or with his      yard measure like barbier each year producing a lawful babe good      husband good father good uncle good neighbour decent trader      but nothing more or that he should have been treacherous      ambitious envious spiteful but the author of andromaque      britannicus iphigenie phèdre athalie       hefor his own sake on my word perhaps of the two men it      would have been a great deal better that he should have been the      first       ithat is even infinitely more true than you think       heah there you are you others if we say anything good and      to the purpose tis like madmen or creatures inspired by a      hazard it is only you wise people who know what you mean yes my      philosopher i know what i mean as well as you do       ilet us see now why did you say that of him       hebecause all the fine things he did never brought him twenty      thousand francs and if he had been a silk merchant in the rue      saint denis or saint honoré a good wholesale grocer an apothecary      with plenty of customers he would have amassed an immense fortune      and in amassing it he could have enjoyed every pleasure in life      he would have thrown a pistole from time to time to a poor devil of      a droll like me we should have had good dinners at his house      played high play drunk firstrate wines firstrate liqueurs      firstrate coffee had glorious excursions into the country now      you see i know what i meant you laugh but let me go on it would      have been better for everybody about him       ino doubt it would provided that he had not put to unworthy      use what gain he had made in lawful commerce and had banished from      his house all those gamesters all those parasites all those idle      flatterers all those depraved neerdowells and had bidden his      shopboys give a sound beating to the officious creature who offers      to play pander       hea beating sir a beating no one is beaten in any      wellgoverned town it is a decent enough trade plenty of people      with fine titles meddle with it and what the deuce would you have      him do with his money if he is not to have a good table good      company good wines handsome women pleasures of every colour      diversion of every sort i would as lief be a beggar as possess a      mighty fortune without any of these enjoyments but go back to      racine he was only good for people who did not know him and for a      time when he had ceased to exist       igranted but weigh the good and bad a thousand years from      now he will draw tears he will be the admiration of men in all the      countries of the earth he will inspire compassion tenderness      pity they will ask who he was and to what land he belonged and      france will be envied he brought suffering on one or two people      who are dead and in whom we take hardly any interest we have      nothing to fear from his vices or his foibles it would have been      better no doubt that he should have received from nature the      virtues of a good man instead of the talents of a great one he is      a tree which made a few other trees planted near him wither up and      which smothered the plants that grew at his feet but he reared his      height to the clouds and his branches spread far he lends his      shadow to all who came or come now or ever shall come to repose      by his majestic trunk he brought forth fruits of exquisite savour      which are renewed again and again without ceasing       we might wish that voltaire had the mildness of duclos the      ingenuousness of the abbé trublet the rectitude of the abbé      dolivet but as that cannot be let us look at the thing on the      side of it that is really interesting let us forget for an instant      the point we occupy in space and time and let us extend our      vision over centuries to come and peoples yet unborn and distant      lands yet unvisited let us think of the good of our race if we      are not generous enough at least let us forgive nature for being      wiser than ourselves if you throw cold water on greuzes head      very likely you will extinguish his talent along with his vanity      if you make voltaire less sensitive to criticism he will lose the      art that took him to the inmost depths of the soul of merope and      will never stir a single emotion in you more       hebut if nature be as powerful as she is wise why did she not      make them as good as she made them great       ido you not see how such reasoning as that overturns the      general order and that if all were excellent here below then      there would be nothing excellent       heyou are right the important point is that you and i should      be here provided only that you and i are you and i then let all      besides go as it can the best order of things in my notion is      that in which i was to have a place and a plague on the most      perfect of worlds if i dont belong to it i would rather exist      and even be a bad hand at reasoning than not exist at all       ithere is nobody but thinks as you do and whoever brings his      indictment against the order of things forgets that he is      renouncing his own existence       hethat is true       iso let us accept things as they are let us see how much they      cost us and how much they give us and leave the whole as it is      for we do not know it well enough either to praise or blame it and      perhaps after all it is neither good nor ill if it is necessary      as so many good folk suppose       henow you are going beyond me what you say seems like      philosophy and i warn you that i never meddle with that all that      i know is that i should be very well pleased to be somebody else      on the chance of being a genius and a great man yes i must agree      i have something here that tells me so i never in my life heard a      man praised that his eulogy did not fill me with secret fury i am      full of envy if i hear something about their private life that is      a discredit to them i listen with pleasure it brings us nearer to      a level i bear my mediocrity more comfortably i say to myself      ah thou couldst never have done mahomet nor the eulogy on      maupeou so i have always been and i always shall be mortified at      my own mediocrity yes i tell you i am mediocre and it provokes      me i never heard the overture to the indes galantes performed      nor the profonds abîmes de ténare nuit eternelle nuit sung      without saying to myself that is what thou wilt never do so i was      jealous of my uncle       iif that is the only thing that chagrins you it is hardly      worth the trouble       hetis nothing only a passing humour then he set himself to      hum the overture and the air he had spoken of and went on       the something which is here and speaks to me says rameau thou      wouldst fain have written those two pieces if thou hadst done      those two pieces thou wouldst soon do two others and after thou      hadst done a certain number they would play thee and sing thee      everywhere in walking thou wouldst hold thy head erect thy      conscience would testify within thy bosom to thy own merit the      others would point thee out there goes the man who wrote the      pretty gavottes and he hummed the gavottes then with the air of a      man bathed in delight and his eyes shining with it he went on      rubbing his hands thou shalt have a fine house he marked out its      size with his arms a famous bed he stretched himself luxuriously      upon it capital wines he sipped them in imagination smacking      his lips a handsome equipage he raised his foot as if to mount      a hundred varlets who will come to offer thee fresh incense every      day and he fancied he saw them all around him palissot      poinsinet the two frérons laporte he heard them approved of      them smiled at them contemptuously repulsed them drove them      away called them back then he continued and it is thus they      would tell thee on getting up in a morning that thou art a great      man thou wouldst read in the histoire des trois siècles that      thou art a great man thou wouldst be convinced of an evening that      thou art a great man and the great man rameau would fall asleep to      the soft murmur of the eulogy that would ring in his ears even as      he slept he would have a complacent air his chest would expand      and rise and fall with comfort he would move like a great man       and as he talked he let himself sink softly on a bench he closed      his eyes and imitated the blissful sleep that his mind was      picturing after relishing the sweetness of this repose for a few      instants he awoke stretched his arms yawned rubbed his eyes and      looked about him for his pack of vapid flatterers       iyou think then the happy mortal has his sleep       hethink so a sorry wretch like me at night when i get back      to my garret and burrow in my trucklebed i shrink up under my      blanket my chest is all compressed and i can hardly breathe it      seems like a moan that you can barely hear now a banker makes the      room ring and astonishes a whole street but what afflicts me      today is not that i snore and sleep meanly and shabbily like a      paltry outcast       iyet that is a sorry thing enough       hewhat has befallen me is still more so       iwhat is that       heyou have always taken some interest in me because i am a      bon diable whom you rather despise at bottom but who diverts      you       iwell that is the plain truth       hei will tell you before beginning he heaved a profound      sigh and clasped his brow with his two hands then he recovers his      tranquillity and says       you know that i am an ignoramus a fool a madman an impertinent      a sluggard a glutton       iwhat a panegyric       hetis true to the letter there is not a word to take away      prithee no debate on that no one knows me better i know myself      and i do not tell the whole       ii have no wish to cross you and i will agree to anything       hewell i used to live with people who took a liking for me      plainly because i was gifted with all these qualities to such a      rare degree       ithat is curious until now i always thought that people hid      these things even from themselves or else that they granted      themselves pardon while they despised them in others       hehide them from themselves can men do that you may be sure      that when palissot is all alone and returns upon himself he tells      a very different tale you may be sure that when he talks quietly      with his colleague they candidly admit that they are only a pair      of mighty rogues despise such things in others my people were far      more equitable and they took my character for a perfect nonesuch      i was in clover they feasted me they did not lose me from their      sight for a single instant without sighing for my return i was      their excellent rameau their dear rameau their rameau the mad      the impertinent the lazy the greedy the merryman the lout      there was not one of these epithets which did not bring me a smile      a caress a tap on the shoulder a cuff a kick at table a titbit      tossed on to my plate away from the table a freedom that i took      without consequences for do you see i am a man without      consequence they do with me and before me and at me whatever they      like without my standing on any ceremony and the little presents      that showered on me the great hound that i am i have lost all i      have lost all for having had common sense once one single time in      my life ah if that ever chances again       iwhat was the matter then       herameau rameau did they ever take you for that the folly      of having had a little taste a trifle of wit a spice of reason      rameau my friend that will teach you the difference between what      god made you and what your protectors wanted you to be so they      took you by the shoulder they led you to the door and cried be      off rascal never appear more he would fain have sense reason      wit i declare off with you we have all these qualities and to      spare you went away biting your thumb it was your infernal      tongue that you ought to have bitten before all this for not      bethinking you of that here you are in the gutter without a      farthing or a place to lay your head you were well housed and      now you will be lucky if you get your garret again you had a good      bed and now a truss of straw awaits you between m de soubises      coachman and friend robbé instead of the gentle quiet slumber that      you had you will have the neighing and stamping of horses all      night longyou wretch idiot possessed by a million devils       ibut is there no way of setting things straight is the fault      you committed so unpardonable if i were you i should go find my      people again you are more indispensable to them than you suppose       heoh as for that i know that now they have me no longer to      make fun for them they are dull as ditchwater       ithen i should go back i would not give them time enough to      learn how to get on without me or to turn to some more decent      amusement for who knows what may happen       hethat is not what i am afraid of that will never come to      pass       ibut sublime as you may be some one else may replace you       hehardly       ihardly it is true still i would go with that lacklustre      face those haggard eyes that open breast that tumbled hair in      that downright tragic state in which you are now i would throw      myself at the feet of the divinity and without rising i would say      with a low and sobbing voice forgive me madam forgive me i am      the vilest of creatures it was only one unfortunate moment for      you know i am not subject to common sense and i promise you i      will never have it again so long as i live       the diverting part of it was that while i discoursed to him in      this way he executed it pantomimically and threw himself on the      ground with his eyes fixed on the earth he seemed to hold between      his two hands the tip of a slipper he wept he sobbed he cried      yes my queen yes i promise i never will so long as i live so      long as ever i live then recovering himself abruptly he went      on in a serious and deliberate tone       heyes you are right i see it is the best yet to go and      humiliate ones self before a hussy cry for mercy at the feet of a      little actress with the hisses of the pit for ever in her ears i      rameau son of rameau the apothecary of dijon who is a good man      and never yet bent his knee to a creature in the world i rameau      who have composed pieces for the piano that nobody plays but which      will perhaps be the only pieces ever to reach posterity and      posterity will play themi i must go stay sir it cannot be      and striking his right hand on his breast he went on i feel      here something that rises and tells me never rameau never there      must be a certain dignity attached to human nature that nothing can      stifle it awakes à propos des bottes you cannot explain it for      there are other days when it would cost me not a pang to be as vile      as you like and for a halfpenny there is nothing too dirty for me      to do       ithen if the expedient i have suggested to you is not to your      taste have courage enough to remain a beggar       hetis hard being a beggar while there are so many rich      fools at whose expense one can live and the contempt for ones      self it is insupportable       ido you know that sentiment       heknow it how many times have i said to myself what rameau      there are ten thousand good tables in paris with fifteen or twenty      covers apiece and of these covers not one for thee there are      purses full of gold which is poured out right and left and not a      crown of it falls to thee a thousand witlings without parts and      without worth a thousand paltry creatures without a charm a      thousand scurvy intriguers are all well clad while thou must go      bare canst thou be such a nincompoop as all this couldst thou not      flatter as well as anybody else couldst thou not find out how to      lie swear forswear promise keep or break like anybody else      couldst thou not favour the intrigue of my lady and carry the      loveletter of my lord like anybody else couldst thou not find      out the trick of making some shopkeepers daughter understand how      shabbily dressed she is how two fine earrings a touch of rouge      some lace and a polish gown would make her ravishing that those      little feet were not made for trudging through the mud that there      is a handsome gentleman young rich in a coat covered with lace      with a superb carriage and six fine lackeys who once saw her as he      passed who thought her charming and wonderful and that ever since      that day he has taken neither bite nor sup cannot sleep at nights      and will surely die of it he comes he pleases the little maid      vanishes and i pocket my two thousand crowns what thou hast a      talent like this and yet in want of bread shame on thee wretch      i recalled a crowd of scoundrels who were not a patch upon me and      yet were rolling in money there was i in serge and they in      velvet they leaned on goldheaded canes and had fine rings on      their fingers and what were they wretched bungling strummers and      now they are a kind of fine gentlemen at such times i felt full of      courage my soul inflamed and elevated my wits alert and subtle      and capable of anything in the world but this happy turn did not      last it would seem for so far i have not been able to make much      way however that may be there is the text of my frequent      soliloquies which you may paraphrase as you choose provided you      are sure that i know what selfcontempt is and that torture of      conscience which comes of the usefulness of the gifts that heaven      has bestowed on us that is the cruellest stroke of all a man      might almost as well never have been born       i had listened to him all the time and as he enacted the scene      with the poor girl with my heart moved by two conflicting      emotions i did not know whether to give myself up to the longing i      had to laugh or to a transport of indignation i was distressingly      perplexed between two humours twenty times an uncontrollable burst      of laughter kept my anger back and twenty times the anger that was      rising from the bottom of my soul suddenly ended in a burst of      laughter i was confounded by so much shrewdness and so much      vileness by ideas now so just and then so false by such general      perversity of sentiments such complete turpitude and such      marvellously uncommon frankness he perceived the struggle going on      within me what ails you said he       inothing       heyou seem to be disturbed       iand i am       hebut now after all what do you advise me to do       ito change your way of talking you unfortunate soul to what      abject state have you fallen       hei admit it and yet do not let my state touch you too      deeply i had no intention in opening my mind to you to give you      pain i managed to scrape up a few savings when i was with the      people remember that i wanted nothing not a thing and they made      me a certain allowance for pocketmoney       he again began to tap his brow with one of his fists to bite his      lips and to roll his eyes towards the ceiling going on to say       but tis all over i have put something aside time has passed and      that is always so much gained       iso much lost you mean       heno no gained people grow rich every moment a day less to      live or a crown to the good tis all one when the last moment      comes one is as rich as another samuel bernard who by pillaging      and stealing and playing bankrupt leaves seven and twenty million      francs in gold is just like rameau who leaves not a penny and      will be indebted to charity for a shroud to wrap round him the      dead man hears not the tolling of the bell tis in vain that a      hundred priests bawl dirges for him and that a long file of      blazing torches go before his soul walks not by the side of the      master of the ceremonies to moulder under marble or to moulder      under clay tis still to moulder to have around ones bier      children in red and children in blue or to have not a creature      what matters it and then look at this wrist it was stiff as the      devil the ten fingers they were so many sticks fastened into a      metacarpus made of wood and these muscles were like old strings of      catgut drier stiffer harder to bend than if that they had been      used for a turners wheel but i have so twisted and broken and      bent them what thou wilt not go and i say that thou shalt       and at this with his right hand he seized the fingers and wrist      of his left hand and turned them first up and then down the      extremity of the fingers touched the arm till the joints cracked      again i was afraid every instant that the bones would remain      dislocated       itake care you will do yourself a mischief       hedont be afraid they are used to it for ten years i have      given it them in a very different style they had to accustom      themselves to it however they liked it and to learn to find their      place on the keys and to leap over the strings so now they go      where they must       at the same moment he threw himself into the attitude of a      violinplayer he hummed an allegro of locatellis his right arm      imitated the movement of the bow his left hand and his fingers      seemed to be feeling along the handle if he makes a false note he      stops tightens or slackens his string and strikes it with his      nail to make sure of its being in tune and then takes up the      piece where he left off he beats time with his foot moves his      head his feet his hands his arms his body as you may have seen      ferrari or chiabran or some other virtuoso in the same      convulsions presenting the image of the same torture and giving      me nearly as much pain for is it not a painful thing to watch the      torture of a man who is busy painting pleasure for my benefit draw      a curtain to hide the man from me if he must show me the spectacle      of a victim on the rack in the midst of all these agitations and      cries if there occurred one of those harmonious passages where the      bow moves slowly over several of the strings at once his face put      on an air of ecstasy his voice softened he listened to himself      with perfect ravishment it is undoubted that the chorus sounded      both in his ears and mine then replacing his imaginary instrument      under his left arm with the same hand by which he held it and      letting his right hand drop with the bow in it said       well what do you think of it       iwonderful       henot bad i fancy it sounds pretty much like the others      and then he stooped down like a musician placing himself at the      piano       inay i beg you to be merciful both to me and to yourself       heno no now that i have got you you shall hear me i will      have no vote that is given without your knowing why you will say a      good word for me with more confidence and that will be worth a      new pupil to me       ibut i am so little in the world and you will tire yourself      all to no purpose       hei am never tired       as i saw that it was useless to have pity on my man for the      sonata on the violin had bathed him in perspiration i resolved to      let him do as he would so behold him seated at the piano his legs      bent his head thrown back towards the ceiling where you would      have thought he saw a score written up humming preluding dashing      off a piece of albertis or galuppis i forget which his voice      went like the wind and his fingers leapt over the imaginary keys      the various passions succeeded one another on his face you      observed on it tenderness anger pleasure sorrow you felt the      piano notes the forte notes and i am sure that a more skilful      musician than myself would have recognised the piece by the      movement and the character by his gestures and by a few notes of      airs which escaped from him now and again but the absurd thing was      to see him from time to time hesitate and take himself up as if he      had gone wrong       now you perceive said he rising and wiping away the drops of      sweat which rolled down his cheeks that we know how to place our      third our superfluous fifth and that we know all about our      dominants those enharmonic passages about which the dear uncle      makes such fuss they are not like having the sea to swallow we      can manage them well enough       iyou have given yourself a great deal of trouble to show me      that you are uncommonly clever but i would have taken your word      for it       heuncommonly clever oh no for my trade i know it decently      and that is more than one wants for in this country is one obliged      to know all that one shows       ino more than to know all that one teaches       hethat is true most thoroughly true now sir philosopher      your hand on your conscience speak the truth there was a time      when you were not a man of such substance as you are today       ii am not so very substantial even now       hebut you would not go now to the luxembourg in      summertime you remember       ino more of that yes i do remember       hein an overcoat of gray shag       iay ay       heterribly worn at one side with one of the sleeves torn and      black woollen stockings mended at the back with white thread       iyes anything you like       hewhat were you doing in the alley of sighs       icutting a shabby figure enough i daresay       heyou used to give lessons in mathematics       iwithout knowing a word about them is not that what you want      to come to       heexactly so       ii learnt by teaching others and i turned out some good      pupils       hethat may be but music is not like algebra or geometry now      that you are a substantial personage       inot so substantial i tell you       heand have a good lining to your purse       inot so good       helet your daughter have masters       inot yet it is her mother who looks to her education for one      must have peace in ones house       hepeace in ones house you have only that when you are      either master or servant and it should be master i had a      wifemay heaven bless her soulbut when it happened sometimes      that she played malapert i used to mount the high horse and bring      out my thunder i used to say like the creator let there be light      and there was light so for four years we had not ten times in all      one word higher than another how old is your child       ithat has nothing to do with the matter       hehow old is your child i say       ithe devil take you leave my child and her age alone and      return to the master she is to have       hei know nothing so pigheaded as a philosopher in all      humility and supplication might one not know from his highness the      philosopher about what age her ladyship his daughter may be       ii suppose she is eight       heeight then four years ago she ought to have had her fingers      on the keys       ibut perhaps i have no fancy for including in the scheme of      her education a study that takes so much time and is good for so      little       heand what will you teach her if you please       ito reason justly if i can a thing so uncommon among men      and more uncommon still among women       heoh let her reason as ill as she chooses if she is only      pretty amusing and coquettish       ias nature has been unkind enough to give her a delicate      organisation with a very sensitive soul and to expose her to the      same troubles in life as if she had a strong organisation and a      heart of bronze i will teach her if i can to bear them      courageously       helet her weep and give herself airs and have nerves all on      edge like the rest if only she is pretty amusing and coquettish      what is she to learn no dancing nor deportment       iyes just enough to make a curtsey to have a good carriage      to enter a room gracefully and to know how to walk       heno singing       ijust enough to pronounce her words well       heno music       iif there were a good teacher of harmony i would gladly      entrust her to him two hours a day for two or three years not any      more       heand instead of the essential things that you are going to      suppress       ii place grammar fables history geography a little      drawing and a great deal of morality       hehow easy it would be for me to prove to you the uselessness      of all such knowledge in a world like ours uselessness do i say      perhaps even the danger but i will for the moment ask you a single      question will she not require one or two masters       ino doubt       heand you hope that these masters will know the grammar the      fables the history the geography the morality in which they      will give her lessons moonshine my dear mentor sheer moonshine      if they knew these things well enough to teach them to other      people they never would teach them       iand why       hebecause they would have spent all their lives in studying      them it is necessary to be profound in art and science to know      its elements thoroughly classical books can only be well done by      those who have grown gray in harness it is the middle and the end      which light up the darkness of the beginning ask your friend      dalembert the coryphæus of mathematics if he thinks himself too      good to write about the elements it was not till after thirty or      forty years of practice that my uncle got a glimpse of the      profundities and the first rays of light in musical theory       io madman archmadman i cried how comes it that in thine      evil head such just ideas go pellmell with such a mass of      extravagances       hewho on earth can find that out tis chance that flings them      to you and they remain if you do not know the whole of a thing      you know none of it well you do not know whither one thing leads      nor whence another has come where this and that should be placed      which ought to pass the first and where the second would be best      can you teach well without method and method whence comes that i      vow to you my dear philosopher i have a notion that physics will      always be a poor science a drop of water raised by a needlepoint      from the vast ocean a grain loosened from an alpine chain and      then seeking the reasons of phenomena in truth one might every      whit as well be ignorant as know so little and know it so ill and      that was exactly my doctrine when i gave myself out for a      musicmaster what are you musing over       ii am thinking that all you have told me is more specious than      solid but that is no matter you taught you say accompaniment      and composition       heyes       iand you knew nothing about either       heno i faith and that is why there were worse than i was      namely those who fancied they knew something at any rate i did      not spoil either the childs taste or its hands when they passed      from me to a good master if they had learnt nothing at all events      they had nothing to unlearn and that was always so much time and      so much money saved       iwhat did you do       hewhat they all do i got there i threw myself into a chair      what shocking weather how tiring the streets are then some      gossip mademoiselle lemierre was to have taken the part of vestal      in the new opera but she is in an interesting condition for the      second time and they do not know who will take her place      mademoiselle arnould has just left her little count they say she      is negotiating with bertin that poor dumesnil no longer knows      either what he is saying or what he is doing now miss take      your book while miss who is in no hurry is looking for her      book which is lost while they call the housemaid and scold and      make a great stir i continuethe clairon is really      incomprehensible they talk of a marriage which is outrageously      absurd tis that of miss  what is her name a little creature      that used to live with so and so etcetera etceteracome      rameau you are talking nonsense it is impossiblei dont talk      nonsense at all they even say it is done there is a rumour that      voltaire is dead and so much the betterand pray why so much      the betterbecause he must be going to give us something more      laughable than usual it is always his custom to die a fortnight      before what more shall i tell you i used to tell certain      naughtinesses that i brought from houses where i had been for we      are all of us great fetchers and carriers i played the madman      they listened to me they laughed they called out how charming he      is meanwhile missys book had been found under the sofa where it      had been pulled about gnawed torn by a puppy or a kitten she sat      down to the piano at first she made a noise on it by herself then      i went towards her after giving her mother a sign of approbation      the mother that is not bad people have only to be in earnest      but they are not in earnest they would rather waste their time in      chattering in disarranging things in gadding hither and thither      and i know not what besides your back is no sooner turned m      rameau than the book is shut up not to be opened until your next      visit still you never scold her then as something had to be      done i took hold of her hands and placed them differently i got      out of temper i called out sol sol sol miss it is a sol      the mother have you no ear i am not at the piano and i cant      see your book yet i know it ought to be a sol you are most      troublesome to your teacher i cant tell how he is so patient you      do not remember a word of what he says to you you make no      progress then i would lower my tone rather and throwing my      head on one side would say pardon me madam all would go very      well if the young lady liked if she only studied a little more      but it is not bad the mother if i were you i should keep her      at one piece for a whole year oh as for that she shall not      leave it before she has mastered every difficulty and that will      not be as long as you may think monsieur rameau you flatter      her you are too good that is the only part of the lesson which      she will keep in mind and she will take care to repeat it to me      upon occasion and so the time got over my pupil presented me      my little fee with the curtsey she had learnt from the dancing      master i put it into my pocket while the mother said very well      done mademoiselle if favillier were here he would applaud you      i chattered a moment or two for politeness sake and behold that      was what they call a music lesson       iwell and now it is quite another thing       heanother thing i should think so indeed i get there i am      deadly grave i take off my cuffs hastily i open the piano i run      my fingers over the keys i am always in a desperate hurry if they      keep me waiting a moment i cry out as if they were robbing me of a      crown piece in an hour from now i must be so and so in two hours      with the duchess of so and so i am expected to dine with a      handsome marchioness and then on leaving her there is a concert      at the barons       iand all the time nobody is expecting you anywhere at all       heno       iwhat vile arts       hevile forsooth why vile they are customary among people      like me i dont lower myself in doing like everybody else i was      not the inventor of them and it would be most absurd and stupid in      me not to conform to them of course i know very well that if you      go to certain principles of some morality or other which all the      world have in their mouths and which none of them practise you      will find black is white and white will become black but my      philosopher there is a general conscience just as there is a      general grammar and then the exceptions in each language that you      learned people callwhat is it you call them       iidioms       heah exactly well each condition of life has its exceptions      to the general conscience to which i should like to give the title      of idioms of vocation       ii understand fontenelle speaks well writes well though his      style swarms with french idioms       heand the sovereign the minister the banker the magistrate      the soldier the man of letters the lawyer the merchant the      artisan the singing master the dancing master are all most      worthy folk though their practice strays in some points from the      general conscience and abounds in moral idioms the older the      institution the more the idioms the worse the times the more do      idioms multiply the man is worth so much his trade is worth the      same and reciprocally at last the trade counts for so much the      man for the same so people take care to make the trade go for as      much as they can       iall that i gather clearly from this twisted stuff is that      there are very few callings honestly carried on and very few      honest men in their callings       hegood there are none at all but in revenge there are few      rogues out of their own shops and all would go excellently but for      a certain number of persons who are called assiduous exact      fulfilling their strict duty most rigorously or what comes to the      same thing for ever in their shops and carrying on their trade      from morning until night and doing nothing else in the world so      they are the only people who grow rich and are esteemed       iby force of idioms       hethat is it i see you understand me now an idiom that      belongs to nearly all conditionsfor there are some that are      common to all countries and all times just as there are follies      that are universala common idiom is to procure for ones self as      many customers as one possibly can a common folly is to believe      that he is cleverest who has most of them there are two      exceptions to the general conscience with which you must comply      there is a kind of credit it is nothing in itself but it is made      worth something by opinion they say good character is better      than golden girdle yet the man who has a good character has not a      golden girdle and i see nowadays that the golden girdle hardly      stands in much need of character one ought if possible to have      both girdle and character and that is my object when i give myself      importance by what you describe as vile arts and poor unworthy      tricks i give my lesson and i give it well behold the general      rule i make them think i have more lessons to give than the day      has hours behold the idiom       iand the lesson you do give it well       heyes not ill passably the thorough bass of the dear master      has simplified all that in old days i used to steal my pupils      money yes i stole it that is certain now i earn it at least      like my neighbours       iand did you steal it without remorse       heoh without remorse they say that if one thief pilfers from      another the devil laughs the parents were bursting with a      fortune which had been got the lord knows how they were people      about the court financiers great merchants bankers i helped to      make them disgorge i and the rest of the people they employed in      nature all species devour one another so all ranks devour one      another in society we do justice on one another without any      meddling from the law the other day it was deschamps now it is      guimard who avenges the prince of the financier and it is the      milliner the jeweller the upholsterer the hosier the draper      the ladysmaid the cook the saddler who avenge the financier of      deschamps in the midst of it all there is only the imbecile or      the sloth who suffers injury without inflicting it whence you see      that these exceptions to the general conscience or these moral      idioms about which they make such a stir are nothing after all      and that you only need to take a clear survey of the whole       ii admire yours       heand then misery the voice of conscience and of honour is      terribly weak when the stomach calls out enough to say that if      ever i grow rich i shall be bound to restore and i have made up my      mind to restore in every possible fashion by eating drinking      gambling and whatever else you please       ii have some fears about your ever growing rich       hei have suspicions myself       ibut if things should fall so what then       hei would do like all other beggars set on horseback i would      be the most insolent ruffler that has ever been seen then i should      recall all that they have made me go through and should pay them      back with good interest all the advances that they have been good      enough to make me i am fond of command and i will command i am      fond of praise and i will make them praise me i will have in my      pay the whole troop of flatterers parasites and buffoons and      ill say to them as has been said to me come knaves let me be      amused and amused i shall be pull me some honest folk to      pieces and so they will be if honest folk can be found we will      be jolly over our cups we will have all sorts of vices and      whimsies it will be delicious we will prove that voltaire has no      genius that buffon everlastingly perched upon his stilts is only      a turgid declaimer that montesquieu is nothing more than a man      with a touch of ingenuity we will send dalembert packing to his      fusty mathematics we will welcome before and behind all the pigmy      catos like you whose modesty is the prop of pride and whose      sobriety is a fine name for not being able to help yourselves       ifrom the worthy use to which you would put your riches i      perceive what a pity it is that you are a beggar you would live      thus in a manner that would be eminently honourable to the human      race eminently useful to your countrymen and eminently glorious      for yourself       heyou are mocking me sir philosopher but you do not know      whom you are laughing at you do not suspect that at this moment i      represent the most important part of the town and the court our      millionaires in all ranks have or have not said to themselves      exactly the same things as i have just confided to you but the      fact is the life that i should lead is precisely their life what      a notion you people have you think that the same sort of happiness      is made for all the world what a strange vision yours supposes a      certain romantic spirit that we know nothing of a singular      character a peculiar taste you adorn this incongruous mixture      with the name of philosophy but now are virtue and philosophy      made for all the world he has them who can get them and he keeps      them who can imagine the universe sage and philosophical agree      that it would be a most diabolically gloomy spot come long live      philosophy the wisdom of solomon for ever to drink good wines to      cram ones self with dainty dishes to rest in beds of down except      that all all is vanity and vexation of spirit       iwhat to defend ones native land       hevanity there is native land no more i see nought from pole      to pole but tyrants and slaves       ito

daughter or the wife of my son       ibut suppose that they both plunge into vice and debauchery       hethat belongs to their position       isuppose they bring themselves into dishonour       heyou never come into dishonour if you are rich whatever you      do       isuppose they ruin themselves       heso much the worse for them       iyou will not pay much heed to your wife       henone whatever if you please the best compliment i think      that a man can pay his dearer half is to do what pleases himself      in your opinion would not society be mightily amusing if everybody      in it was always attending to his duties       iwhy not the evening is never so fair to me as when i am      satisfied with my morning       heand to me also       iwhat makes the men of the world so dainty in their      amusements is their profound idleness       hepray do not think that they are full of trouble       ias they never tire themselves they are never refreshed       hedont suppose that either they are incessantly worn out       ipleasure is always a business for them never the      satisfaction of a necessity       heso much the better necessity is always a trouble       ithey wear everything out their soul gets blunted weariness      seizes them a man who should take their life in the midst of all      their crushing abundance would do them a kindness the only part of      happiness that they know is the part that loses its edge i do not      despise the pleasures of the senses i have a palate too and it      is tickled by a wellseasoned dish or a fine wine i have a heart      and eyes and i like to see a handsome woman sometimes with my      friends a gay party even if it waxes somewhat tumultuous does      not displease me but i will not dissemble from you that it is      infinitely pleasanter to me to have succoured the unfortunate to      have ended some thorny business to have given wholesome counsel      done some pleasant reading taken a walk with some man or woman      dear to me passed instructive hours with my children written a      good page fulfilled the duties of my position said to the woman      that i love a few soft things that bring her arm round my neck i      know actions which i would give all that i possess to have done      mahomet is a sublime work i would a hundred times rather have      got justice for the memory of the calas a person of my      acquaintance fled to carthagena he was the younger son in a      country where custom transfers all the property to the eldest      there he learns that his eldest brother a petted son after having      despoiled his father and mother of all that they possessed had      driven them out of the castle and that the poor old souls were      languishing in indigence in some small country town what does he      dothis younger son who in consequence of the harsh treatment he      had received at the hand of his parents had gone to seek his      fortune far away he sends them help he makes haste to set his      affairs in order he returns with his riches he restores his      father and mother to their home and finds husbands for his      sisters ah my dear rameau that man looked upon this period as      the happiest in his life he had tears in his eyes when he spoke to      me of it and even as i tell you the story i feel my heart beat      faster and my tongue falter for sympathy       hesingular beings you are       itis you who are beings much to be pitied if you cannot      imagine that one rises above ones lot and that it is impossible      to be unhappy under the shelter of good actions       hethat is a kind of felicity with which i should find it hard      to familiarise myself for we do not often come across it but      then according to you we should be good       ito be happy assuredly       heyet i see an infinity of honest people who are not happy      and an infinity of people who are happy without being honest       iyou think so       heand is it not for having had common sense and frankness for      a moment that i dont know where to go for a supper tonight       inay it is for not having had it always it is because you      did not perceive in good time that one ought first and foremost to      provide a resource independent of servitude       heindependent or not the resource i had provided is at any      rate the most comfortable       iand the least sure and least decent       hebut the most conformable to my character of sloth madman      and goodfornought       ijust so       heand since i can secure my happiness by vices which are      natural to me which i have acquired without labour which i      preserve without effort which go well with the manners of my      nation which are to the taste of those who protect me and are      more in harmony with their small private necessities than virtues      which would weary them by being a standing accusation against them      from morning to night why it would be very singular for me to go      and torment myself like a lost spirit for the sake of making      myself into somebody other than i am to put on a character      foreign to my own and qualities which i will admit to be highly      estimable in order to avoid discussion but which it would cost me      a great deal to acquire and a great deal to practise and would      lead to nothing or possibly to worse than nothing through the      continual satire of the rich among whom beggars like me have to      seek their subsistence we praise virtue but we hate it and shun      it and know very well that it freezes the marrow of our bonesand      in this world one must have ones feet warm and then all that      would infallibly fill me with illhumour for why do we so      constantly see religious people so harsh so querulous so      unsociable tis because they have imposed a task upon themselves      which is not natural to them they suffer and when people suffer      they make others suffer too that is not my game nor that of my      protectors either i have to be gay supple amusing comical      virtue makes itself respected and respect is inconvenient virtue      insists on being admired and admiration is not amusing i have to      do with people who are bored and i must make them laugh now it is      absurdity and madness which make people laugh so mad and absurd i      must be and even if nature had not made me so the simplest plan      would still be to feign it happily i have no need to play      hypocrite there are so many already of all colours without      reckoning those who play hypocrite with themselves if your      friend rameau were to apply himself to show his contempt for      fortune and women and good cheer and idleness and to begin to      catonise what would he be but a hypocrite rameau must be what he      isa lucky rascal among rascals swollen with riches and not a      mighty paragon of virtue or even a virtuous man eating his dry      crust of bread either alone or by the side of a pack of beggars      and to cut it short i do not get on with your felicity or with      the happiness of a few visionaries like yourself       ii see my friend that you do not even know what it is and      that you are not even made to understand it       heso much the better i declare so much the better it would      make me burst with hunger and weariness and may be with remorse       ivery well then the only advice i have to give you is to      find your way back as quickly as you can into the house from which      your impudence drove you out       heand to do what you do not disapprove absolutely and yet is a      little repugnant to me relatively       iwhat a singularity       henothing singular in it at all i wish to be abject but i      wish to be so without constraint i do not object to descend from      my dignity you laugh       iyes your dignity makes me laugh       heeverybody has his own dignity i do not object to come down      from mine but it must be in my own way and not at the bidding of      others must they be able to say to me crawland behold me      forced to crawl that is the worms way and it is mine we both of      us follow itthe worm and iwhen they leave us alone but we turn      when they tread on our tails they have trodden on my tail and i      mean to turn and then you have no idea of the creature we are      talking about imagine a sour and melancholy person eaten up by      vapours wrapped twice or thrice round in his dressinggown      discontented with himself and discontented with every one else      out of whom you hardly wring a smile if you put your body and soul      out of joint in a hundred different ways who examines with a cold      considering eye the droll grimaces of my face and those of my      mind which are droller still i may torment myself to attain the      highest sublime of the lunatic asylum nothing comes of it will he      laugh or will he not that is what i am obliged to keep saying to      myself in the midst of my contortions and you may judge how      damaging this uncertainty is to ones talent my hypochondriac      with his head buried in a nightcap that covers his eyes has the      air of an immovable pagod with a string tied to its chin and      going down under his chair you wait for the string to be pulled      and it is not pulled or if by chance the jaws open it is only to      articulate some word that shows he has not seen you and that all      your drolleries have been thrown away this word is the answer to      some question which you put to him four days before the word      spoken the mastoid muscle contracts and the jaw sticks       then he set himself to imitate his man he placed himself on a      chair his head fixed his hat coming over his eyebrows his eyes      halfshut his arms hanging down moving his jaw up and down like      an automaton gloomy obscure oracular as destiny itselfsuch is      our patron       at the other side of the room is a prude who plays at importance      to whom one could bring ones self to say that she is pretty      because she is pretty though she has a blemish or two upon her      face item she is more spiteful more conceited and more silly      than a goose item she insists on having wit item you have      to persuade her that you believe she has more of it than anybody      else in the world item she knows nothing and she has a turn      for settling everything out of hand item you must applaud her      decisions with feet and hands jump for joy and scream with      admirationhow fine that is how delicate well said subtly      seen singularly felt where do women get that without study by      mere force of instinct and pure light of nature that is really      like a miracle and then they want us to believe that experience      study reflection education have anything to do with the      matter and other fooleries to match and tears and tears of      joy ten times a day to kneel down one knee bent in front of the      other the other leg drawn back the arms extended towards the      goddess to seek ones desire in her eyes to hang on her lips to      wait for her command and then start off like a flash of lightning      where is the man who would subject himself to play such a part if      it is not the wretch who finds there two or three times a week the      wherewithal to still the tribulation of his inner parts       ii should never have thought you were so fastidious       hei am not in the beginning i watched the others and i did      as they did even rather better because i am more frankly      impudent a better comedian hungrier and better off for lungs i      descend apparently in a direct line from the famous stentor       and to give me a just idea of the force of his organ he set off      laughing with violence enough to break the windows of the      coffeehouse and to interrupt the chessplayers       ibut what is the good of this talent       heyou cannot guess       ino i am rather slow       hesuppose the debate opened and victory uncertain i get up      and displaying my thunder i say that is as mademoiselle      asserts that is worth calling a judgment there is genius in      the expression but one must not always approve in the same      manner one would be monotonous and seem insincere and become      insipid you only escape that by judgment and resource you must      know how to prepare and place your major and most peremptory tones      to seize the occasion and the moment when for instance there is      a difference in feeling and the debate has risen to its last      degree of violence and you have ceased to listen to one another      and all speak at the same time you ought to have your place at the      corner of the room which is farthest removed from the field of      battle to have prepared the way for your explosion by a long      silence and then suddenly to fall like a thunderclap over the      very midst of the combatants nobody possesses this art as i do      but where i am truly surprising is in the opposite wayi have low      tones that i accompany with a smile and an infinite variety of      approving tricks of face nose lips brow eyes all make play i      have a suppleness of reins a manner of twisting the spine of      shrugging the shoulders extending the fingers inclining the head      closing the eyes and throwing myself into a state of stupefaction      as if i had heard a divine angelic voice come down from heaven      that is what flatters i do not know whether you seize rightly all      the energy of that last attitude i did not invent it but nobody      has ever surpassed me in its execution behold behold       itruly it is unique       hethink you there is a womans brain that could stand that       iit must be admitted that you have carried the talent of      playing the madman and of selfdebasement as far as it can      possibly be carried       hetry as hard as they will they will never touch menot the      best of them palissot for instance will never be more than a      good learner but if this part is amusing at first and if you have      some relish in inwardly mocking at the folly of the people whom you      are intoxicating in the long run that ceases to be exciting and      then after a certain number of discoveries one is obliged to repeat      ones self wit and art have their limits tis only god almighty      and some rare geniuses for whom the career widens as they advance       iwith this precious enthusiasm for fine things and this      facility of genius of yours is it possible that you have invented      nothing       hepardon me for instance that admiring attitude of the back      of which i spoke to you i regard it as my own though envy may      contest my claim i daresay it has been employed before but who      has felt how convenient it was for laughing in ones sleeve at the      ass for whom one was dying of admiration i have more than a      hundred ways of opening fire on a girl under the very eyes of her      mother without the latter suspecting a jot of it yes and even of      making her an accomplice i had hardly begun my career before i      disdained all the vulgar fashions of slipping a billetdoux i      have ten ways of having them taken from me and out of the number i      venture to flatter myself there are some that are new i possess in      an especial degree the gift of encouraging a timid young man i      have secured success for some who had neither wit nor good looks      if all that was written down i fancy people would concede me some      genius       iand would do you singular honour       hei dont doubt it       iin your place i would put those famous methods on paper it      would be a pity for them to be lost       heit is true but you could never suppose how little i think      of method and precepts he who needs a protocol will never go far      your genius reads little experiments much and teaches himself      look at cæsar turenne vauban the marquise de tencin her brother      the cardinal and the cardinals secretary the abbé trublet and      bouret who is it that has given lessons to bouret nobody tis      nature that forms these rare men       iwell but you might do this in your lost hours when the      anguish of your empty stomach or the weariness of your stomach      overloaded banishes slumber       heill think of it it is better to write great things than to      execute small ones then the soul rises on wings the imagination      is kindled whereas it shrivels in amazement at the applause which      the absurd public lavishes so perversely on that mincing creature      of a dangeville who plays so flatly who walks the stage nearly      bent double who stares affectedly and incessantly into the eyes of      every one she talks to and who takes her grimaces for finesse and      her little strut for grace or on that emphatic clairon who      becomes more studied more pretentious more elaborately heavy      than i can tell you that imbecile of a pit claps hands to the      echo and never sees that we are a mere worsted ball of      daintinesses tis true the ball grows a trifle big but what does      it matter that we have the finest skin the finest eyes the      prettiest bill little feeling inside in truth a step that is not      exactly light but which for all that is not as awkward as they      say as for sentiment on the other hand there is not one of these      stage dames whom we cannot cap       iwhat do you mean by all that is it irony or truth       hethe worst of it is that this deuced sentiment is all      internal and not a glimpse of it appears outside but i who am now      talking to you i know and know well that she has it if it is      not that you should see if a fit of illhumour comes on how we      treat the valets how the waitingmaids are cuffed and trounced      what kicks await our good friend if he fails in an atom of that      respect which is our due tis a little demon i tell you full of      sentiment and dignity ah you dont quite know where you are eh       ii confess i can hardly make out whether you are speaking in      good faith or in malice i am a plain man be kind enough to be a      little more outspoken and to leave your art behind for once       hewhat is it why it is what we retail before our little      patroness about the dangeville or the clairon mixed up here and      there with a word or two to put you on the scent i will allow you      to take me for a goodfornothing but not for a fool and tis      only a fool or a man eaten up with conceit who could say such a      parcel of impertinences seriously       ibut how do people ever bring themselves to say them       heit is not done all at once but little by little you come to      it ingenii largitor venter       ithen hunger must press you very hard       hethat may be yet strong as you may think them be sure that      those to whom they are addressed are much more accustomed to listen      to them than we are to hazard them       iis there anybody who has courage to be of your opinion       hewhat do you mean by anybody it is the sentiment and      language of the whole of society       ithose of you who are not great rascals must be great fools       hefools i assure you there is only one and that is he who      feasts us to cheat him       ibut how can people allow themselves to be cheated in such      gross fashion for surely the superiority of the dangeville and the      clairon is a settled thing       hewe swallow until we are full to the throat any lie that      flatters us and take drop by drop a truth that is bitter to us      and then we have the air of being so profoundly penetrated so      true       iyet you must once at any rate have sinned against the      principles of art and let slip by an oversight some of those      bitter truths that wound for in spite of the wretched abject      vile abominable part you play i believe you have at bottom some      delicacy of soul       hei not the least in the world deuce take me if i know what      i am in a general way i have a mind as round as a ball and a      character fresh as a waterwillow never false little interest as      i have in being true never true little interest as i have in      being false i say things just as they come into my head sensible      things then so much the better impertinent things then people      take no notice i let my natural frankness have full play i never      in all my life gave a thought either beforehand what to say or      while i was saying it or after i had said it and so i offend      nobody       istill that did happen with the worthy people among whom you      used to live and who were so kind to you       hewhat would you have it is a mishap an unlucky moment such      as there always are in life there is no such thing as unbroken      bliss i was too well off it could not last we have as you      know the most numerous and the best chosen company it is a school      of humanity the renewal of hospitality after the antique all the      poets who fall we pick them up all decried musicians all the      authors who are never read all the actresses who are hissed a      parcel of beggarly disgraced stupid parasitical souls and at      the head of them all i have the honour of being the brave chief of      a timorous flock it is i who exhort them to eat the first time      they come and i who ask for drink for themthey are so shy a few      young men in rags who do not know where to lay their heads but who      have good looks a few scoundrels who bamboozle the master of the      house and put him to sleep for the sake of gleaning after him in      the fields of the mistress of the house we seem gay but at bottom      we are devoured by spleen and a raging appetite wolves are not      more famishing nor tigers more cruel like wolves when the ground      has been long covered with snow we raven over our food and      whatever succeeds we rend like tigers never was seen such a      collection of soured malignant venomous beasts you hear nothing      but the names of buffon duclos montesquieu rousseau voltaire      dalembert diderot and god knows the epithets that bear them      company nobody can have any parts if he is not as stupid as      ourselves that is the plan on which palissots play of the      philosophers has been conceived and you are not spared in it any      more than your neighbours       iso much the better perhaps they do me more honour than i      deserve i should be humiliated if those who speak ill of so many      clever and worthy people took it into their heads to speak well of      me       heeverybody must pay his scot after sacrificing the greater      animals then we immolate the others       iinsulting science and virtue for a living that is      dearlyearned bread       hei have already told you we are without any consistency we      insult all the world and afflict nobody we have sometimes the      heavy abbé dolivet the big abbé le blanc the hypocrite batteux      the big abbé is only spiteful before he has had his dinner his      coffee taken he throws himself into an armchair his feet against      the ledge of the fireplace and sleeps like an old parrot on its      perch if the noise becomes violent he yawns stretches his arms      rubs his eyes and says well well what is it it is whether      piron has more wit than voltaire let us understand is it wit      that you are talking about or is it taste for as to taste your      piron has not a suspicion of it not a suspicion of it no      and there we are embarked in a dissertation upon taste then the      patron makes a sign with his hand for people to listen to him for      if he piques himself upon one thing more than another it is taste      taste he says taste is a thing but on my soul i dont      know what thing he said that it was nor does he       then sometimes we have friend robbé he regales us with his      equivocal stories with the miracles of the convulsionnaires which      he has seen with his own eyes and with some cantos of a poem on a      subject that he knows thoroughly his verses i detest but i love      to hear him recite themhe has the air of an energumen they all      cry out around him there is a poet worth calling a poet       then there comes to us also a certain noodle with a dull and stupid      air but who has the keenness of a demon and is more mischievous      than an old monkey he is one of those figures that provoke      pleasantries and sarcasms and that god made for the chastisement      of those who judge by appearances and who ought to have learnt      from the mirror that it is as easy to be a wit with the air of a      fool as to hide a fool under the air of a wit tis a very common      piece of cowardice to immolate a good man to the amusement of the      others people never fail to turn to this man he is a snare that      we set for the newcomers and i have scarcely known one of them      who was not caught        i was sometimes amazed at the justice of my madmans observations      on men and characters and i showed him my surprise that is he      answered because one derives good out of bad company as one does      out of libertinism you are recompensed for the loss of your      innocence by that of your prejudices in the society of the bad      where vice shows itself without a mask you learn to understand      them and then i have read a little       iwhat have you read       hei have read and i read and i read over and over again      theophrastus and la bruyère and molière       iexcellent works all of them       hethey are far better than people suppose but who is there      who knows how to read them       ieverybody does according to the measure of his intelligence       heno hardly anybody could you tell me what people look for      in them       iamusement and instruction       hebut what instruction for that is the point       ithe knowledge of ones duties the love of virtue the hatred      of vice       hefor my part i gather from them all that one ought to do      and all that one ought not to say thus when i read the avare i      say to myself be a miser if thou wilt but beware of talking like      the miser when i read tartufe i say be a hypocrite if thou      wilt but do not talk like a hypocrite keep the vices that are      useful to thee but avoid their tone and the appearances that would      make thee laughable to preserve thyself from such a tone and such      appearances it is necessary to know what they are now these      authors have drawn excellent pictures of them i am myself and i      remain what i am but i act and i speak as becomes the character i      am not one of those who despise moralists there is a great deal      of profit to be got from them especially with those who have      applied morality to action vice only hurts men from time to time      the characteristics of vice hurt them from morning to night      perhaps it would be better to be insolent than to have an insolent      expression one who is insolent in character only insults people      now and again one who is insolent in expression insults them      incessantly and do not imagine that i am the only reader of my      kind i have no other merit in this respect than having done on      system from a natural integrity of understanding and with true      and reasonable vision what most others do by instinct and so      their readings make them no better than i am and they remain      ridiculous in spite of themselves while i am only so when i      choose and always leave them a vast distance behind me for the      same art which teaches me how to escape ridicule on certain      occasions teaches me also on certain others how to incur it      happily then i recall to myself all that the others said and all      that i read and i add all that issues from my own originality      which is in this kind wondrous fertile       iyou have done well to reveal these mysteries to me for      otherwise i should have thought you selfcontradictory       hei am not so in the least for against a single time when one      has to avoid ridicule happily there are a hundred when one has to      provoke it there is no better part among the great people than      that of fool for a long time there was the kings fool at no time      was there ever the kings sage officially so styled now i am the      fool of bertin and many others perhaps yours at the present      moment or perhaps you are mine a man who meant to be a sage would      have no fool so he who has a fool is no sage if he is not a sage      he is a fool and perhaps even were he the king himself the fool      of his fool for the rest remember that in a matter so variable as      manners there is nothing absolutely essentially and universally      true or false if not that one must be what interest would have us      be good or bad wise or mad decent or ridiculous honest or      vicious if virtue had happened to be the way to fortune then i      should either have been virtuous or i should have pretended      virtue like other persons as it was they wanted me to be      ridiculous and i made myself so as for being vicious nature      alone had taken all the trouble that was needed in that when i use      the term vicious it is for the sake of talking your language for      if we came to explanations it might happen that you called vice      what i call virtue and virtue what i call vice       then we have the authors of the opéra comique their actors and      their actresses and oftener still their managers all people of      resource and superior merit and i forget the whole clique of      scribblers in the gazettes the avant coureur the petites      affiches the année littéraire the observateur littéraire       ithe année littéraire the observateur littéraire but      they detest one another       hequite true but all beggars are reconciled at the porringer      that cursed observateur littéraire i wish the devil had had both      him and his sheet it was that dog of a miserly priest who caused      my disaster he appeared on our horizon for the first time he      arrived at the hour that drives us all out of our dens the hour      for dinner when it is bad weather lucky the man among us who has      a shilling in his pocket to pay for a hackneycoach he is free to      laugh at a comrade for coming besplashed up to his eyes and wet to      the skin though at night he goes to his own home in just the same      plight there was one of them some months ago who had a violent      brawl with the savoyard at the door they had a running account      the creditor insisted on being paid and the debtor was not in      funds and yet he could not go upstairs without passing through the      hands of the other       dinner is served they do the honours of the table to the      abbéthey place him at the upper end i come in and see this      what abbé you preside that is all very well for today but      tomorrow you will come down if you please by one plate the day      after by another plate and so on from plate to plate now to right      and now to left until from the place that i occupied one time      before you fréron once after me dorat once after fréron palissot      once after dorat you become stationary beside me poor rascal as      you areche siedo sempre comean italian proverb not to be      decently reproduced       the abbé who is a good fellow and takes everything in good part      bursts out laughing mademoiselle struck by my observation and by      the aptness of my comparison bursts out laughing everybody to      right and left burst out laughing except the master of the house      who flies into a huff and uses language that would have meant      nothing if we had been by ourselves       rameau you are an impertinent       i know i am and it is on that condition that i was received      here       you are a scoundrel       like anybody else       a beggar       should i be here if i were not       i will have you turned out of doors       after dinner i will go of my own will       i recommend you to go       we dined i did not lose a single toothful after eating well and      drinking amply for after all messer gaster is a person with whom i      have never sulked i made up my mind what to do and i prepared to      go i had pledged my word in presence of so many people that i was      bound to keep it for a considerable time i hunted up and down the      room for my hat and cane in every corner where they were not likely      to be reckoning all the time that the master of the house would      break out into a new torrent of injuries that somebody would      interpose and that we should at last make friends by sheer dint of      altercation i turned on this side and that for i had nothing on      my heart but the master more sombre and darkbrowed than homers      apollo as he lets his arrows fly among the greeks with his cap      plucked farther over his head than usual marched backwards and      forwards up and down the room mademoiselle approaches me but      mademoiselle say i what has happened beyond what happens every      day have i been different from what i am on other days       i insist on his leaving the housei am leaving but i have      given no ground of offencepardon me we invite the abbé      and it was he who was wrong to invite the abbé while at the      same time he was receiving me and with me so many other creatures      of my sortcome friend rameau you must beg the abbés      pardoni shall not know what to do with his pardoncome      come all will be rightthey take me by the hand and drag me      towards the abbés chair i look at him with a kind of admiring      wonder for who before ever asked pardon of the abbé all this is      very absurd abbé confess is it not and then i laugh and the      abbé laughs too so that is my forgiveness on that side but i had      next to approach the other and that was a very different thing i      forget exactly how it was that i framed my apologysir here is      the madmanhe has made me suffer too long i wish to hear no      more about himhe is sorryyes i am very sorryit      shall not happen againuntil the first rascali do not      know whether he was in one of those days of illhumour when      mademoiselle herself dreads to go near him or whether he      misunderstood what i said or whether i said something wrong      things were worse than before good heavens does he not know me      does he not know that i am like children and that there are some      circumstances in which i let anything and everything escape me and      then god help me am i not to have a moment of relief why it      would wear out a puppet made of steel to keep pulling the string      from night to morning and from morning to night i must amuse      them of course that is the condition but i must now and then      amuse myself in the midst of these distractions there came into my      head a fatal idea an idea that gave me confidence that inspired      me with pride and insolence it was that they could not do without      me and that i was indispensable       iyes i daresay that you are very useful to them but that      they are still more useful to you you will not find as good a      house every day but they for one madman who falls short will      find a hundred to take his place       hea hundred madmen like me sir philosopher they are not so      common i can tell you flat foolsyes people are harder to      please in folly than in talent or virtue i am a rarity in my own      kind a great rarity now that they have me no longer what are      they doing they find time as heavy as if they were dogs i am an      inexhaustible bagful of impertinences every minute i had some      fantastic notion that made them laugh till they cried i was a      whole bedlam in myself       iwell at any rate you had bed and board coat and breeches      shoes and a pistole a month       hethat is the profit side of the account you say not a word      of the cost of it all first if there was a whisper of a new piece      no matter how bad the weather one had to ransack all the garrets      in paris until one had found the author then to get a reading of      the play and adroitly to insinuate that there was a part in it      which would be rendered in a superior manner by a certain person of      my acquaintanceand by whom if you pleaseby whom a pretty      question there are graces finesse eleganceah you mean      mademoiselle dangeville perhaps you know heryes a little      but tis not shewho is it theni whispered the name very      low sheyes she i repeated with some shame for sometimes      i do feel a touch of shame and at this name you should have seen      how long the poets face grew if indeed he did not burst out      laughing in my face still whether he would or not i was bound to      take my man to dine and he being naturally afraid of pledging      himself drew back and tried to say no thank you you should      have seen how i was treated if i did not succeed in my      negotiation i was a blockhead a fool a rascal i was not good      for a single thing i was not worth the glass of water which they      gave me to drink it was still worse at their performance when i      had to go intrepidly amid the cries of a public that has a good      judgment of its own whatever may be said about it and make my      solitary clap of the hand audible draw every eye to me and      sometimes save the actress from hisses and hear people murmur      around mehe is one of the valets in disguise belonging to the      man who will that knave be quiet they do not know what brings      a man to that they think it is stupidity but there is one motive      that excuses anything       ieven the infraction of the civil laws       heat length however i became known and people used to say      oh it is rameau my resource was to throw out some words of      irony to save my solitary applause from ridicule by making them      interpret it in an opposite sense       now agree that one must have a mighty interest to make one thus      brave the assembled public and that each of these pieces of hard      labour was worth more than a paltry crown and then at home there      was a pack of dogs to tend and cats for which i was responsible i      was only too happy if micou favoured me with a stroke of his claw      that tore my cuff or my wrist criquette is liable to colic tis i      who have to rub her in old days mademoiselle used to have the      vapours today it is her nerves she is beginning to grow a      little stout you should hear the fine tales they make out of this       iyou do not belong to people of this sort at any rate       hewhy not       ibecause it is indecent to throw ridicule on ones      benefactors       hebut is it not worse still to take advantage of ones      benefits to degrade the receiver of them       ibut if the receiver of them were not vile in himself nothing      would give the benefactor the chance       hebut if the personages were not ridiculous in themselves they      would not make subjects for good tales and then is it my fault if      they mix with rascaldom is it my fault if after mixing themselves      up with rascaldom they are betrayed and made fools of when people      resolve to live with people like us if they have common sense      there is an infinite quantity of blackness for which they must make      up their minds when they take us do they not know us for what we      are for the most interested vile and perfidious of souls then      if they know us all is well there is a tacit compact that they      shall treat us well and that sooner or later we shall treat them      ill in return for the good that they have done us does not such an      agreement subsist between a man and his monkey or his parrot if      you take a young provincial to the menagerie at versailles and he      takes it into his head for a freak to push his hands between the      bars of the cage of the tiger or the panther whose fault is it it      is all written in the silent compact and so much the worse for the      man who forgets or ignores it how i could justify by this      universal and sacred compact the people whom you accuse of      wickedness whereas it is in truth yourselves whom you ought to      accuse of folly but while we execute the just decrees of      providence on folly you who paint us as we are you execute its      just decrees on us what would you think of us if we claimed with      our shameless manners to enjoy public consideration that we are      out of our senses and those who look for decent behaviour from      people who are born vicious and with vile and bad charactersare      they in their senses everything has its true wages in this world      there are two public prosecutors one at your door chastising      offences against society nature is the other nature knows all the      vices that escape the laws give yourself up to debauchery and you      will end with dropsy if you are crapulous your lungs will find      you out if you open your door to ragamuffins and live in their      company you will be betrayed laughed at despised the shortest      way is to resign ones self to the equity of these judgments and      to say to ones self that is as it should be to shake ones ears      and turn over a new leaf or else to remain what one is but on the      conditions aforesaid       iyou cannot doubt what judgment i pass on such a character as      yours       henot at all i am in your eyes an abject and most despicable      creature and i am sometimes the same in my own eyes though not      often i more frequently congratulate myself on my vices than blame      myself for them you are more constant in your contempt       itrue but why show me all your turpitude       hefirst because you already know a good deal of it and i saw      that there was more to gain than to lose by confessing the rest       ihow so if you please       heit is important in some lines of business to reach      sublimity it is especially so in evil people spit upon a small      rogue but they cannot refuse a kind of consideration to a great      criminal his courage amazes you his atrocity makes you shudder      in all things what people prize is unity of character       ibut this estimable unity of character you have not quite got      i find you from time to time vacillating in your principles it is      uncertain whether you get your wickedness from nature or study and      whether study has brought you as far as possible       hei agree with you but i have done my best have i not had      the modesty to recognise persons more perfect in my own line than      myself have i not spoken to you of bouret with the deepest      admiration bouret is the first person in the world for me       ibut after bouret you come       heno       ipalissot then       hepalissot but not palissot alone       iand who is worthy to share the second rank with him       hethe renegade of avignon       ii never heard of the renegade of avignon but he must be an      astonishing man       hehe is so indeed       ithe history of great personages has always interested me       hei can well believe it this hero lived in the house of a      good and worthy descendant of abraham promised to the father of      the faithful in number equal to the stars in the heavens       iin the house of a jew       hein the house of a jew he had at first surprised pity then      goodwill then entire confidence for that is how it always      happens we count so strongly on our kindness that we seldom hide      our secrets from anybody on whom we have heaped benefits how      should there not be ingrates in the world when we expose this man      to the temptation of being ungrateful with impunity that is a just      reflection which our jew failed to make he confided to the      renegade that he could not conscientiously eat pork you will see      the advantage that a fertile wit knew how to get from such a      confession some months passed during which our renegade redoubled      his attentions when he believed his jew thoroughly touched      thoroughly captivated thoroughly convinced that he had no better      friend among all the tribes of israel  now admire the      circumspection of the man he is in no hurry he lets the pear      ripen before he shakes the branch too much haste might have      ruined his design it is because greatness of character usually      results from the natural balance between several opposite      qualities       ipray leave your reflections and go straight on with your      story       hethat is impossible there are days when i cannot help      reflecting tis a malady that must be allowed to run its course      where was i       iat the intimacy that had been established between the jew and      the renegade       hethen the pear was ripe but you are not listening what      are you dreaming about       ii am thinking of the curious inequality in your tone now so      high now so low       hehow can a man made of vices be one and the same he      reaches his friends house one night with an air of violent      perturbation with broken accents a face as pale as death and      trembling in every limb what is the matter with youwe are      ruined ruined howruined i tell you beyond all      helpexplainone moment until i have recovered from my      frightcome then recover yourself says the jew a      traitor has informed against us before the holy inquisition you as      a jew me as a renegade an infamous renegade mark how the      traitor does not blush to use the most odious expressions it needs      more courage than you may suppose to call ones self by ones right      name you do not know what an effort it costs to come to that       ino i daresay not but the infamous renegade       hehe is false but his falsity is adroit enough the jew takes      fright tears his beard rolls on the ground sees the officers at      his door sees himself clad in the sanbenito sees his      autodafè all made ready my friend he cries my good      tender friend my only friend what is to be done       what is to be done why show ourselves affect the greatest      security go about our business just as we usually do the      procedure of the tribunal is secret but slow we must take      advantage of its delays to sell all you have i will hire a boat      or i will have it hired by a third personthat will be best in it      we will deposit your fortune for it is your fortune that they are      most anxious to get at and then we will go you and i and seek      under another sky the freedom of serving our god and following in      security the law of abraham and our own consciences the important      point in our present dangerous situation is to do nothing      imprudent       no sooner said than done the vessel is hired victualled and      manned the jews fortune put on board on the morrow at dawn      they are to sail they are free to sup gaily and to sleep in all      security on the morrow they escape their prosecutors in the      night the renegade gets up despoils the jew of his portfolio his      purse his jewels goes on board and sails away and you think      that this is all good you are not awake to it now when they told      me the story i divined at once what i have not told you in order      to try your sagacity you were quite right to be an honest man you      would never have made more than a fifthrate scoundrel up to this      point the renegade is only that he is a contemptible rascal whom      nobody would consent to resemble the sublimity of his wickedness      is this that he was himself the informer against his good friend      the israelite of whom the inquisition took hold when he awoke the      next morning and of whom a few days later they made a famous      bonfire and it was in this way that the renegade became the      tranquil possessor of the fortune of the accursed descendant of      those who crucified our lord       ii do not know which of the two is most horrible to methe      vileness of your renegade or the tone in which you speak of it       heand that is what i said the atrocity of the action carries      you beyond contempt and hence my sincerity i wished you to know      to what a degree i excelled in my art to extort from you the      admission that i was at least original in my abasement to rank me      in your mind on the line of the great goodfornoughts and to hail      me henceforthvivat mascarillus fourbum imperator  here the discussion is turned aside by rameaus pantomimic performance of a fugue to various topics in music224      224 vol v pp 457468       ihow does it happen that with such fine tact such great      sensibility for the beauties of the musical art you are so blind      to the fine things of morality so insensible to the charms of      virtue       heit must be because there is for the one a sense that i have      not got a fibre that has not been given to me a slack string that      you may play upon as much as you please but it never vibrates or      it may be because i have always lived with those who were good      musicians but bad men whence it has come to pass that my ear has      grown very fine and my heart has grown very deaf and then there      is something in race the blood of my father and the blood of my      uncle is the same blood my blood is the same as that of my father      the paternal molecule was hard and obtuse and that accursed first      molecule has assimilated to itself all the rest       ido you love your child       hedo i love it the little savage i dote on it       iwill you not then seriously set to work to arrest in it the      consequences of the accursed paternal molecule       hei shall labour in vain i fancy if he is destined to grow      into a good man i shall not hurt him but if the molecule meant      him for a neerdowell like his father then all the pains that i      might have taken to make a decent man of him would only be very      hurtful to him education incessantly crossing the inclination of      the molecule he would be drawn as it were by two contrary forces      and would walk in zigzags along the path of life as i see an      infinity of other people doing equally awkward in good and evil      these are what we call espèces of all epithets the most to be      dreaded because it marks mediocrity and the very lowest degree of      contempt a great scoundrel is a great scoundrel but he is not an      espèce before the paternal molecule had got the upper hand and      had brought him to the perfect abjection at which i have arrived      it would take endless time and he would lose his best years i do      not meddle at present i let him come on i examine him he is      already greedy cunning idle lying and a cheat im much afraid      that he is a chip of the old block       iand you will make him a musician so that the likeness may be      exact       hea musician sometimes i look at him and grind my teeth      saying if thou wert ever to know a note of music i believe i      would wring thy neck       iand why so if you please       hemusic leads to nothing       iit leads to everything       heyes when people are firstrate but who can promise himself      that his child shall be firstrate the odds are ten thousand to      one that he will never be anything but a wretched scraper of      catgut are you aware that it would perhaps be easier to find a      child fit to govern a realm fit to be a great king than one fit      for a great violin player       iit seems to me that agreeable talents even if they are      mediocre among a people who are without morals and are lost in      debauchery and luxury get a man rapidly on in the path of fortune       heno doubt gold and gold gold is everything and all the      rest without gold is nothing so instead of cramming his head with      fine maxims which he would have to forget on pain of remaining a      beggar all the days of his life what i do is this when i have a      louis which does not happen to me often i plant myself in front      of him i pull the louis out of my pocket i show it to him with      signs of admiration i raise my eyes to heaven i kiss the louis      before him and to make him understand still better the importance      of the sacred coin i point to him with my finger all that he can      get with it a fine frock a pretty cap a rich cake then i thrust      the louis into my pocket i walk proudly up and down i raise the      lappet of my waistcoat i strike my fob and in that way i make him      see that it is the louis in it that gives me all this assurance       inothing could be better but suppose it were to come to pass      that being so profoundly penetrated by the value of the louis he      were one day       hei understand you one must close ones eyes to that there      is no moral principle without its own inconvenience at the worst      tis a bad quarter of an hour and then all is over       ieven after hearing views so wise and so bold i persist in      thinking that it would be good to make a musician of him i know no      other means of getting so rapidly near great people of serving      their vices better or turning your own to more advantage       hethat is true but i have plans for a speedier and surer      success ah if it were only a girl but as we cannot do all that      we should like we must take what comes and make the best of it      and not be such idiots as most fathers who could literally do      nothing worse supposing them to have deliberately planned the      misery of their childrennamely give the education of lacedæmon      to a child who is destined to live in paris if the education is      bad the morals of my country are to blame for that not i answer      for it who may i wish my son to be happy or what is the same      thing rich honoured and powerful i know something about the      easiest ways of reaching this end and i will teach them to him      betimes if you blame me you sages the multitude and success      will acquit me he will put money in his purse i can tell you if      he has plenty of that he will lack nothing else not even your      esteem and respect       iyou may be mistaken       hethen perhaps he will do very well without it like many      other people                                                 there was in all this a good deal of what passes through many      peoples minds and much of the principle according to which they      shape their own conduct but they never talk about it there in      short is the most marked difference between my man and most of      those about us he avowed the vices that he had and that others      have but he was no hypocrite he was neither more nor less      abominable than they he was only more frank and more consistent      and sometimes he was profound in the midst of his depravity i      trembled to think what his child might become under such a master      it is certain that after ideas of bringingup so strictly traced      on the pattern of our manners he must go far unless prematurely      stopped on the road       heoh fear nothing the important point the difficult point      to which a good father ought to attend before everything else is      not to give to his child vices that enrich or comical tricks such      as make him valuable to people of qualityall the world does that      if not on system as i do at least by example and precept the      important thing is to impress on him the just proportion the art      of keeping out of disgrace and the arm of the law there are      certain discords in the social harmony that you must know exactly      how to place to prepare and to hold nothing so tame as a      succession of perfect chords there needs something that      stimulates that resolves the beam and scatters its rays       iquite so by your image you bring me back from morals to      music and i am very glad for to be quite frank with you i      like you better as musician than as moralist       heyet i am a mere subaltern in music and a really superior      figure in morals       ii doubt that but even if it were so i am an honest man and      your principles are not mine       heso much the worse for you ah if i only had your talents       inever mind my talents let us return to yours       heif i could only express myself like you but i have an      infernally absurd jargonhalf the language of men of the world and      of letters half of billingsgate       inay i am a poor talker enough i only know how to speak the      truth and that does not always answer as you know       hebut it is not for speaking the truthon the contrary it is      for skilful lying that i covet your gift if i knew how to write      to cook up a book to turn a dedicatory epistle to intoxicate a      fool as to his own merits to insinuate myself into the good graces      of women       iand you do know all that a thousand times better than i i      should not be worthy to be so much as your pupil       hehow many great qualities lost of which you do not know the      price       ii get the price that i ask       heif that were true you would not be wearing that common      suit that rough waistcoat those worsted stockings those thick      shoes that ancient wig       ii grant that a man must be very maladroit not to be rich if      he sticks at nothing in order to become rich but the odd thing is      that there are people like me who do not look on riches as the most      precious thing in the world bizarre people you know       hebizarre enough a man is not born with such a twist as that      he takes the trouble to give it to himself for it is not in      nature       iin the nature of man       heno for everything that lives without exception seeks its      own wellbeing at the expense of any prey that is proper to its      purpose and i am perfectly sure that if i let my little savage      grow up without saying a word to him on the matter he would wish      to be richly clad sumptuously fed cherished by men loved by      women and to heap upon himself all the happiness of life       iif your little savage were left to himself let him only      preserve all his imbecility and add to the scanty reason of the      child in the cradle the violent passions of a man of thirtywhy he      would strangle his father and dishonour his own mother       hethat proves the necessity of a good education and who      denies it and what is a good education but one that leads to all      sorts of enjoyments without danger and without inconvenience       ii am not so far from your opinion only let us keep clear of      explanations       hewhy       ibecause i am afraid that we only agree in appearance and      that if we once begin to discuss what are the dangers and the      inconveniences to avoid we should cease to understand one another       hewhat of that       ilet us leave all this i tell you what i know about it i      shall never get you to learn and you will more easily teach me      what i do not know and you do know in music let us talk about      music dear rameau and tell me how it has come about that with the      faculty for feeling retaining and rendering the finest passages      in the great masters with the enthusiasm that they inspire in you      and that you transmit to others you have done nothing that is      worth       instead of answering me he shrugged his shoulders and pointing to      the sky with his finger he cried the star the star when nature      made leo vinci pergolese duni she smiled she put on a grave      and imposing air in shaping my dear uncle rameau who for half a      score years they will have called the great rameau and of whom      very soon nobody will say a word when she tricked up his nephew      she made a grimace and a grimace and again a grimace and as he      said this he put on all sorts of odd expressions contempt      disdain irony and he seemed to be kneading between his fingers a      piece of paste and to be smiling at the ridiculous shapes that he      gave it that done he flung the incongruous pagod225 away from      him and said it was thus she made me and flung me by the side      of the other pagods some with huge wrinkled paunches and short      necks and great eyes projecting out of their heads stamped with      apoplexy others with wry necks some again with wizened faces      keen eyes hooked noses all were ready to split with laughing when      they espied me and i put my hands to my sides and split with      laughter when i espied them for fools and madmen tickle one      another they seek and attract one another if when i got among      them i had not found readymade the proverb about the money of      fools being the patrimony of people with wits they would have      been indebted to me for it i felt that nature had put my lawful      inheritance into the purses of the pagods and i devised a thousand      means of recovering my rights      225 these little china images of gods with nodding heads were     then a fashionable toy in paris       iyes i know all about your thousand means you have told me      of them and i have admired them vastly but with so many      resources why not have tried that of a fine work       hewhen i am alone i take up my pen and intend to write i bite      my nails and rub my brow your humble servant goodbye the god is      absent i had convinced myself that i had genius at the end of the      time i discover that i am a fool a fool and nothing but a fool      but how is one to feel to think to rise to heights to paint in      strong colours while haunting with such creatures as those whom      one must see if one is to live in the midst of such talk as one      has to make and to hear and such idle gossip how charming the      boulevard was today have you heard the little marmotte her      playing is ravishing mr soandso had the handsomest pair of      grays in his carriage that you can possibly imagine the      beautiful mrs soandso is beginning to fade who at the age of      fiveandforty would wear a headdress like that young      suchandsuch is covered with diamonds and she gets them cheap       you mean she gets them dear       no i do not       where did you see her       at the play       the scene of despair was played as it had never been played      before the polichinelle of the fair has a voice but no      delicacy no soul madame soandso has produced two at a birth      each father will have his own child and yet you suppose that      this kind of thing said and said again and listened to every day      of the week sets the soul aglow and leads to mighty things       inay it were better to turn the key of ones garret drink      cold water eat dry bread and seek ones true self       hemaybe but i have not the courage and then the idea of      sacrificing ones happiness for the sake of a success that is      doubtful and the name that i bear rameau it is not with talents      as it is with nobility nobility transmits itself and increases in      lustre by passing from grandfather to father and from father to      son and from son to grandson without the ancestor impressing a      spark of merit on his descendant the old stock ramifies into an      enormous crop of fools but what matter it is not so with talents      merely to obtain the renown of your father you must be cleverer      than he was you must have inherited his fibre the fibre has      failed me but the wrist is nimble the fiddlebow scrapes away      and the pot boils if there is not glory there is broth       iif i were in your place i would not take it for granted i      would try whatever it be that a man applies himself to nature      meant him for it       heshe makes mighty blunders for my part i do not look down      from heights whence all seems confused and blurredthe man who      prunes a tree with his knife all one with the caterpillar who      devours its leaf a couple of insects each at his proper task do      you if you choose perch

always to appetite that i come back and to the      sensation that is ever present to methen i find that it is by no      means consistent with good order not to have always something to      eat what a precious economy of things men who are overcrammed      with everything under the sun while others who have a stomach      just as importunate as they a hunger that recurs as regularly as

too heavy to raise myself so high      no sojourn in the fogs for me i look about me and i assume my      postures or i amuse myself with the postures that i see others      taking i am an excellent pantomime as you shall judge                                                 then he set himself to smile to imitate the admirer the      suppliant the fawning complaisant he expects a command

legs exactly straight      he listens he seeks to read their faces and then he addsthat      is my pantomime very much the same as that of all flatterers      courtiers valets and beggars       the buffooneries of this man the stories of the abbé galiani the      extravagances of rabelais have sometimes thrown me into profound      reveries they are three stores whence i have provided myself with      ridiculous masks that i place on the faces of the gravest      personages and i see pantaloon in a prelate a satyr in a      president a pig in a monk an ostrich in a minister a goose in      his first clerk                                                 ibut according to your account i said to my man there are      plenty of beggars in the world and yet i know nobody who is not

said on that for do      you suppose that one may not from time to time find even by the      side of him a dainty foot a pretty neck a bewitching nose that      makes him execute his pantomime whoever has need of another is      indigent and assumes a posture the king postures before his      mistress and before god he treads his pantomimic measure the      minister dances the step of courtier flatterer valet and beggar      before his king the crowd of the ambitious cut a hundred capers      each viler than the rest before the minister the abbé with his      bands and long cloak postures at least once a week before the      patron of livings on my word what you call the pantomime of      beggars is only the whole huge bustle of the earth       hebut let us bethink ourselves
