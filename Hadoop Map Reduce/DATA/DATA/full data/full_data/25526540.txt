25526540	a modern instance  by  william dean howells     introduction  mr howells has written a long series of poems novels sketches stories and essays and has been perhaps the most continuous worker in the literary art among american writers he was born at martins perry belmont county ohio march 1 1837 and the experiences of his early life have been delightfully told by himself in a boys town my year in a log cabin and my literary passions these books which seem like pastimes in the midst of howellss serious work are likely to live long not only as playful autobiographic records but as vivid pictures of life in the middle west in the middle of the nineteenth century the boy lived in a home where frugality was the law of economy but where high ideals of noble living were cheerfully maintained and the very occupations of the household tended to stimulate literary activity he read voraciously and with an instinctive scent for what was great and permanent in literature and in his fathers printingoffice learned to set type and soon to make contributions to the local journals he went to the state capitol to report the proceedings of the legislature and before he was twentytwo had become news editor of the state journal of columbus ohio  but at the same time he had given clear intimations of his literary skill and had contributed several poems to the atlantic monthly his introduction to literature was in the stirring days just before the war for the union and he had a generous enthusiasm for the great principles which were then at stake yet the political leaven chiefly caused the bread he was baking to rise and his native genius was distinctly for work in creative literature his contribution to the political writing of the day besides his newspaper work was a small campaign life of lincoln and shortly after the incoming of the first republican administration he received the appointment of consul at venice  at venice he remained from 1861 to 1865 and these years may fairly be taken as standing for his university training he carried with him to europe some conversance with french german spanish and italian and an insatiable thirst for literature in these languages naturally now he concentrated his attention on the italian language and literature but after all he was not made for a microscopic or encyclopaedic scholar least of all for a pedant what he was looking for in literature though he scarcely so stated it to himself at the time was human life and it was this firsthand acquaintance he was acquiring with life in another circumstance that constituted his real training in literature to pass from ohio straight to italy with the merest alighting by the way in new york and boston was to be transported from one world to another but he carried with him a mind which had already become naturalized in the large world of history and men through the literature in which he had steeped his mind no one can read the record of the books he had revelled in and observe the agility with which he was absorbed successively in books of greatly varying character without perceiving how wide open were the windows of his mind and as the light streamed in from all these heavens so the inmate looked out with unaffected interest on the views spread before him  thus it was that italy and venice in particular afforded him at once the greatest delight and also the surest test of his growing power the swift observation he had shown in literature became an equally rapid survey of all these novel forms before him the old life embedded in this historic country became the book whose leaves he turned but he looked with the greatest interest and most sympathetic scrutiny on that which passed before his eyes it was novel it was quaint it was filled with curious unexpected betrayals of human nature but it was above all real actual a thing to be touched and as it were fondled by hands that were deft by nature and were quickly becoming more skilful by use mr howells began to write letters home which were printed in the boston daily advertiser and grew easily into a book which still remains in the minds of many of his readers the freshest of all his writings venetian life this was followed shortly by italian journeys in which mr howells gathered his observations made in going from place to place in italy a good many years later after returning to the country of his affection he wrote a third book of a similar character under the title of tuscan cities but his use of italy in literature was not confined to books of travels he made and published studies of italian literature and he wove the life of the country into fiction in a charming manner illustrations may be found in a foregone conclusion one of the happiest of his novels whose scene is laid in venice in the lady of the aroostook and in many slight sketches  when mr howells returned to america at the close of his term as consul he found warm friends whom he had made through his writings he served for a short time on the staff of the nation of new york and then was invited to boston to take the position of assistant editor of the atlantic monthly under mr fields this was in 1866 and five years later on the retirement of mr fields he became editor and remained in the position until 1881 living during this period in cambridge he was not only editor of the magazine he was really its chief contributor any one who takes the trouble to examine the pages of the atlantic index will see how far his work outnumbers in titles that of all other contributors and the range of his work was great  he wrote a large proportion of the reviews of books which in those days constituted a marked feature of the magazine these reviews were conscientiously written and showed penetration and justice but they had besides a felicitous and playful touch which rendered them delightful reading even though one knew little or cared little for the book reviewed sometimes though not often he wrote poems but readers soon learned to look with eagerness for a kind of writing which seemed almost more individual with him than any other form of writing we mean the humorous sketches of everyday life in which he took scenes of the commonest sort and drew from them an inherent life which most never suspected yet confessed the moment he disclosed it he would do such a commonplace thing as take an excursion down the harbor or even a ride to town in a horsecar and come back to turn his experience into a piece of genuine literature a number of these pieces were collected into a volume entitled suburban sketches  it is interesting to observe how slowly yet surely mr howells drew near the great field of novelwriting and how deliberately he laid the foundations of his art first the graceful sketch which was hardly more than a leaf out of his notebook then the blending of travel with characterdrawing as in a chance acquaintance and their wedding journey and later stories of people who moved about and thus found the incidents which the author had not to invent as in the lady of the aroostook meanwhile the eye which had taken note of surface effects was beginning to look deeper into the springs of being and the hand which had described was beginning to model figures also which stood alone  so there followed a number of little dramatic sketches where the persons of the drama carried on their little play and since they were not on a stage before the spectator the author constructed a sort of literary stage for the reader that is to say he supplied by paragraphs what in a regular play would be stage directions this is seen in such little comedies as a counterfeit presentment which indeed was put on the stage but instead of pushing forward on this line into the field of great drama mr howells contented himself with dexterous strokes with a fine pen so to speak and created a number of sparkling farces like the parlor car  the real issue of all this practice in the dramatic art was to disengage the characters he created from too close dependence on the kind of circumstance as of travel which the author did not invent and to give them substantial life in the working out of the drama of their spiritual evolution thus by the time he was released from editorial work mr howells was ready for the thoroughgoing novel and he gave to readers such examples of art as a modern instance the rise of silas lapham and that most important of all his novels a hazard of new fortunes by the time this last novel was written he had become thoroughly interested not merely in the men women and children about him but in that mysterious complex order named by us society with its roots matted together as in a swamp and seeming to many to be sucking up maleficent miasmatic vapors from the soil in which it was rooted like many another lover of his kind he has sought to trace the evils of individual life to their source in this composite order and to guess at the mode by which society shall right itself and drink up healthy and lifegiving virtues from the soil  but it must not be inferred that his novels and other literary work have been by any means exclusively concerned with the reconstruction of the social order he has indeed experimented with this theme but he has always had a sane interest in life as he sees it and with the increasing scope of his observation he has drawn his figures from a larger world which includes indeed the world in which he first began to find his characters and their action  not long after retiring from the atlantic he went to live in new york and varied his american experience with frequent travels and continued residence in europe for a while he maintained a department in harpers magazine where he gave expression to his views on literature and the dramatic art and for a short period returned to the editorial life in conducting the cosmopolitan later he entered also the field of lecturing and thus further extended the range of his observation for many years mr howells was the writer of editors easy chair in harpers magazine in 1909 he was made president of the american academy of arts and letters mr howellss death occurred may 11 1920  this in fine is the most summary statement of his career in literaturethat he has been a keen and sympathetic observer of life and has caught its character not like a reporter going about with a kodak and snapping it aimlessly at any conspicuous object but like an alert artist who goes back to his studio after a walk and sets down his comments on what he has seen in quick accurate sketches now and then resolving numberless undrawn sketches into some one comprehensive and beautiful picture     the sequence of mr howellss

mountains they were green to their tops in summer and in winter white through their serried pines and drifting mists but at every season serious and beautiful furrowed with hollow shadows and taking the light on masses and stretches of irongray crag the river swam through the plain in long curves and slipped away at last through an unseen pass to the southward tracing a score of miles in its course over a space that measured but three or four the plain was very fertile and its features if few and of purely utilitarian beauty had a rich luxuriance and there was a tropical riot of vegetation when the sun of july beat on those northern fields they waved with corn and oats to the feet of the mountains and the potatoes covered a vast acreage with the lines of their intense coarse green the meadows were deep with english grass to the banks of the river that doubling and returning upon itself still marked its way with a dense fringe of alders and white birches  but winter was full half the year the snow began at thanksgiving and fell snow upon snow till fast day thawing between the storms and packing harder and harder against the breakup in the spring when it covered the ground in solid levels three feet high and lay heaped in drifts that defied the sun far into may when it did not snow the weather was keenly clear and commonly very still then the landscape at noon had a stereoscopic glister under the high sun that burned in a heaven without a cloud and at setting stained the sky and the white waste with freezing pink and violet on such days the farmers and lumbermen came in to the village stores and made a stiff and feeble stir about their doorways and the school children gave the street a little life and color as they went to and from the academy in their red and blue woollens four times a day the mill the shrill wheeze of whose saws had become part of the habitual silence blew its whistle for the hands to begin and leave off work in blasts that seemed to shatter themselves against the thin air but otherwise an arctic quiet prevailed  behind the black boles of the elms that swept the vista of the street with the fine gray tracery of their boughs stood the houses deepsunken in the accumulating drifts through which each householder kept a path cut from his doorway to the road white and clean as if hewn out of marble some cross streets straggled away east and west with the poorer dwellings but this that followed the northward and southward reach of the plain was the main thoroughfare and had its own impressiveness with those square white houses which they build so large in northern new england they were all kept in scrupulous repair though here and there the frost and thaw of many winters had heaved a fence out of plumb and threatened the poise of the monumental urns of painted pine on the gateposts they had darkgreen blinds of a color harmonious with that of the funereal evergreens in their dooryards and they themselves had taken the tone of the snowy landscape as if by the operation of some such law as blanches the furbearing animals of the north they seemed proper to its desolation while some houses of more modern taste painted to a warmer tone looked with their mansard roofs and jigsawed piazzas and balconies intrusive and alien  at one end of the street stood the academy with its classic façade and its belfry midway was the hotel with the stores the printingoffice and the churches and at the other extreme one of the square white mansions stood advanced from the rank of the rest at the top of a deepplunging valley defining itself against the mountain beyond so sharply that it seemed as if cut out of its dark wooded side it was from the gate before this house distinct in the pink light which the sunset had left that on a saturday evening in february a cutter gay with redlined robes dashed away and came musically clashing down the street under the naked elms for the women who sat with their work at the windows on either side of the way hesitating whether to light their lamps and drawing nearer and nearer to the deadline of the outer cold for the latest glimmer of the day the passage of this illtimed vehicle was a vexation little short of grievous every movement on the street was precious to them and with all the keenness of their starved curiosity these captives of the winter could not make out the people in the cutter afterward it was a mortification to them that they should not have thought at once of bartley hubbard and marcia gaylord they had seen him go up toward squire gaylords house half an hour before and they now blamed themselves for not reflecting that of course he was going to take marcia over to the church sociable at lower equity their identity being established other little proofs of it reproached the inquirers but these perturbed spirits were at peace and the lamps were out in the houses where the smell of rats in the wainscot and of potatoes in the cellar strengthened with the growing night when bartley and marcia drove back through the moonlit silence to her fathers door here too the windows were all dark except for the light that sparely glimmered through the parlor blinds and the young man slackened the pace of his horse as if to still the bells some distance away from the gate  the girl took the hand he offered her when he dismounted at the gate and as she jumped from the cutter wont you come in she asked  i guess i can blanket my horse and stand him under the woodshed answered the young man going around to the animals head and leading him away  when he returned to the door the girl opened it as if she had been listening for his step and she now stood holding it ajar for him to enter and throwing the light upon the threshold from the lamp which she lifted high in the other hand the action brought her figure in relief and revealed the outline of her bust and shoulders while the lamp flooded with light the face she turned to him and again averted for a moment as if startled at some noise behind her she thus showed a smooth low forehead lips and cheeks deeply red a softly rounded chin touched with a faint dimple and in turn a nose short and aquiline her eyes were dark and her dusky hair flowed crinkling above her fine black brows and vanished down the curve of a lovely neck there was a peculiar charm in the form of her upper lip it was exquisitely arched and at the corners it projected a little over the lower lip so that when she smiled it gave a piquant sweetness to her mouth with a certain demure innocence that qualified the roman pride of her profile for the rest her beauty was of the kind that coming years would only ripen and enrich at thirty she would be even handsomer than at twenty and be all the more southern in her type for the paling of that northern color in her cheeks the young man who looked up at her from the doorstep had a yellow mustache shadowing either side of his lip with a broad sweep like a birds wing his chin deepcut below his mouth failed to come strenuously forward his cheeks were filled to an oval contour and his face had otherwise the regularity common to americans his eyes a clouded gray heavylidded and longlashed were his most striking feature and he gave her beauty a deliberate look from them as he lightly stamped the snow from his feet and pulled the sealskin gloves from his long hands  come in she whispered coloring with pleasure under his gaze and she made haste to shut the door after him with a luxurious impatience of the cold she led the way into the room from which she had come and set down the lamp on the corner of the piano while he slipped off his overcoat and swung it over the end of the sofa they drew up chairs to the stove in which the smouldering fire revived by the opened draft roared and snapped it was midnight as the sharp strokes of a wooden clock declared from the kitchen and they were alone together and all the other inmates of the house were asleep the situation scarcely conceivable to another civilization is so common in ours where youth commands its fate and trusts solely to itself that it may be said to be characteristic of the new england civilization wherever it keeps its simplicity it was not stolen or clandestine it would have interested every one but would have shocked no one in the village if the whole village had known it all that a girls parents ordinarily exacted was that they should not be waked up  ugh said the girl it seems as if i never should get warm she leaned forward and stretched her hands toward the stove and he presently rose from the rockingchair in which he sat somewhat lower than she and lifted her sack to throw it over her shoulders but he put it down and took up his overcoat  allow my coat the pleasure he said with the ease of a man who is not too far lost to be really flattering  much obliged to the coat she replied shrugging herself into it and pulling the collar close about her throat i wonder you didnt put it on the sorrel you could have tied the sleeves around her neck  shall i tie them around yours he leaned forward from the low rockingchair into which he had sunk again and made a feint at what he had proposed  but she drew back with a gay no and added some day father says that sorrel will be the death of us he says its a bad color for a horse theyre always ugly and when they get heated theyre crazy  you never seem to be very much frightened when youre riding after the sorrel said bartley  oh ive great faith in your driving  thanks but i dont believe in this notion about a horse being vicious because hes of a certain color if your father didnt believe in it i should call it a superstition but the squire has no superstitions  i dont know about that said the girl i dont think he likes to see the new moon over his left shoulder  i beg his pardon then returned bartley i ought to have said religions the squire has no religions the young fellow had a rich caressing voice and a securely winning manner which comes from the habit of easily pleasing in this charming tone and with this delightful insinuation he often said things that hurt but with such a humorous glance from his softly shaded eyes that people felt in some sort flattered at being taken into the joke even while they winced under it the girl seemed to wince as if in spite of her familiarity with the fact it wounded her to have her fathers scepticism recognized just then she said nothing and he added i remember we used to think that a redheaded boy was worsetempered on account of his hair but i dont believe the sorreltops as we called them were any more fiery than the rest of us  marcia did not answer at once and then she said with the vagueness of one not greatly interested by the subject youve got a sorreltop in your office thats fiery enough if shes anything like what she used to be when she went to school  hannah morrison  yes  oh she isnt so bad shes pretty lively but shes very eager to learn the business and i guess we shall get along i think she wants to please me  does she but she must be going on seventeen now  i dare say answered the young man carelessly but with perfect intelligence shes goodlooking in her way too  oh then you admire red hair  he perceived the anxiety that the girls pride could not keep out of her tone but he answered indifferently im a little too near that color myself i hear that red hairs coming into fashion but i guess its natural i should prefer black  she leaned back in her chair and crushed the velvet collar of his coat under her neck in lifting her head to stare at the highhung mezzotints and family photographs on the walls while a flattered smile parted her lips and there was a little thrill of joy in her voice i presume we must be a good deal behind the age in everything at equity  well you know my opinion of equity returned the young man if i didnt have you here to free my mind to once in a while i dont know what i should do  she was so proud to be in the secret of his discontent with the narrow world of equity that she tempted him to disparage it further by pretending to identify herself with it i dont see why you abuse equity to me i ve never been anywhere else except those two winters at school youd better look out i might expose you she threatened fondly  im not afraid those two winters make a great difference you saw girls from other placesfrom augusta and bangor and bath  well i couldnt see how they were so very different from equity girls  i dare say they couldnt either if they judged from you  she leaned forward again and begged for more flattery from him with her happy eyes why what does make me so different from all the rest i should really like to know  oh you dont expect me to tell you to your face  yes to my face i dont believe its anything complimentary  no its nothing that you deserve any credit for  pshaw cried the girl i know youre only talking to make fun of me how do i know but you make fun of me to other girls just as you do of them to me everybody says youre sarcastic  have i ever been sarcastic with you  you know i wouldnt stand it  he made no reply but she admired the ease with which he now turned from her and took one book after another from the table at his elbow saying some words of ridicule about each it gave her a still deeper sense of his intellectual command when he finally discriminated and began to read out a poem with studied elocutionary effects he read in a low tone but at last some responsive noises came from the room overhead he closed the book and threw himself into an attitude of deprecation with his eyes cast up to the ceiling  chicago he said laying the book on the table and taking his knee between his hands while he dazzled her by speaking from the abstraction of one who has carried on a train of thought quite different from that on which he seemed to be intentchicago is the place for me i dont think i can stand equity much longer you know that chum of mine i told you about hes written to me to come out there and go into the law with him at once  why dont you go the girl forced herself to ask  oh im not ready yet should you write to me if i went to chicago  i dont think youd find my letters very interesting you wouldnt want any news from equity  your letters wouldnt be interesting if you gave me the equity news but they would if you left it out then youd have to write about yourself  oh i dont think that would interest anybody  well i feel almost like going out to chicago to see  but i havent promised to write yet said the girl laughing for joy in his humor  i shall have to stay in equity till you do then better promise at once  wouldnt that be too much like marrying a man to get rid of him  i dont think thats always such a bad planfor the man he waited for her to speak but she had gone the length of her tether in this direction byron says    mans love is of mans life a thing apart   tis womans whole existence  do you believe that he dwelt upon her with his tree look in the happy embarrassment with which she let her head droop  i dont know she murmured i dont know anything about a mans life  it was the womans i was asking about  i dont think im competent to answer  well ill tell you then i think byron was mistaken my experience is that when a man is in love theres nothing else of him thats the reason ive kept out of it altogether of late years my advice is dont fall in love it takes too much time they both laughed at this but about corresponding now you havent said whether you would write to me or not will you  cant you wait and see she asked slanting a look at him which she could not keep from being fond  no no unless you wrote to me i couldnt go to chicago  perhaps i ought to promise then at once  you mean that you wish me to go  you said that you were going you oughtnt to let anything stand in the way of your doing the best you can for yourself  but you would miss me a little wouldnt you you would try to miss me now and then  oh you are here pretty often i dont think i should have much difficulty in missing you  thanks thanks i can go with a light heart now good by he made a pretence of rising  what are you going at once  yes this very nightor tomorrow or no i cant go tomorrow theres something i was going to do tomorrow  perhaps go to church  oh that of course but it was in the afternoon stop i have it i want you to go sleighriding with me in the afternoon  i dont know about that marcia began  but i do said the young man hold on ill put my request in writing he opened her portfolio which lay on the table what elegant stationery may i use some of this elegant stationery the letter is to a ladyto open a correspondence may i she laughed her assent how ought i to begin dearest miss marcia or just dear marcia which is better  you had better not put either  but i must youre one or the other you know youre dearto your familyand youre marcia you cant deny it the only question is whether youre the dearest of all the miss marcias i may be mistaken you know well err on the safe side dear marcia he wrote it down that looks well and it reads well it looks very natural and it reads like poetryblank verse theres no rhyme for it that i can remember dear marcia will you go sleighriding with me tomorrow afternoon at two oclock sharp yoursyours sincerely or cordially or affectionately or what the dear marcia seems to call for something out of the common i think it had better be affectionately he suggested it with ironical gravity  and i think it had better be truly protested the girl  truly it shall be then your word is lawstatute in such case made and provided he wrote with unutterable devotion yours truly bartley j hubbard and read it aloud  she leaned forward and lightly caught it away from him and made a feint of tearing it he seized her hands mr hubbard she cried in undertone let me go please  on two conditionspromise not to tear up my letter and promise to answer it in writing  she hesitated long letting him hold her wrists at last she said well and he released her wrists on whose whiteness his clasp left red circles she wrote a single word on the paper and pushed it across the table to him he rose with it and went around to her side  this is very nice but you havent spelled it correctly anybody would say this was no to look at it and you meant to write yes take the pencil in your hand miss gaylord and i will steady your trembling nerves so that you can form the characters stop at the slightest resistance on your part i will call out and alarm the house or i will he put the pencil into her fingers and took her soft fist into his and changed the word while she submitted helpless with her smothered laughter now the address dear  no no she protested  yes yes dear mr hubbard there that will do now the signature yours  i wont write that i wont indeed  oh yes you will you only think you wont yours gratefully marcia gaylord thats right the gaylord is not very legible on account of a slight tremor in the writers arm resulting from a constrained posture perhaps thanks miss gaylord i will be here promptly at the hour indicated  the noises renewed themselves overheadsome one seemed to be moving about hubbard laid his hand on that of the girl still resting on the table and grasped it in burlesque alarm she could scarcely stifle her mirth he released her hand and reaching his chair with a theatrical stride sat there cowering till the noises ceased then he began to speak soberly in a low voice he spoke of himself but in application of a lecture which they had lately heard so that he seemed to be speaking of the lecture it was on the formation of character and he told of the processes by which he had formed his own character they appeared very wonderful to her and she marvelled at the ease with which he dismissed the frivolity of his recent mood and was now all seriousness when he came to speak of the influence of others upon him she almost trembled with the intensity of her interest but of all the women i have known marcia he said i believe you have had the strongest influence upon me i believe you could make me do anything but you have always influenced me for good your influence upon me has been ennobling and elevating  she wished to refuse his praise but her heart throbbed for bliss and pride in it her voice dissolved on her lips they sat in silence and he took in his the hand that she let hang over the side of her chair the lamp began to burn low and she found words to say i had better get another but she did not move  no dont he said i must be going too look at the wick there marcia it scarcely reaches the oil in a little while it will not reach it and the flame will die out that is the way the ambition to be good and great will die out of me when my life no longer draws its inspiration from your influence  this figure took her imagination it seemed to her very beautiful and his praise humbled her more and more  good night he said in a low sad voice he gave her hand a last pressure and rose to put on his coat her admiration of his words her happiness in his flattery filled her brain like wine she moved dizzily as she took up the lamp to light him to the door i have tired you he said tenderly and he passed his hand around her to sustain the elbow of the arm with which she held the lamp she wished to resist but she could not try  at the door he bent down his head and kissed her good night dearfriend  good night she panted and after the door had closed upon him she stooped and kissed the knob on which his hand had rested  as she turned she started to see her father coming down the stairs with a candle in his hand he had his black cravat tied around his throat but no collar otherwise he had on the rusty black clothes in which he ordinarily went about his affairsthe cassimere pantaloons the satin vest and the dresscoat which oldfashioned country lawyers still wore ten years ago in preference to a frock or sack he stopped on one of the lower steps and looked sharply down into her uplifted face and as they stood confronted their consanguinity came out in vivid resemblances and contrasts his high hawklike profile was translated into the fine aquiline outline of hers the harsh rings of black hair now grizzled with age which clustered tightly over his head except where they had retreated from his deeply seamed and wrinkled forehead were the crinkled flow above her smooth white brow and the line of the bristly tufts that overhung his eyes was the same as that of the low arches above hers her complexion was from her mother his skin was dusky yellow but they had the same mouth and hers showed how sweet his mouth must have been in his youth his eyes deep sunk in their cavernous sockets had rekindled their dark fires in hers his whole visage softened to her sex and girlish years looked up at him in his daughters face  why father did we wake you  no i hadnt been asleep at all i was coming down to read but its time you were in bed marcia  yes im going now theres a good fire in the parlor stove  the old man descended the remaining steps but turned at the parlor door and looked again at his daughter with a glance that arrested her with her foot on the lowest stair  marcia he asked grimly are you engaged to bartley hubbard  the blood flashed up from her heart into her face like fire and then as suddenly fell back again and left her white she let her head droop and turn till her eyes were wholly averted from him and she did not speak he closed the door behind him and she went upstairs to her own room in her shame she seemed to herself to crawl thither with her fathers glance burning upon her     ii   bartley hubbard drove his sorrel colt back to the hotel stable through the moonlight and woke up the hostler asleep behind the counter on a bunk covered with buffalorobes the halfgrown boy did not wake easily he conceived of the affair as a joke and bade bartley quit his fooling till the young man took him by his collar and stood him on his feet then he fumbled about the button of the lamp turned low and smelling rankly and lit his lantern which contributed a rival stench to the choking air he kicked together the embers that smouldered on the hearth of the franklin stove sitting down before it for his greater convenience and having put a fresh pineroot on the fire fell into a doze with his lantern in his hand look here young man said bartley shaking him by the shoulder you had better go out and put that colt up and leave this sleeping before the fire to me  guess the colt can wait awhile grumbled the boy but he went out all the same and bartley looking through the window saw his lantern wavering a yellow blot in the white moonshine toward the stable he sat down in the hostlers chair and in his turn kicked the pineroot with the heel of his shoe and looked about the room he had had as he would have said a grand good time but it had left him hungry and the table in the middle of the room with the chairs huddled around it was suggestive though he knew that it had been barrenly put there for the convenience of the landlords friends who came every night to play whist with him and that nothing to eat or drink had ever been set out on it to interrupt the austere interest of the game it was long since there had been anything on the shelves behind the counter more cheerful than cornballs and fancy crackers for the children of the summer boarders these dainties being out of season the jars now stood there empty the young man waited in a hungry reverie in which it appeared to him that he was undergoing unmerited suffering till the stableboy came back now wide awake and disposed to let the house share his vigils as he stamped over the floor in his heavy boots  andy said bartley in a pathetic tone of injury cant you scare me up something to eat  there aint anything in the buttery but meatpie said the boy  he meant mincepie as hubbard knew and not a pasty of meat and the hungry man hesitated well fetch it he said finally i guess we can warm it up a little by the coals here  he had not been so long out of college but the idea of this irregular supper when he had once formed it began to have its fascination he took up the broad fireshovel and by the time the boy had shuffled to and from the pantry beyond the diningroom bartley had cleaned the shovel with a piece of newspaper and was already heating it by the embers which he had raked out from under the pineroot the boy silently transferred the halfpie he had brought from its plate to the shovel he pulled up a chair and sat down to watch it the pie began to steam and send out a savory odor he himself in thawing emitted a stronger and stronger smell of stable he was not without his disdain for the palate which must have its mincepie warm at midnightnor without his respect for it either this fastidious taste must be part of the splendor which showed itself in mr hubbards citycut clothes and in his neckscarfs and the perfection of his fingernails and mustache the boy had felt the original impression of these facts deepened rather than effaced by custom they were for every day and not as he had at first conjectured for some great occasion only  you dont suppose andy there is such a thing as cold tea or coffee anywhere that we could warm up asked bartley gazing thoughtfully at the pie  the boy shook his head get you some milk he said and after he had let the dispiriting suggestion sink into the others mind he added or some water  oh bring on the milk groaned bartley but with the relief that a choice of evils affords the boy stumped away for it and when he came back the young man had got his pie on the plate again and had drawn his chair up to the table thanks he said with his mouth full as the boy set down the goblet of milk andy pulled his chair round so as to get an unrestricted view of a man who ate his pie with his fork as easily as another would with a knife that sister of yours is a smart girl the young man added making deliberate progress with the pie  the boy made an inarticulate sound of satisfaction and resolved in his heart to tell her what mr hubbard had said  shes as smart as time continued bartley  this was something concrete the boy knew he should remember that comparison bring you anything else he asked admiring the young mans skill in getting the last flakes of the crust on his fork the pie had now vanished  why there isnt anything else is there bartley demanded with the plaintive dismay of a man who fears he has flung away his hunger upon one dish when he might have had something better  cheese replied the boy  oh said bartley he reflected awhile i suppose i could toast a piece on this fork but there isnt any more milk  the boy took away the plate and goblet and brought them again replenished  bartley contrived to get the cheese on his fork and rest it against one of the andirons so that it would not fall into the ashes when it was done he ate it as he had eaten the pie without offering to share his feast with the boy there he said yes andy if she keeps on as shes been doing she wont have any trouble shes a bright girl he stretched his legs before the fire again and presently yawned  want your lamp mr hubbard asked the boy  well yes andy the young man consented i suppose i may as well go to bed  but when the boy brought his lamp he still remained with outstretched legs in front of the fire speaking of hannah morrison made him think of marcia again and of the way in which she had spoken of the girl he lolled his head on one side in such comfort as a young man finds in the conviction that a pretty girl is not only fond of him but is instantly jealous of any other girl whose name is mentioned he smiled at the flame in his reverie and the boy examined with clandestine minuteness the set and pattern of his trousers with glances of reference and comparison to his own  there were many things about his relations with marcia gaylord which were calculated to give bartley satisfaction she was without question the prettiest girl in the place and she had more style than any other girl began to have he liked to go into a room with marcia gaylord it was some pleasure marcia was a lady she had a good education she had been away two years at school and when she came back at the end of the second winter he knew that she had fallen in love with him at sight he believed that he could time it to a second he remembered how he had looked up at her as he passed and she had reddened and tried to turn away from the window as if she had not seen him bartley was still free as air but if he could once make up his mind to settle down in a hole like equity he could have her by turning his hand of course she had her drawbacks like everybody she was proud and she would be jealous but with all her pride and her distance she had let him see that she liked him and with not a word on his part that any one could hold him to  hollo he cried with a suddenness that startled the boy who had finished his meditation upon bartleys trousers and was now deeply dwelling on his boots do you like em see what sort of a shine you can give em for sundaygotomeeting tomorrow morning he put out his hand and laid hold of the boys head passing his fingers through the thick red hair sorreltop he said with a grin of agreeable reminiscence they emptied all the freckles they had left into your facedidnt they andy  this free joking way of bartleys was one of the things that made him popular he passed the time of day and was give and take right along as his admirers expressed it from the first in a community where his smartness had that honor which gives us more smart men to the square mile than any other country in the world the fact of his smartness had been affirmed and established in the strongest manner by the authorities of the college at which he was graduated in answer to the reference he made to them when negotiating with the committee in charge for the place he now held as editor of the equity free press the faculty spoke of the solidity and variety of his acquirements and the distinction with which he had acquitted himself in every branch of study he had undertaken they added that he deserved the greater credit because his early disadvantages as an orphan dependent on his own exertions for a livelihood had been so great that he had entered college with difficulty and with heavy conditions this turned the scale with a committee who had all been poor boys themselves and justly feared the encroachments of hereditary aristocracy they perhaps had their misgivings when the young man in his wellblacked boots his gray trousers neatly fitting over them and his diagonal coat buttoned high with one button stood before them with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets and looked down over his mustache at the floor with sentiments concerning their wisdom which they could not explore they must have resented the fashionable keeping of everything about him for bartley wore his one suit as if it were but one of many but when they understood that he had come by everything through his own unaided smartness they could no longer hesitate one indeed still felt it a duty to call attention to the fact that the college authorities said nothing of the young mans moral characteristics in a letter dwelling so largely upon his intellectual qualifications the others referred this point by a silent look to squire gaylord  i dont know said the squire as i ever heard that a great deal of morality was required by a newspaper editor the rest laughed at the joke and the squire continued but i guess if he worked his own way through college as they say that he haint had time to be up to a great deal of mischief you know its for idle hands that the devil provides doctor  thats true as far as it goes said the doctor  but it isnt the whole truth the devil provides for some busy hands too  theres a good deal of sense in that the squire admitted the worst scamps i ever knew were active fellows still industry is in a mans favor if the faculty knew anything against this young man they would have given us a hint of it i guess we had better take him we shant do better is it a vote  the good opinion of bartleys smartness which squire gaylord had formed was confirmed some months later by the development of the fact that the young man did not regard his management of the equity free press as a final vocation the story went that he lounged into the lawyers office one saturday afternoon in october and asked him to let him take his blackstone into the woods with him he came back with it a few hours later  well sir said the attorney sardonically how much blackstone have you read  about forty pages answered the young man dropping into one of the empty chairs and hanging his leg over the arm  the lawyer smiled and opening the book asked half a dozen questions at random bartley answered without changing his indifferent countenance or the careless posture he had fallen into a sharper and longer examination followed the very language seemed to have been unbrokenly transferred to his mind and he often gave the authors words as well as his ideas  ever looked at this before asked the lawyer with a keen glance at him over his spectacles  no said bartley gaping as if bored and further relieving his weariness by stretching he was without deference for any presence and the old lawyer did not dislike him for this he had no deference himself  you think of studying law he asked after a pause  thats what i came to ask you about said bartley swinging his leg  the elder recurred to his book and put some more questions then he said do you want to study with me  thats about the size of it  he shut the book and pushed it on the table toward the young man go ahead youll get alongif you dont get along too easily  it was in the spring after this that marcia returned home from her last term at boardingschool and first saw him     iii   bartley woke on sunday morning with the regrets that a supper of mincepie and toasted cheese is apt to bring he woke from a bad dream and found that he had a dull headache a cup of coffee relieved his pain but it left him listless and with a longing for sympathy which he experienced in any mental or physical discomfort the frankness with which he then appealed for compassion was one of the things that made people like him he flung himself upon the pity of the first he met it might be some one to whom he had said a cutting or mortifying thing at their last encounter but bartley did not mind that what he desired was commiseration and he confidingly ignored the past in a trust that had rarely been abused if his sarcasm proved that he was quick and smart his recourse to those who had suffered from it proved that he did not mean anything by what he said it showed that he was a man of warm feelings and that his heart was in the right place  bartley deplored his disagreeable sensations to the other boarders at breakfast and affectionately excused himself to them for not going to church when they turned into the office and gathered there before the franklin stove sensible of the day in freshly shaven chins and newly blacked boots the habit of churchgoing was so strong and universal in equity that even strangers stopping at the hotel found themselves the object of a sort of hospitable competition with the members of the different denominations who took it for granted that they would wish to go somewhere and only suffered them a choice between sects there was no intolerance in their offer of pews but merely a profound expectation and one might continue to choose his place of worship sabbath after sabbath without offence this was bartleys custom and it had worked to his favor rather than his disadvantage for in the rather chaotic liberality into which religious sentiment had fallen in equity it was tacitly conceded that the editor of a paper devoted to the interests of the whole town ought not to be of fixed theological opinions  religion there had largely ceased to be a fact of spiritual experience and the visible church flourished on condition of providing for the social needs of the community it was practically held that the salvation of ones soul must not be made too depressing or the young people would have nothing to do with it professors of the sternest creeds temporized with sinners and did what might be done to win them to heaven by helping them to have a good time here the church embraced and included the world it no longer frowned even upon social dancinga transgression once so heinous in its eyes it opened its doors to popular lectures and encouraged secular music in its basements where during the winter oyster suppers were given in aid of good objects the sunday school was made particularly attractive both to the children and the young men and girls who taught them not only at thanksgiving but at christmas and latterly even at easter there were special observances which the enterprising spirits having the welfare of the church at heart tried to make significant and agreeable to all and promotive of good feeling christenings and marriages in the church were encouraged and elaborately celebrated death alone though treated with cutflowers in emblematic devices refused to lend itself to the cheerful intentions of those who were struggling to render the idea of another and a better world less repulsive in contrast with the relaxation and uncertainty of their doctrinal aim the rude and bold infidelity of old squire gaylord had the greater affinity with the mood of the puritanism they had outgrown but bartley hubbard liked the religious situation well enough he took a leading part in the entertainments and did something to impart to them a literary cast as in the series of readings from the poets which he gave the first winter for the benefit of each church in turn at these lectures he commended himself to the sober elders who were troubled by the levity of his behavior with young people on other occasions by asking one of the ministers to open the exercises with prayer and another at the close to invoke the divine blessing there was no especial relevancy in this but it pleased he kept himself from the beginning pretty constantly in the popular eye he was a speaker at all public meetings where his declamation was admired and at private parties where the congealed particles of village society were united in a frozen mass he was the first to break the ice and set the angular fragments grating and grinding upon one another  he now went to his room and opened his desk with some vague purpose of bringing up the arrears of his correspondence formerly before his interest in the newspaper had lapsed at all he used to give his sunday leisure to making selections and writing paragraphs for it but he now let the pile of exchanges lie unopened on his desk and began to rummage through the letters scattered about in it they were mostly from young ladies with whom he had corresponded and some of them enclosed the photographs of the writers doing their best to look as they hoped he might think they looked they were not loveletters but were of that sort which the laxness of our social life invites young people who have met pleasantly to exchange as long as they like without explicit intentions on either side they commit the writers to nothing they are commonly without result except in wasting time which is hardly worth saving every one who has lived the american life must have produced them in great numbers while youth lasts they afford an excitement whose charm is hard to realize afterward  bartleys correspondents were young ladies of his college town where he had first begun to see something of social life in days which he now recognized as those of his green youth they were not so very far removed in point of time but the experience of a larger world in the vacation he had spent with a boston student had relegated them to a moral remoteness that could not readily be measured his friend was the son of a family who had diverted him from the natural destiny of a boston man at harvard and sent him elsewhere for sectarian reasons they were rich people devout in their way and benevolent after a fashion of their own and their son always brought home with him for the holidays and other short vacations some fellowstudent accounted worthy of their hospitality through his religious intentions or his intellectual promise these guests were indicated to the young man by one of the faculty and he accepted their companionship for the time with what perfunctory civility he could muster he and bartley had amused themselves very well during that vacation the hallecks were not fashionable people but they lived wealthily they had a coachman and an inside man whom bartley at first treated with a consideration which it afterward mortified him to think of their house was richly furnished with cushioned seats dense carpets and heavy curtains and they were visited by other people of their denomination and of a like abundance some of these were infected with the prevailing culture of the city and the young ladies especially dressed in a style and let fall ideas that filled the soul of the country student with wonder and worship he heard a great deal of talk that he did not understand but he eagerly treasured every impression and pieced it out by question or furtive observation into an image often shrewdly true and often grotesquely untrue to the conditions into which he had been dropped he civilized himself as rapidly as his light permitted there was a great deal of churchgoing but he and young halleck went also to lectures and concerts they even went to the opera and bartley with the privity of his friend went to the theatre halleck said that he did not think there was much harm in a play but that his people stayed away for the sake of the examplea reason that certainly need not hold with bartley  at the end of the vacation he returned to college leaving his measure with hallecks tailor and his heart with all the splendors and elegances of the town he found the ceilings very low and the fashions much belated in the village but he reconciled himself as well as he could the real stress came when he left college and the question of doing something for himself pressed upon him he intended to study law but he must meantime earn his living it had been his fortune to be left when very young not only an orphan but an extremely pretty child with an exceptional aptness for study and he had been better cared for than if his father and mother had lived he had been not only well housed and fed and very well dressed but pitied as an orphan and petted for his beauty and talent while he was always taught to think of himself as a poor boy who was winning his own way through the world but when his benefactor proposed to educate him for the ministry with a view to his final use in missionary work he revolted he apprenticed himself to the printer of his village and rapidly picked up a knowledge of the business so that at nineteen he had laid by some money and was able to think of going to college there was a fund in aid of indigent students in the institution to which he turned and the faculty favored him he finished his course with great credit to himself and the college and he was naturally inclined to look upon what had been done for him earlier as an advantage taken of his youthful inexperience he rebelled against the memory of that tutelage in spite of which he had accomplished such great things if he had not squandered his time or fallen into vicious courses in circumstances of so much discouragement if he had come out of it all selfreliant and independent he knew whom he had to thank for it the worst of the matter was that there was some truth in all this  the ardor of his satisfaction cooled in the two years following his graduation when in intervals of teaching country schools he was actually reduced to work at his trade on a village newspaper but it was as a practical printer through the freemasonry of the craft that bartley heard of the wish of the equity committee to place the free press in new hands and he had to be grateful to his trade for a primary consideration from them which his collegiate honors would not have won him there had not yet begun to be that talk of journalism as a profession which has since prevailed with our collegians and if bartley had thought as other collegians think of devoting himself to newspaper life he would have turned his face toward the city where its prizes are wonthe ten and fifteen dollar reporterships for which a font years course of the classics is not too costly a preparation but to tell the truth he had never regarded his newspaper as anything but a makeshift by which he was to be carried over a difficult and anxious period of his life and enabled to attempt something worthier his powers he had no illusions concerning it if he had ever thought of journalism as a grand and ennobling profession these ideas had perished in his experience in a village printingoffice he came to his work in equity with practical and immediate purposes which pleased the committee better the paper had been established some time before in one of those flurries of ambition which from time to time seized equity when its citizens reflected that it was the central town in the county and yet not the shiretown the question of the removal of the countyseat had periodically arisen before but it had never been so hotly agitated as now the paper had been a happy thought of a local politician whose conception of its management was that it might be easily edited by a committee if a printer could be found to publish it but a few months experience had made the free press a terrible burden to its founders it could not be sustained and it could not be let die without final disaster to the interests of the town and the committee began to cast about for a publisher who could also be editor bartley to whom it fell could not be said to have thrown his heart and soul into the work but he threw all his energy and he made it more than its friends could have hoped he espoused the cause of equity in the pending question with the zeal of a condottiere and did service no less faithful because of the cynical quality latent in it when the legislative decision against equity put an end to its ambitious hopes for the time being he continued in control of the paper with a fair prospect of getting the property into his own hands at last and with some growing question in his mind whether after all it might not be as easy for him to go into politics from the newspaper as from the law he managed the office very economically and by having the work done by girl apprentices with the help of one boy he made it selfsupporting he modelled the newspaper upon the modern conception through which the country press must cease to have any influence in public affairs and each paper become little more than an open letter of neighborhood gossip but while he filled his sheet with minute chronicles of the goings and comings of unimportant persons and with all attainable particulars of the ordinary life of the different localities he continued to make spicy hits at the enemies of equity in the late struggle and kept the public spirit of the town alive he had lately undertaken to make known its advantages as a summer resort and had published a series of encomiums upon the beauty of its scenery and the healthfulness of its air and water which it was believed would put it in a position of rivalry with some of the famous white mountain places he invited the enterprise of outside capital and advocated a narrowgauge road up the valley of the river through the notch so as to develop the picturesque advantages of that region in all this the color of mockery let the wise perceive that bartley saw the joke and enjoyed it and it deepened the popular impression of his smartness  this vein of cynicism was not characteristic as it would have been in an older man it might have been part of that spiritual and intellectual unruliness of youth which people laugh at and forgive and which one generally regards in after life as something almost alien to ones self he wrote long bragging articles about equity in a tone bordering on burlesque and he had a department in his paper where he printed humorous squibs of his own and of other people these were sometimes copied and in the daily papers of the state he had been mentioned as the funny man of the equity free press he also sent letters to one of the boston journals which he reproduced in his own sheet and which gave him an importance that the best endeavor as a country editor would never have won him with the villagers he would naturally as the local printer have ranked a little above the foreman of the sawmill in the social scale and decidedly below the master of the academy but his personal qualities elevated him over the head even of the latter but above all the fact that he was studying law was a guaranty of his superiority that nothing else could have given that science is the fountain of the highest distinction in a country town bartleys whole course implied that he was above editing the free press but that he did it because it served his turn that was admirable  he sat a long time with these girls letters before him and lost himself in a pensive reverie over their photographs and over the good times he used to have with them he mused in that formless way in which a young man thinks about young girls his soul is suffused with a sense of their sweetness and brightness and unless he is distinctly in love there is no intention in his thoughts of them even then there is often no intention bartley might very well have a good conscience about them he had broken no hearts among them and had only met them halfway in flirtation what he really regretted as he held their letters in his hand was that he had never got up a correspondence with two or three of the girls whom he had met in boston though he had been cowed by their magnificence in the beginning he had never had any reverence for them he believed that they would have liked very well to continue his acquaintance but he had not known how to open a correspondence and the point was one on which he was ashamed to consult halleck these college belles compared with them were amusingly inferior by a natural turn of thought he realized that they were inferior to marcia gaylord too in looks and style no less than in an impassioned preference for himself a distaste for their somewhat veteran ways in flirtation grew upon him as he thought of her he philosophized against them to her advantage he could not blame her if she did not know how to hide her feelings for him yet he knew that marcia would rather have died than let him suppose that she cared for him if she had known that she was doing it the fun of it was that she should not know this charmed him it touched him even he did not think of it exultingly as the night before but sweetly fondly and with a final curiosity to see her again and enjoy the fact in her presence the acrid little jets of smoke which escaped from the joints of his stove from time to time annoyed him he shut his portfolio at last and went out to walk     iv   the forenoon sunshine beating strong upon the thin snow along the edges of the porch floor tattered them with a little thaw here and there but it had no effect upon the hardpacked levels of the street up the middle of which bartley walked in a silence intensified by the muffled voices of exhortation that came to him out of the churches it was in the very heart of sermontime and he had the whole street to himself on his way up to squire gaylords house as he drew near he saw smoke ascending from the chimney of the lawyers officea little white building that stood apart from the dwelling on the left of the gate and he knew that the old man was within reading there with his hat on and his long legs flung out toward the stove unshaven and unkempt in a grim protest against the prevalent christian superstition he might be reading hume or gibbon or he might be reading the biblea book in which he was deeply versed and from which he was furnished with texts for the demolition of its friends his adversaries he professed himself a great admirer of its literature and in the heat of controversy he often found himself a defender of its doctrines when he had occasion to expose the fallacy of latitudinarian interpretations for liberal christianity he had nothing but contempt and refuted it with a scorn which spared none of the worldly tendencies of the church in equity the idea that souls were to be saved by church sociables filled him with inappeasable rancor and he maintained the superiority of the old puritanic discipline against them with a fervor which nothing but its reestablishment could have abated it was said that squire gaylords influence had largely helped to keep in place the last of the rigidly orthodox ministers under whom his liberalizing congregation chafed for years of discontent but this was probably an exaggeration of the native humor mrs gaylord had belonged to this church and had never formally withdrawn from it and the lawyer always contributed to pay the ministers salary he also managed a little property for him so well as to make him independent when he was at last asked to resign by his deacons  in another mood bartley might have stepped aside to look in on the squire before asking at the house door for marcia they relished each others company as people of contrary opinions and of no opinions are apt to do bartley loved to hear the squire get going as he said and the old man felt a fascination in the youngster bartley was smart he took a point as quick as lightning and the squire did not mind his making friends with the mammon of righteousness as he called the visible church in equity it amused him to see bartley lending the church the zealous support of the press with an impartial patronage of the different creeds there had been times in his own career when the silence of his opinions would have greatly advanced him but he had not chosen to pay this price for success he liked his freedom or he liked the bitter tang of his own tongue too well and he had remained a leading lawyer in equity when he might have ended a judge or even a congressman of late years however since people whom he could have joined in their agnosticism so heartily up to a certain point had begun to make such fools of themselves about darwinism and the brotherhood of all men in the monkey he had grown much more tolerant he still clung to his oldfashioned deistical opinions but be thought no worse of a man for not holding them he did not deny that a man might be a christian and still be a very good man  the audacious humor of his position sufficed with a people who liked a joke rather better than anything else in his old age his infidelity was something that would hardly have been changed if possible by a popular vote even his wife to whom it had once been a heavy cross borne with secret prayer and tears had long ceased to gainsay it in any wise her family had opposed her yoking with an unbeliever when she married him but she had some such hopes of converting him as women cherish who give themselves to men confirmed in drunkenness she learned as other women do that she could hardly change her husband in the least of his habits and that in this great matter of his unbelief her love was powerless it became easier at last for her to add selfsacrifice to selfsacrifice than to vex him with her anxieties about his soul and to act upon the feeling that if he must be lost then she did not care to be saved he had never interfered with her churchgoing he had rather promoted it for he liked to have women go but the time came when she no longer cared to go without him she lapsed from her membership and it was now many years since she had worshipped with the people of her faith if indeed she were still of any faith her life was silenced in every way and as often happens with aging wives in country towns she seldom went out of her own door and never appeared at the social or public solemnities of the village her husband and her daughter composed and bounded her worldshe always talked of them or of other things as related to them she had grown an elderly woman without losing the color of her yellow hair and the bloom of girlhood had been stayed in her cheeks as if by the young habit of blushing which she had kept she was still what her neighbors called very prettyappearing and she must have been a beautiful girl the silence of her inward life subdued her manner till now she seemed always to have come from some place on which a deep hush had newly fallen  she answered the door when bartley turned the crank that snapped the gongbell in its centre and the young man who was looking at the street while waiting for some one to come confronted her with a start oh he said i thought it was marcia good morning mrs gaylord isnt marcia at home  she went to church this morning replied her mother wont you walk in  why yes i guess i will thank you faltered bartley in the irresolution of his disappointment i hope i shant disturb you  come right into the sittingroom she wont be gone a great while now said mrs gaylord leading the way to the large square room into which a door at the end of the narrow hall opened a slumberous heat from a sheetiron woodstove pervaded the place and a clock ticked monotonously on a shelf in the corner mrs gaylord said wont you take a chair and herself sank into the rocker with a deep feather cushion in the seat and a thinner feather cushion tied halfway up the back after the more active duties of her housekeeping were done she sat every day in this chair with her knitting or sewing and let the clock tick the long hours of her life away with no more apparent impatience of them or sense of their dulness than the cat on the braided rug at her feet or the geraniums in the pots at the sunny window are you pretty well today she asked  well no mrs gaylord im not answered bartley im all out of sorts i havent felt so dyspeptic for i dont know how long  mrs gaylord smoothed the silk dress across her lapthe thin old black silk which she still instinctively put on for sabbath observance though it was so long since she had worn it to church mr gaylord used to have it when we were first married though he aint been troubled with it of late years he seemed to think then it was worse sundays  i dont believe sunday has much to do with it in my case i ate some mincepie and some toasted cheese last night and i guess they didnt agree with me very well said bartley who did not spare himself the confession of his sins when seeking sympathy it was this candor that went so far to convince people of his goodheartedness  i dont know as i ever heard that meatpie was bad said mrs gaylord thoughtfully mr gaylord used to eat it right along all through his dyspepsia and he never complained of it and the cheese ought to have made it digest  well i dont know what it was replied bartley plaintively submitting to be exonerated but i feel perfectly used up oh i suppose i shall get over it or forget all about it by tomorrow he added with strenuous cheerfulness it isnt anything worth minding  mrs gaylord seemed to differ with him on this point head ache any she asked  it did this morning when i first woke up bartley assented  i dont believe but what a cup of tea would be the best thing for you she said critically  bartley had instinctively practised a social art which ingratiated him with people at equity as much as his demands for sympathy endeared him he gave trouble in little unusual ways he now said oh i wish you would give me a cup mrs gaylord  why yes indeed thats just what i was going to she replied she went to the kitchen which lay beyond another room and reappeared with the tea directly proud of her promptness but having it on her conscience to explain it i most always keep the pot on the stove hearth sunday morning sos to have it ready if mr gaylord ever wants a cup hes a master hand for tea and always was there i guess you better take it without milk i put some sugar in the saucer if you want any she dropped noiselessly upon her feather cushion again and bartley who had risen to receive the tea from her remained standing while he drank it  that does seem to go to the spot he said as he sipped it thoughtfully observant of its effect upon his disagreeable feelings i wish i had you to take care of me mrs gaylord and keep me from making a fool of myself he added when he had drained the cup no no he cried at her offering to take it from him ill set it down i know it will fret you to have it in here and ill carry it out into the kitchen he did so before she could prevent him and came back touching his mustache with his handkerchief i declare mrs gaylord i should love to live in a kitchen like that  i guess you wouldnt if you had to said mrs gaylord flattered into a smile marcia she likes to sit out there she says better than anywheres in the house but i always tell her its because she was there so much when she was little i dont see as she seems overanxious to do anything there but sit i tell her not but what she knows how well enough mr gaylord too hes great for being round in the kitchen if he gets up in the night when he has his waking spells he had rather take his lamp out there if theres a fire left and read any time than what he would in the parlor well we used to sit there together a good deal when we were young and he got the habit of it theres everything in habit she added thoughtfully marcia shes got quite in the way lately of going to the methodist church  yes ive seen her there you know i board round at the different churches as the schoolmaster used to at the houses in the old times  mis gaylord looked up at the clock and gave a little nervous laugh i dont know what marcia will say to my letting her company stay in the sittingroom shes pretty late today but i guess you wont have much longer to wait now  she spoke with that awe of her daughter and her judgments which is one of the pathetic idiosyncrasies of a certain class of american mothers they feel themselves to be not so well educated as their daughters whose fancied knowledge of the world they let outweigh their own experience of life they are used to deferring to them and they shrink willingly into household drudges before them and leave them to order the social affairs of the family mrs gaylord was not much afraid of bartley for himself but as marcias company he made her more and more uneasy toward the end of the quarter of an hour in which she tried to entertain him with her simple talk varying from mr gaylord to marcia and from marcia to mr gaylord again when she recognized the girls quick touch in the closing of the front door and her elastic step approached through the hall the mother made a little deprecating noise in her throat and fidgeted in her chair as soon as marcia opened the sittingroom door mrs gaylord modestly rose and went out into the kitchen the mother who remained in the room when her daughter had company was an oddity almost unknown in equity  marcias face flashed all into a light of joy at sight of bartley who scarcely waited for her mother to be gone before he drew her toward him by the hand she had given she mechanically yielded and then as if the recollection of some new resolution forced itself through her pleasure at sight of him she freed her hand and retreating a step or two confronted him  why marcia he said whats the matter  nothing she answered  it might have amused bartley if he had felt quite well to see the girl so defiant of him when she was really so much in love with him but it certainly did not amuse him now it disappointed him in his expectation of finding her femininely soft and comforting and he did not know just what to do he stood staring at her in discomfiture while she gained in outward composure though her cheeks were of the jacqueminot red of the ribbon at her throat what have i done marcia he faltered  oh you havent done anything  some one has been talking to you against me  no one has said a word to me about you  then why are you so coldso strangesosodifferent  different  yes from what you were last night he answered with an aggrieved air  oh we see some things differently by daylight she lightly explained wont you sit down  no thank you bartley replied sadly but unresentfully i think i had better be going i see there is something wrong  i dont see why you say there is anything wrong she retorted what have i done  oh you have not done anything i take it back it is all right but when i came here this morningencouragedhopingthat you had the same feeling as myself and you seem to forget everything but a ceremonious acquaintanceshipwhy it is all right of course i have no reason to complain but i must say that i cant help being surprised he saw her lips quiver and her bosom heave marcia do you blame me for feeling hurt at your coldness when i came here to tell youto tell you ii love you with his nerves all unstrung and his hunger for sympathy he really believed that he had come to tell her this yes he added bitterly i will tell you though it seems to be the last word i shall speak to you ill go now  bartley you shall never go she cried throwing herself in his way do you think i dont care for you too you may kiss meyou may kill me now  the passionate tears sprang to her eyes without the sound of sobs or the contortion of weeping and she did not wait for his embrace she flung her arms around his neck and held him fast crying i wouldnt let you for your own sake darling and if i had died for iti thought i should die last nighti was never going to let you kiss me again till you saidtilltillnow dont you see she caught him tighter and hid her face in his neck and cried and laughed for joy and shame while he suffered her caresses with a certain bewilderment i want to tell you nowi want to explain she said lifting her face and letting him from her as far as her arms caught around his neck would reach and fervidly searching his eyes lest some ray of what he would think should escape her dont speak a word first father saw us at the door last nighthe happened to be coming downstairs because he couldnt sleepjust when youoh bartley dont she implored at the little smile that made his mustache quiver and he asked me whether we were engaged and when i couldnt tell him we were i know what he thought i knew how he despised me and i determined that if you didnt tell me that you cared for meand thats the reason bartley and notnot because i didnt care more for you than i do for the whole world andandyou dont mind it now do you it was for your sake dearest  whether bartley perfectly divined or not all the feeling at which her words hinted it was delicious to be clung about by such a pretty girl as marcia gaylord to have her now darting her face into his neckscarf with intolerable consciousness and now boldly confronting him with alldefying fondness while she lightly pushed him and pulled him here and there in the vehemence of her appeal perhaps such a man in those fastnesses of his nature which psychology has not yet explored never loses even in the tenderest transports the sense of prey as to the girl whose love he has won but if this is certain it is also certain that he has transports which are tender and bartley now felt his soul melted with affection that was very novel and sweet  why marcia he said what a strange girl you are he sunk into his chair again and putting his arms around her waist drew her upon his knee like a child  she held herself apart from him at her arms length and said wait let me say it before it seems as if we had always been engaged and everything was as right then as it is now did you despise me for letting you kiss me before we were engaged  no he laughed again i liked you for it  but if you thought i would let any one else you wouldnt have liked it  this diverted him still more i shouldnt have liked that more than half as well  no she said thoughtfully she dropped her face awhile on his shoulder and seemed to be struggling with herself then she lifted it and did you everdid you she gasped  if you want me to say that all the other girls in the world are not worth a hair of your head ill say that marcia now lets talk business  this made her laugh and i shall want a little lock of yours she said as if they had hitherto been talking of nothing but each others hair  and i shall want all of yours he answered  no dont be silly she critically explored his face how funny to have a mole in your eyebrow she put her finger on it i never saw it before  you never looked so closely theres a scar at the corner of your upper lip that i hadnt noticed  can you see that she demanded radiantly well you have got good eyes the cat did it when i was a little girl  the door opened and mrs gaylord surprised them in the celebration of these discoveriesor rather she surprised herself for she stood holding the door and helpless to move though in her heart she had an apologetic impulse to retire and she even believed that she made some murmurs of excuse for her intrusion bartley was equally abashed but marcia rose with the coolness of her sex in the intimate emergencies which confound a man oh mother its you i forgot about you come in or ill set the table if thats what you want as mrs gaylord continued to look from her to bartley in her daze marcia added simply were engaged mother you may as well know it first as last and i guess you better know it first  her mother appeared not to think it safe to relax her hold upon the door and bartley went filially to her rescueif it was rescue to salute her blushing defencelessness as he did a confused sense of the extraordinary nature and possible impropriety of the proceeding may have suggested her husband to her mind or it may have been a feeling that some remark was expected of her even in the mental destitution to which she was reduced  have you told mr gaylord about it she asked of either or neither or both as they chose to take it  bartley left the word to marcia who answered well no mother we havent yet weve only just found it out ourselves i guess father can wait till he comes in to dinner i intend to keep bartley here to prove it  he said remarked mrs gaylord whom bartley had led to her chair and placed on her cushion t he had a headache when he first came in and she appealed to him for corroboration while she vainly endeavored to gather force to grapple again with the larger fact that he and marcia were just engaged to be married  marcia stopped down and pulled her mother up out of her chair with a hug oh come now mother you mustnt let it take your breath away she said with patronizing fondness im not afraid of what father will say you know what he thinks of bartleyor mr hubbard as i presume youll want me to call him now mother you just run up stairs and put on your best cap and leave me to set the table and get up the dinner i guess i can get bartley to help me mother mother mother she cried in happiness that was otherwise unutterable and clasping her mother closer in her strong young arms she kissed her with a fervor that made her blush again before the young man  marcia marcia you hadnt ought to its ridiculous she protested but she suffered herself to be thrust out of the room grateful for exile in which she could collect her scattered wits and set herself to realize the fact that had dispersed them it was decorous also for her to leave marcia alone with mr hubbard far more so now than when he was merely company she felt that and she fumbled over the dressing she was sent about and once she looked out of her chamber window at the office where mr gaylord sat and wondered what mr gaylord she thought of him and even dreamt of him as mr gaylord and had never in the most familiar moments addressed him otherwise would say but she left the solution of the problem to him and marcia she was used to leaving them to the settlement of their own difficulties  now bartley said marcia in the businesslike way that women assume in such matters as soon as the great fact is no longer in doubt you must help me to set the table put up that leaf and ill put up this im going to do more for mother than i used to she said repentant in her bliss its a shame how much ive left to her the domestic instinct was already astir in her heart  bartley pulled the tablecloth straight from her and vied with her in the rapidity and exactness with which he arranged the knives and forks at right angles beside the plates when it came to some heavier dishes they agreed to carry them turn about but when it was her turn he put out his hand to support her elbow as i did last night and saved you from dropping a lamp  this made her laugh and she dropped the first dish with a crash poor mother she exclaimed i know she heard that and shell be in agony to know which one it is  mrs gaylord did indeed hear it far off in her chamber and quaked with an anxiety which became intolerable at last  marcia marcia she quavered down the stairs what have you broken  marcia opened the door long enough to call back oh only the old blueedged platter mother and then she flew at bartley crying for shame for shame and pressing her hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter shell hear you bartley and think youre laughing at her but she laughed herself at his struggles and ended by taking him by the hand and pulling him out into the kitchen where neither of them could be heard she abandoned herself to the ecstasy of her soul and he thought she had never been so charming as in this wild gayety  why marsh i never saw you carry on so before  you never saw me engaged before thats the way all girls actif they get the chance dont you like me to be so she asked with quick anxiety  rather he replied  oh bartley she exclaimed i feel like a child i surprise myself as much as i do you for i thought i had got very old and i didnt suppose i should ever let myself go in this way but there is something about this that lets me be as silly as i like its somehow as if i were a great deal more alone when im with you than when im by myself how does it make you feel  good he answered and that satisfied her better than if he had entered into those subtleties which she had tried to express it was more like a man he had his arm about her again and she put down her hand on his to press it closer against her heart  of course she explained recurring to his surprise at her frolic mood i dont expect you to be silly because i am  no he assented but how can i help it  oh i dont mean for the time being i mean generally speaking i mean that i care for you because i know you know a great deal more than i do and because i respect you i know that everybody expects you to be something great and i do too  bartley did not deny the justness of her opinions concerning himself or the reasonableness of the general expectation though he probably could not see the relation of these cold abstractions to the pleasure of sitting there with a pretty girl in that way but he said nothing  do you know she went on turning her face prettily around toward him but holding it a little way off to secure attention as impersonal as might be under the circumstances what pleased me more than anything else you ever said to me  no answered bartley something you got out of me when you were trying to make me tell you the difference between you and the other equity girls  she laughed in glad defiance of her own consciousness well i was trying to make you compliment me im not going to deny it but i must say i got my comeuppance you didnt say a thing i cared for but you did afterward dont you remember  no when  she hesitated a moment when you told me that my influence hadhadmade you better you know  oh said bartley that well he added carelessly its every word true didnt you believe it  i was just as glad as if i did and it made me resolve never to do or say a thing that could lower your opinion of me and then you know there at the doorit all seemed part of our trying to make each other better but when father looked at me in that way and asked me if we were engaged i went down into the dust with shame and it seemed to me that you had just been laughing at me and amusing yourself with me and i was so furious i didnt know what to do do you know what i wanted to do i wanted to run downstairs to father and tell him what you had said and ask him if he believed you had ever liked any other girl she paused a little but he did not answer and she continued but now im glad i didnt and i shall never ask you that and i shall not care for anything that youthats happened before today its all right and you do think i shall always try to make you good and happy dont you  i dont think you can make me much happier than i am at present and i dont believe anybody could make me feel better answered bartley  she gave a little laugh at his refusal to be serious and let her head for fondness fall upon his shoulder while he turned round and round a ring he found on her finger  ah ha he said after a while who gave you this ring miss gaylord  father christmas before last she promptly answered without moving im glad you asked she murmured in a lower voice full of pride in the maiden love she could give him theres never been any one but you or the thought of any one she suddenly started away  now lets play were getting dinner it was quite time in the next moment the coffee boiled up and if she had not caught the lid off and stirred it down with her spoon it would have been spoiled the steam ascended to the ceiling and filled the kitchen with the fragrant smell of the berry  im glad were going to have coffee she said youll have to put up with a cold dinner except potatoes but the coffee will make up and i shall need a cup to keep me awake i dont believe i slept last night till nearly morning do you like coffee  id have given all i ever expect to be worth for a cup of it last night he said i was awfully hungry when i got back to the hotel and i couldnt find anything but a piece of mincepie and some old cheese and i had to be content with cold milk i felt as if i had lost all my friends this morning when i woke up  a sense of remembered grievance trembled in his voice and made her drop her head on his arm in pity and derision of him poor bartley she cried and you came up here for a little petting from me didnt you ive noticed that in you well you didnt get it did you  well not at first he said  yes you cant complain of any want of petting at last she returned delighted at his indirect recognition of the difference then the daring the archness and caprice that make coquetry in some women and lurk a divine possibility in all came out in her the sweetness kept back by the whole strength of her pride overflowed that broken barrier now and she seemed to lavish this revelation of herself upon him with a sort of tender joy in his bewilderment she was not hurt when he crudely expressed the elusive sense which has been in other mens minds at such times they cannot believe that this fascination is inspired and not practised  well he said im glad you told me that i was the first i should have thought youd had a good deal of experience in flirtation  you wouldnt have thought so if you hadnt been a great flirt yourself she answered audaciously perhaps i have been engaged before  their talk was for the most part frivolous and their thoughts ephemeral but again they were with her at least suddenly and deeply serious till then all things seemed to have been held in arrest and impressions ideas feelings fears desires released themselves simultaneously and sought expression with a rush that defied coherence oh why do we try to talk she asked at last the more we say the more we leave unsaid let us keep still awhile but she could not bartley when did you first think you cared about me  i dont know said bartley i guess it must have been the first time i saw you  yes that is when i first knew that i cared for you but it seems to me that i must have always cared for you and that i only found it out when i saw you going by the house that day she mused a little time before she asked again bartley  well  did you ever use to be afraidor no wait ill tell you first and then ill ask you im not ashamed of it now though once i thought i couldnt bear to have any one find it out i used to be awfully afraid you didnt care for me i would try to make out from things you did and said whether you did or not but i never could be certain i believe i used to find the most comfort in discouraging myself i used to say to myself why of course he doesnt how can he hes been everywhere and hes seen so many girls he corresponds with lots of them altogether likely hes engaged to some of the young ladies hes met in boston and he just goes with me here for a blind and then when you would praise me sometimes i would just say oh hes complimented plenty of girls i know hes thinking this instant of the young lady hes engaged to in boston and it would almost kill me and when you did some little thing to show that you liked me i would think he doesnt like me he hates he despises me he does he does he does and i would go on that way with my teeth shut and my breath held i dont know how long bartley broke out into a broad laugh at this image of desperation but she added tenderly i hope i never made you suffer in that way  what way he asked  thats what i wanted you to tell me did you everdid you use to be afraid sometimes that ithat youdid you put off telling me that you cared for me so long because you thought you dreadedoh i dont see what i can ever do to make it up to you if you did were you afraid i didnt care for you  no shouted bartley she had risen and stood before him in the fervor of her entreaty and he seized her arms pinioning them to her side and holding her helpless while he laughed and laughed again i knew you were dead in love with me from the first moment  bartley bartley hubbard she exclaimed let me golet me go this instant i never heard of such a shameless thing  but she really made no effort to escape     v   the house seemed too little for marcias happiness and after dinner she did not let bartley forget his last nights engagement she sent him off to get his horse at the hotel and ran up to her room to put on her wraps for the drive her mother cleared away the dinner things she pushed the table to the side of the room and then sat down in her feathercushioned chair and waited her husbands pleasure to speak he ordinarily rose from the sunday dinner and went back to his office today he had taken a chair before the stove but he had mechanically put his hat on and he wore it pushed off his forehead as he tilted his chair back on its hind legs and braced himself against the hearth of the stove with his feet  a man is master in his own house generally through the exercise of a certain degree of brutality but squire gaylord maintained his predominance by an enlightened absenteeism no man living always at home was ever so little under his own roof while he was in more active business life he had kept an office in the heart of the village where he spent all his days and a great part of every night but after he had become rich enough to risk whatever loss of business the change might involve he bought this large old square house on the border of the village and thenceforth made his home in the little detached office  if mrs gaylord had dimly imagined that she should see something more of him having him so near at hand she really saw less there was no weather by day or night in which he could not go to his office now he went no more than his wife into the village society she might have been glad now and then of a little glimpse of the world but she never said so and her social life had ceased like her religious life their house was richly furnished according to the local taste of the time the parlor had a brussels carpet and heavy chairs of mahogany and haircloth marcia had a piano there and since she had come home from school they had made company as mrs gaylord called it two or three times for her but they had held aloof from the festivity the squire in his office and mrs gaylord in the family room where they now sat in unwonted companionship  well mr gaylord said his wife i dont know as you can say but what marcias suited well enough  this was the first allusion they had made to the subject but she let it take the argumentative form of her cogitations  myes sighed the squire in long nasal assent most too well if anything he rasped first one unshaven cheek and then the other with his thin quivering hand  hes smart enough said mrs gaylord as before  myes most too smart replied her husband a little more quickly than before hes smart enough even if she wasnt to see from the start that she was crazy to have him and that isnt the best way to begin life for a married couple if im a judge  it would killed her if she hadnt got him i could see t was wearin on her every day more and more she used to fairly jump every knock shed hear at the door and i know sometimes when she was afraid he wa nt coming she used to go out in hopes t she shd meet him i dont suppose she allowed to herself that she did it for thatmarcias proud  myes said the squire shes proud and when a proud girl makes a fool of herself about a fellow its a matter of life and death with her she cant help herself she lets go everything  i declare mrs gaylord went on it worked me up considerable to have her come in some those times and see by her face t shed seen him with some the other girls she used to look so and then id hear her up in her room cryin and cryin i shouldnt cared so much if marciad been like any other girl kind of flirty like about it but she wa nt she was just bowed down before her idol  a final assent came from the squire as if wrung out of his heart and he rose from his chair and then sat down again marcia was his child and he loved her with his whole soul mwell he deeply sighed all that parts over anyway but he tingled in an anguish of sympathy with what she had suffered you see miranda how she looked at me when she first came in with himso proud and independent poor girl and yet as if she was afraid i mightnt like it  yes i see it  he pulled his hat far down over his cavernous eyes and worked his thin rusty old jaws  i hope t shell be able to school herself so s t not show out her feelings so much said mrs gaylord  i wish she could school herself so as to not have em so much but i guess shell have em and i guess shell show em out they were both silent after a while he added throwing at the stove a minute fragment of the cane he had pulled off the seat of his chair miranda ive expected something of this sort a good while and ive thought over what bartley had better do  mrs gaylord stooped forward and picked up the bit of wood which her husband had thrown down her vigilance was rewarded by finding a thread on the oilcloth near where it lay she whipped this round her finger and her husband continued hed better give up his paper and go into the law he s done well in the paper and hes a smart writer but editing a newspaper aint any work for a man its all well enough as long as hes single but when hes got a wife to look after hed better get down to work my business is in just such a shape now that i could hand it over to him in a lump but come to wait a year or two longer and this young man and that one ll eat into it and it wont be the same thing at all i shall want bartley to push right along and get admitted at once he can do it fast enough hes bright enough added the old man with a certain grimness mwell he broke out with a quick sigh after a moment of musing it hasnt happened at any very bad time i was just thinking this morning that i should like to have my whole time pretty soon to look after my property i shant want bartley to do that for me ill give him a good start in money and in business but ill look after my property myself ill speak to him the first chance i get  a light step sounded on the stairs and marcia burst into the room ready for her drive i wanted to get a good warm before i started she explained stooping before the stove and supporting herself with one hand on her fathers knee there had been no formal congratulations upon her engagement from either of her parents but this was not requisite and would have been a little affected they were perhaps now ashamed to mention it outright before her alone the squire however went so far as to put his hand over the hand she had laid upon his knee and to smooth it twice or thrice  you going to ride after that sorrel colt of bartleys he asked  of course she answered with playful pertness i guess bartley can manage the sorrel colt hes never had any trouble yet  hes always been able to give his whole mind to him before said the squire he gave marcias hand a significant squeeze and let it go  she would not confess her consciousness of his meaning at once she looked up at the clock and then turned and pulled her fathers watch out of his waistcoat pocket and compared the time why youre both fast  perhaps bartleys slow said the squire and having gone as far as he intended in this direction he permitted himself a low chuckle  the sleighbells jingled without and she sprang lightly to her feet i guess you dont think bartleys slow she exclaimed and hung over her father long enough to rub her lips against his bristly cheek by mother she said over her shoulder and went out of the room she let her muff hang as far down in front of her as her arms would reach in a stylish way and moved with a little rhythmical tilt as if to some inner music even in her furs she was elegantly slender in shape  the old people remained silent and motionless till the clash of the bells died away then the squire rose and went to the woodshed beyond the kitchen whence he reappeared with an armful of wood his wife started at the sight mr gaylord what be you doin  oh im going to make em up a little fire in the parlor stove i guess they wont want us round a great deal when they come back  mrs gaylord said well i never did when her husband returned from the parlor she added i suppose some folksd say it was rather of a strange way of spendin the sabbath  its a very good way of spending the sabbath you dont suppose that any of the people in church are half as happy do you why old jonathan edwards himself used to allow all proper opportunity for the young fellows that come to see his girls and a room and fire if needed his life says so  i guess he didnt allow it on the sabbath retorted mrs gaylord  well the life dont say chuckled the squire why miranda i do it for marcia theres never but one first day to an engagement you know that as well as i do in saying this squire gaylord gave way to his repressed emotion in an extravagance he suddenly stooped over and kissed his wife but he spared her confusion by going out to his office at once where he stayed the whole afternoon  bartley and marcia took the long drive as it was called at equity the road plunged into the darkly wooded gulch beyond the house and then struck away eastward crossing loop after loop of the river on the covered bridges where the neighbors who had broken it out with their oxteams in the open had thickly bedded it in snow in the valleys and sheltered spots it remained free and so wide that encountering teams could easily pass each other but where it climbed a hill or crossed a treeless level it was narrowed to a single track with turnouts at established points where the drivers of the sleighs waited to be sure that the stretch beyond was clear before going forward in the country the winter which held the village in such close siege was an occupation under which nature seemed to cower helpless and men made a desperate and ineffectual struggle the houses banked up with snow almost to the sills of the windows that looked out blind with frost upon the lifeless world were dwarfed in the drifts and seemed to founder in a white sea blotched with strange bluish shadows under the slanting sun where they fronted close upon the road it was evident that the fight with the snow was kept up unrelentingly spaces were shovelled out and paths were kept open to the middle of the highway and to the barn but where they were somewhat removed there was no visible trace of the conflict and no sign of life except the faint wreathed lines of smoke wavering upward from the chimneys  in the hollows through which the road passed the lower boughs of the pines and hemlocks were weighed down with the snowfall till they lay half submerged in the drifts but wherever the wind could strike them they swung free of this load and met in low flat arches above the track the river betrayed itself only when the swift current of a ripple broke through the white surface in long irregular grayish blurs it was all wild and lonesome but to the girl alone in it with her lover the solitude was sweet and she did not wish to speak even to him his hands were both busy with the reins but it was agreed between them that she might lock hers through his arm cowering close to him under the robes she laid her head on his shoulder and looked out over the flying landscape in measureless content and smiled with filling eyes when he bent over and warmed his cold red cheek on the top of her fur cap  the moments of bliss that silence a woman rouse a man to make sure of his rapture how do you like it marsh he asked trying at one of these times to peer round into her face are you afraid  noonly of getting back too soon  he made the shivering echoes answer with his delight in this and chirruped to the colt who pushed forward at a wilder speed flinging his hoofs out before him with the straight thrust of the horn trotter and seeming to overtake them as they flew i should like this ride to last forever  forever she repeated that would do for a beginning  marsh what a girl you are i never supposed you would be so free to let a fellow know how much you cared for him  neither did i she answered dreamily but nownow the only trouble is that i dont know how to let him know she gave his arm to which she clung a little convulsive clutch and pressed her head harder upon his shoulder  well thats pretty much my complaint too said bartley though i couldnt have expressed it so well  oh you express she murmured with the pride in him which implied that there were no thoughts worth expressing to which he could not give a monumental utterance her adoration flattered his selflove to the same passionate intensity and to something like the generous complexion of her worship  marcia he answered i am going to try to be all you expect of me and i hope i shall never do anything unworthy of your ideal  she could only press his arm again in speechless joy but she said to herself that she should always remember these words  the wind had been rising ever since they started but they had not noticed it till now when the woods began to thin away on either side and he stopped before striking out over one of the naked stretches of the plaina white waste swept by the blasts that sucked down through a gorge of the mountain and flattened the snowdrifts as the tornado flattens the waves across this expanse ran the road its stiff lines obliterated here and there in the slight depressions and showing dark along the rest of the track  it was a good halfmile to the next body of woods and midway there was one of those sidings where a sleigh approaching from the other quarter must turn out and yield the right of way bartley stopped his colt and scanned the road  anybody coming asked marcia  no i dont see any one but if theres any one in the woods yonder theyd better wait till i get across no horse in equity can beat this colt to the turnout  oh well look carefully bartley if we met any one beyond the turnout i dont know what i should do pleaded the girl  i dont know what they would do said bartley but its their lookout now if they come wrap your face up well or put your head under the robe ive got to hold my breath the next halfmile he loosed the reins and sped the colt out of the shelter where he had halted the wind struck them like an edge of steel and catching the powdery snow that their horses hoofs beat up sent it spinning and swirling far along the glistening levels on their lee they felt the thrill of the go as if they were in some light boat leaping over a swift current marcia disdained to cover her face if he must confront the wind but after a few gasps she was glad to bend forward and bury it in the long hair of the bearskin robe when she lifted it they were already past the siding and she saw a cutter dashing toward them from the cover of the woods bartley she screamed the sleigh  yes he shouted some fool theres going to be trouble here he added checking his horse as he could they dont seem to know how to manageits a couple of women hold on hold on he called dont try to turn out ill turn out  the women pulled their horses head this way and that in apparent confusion and then began to turn out into the trackless snow at the roadside in spite of bartleys frantic efforts to arrest them they sank deeper and deeper into the drift their horse plunged and struggled and then their cutter went over amidst their shrieks and cries for help  bartley drove up abreast of the wreck and saying still jerry dont be afraid marciahe put the reins into her hands and sprang out to the rescue  one of the women had been flung out free of the sleigh and had already gathered herself up and stood crying and wringing her hands oh mr hubbard mr hubbard help hannah shes under there  all right keep quiet mrs morrison take hold of your horses head bartley had first of all seized him by the bit and pulled him to his feet he was old and experienced in obedience and he now stood waiting orders patiently enough bartley seized the cutter and by an effort of all his strength righted it the colt started and trembled but marcia called to him in bartleys tone still jerry and he obeyed her  the girl who had been caught under the overturned cutter escaped like a wild thing out of a trap when it was lifted and plunging some paces away faced round upon her rescuer with the hood pulled straight and set comely to her face again almost before he could ask any bones broken hannah  no she shouted mother mother stop crying dont you see im not dead she leaped about catching up this wrap and that shaking the dry snow out of them and flinging them back into the cutter while she laughed in the wild tumult of her spirits bartley helped her pick up the fragments of the wreck and joined her in making fun of the adventure the wind hustled them but they were warm in defiance of it with their jollity and their bustle  why didnt you let me turn out demanded bartley as he and the girl stood on opposite sides of the cutter rearranging the robes in it  oh i thought i could turn out well enough you had a right to the road  well the next time you see any one past the turnout you better not start from the woods  why theres no more room in the woods to get past than there is here cried the girl  theres more shelter  oh im not cold she flashed a look at him from her brilliant face warm with all the glow of her young health and laughed and before she dropped her eyes she included marcia in her glance they had already looked at each other without any sign of recognition come mother all right now  her mother left the horses head and heavily ploughing back to the cutter tumbled herself in the girl from her side began to climb in but her weight made the sleigh careen and she dropped down with a gay shriek  bartley came round and lifted her in the girl called to her horse and drove up into the road and away  bartley looked after her a moment and continued to glance in that direction when he stood stamping the snow off his feet and brushing it from his legs and arms before he remounted to marcias side he was excited and talked rapidly and loudly as he took the reins from marcias passive hold and let the colt out that girl is the pluckiest fool yet wouldnt let me turn out because i had the right of way and she wasnt going to let anybody else have a hand in getting that old ark of theirs afloat again good their horse wasnt anything like jerry how well jerry behaved were you frightened marsh he bent over to see her face but she had not her head on his shoulder and she did not sit close to him now did you freeze  oh no i got along very well she answered dryly and edged away as far as the width of the seat would permit it would have been better for you to lead their horse up into the road and then she could have got in without your help her mother got in alone  he took the reins into his left hand and passing his strong right around her pulled her up to his side she resisted with diminishing force at last she ceased to resist and her head fell passively to its former place on his shoulder he did not try to speak any word of comfort he only held her close to him when she looked up as they entered the village she confronted him with a brilliant smile that ignored her tears  but that night when she followed him to the door she looked him searchingly in the eyes i wonder if you really do despise me bartley she asked  certainly he answered with a jesting smile what for  for showing out my feelings so for not even trying to pretend not to care everything for you  it wouldnt be any use your trying i should know that you did anyway  oh dont laugh bartley dont laugh i dont believe that i ought to ive heard that it makes people sick of you but i cant help iti cant help it and ifif you think im always going to be soand that im going to keep on getting worse and worse and making you so unhappy why youd better break your engagement nowwhile you have a chance  what have you been making me unhappy about i should like to know i thought id been having a very good time  she hid her face against his breast it almost killed me to see you there with her i was so coldmy hands were half frozen holding the reinsand i was so afraid of the colt i didnt know what to do and i had been keeping up my courage on your account and you seemed so long about it all and she could have got in perfectly wellas well as her mother didwithout your help her voice broke in a miserable sob and she clutched herself tighter to him  he smoothed down her hair with his hand why marsh did you think that made me unhappy i didnt mind it a bit i knew what the trouble was at the time but i wasnt going to say anything i knew you would be all right as soon as you could think it over you dont suppose i care anything for that girl  no answered a rueful sob but i wish you didnt have anything to do with her i know shell make trouble for you somehow  well said bartley i cant very well turn her off as long as she does her work but you neednt be worried about making me unhappy if anything i rather liked it it showed how much you did care for me he bent toward her with a look of bright raillery for the parting kiss now then once twice three timesand good night it is     vi   the spectacle of a love affair in which the woman gives more of her heart than the man gives of his is so pitiable that we are apt to attribute a kind of merit to her as if it were a voluntary selfsacrifice for her to love more than her share not only other men but other women look on with this canonizing compassion for women have a lively power of imagining themselves in the place of any sister who suffers in matters of sentiment and are eager to espouse the common cause in commiserating her each of them pictures herself similarly wronged or slighted by the man she likes best and feels how cruel it would be if he were to care less for her than she for him and for the time being in order to realize the situation she loads him with all the sins of omission proper to the culprit in the alien case but possibly there is a compensation in merely loving even where the love given is out of all proportion to the love received  if bartley hubbards sensations and impressions of the day had been at all reasoned that night as he lay thinking it over he could unquestionably have seen many advantages for marcia in the affairperhaps more than for himself but to do him justice he did not formulate these now or in any wise explicitly recognize the favors he was bestowing at twentysix one does not naturally compute them in musing upon the girl to whom one is just betrothed and bartleys mind was a confusion of pleasure he liked so well to think how fond of him marcia was that it did not occur to him then to question whether he were as fond of her it is possible that as he drowsed at last there floated airily through the consciousness which was melting and dispersing itself before the approach of sleep an intimation from somewhere to some one that perhaps the affair need not be considered too seriously but in that mysterious limbo one cannot be sure of what is thought and what is dreamed and bartley always acquitted himself and probably with justice of any want of seriousness  what he did make sure of when he woke was that he was still out of sorts and that he had again that dull headache and his instant longing for sympathy did more than anything else to convince him that he really loved marcia and had never in his obscurest or remotest feeling swerved in his fealty to her in the atmosphere of her devotion yesterday he had so wholly forgotten his sufferings that he had imagined himself well but now he found that he was not well and he began to believe that he was going to have what the country people call a fit of sickness he felt that he ought to be taken care of that he was unfit to work and in his vexation at not being able to go to marcia for comfortit really amounted to nothing lesshe entered upon the days affairs with fretful impatience  the free press was published on tuesdays and monday was always a busy time of preparation the hands were apt also to feel the demoralization that follows a holiday even when it has been a holy day the girls who set the type of the free press had by no means foregone the rights and privileges of their sex in espousing their art and they had their beaux on sunday night like other young ladies it resulted that on monday morning they were nervous and impatient alternating between fits of giggling delight in the interchange of fond reminiscences and the crossness which is pretty sure to disfigure human behavior from want of sleep but ordinarily bartley got on very well with them in spite of the assumption of equality between all classes in equity they stood in secret awe of his personal splendor and the tradition of his achievements at college and in the great world and a flattering joke or a sharp sarcasm from him went a great way with them besides he had an efficient lieutenant in henry bird the young printer who had picked up his trade in the office and who acted as bartleys foreman so far as the establishment had an organization bird had industry and discipline which were contagious and that love of his work which is said to be growing rare among artisans in the modern subdivision of trades this boyfor he was only nineteenworked at his craft early and late out of pleasure in it he seemed one of those simple subordinate natures which are happy in looking up to whatever assumes to be above them he exulted to serve in a world where most people prefer to be served and it is uncertain whether he liked his work better for its own sake or bartleys for whom he did it he was slight and rather delicate in health and it came natural for bartley to patronize him he took him on the long walks of which he was fond and made him in some sort his humble confidant talking to him of himself and his plans with large and braggart vagueness he depended upon bird in a great many things and bird never failed him for he had a basis of constancy that was immovable no said a philosopher from a neighboring loggingcamp who used to hang about the printingoffice a long time after he had got his paper there aint a great deal of natural git up and howl about henry but he stays put in the confidences which bartley used to make bird he promised that when he left the newspaper for the law he would see that no one else succeeded him the young fellow did not need this promise to make him bartleys fast friend but it colored his affection with ambitious enthusiasm to edit and publish a newspaperhis dreams did not go beyond that to devote it to bartleys interest in the political life on which bartley often hinted he might enterthat would be the sweetest privilege of realized success bird already wrote paragraphs for the free press and bartley let him make up a column of news from the city exchanges which was partly written and partly selected  bartley came to the office rather late on monday morning bringing with him the papers from saturday nights mail which had lain unopened over sunday and went directly into his own room without looking into the printingoffice he felt feverish and irritable and he resolved to fill up with selections and let his editorial paragraphing go or get bird to do it he was tired of the work and sick of equity marcias face seemed to look sadly in upon his angry discontent and he no longer wished to go to her for sympathy his door opened and without glancing from the newspaper which he held up before him he asked what is it bird do you want copy  well no mr hubbard answered bird we have copy enough for the force weve got this morning  why whats up demanded bartley dropping his paper  lizzie sawyer has sent word that she is sick and we havent heard or seen anything of hannah morrison  confound the girls said bartley theres always something the matter with them he rubbed his hand over his forehead as if to rub out the dull pain there well he said i must go to work myself then he rose and took hold of the lapels of his coat to pull it off but something in birds look arrested him what is it he asked  old morrison was here just before you came in and said he wanted to see you i think he was drunk said bird anxiously he said he was coming back again  all right let him come replied bartley this is a free countryespecially in equity i suppose he wants hannahs wages raised as usual how much are we behind on the paper henry  were not a great deal behind mr hubbard if we were not so weakhanded  perhaps we can get hannah back during the forenoon at any rate we can ask her honored parent when he comes  where morrison got his liquor was a question that agitated equity from time to time and baffled the officer of the law empowered to see that no strong drink came into the town under conditions which made it impossible even in the loggingcamps and rendered the sale of spirits too precarious for the apothecary who might be supposed to deal in them medicinally morrison never failed of his spree when the mysterious mechanism of his appetite enforced it probably it was some form of bedevilled cider that supplied the material of his debauch but even cider was not easily to be had  morrisons spree was a movable feast and recurred at irregular intervals of two or three or even six weeks but it recurred often enough to keep him poor and his family in a social outlawry against which the kindly instincts of their neighbors struggled in vain mrs morrison was that pariah who in a village like equity cuts herself off from hope by taking in washing and it was a decided rise in the world for hannah a wild girl at school to get a place in the printingoffice her father had applied for it humbly enough at the tremulous and penitent close of one of his long sprees and was grateful to bartley for taking the special interest in her which she reported at home  but the independence of a drunken shoemaker is proverbial and morrisons meek spirit soared into lordly arrogance with his earliest cups the first warning which the community had of his change of attitude was the conspicuous and even defiant closure of his shop and the scornful rejection of custom however urgent or necessitous all equity might go in broken shoes for any patching or halfsoling the people got from him he went about collecting his small dues and paying up his debts as long as the money lasted in token of his resolution not to take any favors from any man thereafter then he retired to his house on one of the by streets and by degrees drank himself past active offence it was of course in his defiant humor that he came to visit bartley who had learned to expect him whenever hannah failed to appear promptly at her work the affair was always easily arranged bartley instantly assented with whatever irony he liked to morrisons demands he refused with overwhelming politeness even to permit him to give himself the trouble to support them by argument he complimented hannah inordinately as one of the most gifted and accomplished ladies of his acquaintance and inquired affectionately after the health of each member of the morrison family when morrison rose to go he always said in shaking hands well sir if there was more like you in equity a poor man could get along youre a gentleman sir after getting some paces away from the street door he stumbled back up the stairs to repeat youre a gentleman hannah came during the day and the wages remained the same neither of the contracting parties regarded the increase so elaborately agreed upon and morrison on becoming sober gratefully ignored the whole transaction though by a curious juggle of his brain he recurred to it in his next spree and advanced in his new demand from the last rise his daughter was now nominally in receipt of an income of forty dollars a week but actually accepted four  bartley on his part enjoyed the business as an agreeable excitement and a welcome relief from the monotony of his official life he never hurried morrisons visits but amused himself by treating him with the most flattering distinction and baffling his arrogance by immediate concession but this morning when morrison came back with a front of uncommon fierceness he merely looked up from his newspapers to which he had recurred and said coolly oh mr morrison good morning i suppose its that little advance that you wish to see me about take a chair what is the increase you ask this time of course i agree to anything  he leaned forward pencil in hand to make a note of the figure morrison should name when the drunkard approached and struck the table in front of him with his fist and blazed upon bartleys face suddenly uplifted with his blue crazy eyes  no sir i wont take a seat and i dont come on no such business no sir he struck the table again and the violence of his blow upset the inkstand  bartley saved himself by suddenly springing away hollo here he shouted what do you mean by this infernal nonsense  what do you mean retorted the drunkard by makin up to my girl  youre a fool cried bartley and drunk  ill show you whether im a fool and ill show you whether im drunk said morrison he opened the door and beckoned to bird with an air of mysterious authority young man come here  bird was used to the indulgence with which bartley treated morrisons tipsy freaks and supposed that he had been called by his consent to witness another agreement to a rise in hannahs wages he came quickly to help get morrison out of the way the sooner and he was astonished to be met by bartley with i dont want you bird  all right answered the boy and he turned to go out of the door  but morrison had planted himself against it and waved bird austerely back i want you he said with drunken impressiveness for a witnesswickwitnesswhile i ask mr hubbard what he means by  hold your tongue cried bartley get out of this he advanced a pace or two toward morrison who stood his ground without swerving  now youyou keep quiet mr hubbard said morrison with a swift drunken change of mood by which he passed from arrogant denunciation to a smooth patronizing mastery of the situation i wish this thing all settled amicicamelcabilly  bartley broke into a helpless laugh at morrisons final failure on a word difficult to sober tongues and the latter went on no casion for bad feeling on either side all i want know is what you mean  well go on cried bartley goodnaturedly and he sat down in his chair which he tilted back and clasping his hands behind his head looked up into morrisons face what do i mean by what  probably morrison had not expected to be categorical or to bring anything like a bill of particulars against bartley and this demand gave him pause what you mean he said at last by always praising her up so  what i said shes a very good girl and a very bright one you dont deny that  nono matter what i deny whatwhat you lend her all them books for  to improve her mind you dont object to that i thought you once thanked me for taking an interest in her  dont you mind what i object to and what i thank you for said morrison with dignity i know what im about  i begin to doubt but get on im in a great hurry this morning said bartley  morrison seemed to be making a mental examination of his stock of charges while the strain of keeping his upright position began to tell upon him and he swayed to and fro against the door whats that word you sent her by my boy satday night  that she was a smart girl and would be sure to get on if she was goodor words to that effect i trust there was no offence in that mr morrison  morrison surrendered himself to another season of cogitation in which he probably found his vagueness growing upon him he ended by fumbling in all his pockets and bringing up from the last a crumpled scrap of paper what youwhat you say that  bartley took the extended scrap with an easy air miss morrisons handwriting i think he held it up before him and read aloud i love my love with an h because he is handsome this appears to be a confidence of miss morrison to her muse whom do you think she refers to mr morrison  whatswhats the first letter your name demanded morrison with an effort to collect his dispersing severity  b promptly replied bartley perhaps this concerns you henry your name begins with an h he passed the paper up over his head to bird who took it silently you see he continued addressing bird but looking at morrison as he spoke mr morrison wishes to convict me of an attempt upon miss hannahs affections have you anything else to urge mr morrison  morrison slid at last from his difficult position into a convenient chair and struggled to keep himself from doubling forward i want know what you mean he said with dogged iteration  ill show you what i mean said bartley with an ugly quiet while his mustache began to twitch he sprang to his feet and seized morrison by the collar pulling him up out of the chair till he held him clear of the floor and opened the door with his other hand dont show your face here againyou or your girl either still holding the man by the collar he pushed him before him through the office and gave him a final thust out of the outer door  bartley returned to his room in a white heat miserable tipsy rascal he panted i wonder who has set him on to this thing  bird stood pale and silent still nolding the crumpled scrap of paper in his hand  i shouldnt be surprised if that impudent little witch herself had put him up to it shes capable of it said bartley fumbling aimlessly about on his table in his wrath without looking at bird  its a lie said bird  bartley started as if the other had struck him and as he glared at bird the anger went out of his face for pure amazement are you out of your mind henry he asked calmly perhaps youre drunk too this morning the devil seems to have got into pretty much everybody  its a lie repeated the boy while the tears sprang to his eyes shes as good a girl as marcia gaylord is any day  better go away henry said bartley with a deadly sort of gentleness  im going away answered the boy his face twisted with weeping ive done my last days work for you he pulled down his shirtsleeves and buttoned them at the wrists while the tears ran out over his facehelpless tears the sign of his womanish tenderness his womanish weakness  bartley continued to glare at him why i do believe youre in love with her yourself you little fool  oh ive been a fool cried bird a fool to think as much of you as i always havea fool to believe that you were a gentleman and wouldnt take a mean advantage i was a fool to suppose you wanted to do her any good when you came praising and flattering her and turning her head  well then said bartley with harsh insolence dont be a fool any longer if youre in love with her you havent any quarrel with me my boy she flies at higher game than humble newspaper editors the head of willetts lumbering gang is your man and so you may go and tell that old sot her father why henry you dont mean to say you care anything for that girl  and do you mean to say you havent done everything you could to turn her head since shes been in this office she used to like me well enough at school all men are blind and jealous children alike when it comes to question of a woman between them and this poor boys passion was turning him into a tiger dont come to me with your lies any more here his rage culminated and with a blind cry of ay he struck the paper which he had kept in his hand into bartleys face  the demons whatever they were of anger remorse pride shame were at work in bartleys heart too and he returned the blow as instantly as if birds touch had set the mechanism of his arm in motion in contempt of the others weakness he struck with the flat of his hand but the blow was enough bird fell headlong and the concussion of his head upon the floor did the rest he lay senseless     vii   bartley hung over the boy with such a terror in his soul as he had never had before he believed that he had killed him and in this conviction came with the simultaneity of events in dreams the sense of all his blame of which the blow given for a blow seemed the least part he was not so wrong in that as he was wrong in what led to it he did not abhor in himself so much the wretch who had struck his brother down as the light and empty fool who had trifled with that silly hoyden the follies that seemed so amusing and resultless in their time had ripened to this bitter effect and he knew that he and not she was mainly culpable her selfbetrayal however it came about was proof that they were more serious with her than with him and he could not plead to himself even the poor excuse that his fancy had been caught amidst the anguish of his selfcondemnation the need to conceal what he had done occurred to him he had been holding birds head in his arms and imploring him henry henry wake up in a low husky voice but now he turned to the door and locked it and the lie by which he should escape sprang to his tongue he died in a fit he almost believed it as it murmured itself from his lips there was no mark no bruise nothing to show that he had touched the boy suddenly he felt the lie choke him he pulled down the window to let in the fresh air and this pure breath of heaven blew into his darkened spirit and lifted there a little the vapors which were thickening in it the horror of having to tell that lie even if he should escape by it all his life long till he was a gray old man and to keep the truth forever from his lips presented itself to him as intolerable slavery oh my god he spoke aloud how can i bear that and it was in selfpity that he revolted from it few men love the truth for its own sake and bartley was not one of these but he practised it because his experience had been that lies were difficult to manage and that they were a burden on the mind he was not candid he did not shun concealments and evasions but positive lies he had kept from and now he could not trust one to save his life he unlocked the door and ran out to find help he must do that at last he must do it at any risk no matter what he said afterward when our deeds and motives come to be balanced at the last day let us hope that mercy and not justice may prevail  it must have been mercy that sent the doctor at that moment to the apothecarys on the other side of the street and enabled bartley to get him up into his office without publicity or explanation other than that henry bird seemed to be in a fit the doctor lifted the boys head and explored his bosom with his hand  is heis he dead gasped bartley and the words came so mechanically from his tongue that he began to believe he had not spoken them when the doctor answered  no how did this happen tell me exactly  we had a quarrel he struck me i knocked him down bartley delivered up the truth as a prisoner of waror a captive brigand perhapsparts with his weapons one by one  very well said the doctor get some water  bartley poured some out of the pitcher on his table and the doctor wetting his handkerchief drew it again and again over birds forehead  i never meant to hurt him said bartley i didnt even intend to strike him when he hit me  intentions have very little to do with physical effects replied the doctor sharply henry  the boy opened his eyes and muttering feebly my head closed them again  theres a concussion here said the doctor we had better get him home drive my sleigh over will you from smiths  bartley went out into the glare of the sun which beat upon him like the eye of the world but the street was really empty as it often was in the middle of the forenoon at equity the apothecary who saw him untying the doctors horse came to his door and said jocosely hello doc whos sick  i am said bartley solemnly and the apothecary laughed at his readiness bartley drove round to the back of the printingoffice where the farmers delivered his wood i thought we could get him out better that way he explained and the doctor who had to befriend a great many concealments in his practice silently spared bartleys disingenuousness  the rush of the cold air as they drove rapidly down the street with that limp shape between them revived the boy and he opened his eyes and made an effort to hold himself erect but he could not and when they got him into the warm room at home he fainted again his mother had met them at the door of her poor little house without any demonstration of grief or terror she was far too well acquainted in her widowhoodbereft of all her children but this sonwith sickness and death to show even surprise if she felt it when bartley broke out into his lamentable confession oh mrs bird this is my work she only wrung her hands and answered your work oh mr hubbard he thought the world of you and did not ask him how or why he had done it after they had got henry on the bed bartley was no longer of use there but they let him remain in the corner into which he had shrunk and from which he watched all that went on with a dry mouth and faltering breath it began to appear to him that he was very young to be involved in a misfortune like this he did not understand why it should have happened to him but he promised himself that if henry lived he would try to be a better man in every way  after he had lost all hope the time seemed so long the boy on the bed opened his eyes once more and looked round while bartley still sat with his face in his hands wherewhere is mr hubbard he faintly asked with a bewildered look at his mother and the doctor  bartley heard the weak voice and staggered forward and fell on his knees beside the bed here here here i am henry oh henry i didnt intend he stopped at the word and hid his face in the coverlet  the boy lay as if trying to make out what had happened and the doctor told him that he had fainted after a time he put out his hand and laid it on bartleys head yes but i dont understand what makes him cry  they looked at bartley who had lifted his head and he went over the whole affair except so far as it related to hannah morrison he did not spare himself he had often found that strenuous selfcondemnation moved others to compassion and besides it was his nature to seek the relief of full confession but henry heard him through with a blank countenance dont you remember bartley implored at last  no i dont remember i only remember that there seemed to be something the matter with my head this morning  that was the trouble with me too said bartley i must have been crazyi must have been insanewhen i struck you i cant account for it  i dont remember it answered the boy  thats all right said the doctor dont try i guess you better let him alone now he added to bartley with such a significant look that the young man retired from the bedside and stood awkwardly apart hell get along you neednt be anxious about leaving him hell be better alone  there was no mistaking this hint well well said bartley humbly ill go but id rather stay and watch with himi shant eat or sleep till hes on foot again and i cant leave till you tell me that you forgive me mrs bird i never dreamedi didnt intend he could not go on  i dont suppose you meant to hurt henry said the mother you always pretended to be so fond of him and he thought the world of you but i dont see how you could do it i presume it was all right  no it was all wrongor so nearly all wrong that i must ask your forgiveness on that ground i loved himi thought the world of him too id ten thousand times rather have hurt myself pleaded bartley dont let me go till you say that you forgive me  ill see how henry gets along said mrs bird i dont know as i could rightly say i forgive you just yet doubtless she was dealing conscientiously with herself and with him i like to be sure of a thing when i say it she added  the doctor followed him into the hall and bartley could not help turning to him for consolation i think mrs bird is very unjust doctor ive done everything i could and said everything to explain the matter and ive blamed myself where i cant feel that i was to blame and yet you see how she holds out against me  i dare say answered the doctor dryly shell feel differently as she says if the boy gets along  bartley dropped his hat to the floor get along whywhy you think hell get well now dont you doctor  oh yes i was merely using her words hell get well  andand it wont affect his mind will it i thought it was very strange his not remembering anything about it  thats a very common phenomenon said the doctor the patient usually forgets everything that occurred for some little time before the accident in cases of concussion of the brain bartley shuddered at the phrase but he could not ask anything further what i wanted to say to you continued the doctor was that this may be a long thing and there may have to be an inquiry into it youre lawyer enough to understand what that means i should have to testify to what i know and i only know what you told me  why you dont doubt  no sir ive no reason to suppose you havent told me the truth as far as it goes if you have thought it advisable to keep anything back from me you may wish to tell the whole story to an attorney  i havent kept anything back doctor wills said bartley ive told you everythingeverything that concerned the quarrel that drunken old scoundrel of a morrison got us into it he accused me of making love to his daughter and henry was jealousi never knew he cared anything for her i hated to tell you this before his mother but this is the whole truth so help me god  i supposed it was something of the kind replied the doctor im sorry for you you cant keep it from having an ugly look if it gets out and it may have to be made public i advise you to go and see squire gaylord hes always stood your friend  ii was just going there said bartley and this was true  through all he had felt the need of some sort of retrievalof reestablishing himself in his own esteem by some signal stroke and he could think of but one thing it was not his fault if he believed that this must combine selfsacrifice with safety and the greatest degree of humiliation with the largest sum of consolation he was none the less resolved not to spare himself at all in offering to release marcia from her engagement the fact that he must now also see her father upon the legal aspect of his case certainly complicated the affair and detracted from its heroic quality he could not tell which to see first for he naturally wished his action to look as well as possible and if he went first to marcia and she condemned him he did not know in what figure he should approach her father if on the other hand he went first to squire gaylord the old lawyer might insist that the engagement was already at an end by bartleys violent act and might well refuse to let a man in his position even see his daughter he lagged heavyheartedly up the middle of the street and left the question to solve itself at the last moment but when he reached squire gaylords gate it seemed to him that it would be easier to face the father first and this would be the right way too  he turned aside to the little office and opened the door without knocking and as he stood with the knob in his hand trying to habituate his eyes full of the snowglare to the dimmer light within he heard a rapturous cry of why bartley and he felt marcias arms flung around his neck his burdened heart yearned upon her with a tenderness he had not known before he realized the preciousness of an embrace that might be the last but he dared not put down his lips to hers she pushed back her head in a little wonder and saw the haggardness of his face while he discovered her father looking at them how strong and pure the fire in her must be when her fathers presence could not abash her from this betrayal of her love bartley sickened and he felt her arms slip from his neck whywhywhat is the matter  in spite of some vaguely magnanimous intention to begin at the beginning and tell the whole affair just as it happened bartley found himself wishing to put the best face on it at first and trust to chances to make it all appear well he did not speak at once and marcia pressed him into a chair and then like an eager child who will not let its friend escape till it has been told what it wishes to know she set herself on his knee and put her hand on his shoulder he looked at her father not at her while he spoke hoarsely i have had trouble with henry bird squire gaylord and ive come to tell you about it  the old squire did not speak but marcia repeated in amazement with henry bird  he struck me  henry bird struck you cried the girl i should like to know why henry bird struck you when youve made so much of him and hes always pretended to be so grateful  bartley still looked at her father and i struck him back  you did perfectly right bartley exclaimed marcia and i should have despised you if you had let any one run over you struck you i declare  he did not heed her but continued to look at her father i didnt intend to hurt himi hit him with my open handbut he fell and struck his head on the floor im afraid it hurt him pretty badly he felt the pang that thrilled through the girl at his words and her hand trembled on his shoulder but she did not take it away  the old man came forward from the pile of books which he and marcia had been dusting and sat down in a chair on the other side of the stove he pushed back his hat from his forehead and asked drily what commenced it  bartley hesitated it was this part of the affair which he would rather have imparted to marcia after seeing it with her fathers eyes or possibly if her father viewed it favorably have had him tell her the old man noticed his reluctance hadnt you better go into the house marsh  she merely gave him a look of utter astonishment for answer and did not move he laughed noiselessly and said to bartley go on  it was that drunken old scoundrel of a morrison who began it cried bartley in angry desperation marcia dropped her hand from his shoulder while her father worked his jaws upon the bit of stick he had picked up from the pile of wood and put between his teeth you know that whenever he gets on a spree he comes to the office and wants hannahs wages raised  marcia sprang to her feet oh i knew it i knew it i told you she would get you into trouble i told you so she stood clinching her hands and her father bent his keen scrutiny first upon her and then upon the frowning face with which bartley regarded her  did he come to have her wages raised today  no  what did he come for he involuntarily assumed the attitude of a lawyer crossquestioning a slippery witness  he came forhe camehe accused me ofhe said i hadmade love to his confounded girl  marcia gasped  what made him think you had  it wasnt necessary for him to have any reason he was drunk i had been kind to the girl and favored her all i could because she seemed to be anxious to do her work well and i praised her for trying  umumph commented the squire and that made henry bird jealous  it seems that he was fond of her i never dreamed of such a thing and when i put old morrison out of the office and came back he called me a liar and struck me in the face he did not lift his eyes to the level of marcias who in her gray dress stood there like a gray shadow and did not stir or speak  and you never had made up to the girl at all  no  kissed her i suppose now and then suggested the squire  bartley did not reply  flattered her up and told how much you thought of her occasionally  i dont see what that has to do with it said bartley with a sulky defiance  no i suppose its what youd do with most any pretty girl returned the squire he was silent awhile and so you knocked henry down what happened then  i tried to bring him to and then i went for the doctor he revived and we got him home to his mothers the doctor says he will get well but he advised me to come and see you  any witnesses of the assault  no we were alone in my own room  told any one else about it  i told the doctor and mrs bird henry couldnt remember it at all  couldnt remember about morrison or what made him mad at you  nothing  and thats all about it  yes  the two men had talked across the stove at each other practically ignoring the girl who stood apart from them gray in the face as her dress and suppressing a passion which had turned her as rigid as stone  now marcia said her father kindly better go into the house thats all there is of it  no that isnt all she answered give me my ring bartley heres yours she slipped it off her finger and put it into his mechanically extended hand  marcia he implored confronting her  give me my ring please  he obeyed and put it into her hand she slipped it back on the finger from which she had so fondly suffered him to take it yesterday and replace it with his own  ill go into the house now father good by bartley her eyes were perfectly clear and dry and her voice controlled and as he stood passive before her she took him round the neck and pressed against his face once and twice and thrice her own gray face in which all love and unrelenting and despair were painted once and again she held him and looked him in the eyes as if to be sure it was he then with a last pressure of her face to his she released him and passed out of the door  shes been talking about you here all the morning said the squire with a sort of quiet absence as if nothing in particular had happened and he were commenting on a little fact that might possibly interest bartley he ruminated upon the fragment of wood in his mouth awhile before he added i guess she wont want to talk about you any more i drew you out a little on that hannah morrison business because i wanted her to understand just what kind of fellow you were you see it isnt the trouble youve got into with henry bird thats killed her its the cause of the trouble i guess if it had been anything else shed have stood by you but you see thats the one thing she couldnt bear and im glad its happened now instead of afterwards i guess youre one of that kind mr hubbard  squire gaylord cried bartley upon my sacred word of honor there isnt any more of this thing than ive told you and i think its pretty hard to be thrown over forfor  fooling with a pretty girl when you get a chance and the girl seems to like it yes it is rather hard and i suppose you havent even seen her since you were engaged to marcia  of course not that is  its a kind of retroactive legislation on marcias part said the squire rubbing his chin and thats against one of the first principles of law but women dont seem to be able to grasp that idea theyre queer about some things they appear to think they marry a mans whole lifehis past as well as his futureand that makes em particular and they distinguish between different kinds of men youll find em pinning their faith to a fellow whos been through pretty much everything and swearing by him from the word go and another chap whos never done anything very bad they wont trust half a minute out of their sight well i guess marcia is of rather a jealous disposition he concluded as if bartley had urged this point  shes very unjust to me bartley began  oh yesshes unjust said her father i dont deny that but it wouldnt be any use talking to her shed probably turn round with some excuse about what she had suffered and that would be the end of it she would say that she couldnt go through it again well it ought to be a comfort to you to think you dont care a great deal about it  but i do care exclaimed bartley i care all the world for it i  since when interrupted the squire do you mean to say that you didnt know till you asked her yesterday that marcia was in love with you  bartley was silent  i guess you knew it as much as a year ago didnt you everybody else did but youd just as soon it had been hannah morrison or any other pretty girl you didnt care but marcia did you see she wasnt one of the kind that let any goodlooking fellow make love to them it was because it was you and you knew it were plain men mr hubbard and i guess youll get over this in time i shouldnt wonder if you began to mend right away  bartley found himself helpless in the face of this passionless sarcasm he could have met stormy indignation or any sort of invective in kind but the contemptuous irony with which his pretensions were treated the cold scrutiny with which his motives were searched was something he could not meet he tried to pull himself together for some sort of protest but he ended by hanging his head in silence he always believed that squire gaylord had liked him and here he was treating him like his bitterest enemy and seeming to enjoy his misery he could not understand it he thought it extremely unjust and past all the measure of his offence this was true perhaps but it is doubtful if bartley would have accepted any suffering no matter how nicely proportioned in punishment of his wrongdoing he sat hanging his head and taking his pain in rebellious silence with a gathering hate in his heart for the old man  mwell said the squire at last rising from his chair i guess i must be going  bartley sprang to his feet aghast youre not going to leave me in the lurch are you youre not  oh i shall take care of you young mandont be afraid ive stood your friend too long and your names been mixed up too much with my girls for me to let you come to shame openly if i can help it im going to see dr wills about you and im going to see mrs bird and try to patch it up somehow  andandwhere shall i go gasped bartley  you might go to the devil for all i cared for you said the old man with the contempt which he no longer cared to make ironical but i guess you better go back to your office and go to work as if nothing had happenedtill something does happen i shall close the paper out as soon as i can i was thinking of doing that just before you came in i was thinking of taking you into the law business with me marcia and i were talking about it here but i guess you wouldnt like the idea now  he seemed to get a bitter satisfaction out of these mockeries from which indeed he must have suffered quite as much as bartley but he ended sadly and almost compassionately with come come you must start some time and bartley dragged his leaden weight out of the door the squire closed it after him but he did not accompany him down the street it was plain that he did not wish to be any longer alone with bartley and the young man suspected with a sting of shame that he scorned to be seen with him     viii   the more bartley dwelt upon his hard case during the week that followed the more it appeared to him that he was punished out of all proportion to his offence he was in no mood to consider such mercies as that he had been spared from seriously hurting bird and that squire gaylord and doctor wills had united with henrys mother in saving him from open disgrace the physician indeed had perhaps indulged a professional passion for hushing the matter up rather than any pity for bartley he probably had the scientific way of looking at such questions and saw much physical cause for moral effects he refrained with the physicians reticence from inquiring into the affair but he would not have thought bartley without excuse under the circumstances in regard to the relative culpability in matters of the kind his knowledge of women enabled him to take much the view of the womans share that other women take  but bartley was ignorant of the doctors leniency and associated him with squire gaylord in the feeling that made his last week in equity a period of social outlawry there were moments in which he could not himself escape the same point of view he could rebel against the severity of the condemnation he had fallen under in the eyes of marcia and her father he could in the light of example and usage laugh at the notion of harm in his behavior to hannah morrison yet he found himself looking at it as a treachery to marcia certainly she had no right to question his conduct before his engagement yet if he knew that marcia loved him and was waiting with lifeanddeath anxiety for some word of love from him it was cruelly false to play with another at the passion which was such a tragedy to her this was the point that put aside however often still presented itself and its recurrence if he could have known it was mercy and reprieve from the only source out of which these could come  hannah morrison did not return to the printingoffice and bird was still sick though it was now only a question of time when he should be out again bartley visited him some hours every day and sat and suffered under the quiet condemnation of his mothers eyes she had kept bartleys secret with the same hardness with which she had refused him her forgiveness and the village had settled down into an ostensible acceptance of the theory of a faint as the beginning of birds sickness with such other conjectures as the doctor freely permitted each to form bartley found his chief consolation in the work which kept him out of the way of a great deal of question he worked far into the night as he must to make up for the force that was withdrawn from the office at the same time he wrote more than ever in the paper and he discovered in himself that dual life of which every one who sins or sorrows is sooner or later aware that strange separation of the intellectual activity from the suffering of the soul by which the mind toils on in a sort of ironical indifference to the pangs that wring the heart the realization that in some ways his brain can get on perfectly well without his conscience  there was a great deal of sympathy felt for bartley at this time and his popularity in equity was never greater than now when his life there was drawing to a close the spectacle of his diligence was so impressive that when on the following sunday the young minister who had succeeded to the pulpit of the orthodox church preached a sermon on the beauty of industry from the text consider the lilies there were many who said that they thought of bartley the whole while and onea ladyasked mr savin if he did not have mr hubbard in mind in the picture he drew of the heroic worker they wished that bartley could have heard that sermon  marcia had gone away early in the week to visit in the town where she used to go to school and bartley took her going away as a sign that she wished to put herself wholly beyond his reach or any danger of relenting at sight of him he talked with no one about her and going and coming irregularly to his meals and keeping himself shut up in his room when he was not at work he left people very little chance to talk with him but they conjectured that he and marcia had an understanding and some of the ladies used such scant opportunity as he gave them to make sly allusions to her absence and his desolate condition they were confirmed in their surmise by the fact known from actual observation that bartley had not spoken a word to any other young lady since marcia went away  look here my friend said the philosopher from the loggingcamp when he came in for his paper on the tuesday afternoon following seems to me from what i hear tell around here youre tryin to kill yourself on this newspaper now it wont do i tell you it wont do  bartley was addressing for the mail the papers which one of the girls was folding what are you going to do about it he demanded of his sympathizer with whimsical sullenness not troubling himself to look up at him  well i haint exactly settled yet replied the philosopher who was of a tall lank figure and of a mighty brown beard but ive been around pretty much everywhere and i find that about the poorest use you can put a man to is to kill him  it depends a good deal on the man said bartley but thats stale kinney its the old formula of the anticapitalpunishment fellows try something else theyre not talking of hanging me yet he kept on writing and the philosopher stood over him with a humorous twinkle of enjoyment at bartleys readiness  well ill allow its old he admitted sos homer  yes but you dont pretend that you wrote homer  kinney laughed mightily then he leaned forward and slapped bartley on the shoulder with his newspaper look here he exclaimed i like you  oh try some other tack lots of fellows like me bartley kept on writing i gave you your paper didnt i kinney  you mean that you want me to get out  far be it from me to say so  this delighted kinney as much as the last refinement of hospitality would have pleased another man look here he said i want you should come out and see our camp i cant fool away any more time on you here but i want you should come out and see us give you something to write about hey  the invitation comes at a time when circumstances over which i have no control oblige me to decline it i admire your prudence kinney  no honest injian now protested kinney take a day off and fill up with dead advertisements thats the way they used to do out in alkali city when they got short of help on the eagle and we liked it just as well  now you are talking sense said bartley looking up at him how far is it to your settlement  two miles if youre goin three and a half if you aint  when are you coming in  im in now  i cant go with you today  well howll tomorrow morning suit  tomorrow morning will suit said bartley  all right if anybody comes to see the editor tomorrow morning marilla said kinney to the girl you tell em hes sick and gone aloggin and wont be back till saturday say he added laying his hand on bartleys shoulder you aint foolin  if i am replied bartley just mention it  good said kinney tomorrow it is then  bartley finished addressing the newspapers and then he put them up in wrappers and packages for the mail you can go now marilla he said to the girl ill leave some copy for you and kitty youll find it on my table in the morning  all right answered the girl  bartley went to his supper which he ate with more relish than he had felt for his meals since his troubles began and he took part in the suppertable talk with something of his old audacity the change interested the lady boarders and they agreed that he must have had a letter he returned to his office and worked till nine oclock writing and selecting matter out of his exchanges he spent most of the time in preparing the funny column which was a favorite feature in the free press then he put the copy where the girls would find it in the morning and leaving the door unlocked took his way up the street toward squire gaylords  he knew that he should find the lawyer in his office and he opened the office door without knocking and went in he had not met squire gaylord since the morning of his dismissal and the old man had left him for the past eight days without any sign as to what he expected of bartley or of what he intended to do in his affair  they looked at each other but exchanged no sort of greeting as bartley unbidden took a chair on the opposite side of the stove the squire did not put down the book he had been reading  ive come to see what youre going to do about the free press said bartley  the old man rubbed his bristling jaw that seemed even lanker than when bartley saw it last he waited almost a minute before he replied i dont know as ive got any call to tell you  then ill tell you what im going to do about it retorted bartley im going to leave it ive done my last days work on that paper do you think he cried angrily that im going to keep on in the dark and let you consult your pleasure as to my future no sir you dont know your man quite mr gaylord  youve got over your scare said the lawyer  ive got over my scare bartley retorted  and you think because youre not afraid any longer that youre out of danger i know my man as well as you do i guess  if you think i care for the danger i dont you may do what you please whatever you do i shall know it isnt out of kindness for me i didnt believe from the first that the law could touch me and i wasnt uneasy on that account but i didnt want to involve myself in a public scandal for miss gaylords sake miss gaylord has released me from any obligations to her and now you may go ahead and do what you like each of the men knew how much truth there was in this but for the moment in his anger bartley believed himself sincere and there is no question but his defiance was so squire gaylord made him no answer and after a minute of expectation bartley added at any rate ive done with the free press i advise you to stop the paper and hand the office over to henry bird when he gets about im going out to willetts loggingcamp tomorrow and im coming back to equity on saturday youll know where to find me till then and after that you may look me up if you want me  he rose to go but stopped with his hand on the doorknob at a sound preliminary to speaking which the old man made in his throat bartley stopped hoping for a further pretext of quarrel but the lawyer merely asked wheres the key  its in the office door  the old man now looked at him as if he no longer saw him and bartley went out balked of his purpose in part and in that degree so much the more embittered  squire gaylord remained an hour longer then he blew out his lamp and left the little office for the night a light was burning in the kitchen and he made his way round to the back door of the house and let himself in his wife was there sitting before the stove in those last delicious moments before going to bed when all the house is mellowed to such a warmth that it seems hard to leave it to the cold and dark in this poor lady who had so long denied herself spiritual comfort there was a certain obscure luxury she liked little dainties of the table she liked soft warmth an easy cushion it was doubtless in the disintegration of the finer qualities of her nature that as they grew older together she threw more and more the burden of acute feeling upon her husband to whose doctrine of life she had submitted but had never been reconciled marriage is with all its disparities a much more equal thing than appears and the meek little wife who has all the advantage of public sympathy knows her power over her oppressor and at some tender spot in his affections or his nerves can inflict an anguish that will avenge her for years of coarser aggression thrown in upon herself in so vital a matter as her religion mrs gaylord had involuntarily come to live largely for herself though her talk was always of her husband she gave up for him as she believed her souls salvation but she held him to account for the uttermost farthing of the price she padded herself round at every point where she could have suffered through her sensibilities and lived soft and snug in the shelter of his iron will and indomitable courage it was not apathy that she had felt when their children died one after another but an obscure and formless exultation that mr gaylord would suffer enough for both  marcia was the youngest and her mother left her training almost wholly to her father she sometimes said that she never supposed the child would live she did not actually urge this in excuse but she had the appearance of doing so and she held aloof from them both in their mutual relations with mildly critical reserves they spoiled each other as father and daughter are apt to do when left to themselves what was good in the child certainly received no harm from his indulgence and what was naughty was after all not so very naughty she was passionate but she was generous and if she showed a jealous temperament that must hereafter make her unhappy for the time being it charmed and flattered her father to have her so fond of him that she could not endure any rivalry in his affection  her education proceeded fitfully he would not let her be forced to household tasks that she disliked and as a little girl she went to school chiefly because she liked to go and not because she would have been obliged to it if she had not chosen when she grew older she wished to go away to school and her father allowed her he had no great respect for boardingschools but if marcia wanted to try it he was willing to humor the joke  what resulted was a great proficiency in the things that pleased her and ignorance of the other things her father bought her a piano on which she did not play much and he bought her whatever dresses she fancied he never came home from a journey without bringing her something and he liked to take her with him when he went away to other places she had been several times at portland and once at montreal he was very proud of her he could not see that any one was betterlooking or dressed any better than his girl  he came into the kitchen and sat down with his hat on and taking his chin between his fingers moved uneasily about on his chair  whats brought you in so early asked his wife  well i got through he briefly explained after a while he said bartley hubbards been out there  you dont mean t he knew she  no he didnt know anything about that he came to tell me he was going away  well i dont know what youre going to do mr gaylord said his wife shifting the responsibility wholly upon him d he seem to want to make it up  mno said the squire he was on his high horse he knows he aint in any danger now  aint you afraid shell carry on dreadfully when she finds out t hes gone for good asked mrs gaylord with a sort of implied satisfaction that the carrying on was not to affect her  myes said the squire i suppose shell carry on but i dont know what to do about it sometimes i almost wish id tried to make it up between em that day but i thought shed better see once for all what sort of man she was going in for if she married him its too late now to do anything the fellow came in tonight for a quarrel and nothing else i could see that and i didnt give him any chance  you feel sure asked mrs gaylord impartially that marcia want too particular  no miranda i dont feel sure of anything except that its past your bedtime you better go ill sit up awhile yet i came in because i couldnt settle my mind to anything out there  he took off his hat in token of his intending to spend the rest of the evening at home and put it on the table at his elbow  his wife sewed at the mending in her lap without offering to act upon his suggestion its plain to be seen that she cant get along without him  shell have to now replied the squire  im afraid said mrs gaylord softly that shell be down sick she dont look as if shed slept any great deal since shes been gone i d know as i like very much to see her looking the way she does i guess youve got to take her off somewheres  why shes just been off and couldnt stay  thats because she thought he was here yet but if hes gone it wont be the same thing  well weve got to fight it out some way said the squire it wouldnt do to give in to it now it always was too much of a onesided thing at the best and if we tried now to mend it up it would be ridiculous i dont believe he would come back at all now and if he did he wouldnt come back on any equal terms hed want to have everything his own way mno said the squire as if confirming himself in a conclusion often reached already in his own mind i saw by the way he began tonight that there wasnt anything to be done with him it was fight from the word go  well said mrs gaylord with gentle sceptical interest in the outcome if youve made up your mind to that i hope youll be able to carry it through  thats what ive made up my mind to said her husband  mrs gaylord rolled up the sewing in her workbasket and packed it away against the side bracing it with several pairs of newly darned socks and stockings neatly folded one into the other she took her time for this and when she rose at last to go out with her basket in her hand the door opened in her face and marcia entered mrs gaylord shrank back and then slipped round behind her daughter and vanished the girl took no notice of her mother but went and sat down on her fathers knee throwing her arms round his neck and dropping her haggard face on his shoulder she had arrived at home a few hours earlier having driven over from a station ten miles distant on a road that did not pass near equity after giving as much of a shock to her mothers mild nature as it was capable of receiving by her unexpected return she had gone to her own room and remained ever since without seeing her father he put up his thin old hand and passed it over her hair but it was long before either of them spoke  at last marcia lifted her head and looked her father in the face with a smile so pitiful that he could not bear to meet it well father she said  well marsh he answered huskily what do you think of me now  im glad to have you back again he replied  you know why i came  yes i guess i know  she put down her head again and moaned and cried father father with dry sobs when she looked up confronting him with her tearless eyes what shall i do what shall i do she demanded desolately  he tried to clear his throat to speak but it required more than one effort to bring the words i guess you better go along with me up to boston im going up the first of the week  no she said quietly  the change would do you good its a long while since youve been away from home her father urged  she looked at him in sad reproach of his uncandor you know theres nothing the matter with me father you know what the trouble is he was silent he could not face the trouble ive heard people talk of a heartache she went on i never believed there was really such a thing but i know there is now theres a pain here she pressed her hand against her breast its sore with aching what shall i do i shall have to live through it somehow  if you dont feel exactly well said her father i guess you better see the doctor  what shall i tell him is the matter with me that i want bartley hubbard he winced at the words but she did not he knows that already everybody in town does its never been any secret i couldnt hide it from the first day i saw him id just as lief as not they should say i was dying for him i shall not care what they say when im dead  youd oughtntyoud oughtnt to talk that way marcia said her father gently  what difference she demanded scornfully there was truly no difference so far as concerned any creed of his and he was too honest to make further pretence what shall i do she went on again ive thought of praying but what would be the use  ive never denied that there was a god marcia said her father  oh i know that kind of god well well i know that i talk like a crazy person do you suppose it was providential my being with you in the office that morning when bartley came in  no said her father i dont i think it was an accident  mother said it was providential my finding him out before it was too late  i think it was a good thing the fellow has the making of a firstclass scoundrel in him  do you think hes a scoundrel now she asked quietly  he hasnt had any great opportunity yet said the old man conscientiously sparing him  well then im sorry i found him out yes if i hadnt i might have married him and perhaps if i had died soon i might never have found him out he could have been good to me a year or two and then if i died i should have been safe yes i wish he could have deceived me till after we were married then i couldnt have borne to give him up may be  you would have given him up even then and thats the only thing that reconciles me to it now im sorry for you my girl but youd have made me sorrier then sooner or later hed have broken your heart  hes broken it now said the girl calmly  oh no he hasnt replied her father with a false cheerfulness that did not deceive her youre young and youll get over it i mean to take you away from here for a while i mean to take you up to boston and on to new york i shouldnt care if we went as far as washington i guess when youve seen a little more of the world you wont think bartley hubbards the only one in it  she looked at him so intently that he thought she must be pleased at his proposal do you think i could get him back she asked  her father lost his patience it was a relief to be angry no i dont think so i know you couldnt and you ought to be ashamed of mentioning such a thing  oh ashamed no ive got past that i have no shame any more where hes concerned oh id give the world if i could call him backif i could only undo what i did i was wild i wasnt reasonable i wouldnt listen to him i drove him away without giving him a chance to say a word of course he must hate me now what makes you think he wouldnt come back she asked  i know he wouldnt answered her father with a sort of groan hes going to leave equity for one thing and  going to leave equity she repeated absently then he felt her tremble how do you know hes going she turned upon her father and fixed him sternly with her eyes  do you suppose he would stay after whats happened any longer than he could help  how do you know hes going she repeated  he told me  she stood up he told you when  tonight  why wherewhere did you see him she whispered  in the office  sincesincei came bartley been here and you didnt tell meyou didnt let me know they looked at each other in silence at last when is he going she asked  tomorrow morning  she sat down in the chair which her mother had left and clutched the back of another on which her fingers opened and closed convulsively while she caught her breath in irregular gasps she broke into a low moaning at last the expression of abject defeat in the struggle she had waged with herself her father watched her with dumb compassion better go to bed marcia he said with the same dry calm as if he had been sending her away after some pleasant evening which she had suffered to run too far into the night  dont you thinkdont you thinkhell have to see you again before he goes she made out to ask  no hes finished up with me said the old man  well then she cried desperately youll have to go to him father and get him to come i cant help it i cant give him up youve got to go to him now fatheryes yes you have youve got to go and tell him go and get him to come for mercys sake tell him that im sorrythat i beg his pardonthat i didnt thinki didnt understandthat i knew he didnt do anything wrong she rose and placing her hand on her fathers shoulder accented each entreaty with a little push  he looked up into her face with a haggard smile of sympathy youre crazy marcia he said gently  dont laugh she cried im not crazy now but i was thenyes stark staring crazy look here father i want to tell youi want to explain to you she dropped upon his knee again and tremblingly passed her arm round his neck you see i had just told him the day before that i shouldnt care for anything that happened before we were engaged and then at the very first thing i went and threw him off and i had no right to do it he knows that and thats what makes him so hard towards me but if you go and tell him that i see now i was all wrong and that i beg his pardon and then ask him to give me one more trial just one moreyou can do as much as that for me cant you  oh you poor crazy girl groaned her father dont you see that the trouble is in what the fellow is and not in any particular thing that hes done hes a scamp through and through and hes all the more a scamp when he doesnt know it he hasnt got the first idea of anything but selfishness  no no now ill tell younow ill prove it to you that very sunday when we were out riding together and we met her and her mother and their sleigh upset and he had to lift her back and it made me wild to see him and i wouldnt hardly touch him or speak to him afterwards he didnt say one angry word to me he just pulled me up to him and wouldnt let me be mad and he said that night he didnt mind it a bit because it showed how much i liked him now doesnt that prove hes gooda good deal better than i am and that hell forgive me if youll go and ask him i know he isnt in bed yet he always sits up latehe told me so and youll find him there in his room go straight to his room father dont let anybody see you down in the office i couldnt bear it and slip out with him as quietly as you can but oh do hurry now dont lose another minute  the wild joy sprang into her face as her father rose a joy that it was terrible to him to see die out of it as he spoke i tell you its no use marcia he wouldnt come if i went to him  oh yesyes he would i know he would if  he wouldnt youre mistaken i should have to get down in the dust for nothing hes a bad fellow i tell you and youve got to give him up  you hate me cried the girl the old man walked to and fro clutching his hands their lives had always been in such intimate sympathy his life had so long had her happiness for its sole pleasure that the pang in her heart racked his with as sharp an agony well i shall die and then i hope you will be satisfied  marcia marcia pleaded her father you dont know what youre saying  youre letting him go away from meyoure letting me lose himyoure killing me  he wouldnt come my girl it would be perfectly useless to go to him you mustyou must try to control yourself marcia theres no other waytheres no other hope youre disgraceful you ought to be ashamed you ought to have some pride about you i dont know whats come over you since youve been with that fellow you seem to be out of your senses but trytry my girl to get over it if youll fight it youll conquer yet youve got a spirit for anything and ill help you marcia ill take you anywhere ill do anything for you  you wouldnt go to him and ask him to come here if it would save his life  no said the old man with a desperate quiet i wouldnt  she stood looking at him and then she sank suddenly and straight down as if she were sinking through the floor when he lifted her he saw that she was in a dead faint and while the swoon lasted would be out of her misery the sight of this had wrung him so that he had a kind of relief in looking at her lifeless face and he was slow in laying her down again like one that fears to wake a sleeping child then he went to the foot of the stairs and softly called to his wife miranda miranda     ix   kinney came into town the next morning bright and early as he phrased it but he did not stop at the hotel for bartley till nine oclock thought id give you time for breakfast he exclaimed and so i didnt hurry up any about gettin in my supplies  it was a beautiful morning so blindingly sunny that bartley winked as they drove up through the glistening street and was glad to dip into the gloom of the first woods it was not cold the snow felt the warmth and packed moistly under their runners the air was perfectly still at a distance on the mountainsides it sparkled as if full of diamond dust far overhead some crows called  the suns getting high said bartley with the light sigh of one to whom the thought of spring brings no hope  well i shouldnt begin to plough for corn just yet replied kinney its curious he went on to see how anxious we are to have a thing over it dont much matter what it is whether its summer or winter i suppose wed feel different if we want sure there was going to be another of em i guess thats one reason why the lord concluded not to keep us clearly posted on the question of another life if it want for the uncertainty of the thing there are a lot of fellows like you that wouldnt stand it here a minute why if we had a dead sure thing of overtherivergood climate plenty to eat and wear and not much to doi dont believe any of us would keep darling minnie waitingwell a great while but you see the things all on paper and that makes us cautious and willing to hang on here awhile longer looks splendid on the map streets regularly laid out public squares bandstands churches solid blocks of houses with all the modern improvements but you cant tell whether theres any town there till youre on the ground and then if you dont like it theres no way of gettin back to the states he turned round upon bartley and opened his mouth wide to imply that this was pleasantry  do you throw your philosophy in all under the same price kinney asked the young fellow  well yes i never charge anything over said kinney you see i have a good deal of time to think when im around by myself all day and the philosophy dont cost me anything and the fellows like it roughing it the way they do they can stand most anything hey he now not only opened his mouth upon bartley but thrust him in the side with his elbow and then laughed noisily  kinney was the cook he had been over pretty nearly the whole uninhabitable globe starting as a gaunt and awkward boy from the maine woods and keeping until he came back to them in late middlelife the same gross and ridiculous optimism he had been at sea and shipwrecked on several islands in the pacific he had passed a rainy season at panama and a yellowfever season at vera cruz and had been carried far into the interior of peru by a tidal wave during an earthquake season he was in the border ruffian war of kansas and he clung to california till prosperity deserted her after the completion of the pacific road wherever he went he carried or found adversity but with a heart fed on the metaphysics of horace greeley and buoyed up by a few wildly interpreted maxims of emerson he had always believed in other men and their fitness for the terrestrial millennium which was never more than ten days or ten miles off it is not necessary to say that he had continued as poor as he began and that he was never able to contribute to those railroads mills elevators towns and cities which were sure to be built sir sure to be built wherever he went when he came home at last to the woods some hundreds of miles north of equity he found that some one had realized his early dream of a summer hotel on the shore of the beautiful lake there and he unenviously settled down to admire the landlords thrift and to act as guide and cook for parties of young ladies and gentlemen who started from the hotel to camp in the woods this brought him into the society of cultivated people for which he had a real passion he had always had a few thoughts rattling round in his skull and he liked to make sure of them in talk with those who had enjoyed greater advantages than himself he never begrudged them their luck he simply and sweetly admired them he made studies of their several characters and was never tired of analyzing them to their advantage to the next summers parties late in the fall he went in as it is called with a camp of loggers among whom he rarely failed to find some remarkable men but he confessed that he did not enjoy the steady three or four months in the winter woods with no coming out at all till spring and he had been glad of this chance in a logging camp near equity in which he had been offered the cooks place by the owner who had tested his fare in the northern woods the summer before its proximity to the village allowed him to loaf in upon civilization at least once a week and he spent the greater part of his time at the free press office on publication day he had always sought the society of newspaper men and wherever he could he had given them his he was not long in discovering that bartley was smart as a steel trap and by an early and natural transition from calling the young lady compositors by their pet names and patting them on their shoulders he had arrived at a like affectionate intimacy with bartley  as they worked deep into the woods on their way to the camp the road dwindled to a wellworn track between the stumps and bushes the ground was rough and they constantly plunged down the slopes of little hills and climbed the sides of the little valleys and from time to time they had to turn out for teams drawing logs to the mills in equity each with its equipage of four or five wild young fellows who saluted kinney with an ironical cheer or jovial taunt in passing  theyre all just so he explained with pride when the last party had passed theyre gentlemen every one of emperfect gentlemen  they came at last to a wider clearing than any they had yet passed through and here on a level of the hillside stretched the camp a long low structure of logs with the roof broken at one point by a stovepipe and the walls irregularly pierced by small windows around it crouched and burrowed in the drift the sheds that served as stables and storehouses  the sun shone and shone with dazzling brightness upon the opening the sound of distant shouts and the rhythmical stroke of axes came to it out of the forest but the camp was deserted and in the stillness kinneys voice seemed strange and alien walk in walk in he said hospitably ive got to look after my horse  but bartley remained at the door blinking in the sunshine and harking to the near silence that sang in his ears a curious feeling possessed him sickness of himself as of some one else a longing consciously helpless to be something different a sense of captivity to habits and thoughts and hopes that centred in himself and served him alone  terribly peaceful around here said kinney coming back to him and joining him in a survey of the landscape with his hands on his hips and a stem of timothy projecting from his lips  yes terribly assented bartley  but it aint a bad way for a man to live as long as hes young or haint got anybody that wants his company more than his roombe the place for you  on which ground bartley asked drily without taking his eyes from a distant peak that showed through the notch in the forest  kinney laughed in as unselfish enjoyment as if he had made the turn himself well that aint exactly what i meant to say what i meant was that any man engaged in intellectual pursuits wants to come out and commune with nature every little while  you call the equity free press intellectual pursuits demanded bartley with scorn i suppose it is he added well here i amright on the commune but natures such a big thing i think it takes two to commune with her  well a girls a help assented kinney  i wasnt thinking of a girl exactly said bartley with a little sadness i mean that if youre not in firstrate spiritual condition youre apt to get floored if you undertake to commune with nature  i guess thats about so if a mans got anything on his mind a big railroad depots the place for him but youre run down you ought to come out here and take a hand and be a man amongst men kinney talked partly for quantity and partly for pure indefinite good feeling  bartley turned toward the door what have you got inside here  kinney flung the door open and followed his guest within the first twothirds of the cabin was used as a dormitory and the sides were furnished with rough bunks from the ground to the roof the round unhewn logs showed their form everywhere the crevices were calked with moss and the walls were warm and tight it was dark between the bunks but beyond it was lighter and bartley could see at the farther end a vast cookingstove and three long tables with benches at their sides a huge coffeepot stood on the top of the stove and various pots and kettles surrounded it  come into the diningroom and sit down in the parlor said kinney drawing off his coat as he walked forward take the sofa he added indicating a movable bench he hung his coat on a peg and rolled up his shirtsleeves and began to whistle cheerily like a man who enjoys his work as he threw open the stove door and poked in some sticks of fuel a brooding warmth filled the place and the wood made a pleasant crackling as it took fire  heres my desk said kinney pointing to a barrel that supported a broad smooth boardtop this is where i compose my favorite works he turned round and cut out of a mighty mass of dough in a tin trough a portion which he threw down on his table and attacked with a rollingpin that means pie mr hubbard he explained and pie means meatpieor squashpie at a pinch todays piebaking day but you neednt be troubled on that account sos tomorrow and so was yesterday pie twentyone times a week is the word and dont you forget it they say old agassiz kinney went on in that easy familiar fondness with which our people like to speak of greatness that impresses their imaginationthey say old agassiz recommended fish as the best food for the brain well i dont suppose but what it is but i dont know but what pie is more stimulating to the fancy i never saw anything like meatpie to make ye dream  yes said bartley nodding gloomily ive tried it  kinney laughed well i guess folks of sedentary pursuits like you and me dont need it but these fellows that stamp round in the snow all day they want something to keep their imagination goin and i guess pie does it anyway they cant seem to get enough of it ever try apples when you was at work they say old greeley kep his desk full of em kep munchin away all the while when he was writin his editorials and one of them german poetsi dont know but what it was old gutty himselfkept rotten ones in his drawer liked the smell of em well theres a good deal of apple in meatpie may be its the apple that does it i dont know but i guess if your pursuits are sedentary you better take the apple separate  bartley did not say anything but he kept a lazily interested eye on kinney as he rolled out his piecrust fitted it into his tins filled these from a jar of mincemeat covered them with a sheet of dough pierced in herringbone pattern and marshalled them at one side ready for the oven  if fish is any better for the brain kinney proceeded they cant complain of any want of it at least in the salted form they get fishballs three times a week for breakfast as reglar as sunday tuesday and thursday comes round and fridays i make up a sort of chowder for the kanucks theyre catholics you know and i dont believe in interferin with any mans religion it dont matter what it is  you ought to be a deacon in the first church at equity said bartley  is that so why asked kinney  oh they dont believe in interfering with any mans religion either  well said kinney thoughtfully pausing with the rollingpin in his hand there a such a thing as being too liberal i suppose  the worlds tried the other thing a good while said bartley with cynical amusement at kinneys arrest  it seemed to chill the flow of the good fellows optimism so that he assented with but lukewarm satisfaction  well thats so too and he made up the rest of his pies in silence  well he exclaimed at last as if shaking himself out of an unpleasant reverie i guess we shall get along somehow do you like pork and beans  yes i do said bartley  were goin to have em for dinner you can hit beans any meal you drop in on us beans twentyone times a week just like pie set em in to warm he said taking up a capacious earthen pot near the stove and putting it into the oven i been pretty much everywheres and i dont know as i found anything for a standby that come up to beans im goin to give em potatoes and cabbage todaykind of a boileddinner daybut youll see there aint one in ten ll touch em to what there will these old residenters potatoes and cabbagell do for a kind of a delicacysort of a sidedishontree you know but give em beans for a steady diet why off there in chili even the people regularly live on beansnot exactly like oursbroad and flatbut theyre beans want there some those ancientsold horace or virgil may berung in something about beans in some their poems  i dont remember anything of the kind said bartley languidly  well i dont know as i can i just have a dim recollection of language thrown out at the objectas old matthew arnold says but it might have been something in emerson  bartley laughed i didnt suppose you were such a reader kinney  oh i nibble round wherever i can get a chance mostly in the newspapers you know i dont get any time for books as a general rule but theres pretty much everything in the papers i should call beans a brain food  i guess you call anything a brain food that you happen to like dont you kinney  no sir said kinney soberly but i like to see the philosophy of a thing when i get a chance now theres tea for example he said pointing to the great tin pot on the stove  coffee you mean said bartley  no sir i mean tea thats tea and i give it to em three times a day good and strongmolasses in it and no milk thats a brain food if ever there was one sets em up right on end every time clears their heads and keeps the cold out  i should think you were running a seminary for young ladies instead of a loggingcamp said bartley  no but look at it im in earnest about tea you look at the tea drinkers and the coffeedrinkers all the world over look at em in our own country all the northern people and all the goahead people drink tea the pennsylvanians and the southerners drink coffee why our new england folks dont even know how to make coffee so its fit to drink and its just so all over europe the russians drink tea and theyd et up those coffeedrinkin turks long ago if the teadrinkin english hadnt kept em from it go anywheres you like in the north and you find em drinkin tea the swedes and norwegians in aroostook county drink it and they drink it at home  well what do you think of the french and germans they drink coffee and theyre pretty smart active people too  french and germans drink coffee  yes  kinney stopped short in his heated career of generalization and scratched his shaggy head well he said finally i guess theyre a kind of a missing link as old darwin says he joined bartley in his laugh cordially and looked up at the round clock nailed to a log its about time i set my tables anyway well he asked apparently to keep the conversation from flagging while he went about this work how is the good old free press getting along  its going to get along without me from this out said bartley this is my last week in equity  no retorted kinney in tremendous astonishment  yes im off at the end of the week squire gaylord takes the paper back for the committee and i suppose henry bird will run it for a while or perhaps theyll stop it altogether its been a losing business for the committee  why i thought youd bought it of em  well thats what i expected to do but the office hasnt made any money all that ive saved is in my colt and cutter  that sorrel  bartley nodded im going away about as poor as i came i couldnt go much poorer  well said kinney in the exhaustion of adequate language he went on laying the plates and knives and forks in silence these were of undisguised steel the dishes and the drinking mugs were of that dense and heavy make which the keepers of cheap restaurants use to protect themselves against breakage and which their servants chip to the quick at every edge kinney laid bread and crackers by each plate and on each he placed a vast slab of cold corned beef then he lifted the lid of the pot in which the cabbage and potatoes were boiling together and pricked them with a fork he dished up the beans in a succession of deep tins and set them at intervals along the tables and began to talk again well now im sorry id just begun to feel real well acquainted with you tell you the truth i didnt take much of a fancy to you first off  is that so asked bartley not much disturbed by the confession  yes sir well come to boil it down said kinney with the frankness of the analytical mind that disdains to spare itself in the pursuit of truth i didnt like your good clothes i dont suppose i ever had a suit of clothes to fit me feel kind of ashamed you know when i go into the store and take the first thing the jew wants to put off on to me now i suppose you go to macullar and parkers in boston and you get what you want  no i have my measure at a tailors said bartley with illconcealed pride in the fact  you dont say so exclaimed kinney well he said as if he might as well swallow this pill too while he was about it well whats the use i never was the figure for clothes anyway long gangling boy to start with and a lean stoopshouldered man i found out some time ago that a fellow want necessarily a bad fellow because he had money or a good fellow because he hadnt but i hadnt quite got over hating a man because he had style well i suppose it was a kind of a survival as old tylor calls it but i tell you i sniffed round you a good while before i made up my mind to swallow you and that turnout of yours it kind of staggered me after i got over the clothes why it want so much the coltany man likes to ride after a sorrel colt and it want so much the cutter it was the red linin with pinked edges that you had to your robe and it was the red ribbon that you had tied round the waist of your whip when i see that ribbon on that whip damn you i wanted to kill you bartley broke out into a laugh but kinney went on soberly but thinks i to myself here now you stop right here you wait you give the fellow a chance for his life let him have a chance to show whether that whipribbon goes all through him first if it does kill him cheerfully but give him a chance first well sir i gave you the chance and you showed that you deserved it i guess you taught me a lesson when i see you at work pegging away hard at something or other every time i went into your office up and coming with everybody and just as ready to pass the time of day with me as the biggest bug in town thinks i youd have made a great mistake to kill that fellow kinney and i just made up my mind to like you  thanks said bartley with ironical gratitude  kinney did not speak at once he whistled thoughtfully through his teeth and then he said ill tell you what if youre going away very poor i know a wealthy chap you can raise a loan out of  bartley thought seriously for a silent moment if your friend offers me twenty dollars im not too well dressed to take it  all right said kinney he now dished up the cabbage and potatoes and throwing a fresh handful of tea into the pot and filling it up with water he took down a tin horn with which he went to the door and sounded a long stertorous note     x   guess it was the clothes again said kinney as he began to wash his tins and dishes after the dinner was over and the men had gone back to their work i could see em eyin you over when they first came in and i could see that they didnt exactly like the looks of em it would wear off in time but it takes time for it to wear off and it had to go pretty rusty for a startoff well i dont know as it makes much difference to you does it  oh i thought we got along very well said bartley with a careless yawn there wasnt much chance to get acquainted some of the loggers were as handsome and wellmade as he and were of as good origin and traditions though he had some advantages of training but his twobutton cutaway his wellfitting trousers his scarf with a pin in it had been too much for these young fellows in their long stoga boots and flannel shirts they looked at him askance and despatched their meal with more than their wonted swiftness and were off again into the woods without any demonstrations of satisfaction in bartleys presence  he had perceived their grudge for he had felt it in his time but it did not displease him he had none of the pain with which kinney who had so long bragged of him to the loggers saw that his guest was a failure  i guess theyll come out all right in the end he said in this warm atmosphere after the gross and heavy dinner he had eaten he yawned again and again he folded his overcoat into a pillow for his bench and lay down and lazily watched kinney about his work presently he saw kinney seated on a block of wood beside the stove with his elbow propped in one hand and holding a magazine out of which he was reading he wore spectacles which gave him a fresh and interesting touch of grotesqueness bartley found that an empty barrel had been placed on each side of him evidently to keep him from rolling off his bench  hello he said much obliged to you kinney i havent been taken such good care of since i can remember been asleep havent i  about an hour said kinney with a glance at the clock and ignoring his agency in bartleys comfort  food for the brain said bartley sitting up i should think so ive dreamt a perfect new american cyclopaedia and a pronouncing gazetteer thrown in  is that so said kinney as if pleased with the suggestive character of his cookery now established by eminent experiment  bartley yawned a yawn of satisfied sleepiness and rubbed his hand over his face i suppose he said if im going to write anything about camp kinney i had better see all there is to see  well yes i presume you had said kinney well go over to where theyre cuttin pretty soon and you can see all there is in an hour but i presume youll want to see it so as to ring in some description hey well thats all right but what you going to do with it when youve done it now youre out of the free press  oh i shouldnt have printed it in the free press anyway coals to newcastle you know ill tell you what i think ill do kinney ill get my outlines and then you post me with a lot of factsqueer characters accidents romantic incidents snowingsup threatened starvation adventures with wild animalsand i can make something worth while get out two or three columns so they can print it in their sunday edition and then ill take it up to boston with me and seek my fortune with it  well sir ill do it said kinney fired with the poetry of the idea ill post you dumn f i dont wish i could write well i did use to scribble once for an agricultural paper but i dont call that writin ive set down well i guess as much as sixty times to try to write out what i know about loggin  hold on cried bartley whipping out his notebook thats firstrate thatll do for the first line in the headwhat i know about logginglarge caps well  kinney shut his magazine and took his knee between his hands closing one of his eyes in order to sharpen his recollection he poured forth a stream of reminiscence mingled observation and personal experience bartley followed him with his pencil jotting down points striking in subhead lines and now and then interrupting him with cries of good capital its a perfect mineits a mint by jove he exclaimed ill make six columns of this ill offer it to one of the magazines and itll come out illustrated go on kinney  hark said kinney craning his neck forward to listen i thought i heard sleighbells but i guess it want well sir as i was sayin they fetched that fellow into camp with both feet frozen to the kneesdumn f it want bells  he unlimbered himself and hurried to the door at the other end of the cabin which he opened letting in a clear block of the afternoon sunshine and a gush of sleighbell music shot with mens voices and the cries and laughter of women  well sir said kinney coming back and making haste to roll down his sleeves and put on his coat heres a nuisance a whole party of folkstwo sleighloadsright on us i dont know who they be or where theyre from but i know where i wish they was well of course its natural they should want to see a loggincamp added kinney taking himself to task for his inhospitable mind and there aint any harm in it but i wish theyd give a fellow a little notice  the voices and bells drew nearer but kinney seemed resolved to observe the decorum of not going to the door till some one knocked  kinney kinney hello kinney shouted a mans voice as the bells hushed before the door and broke into a musical clash when one of the horses tossed his head  well sir said kinney rising i guess its old willett himself hes the owner lives up to portland and been threatening to come down here all winter with a party of friends you just stay still he added and he paid himself the deference which every true american owes himself in his dealings with his employer he went to the door very deliberately and made no haste on account of the repeated cries of kinney kinney in which others of the party outside now joined  when he opened the door again the first voice saluted him with a roar of laughter why kinney i began to think you were dead  no sir bartley heard kinney reply it takes more to kill me than you suppose but now he stepped outside and the talk became unintelligible  finally bartley heard what was imaginably mr willetts voice saying well lets go in and have a look at it now and with much outcry and laughter the ladies were invisibly helped to dismount and presently the whole party came stamping and rustling in  bartleys blood tingled he liked this and he stood quite selfpossessed with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets and his elbows dropped while mr willett advanced in a friendly way  ah mr hubbard kinney told us you were in here and asked me to introduce myself while he looked after the horses my names willett these are my daughters this is mrs macallister of montreal mrs witherby of boston miss witherby and mr witherby you ought to know each other mr hubbard is the editor of the equity free press mr witherby of the boston events mr hubbard oh and mr macallister  bartley bowed to the willett and witherby ladies and shook hands with mr witherby a large solemn man with a pursemouth and tight rings of white hair who treated him with the pomp inevitable to the owner of a city newspaper in meeting a country editor  at the mention of his name mr macallister a slight little straight man in a long ulster and a sealskin cap tiddled farcically forward on his toes and giving bartley his hand said ah haow dedo haow dedo  mrs macallister fixed upon him the eye of the flirt who knows her man she was of the darkeyed english type her eyes were very large and full and her smooth black hair was drawn flatly backward and fastened in a knot just under her dashing fur cap she wore a fur sack and she was equipped against the cold as exquisitely as her southern sisters defend themselves from the summer bits of warm color in ribbon and scarf flashed out here and there when she flung open her sack she showed herself much more lavishly buttoned and bugled and bangled than the americans she sat clown on the movable bench which bartley had vacated and crossed her feet very small and saucy even in their arctics on a stick of firewood and cast up her neat profile and rapidly made eyes at every part of the interior why its delicious you know i never saw anything so comfortable i want to spend the rest of me life here you know she spoke very far down in her throat and with a rising inflection in each sentence im going to have a quarrel with you mr willett for not telling me what a delightful surprise you had for us here oh but id no idea of it i assure you  well im glad you like it mrs macallister said mr willett with the clumsiness of american middleage when summoned to say something gallant if id told you what a surprise i had for you it wouldnt have been one  oh its no good your trying to get out of it that way retorted the beauty there he comes now im really in love with him you know she said as kinney opened the door and came hulking forward  nobody said anything at once but bartley laughed finally and ventured well ill propose for you to kinney  oh i dare say cried the beauty with a lively effort of wit mr kinney i have fallen in love with your camp d ye know she added as kinney drew near and im beggin mr willett to let me come and live here among you  well maam said kinney a little abashed at this proposition you couldnt do a better thing for your health i guess  the proprietor of the boston events turned about and began to look over the arrangements of the interior the other ladies went with him conversing in low tones these must be the places where the men sleep they said gazing at the bunks  we must get kinney to explain things to us said mr willett a little restlessly  mrs macallister jumped briskly to her feet oh yes do mr willett make him explain everything ive been tryin to coax it out of him but hes such a tease  kinney looked very sheepish in this character and mrs macallister hooked bartley to her side for the tour of the interior i cant let you away from me mr hubbard your friends so satirical im afraid of him only fancy mr willett hes been talkin to me about brain foods i know hes makin fun of me and it isnt kind is it mr hubbard  she did not give the least notice to the things that the others looked at or to kinneys modest lecture upon the manners and customs of the loggers she kept a little apart with bartley and plied him with bravadoes with pouts with little cries of suspense in the midst of this he heard mr willett saying you ought to get some one to come and write about this for your paper witherby but mrs macallister was also saying something with a significant turn of her floating eyes and the thing that concerned bartley if he were to make his way among the newspapers in boston slipped from his grasp like the idea which we try to seize in a dream she made sure of him for the drive to the place which they visited to see the men felling the trees by inviting him to a seat at her side in the sleigh this crowded the others but she insisted and they all gave way as people must to the caprices of a pretty woman her coquetries united british wilfulness to american nonchalance and seemed to have been graduated to the appreciation of garrison and st lawrence river steamboat and wateringplace society the willett ladies had already found it necessary to explain to the witherby ladies that they had met her the summer before at the seaside and that she had stopped at portland on her way to england they did not know her very well but some friends of theirs did and their father had asked her to come with them to the camp they added that the canadian ladies seemed to expect the gentlemen to be a great deal more attentive than ours were they had known as little what to do with mr macallisters smalltalk and compliments as his wifes audacities but they did not view bartleys responsiveness with pleasure if mrs macallisters arts were not subtle as bartley even in the intoxication of her preference could not keep from seeing still in his mood it was consoling to be singled out by her it meant that even in a loggingcamp he was recognizable by any person of fashion as a goodlooking welldressed man of the world it embittered him the more against marcia while in some sort it vindicated him to himself  the early winter sunset was beginning to tinge the snow with crimson when the party started back to camp where kinney was to give them supper he had it greatly on his conscience that they should have a good time and he promoted it as far as hot mincepie and newly fried doughnuts would go he also opened a few canned goods as he called some very exclusive sardines and peaches and he made an entirely fresh pot of tea and a pan of sodabiscuit mrs macallister made remarks across her plate which were for bartley alone and kinney who was seriously waiting upon his guests refused to respond to bartleys joking reference to himself of some questions and comments of hers  after supper when the loggers had withdrawn to the other end of the long hut she called out to kinney oh do tell them to smoke we shall not mind it at all i assure you cant some of them do something sing or dance  kinney unbent a little at this theres a firstclass clogdancer among them but hes a little stuck up and i dont know as you could get him to dance he said in a low tone  what a bloated aristocrat cried the lady then the only thing is for us to dance first can they play  one of em can whistle like a birdhe can whistle like a whole band answered kinney warming and of course the kanucks can fiddle  and what are kanucks is that what you call us canadians  well maam it aint quite the thing to do said kinney penitently  it isnt at all the thing to do which are the kanucks  she rose and went forward with kinney in her spoiled way and addressed a swarthy gleamingeyed young logger in french he answered with a smile that showed all his white teeth and turned to one of his comrades then the two rose and got violins out of the bunks and came forward others of their race joined them but the yankees hung gloomily back they clearly did not like these liberties this patronage  i shall have your clogdancer on his feet yet mr kinney said mrs macallister as she came back to her place  the canadians began to play and sing those gay gay airs of old france which they have kept unsaddened through all the dark events that have changed the popular mood of the mother country they have matched words to them in celebration of their life on the great rivers and in the vast forests of the north and in these blithe barcaroles and huntingsongs breathes the joyous spirit of a france that knows neither doubt nor carefrance untouched by revolution or napoleonic wars some of the airs still keep the very words that came over seas with them two hundred years ago the transition to the dance was quick and inevitable a dozen slim young fellows were gliding about behind the players pounding the hard earthen floor and singing in time  oh come come cried the beauty rising and stamping impatiently with her little foot suppose we dance too  she pulled bartley forward by the hand her husband followed with the taller miss willett two of the canadians at the instance of mrs macallister came forward and politely asked the honor of the other young ladies hands in the dance their temper was infectious and the cotillon was in full life before their partners had time to wonder at their consent mrs macallister could sing some of the canadian songs her voice clear and fresh rang through those of the men while in at the window thrown open for air came the wild cries of the forestthe wail of a catamount and the solemn hooting of a distant owl  isnt it jolly good fun she demanded when the figure was finished and now kinney went up to the firstclass clogdancer and prevailed with him to show his skill he seemed to comply on condition that the whistler should furnish the music he came forward with a bashful hauteur bridling stiffly like a girl and struck into the laborious and monotonous jig which is perhaps our national dance he was exquisitely shaped and as he danced he suppled more and more while the whistler warbled a wilder and swifter strain and kept time with his hands there was something that stirred the blood in the fury of the strain and dance when it was done mrs macallister caught off her cap and ran round among the spectators to make them pay she excused no one and she gave the money to kinney telling him to get his loggers something to keep the cold out  i should say whiskey if i were in the canadian bush she suggested  well i guess we shant say anything of that sort in this camp said kinney  she turned upon bartley i know mr hubbard is dying to do something do something mr hubbard bartley looked up in surprise at this interpretation of his tacit wish to distinguish himself before her come sing us some of your student songs  bartleys vanity had confided the fact of his college training to her and he was really thinking just then that he would like to give them a seriocomic song for which he had been famous with his class he borrowed the violin of a kanuck and sitting down strummed upon it banjowise the song was one of those which is partly spoken and acted he really did it very well but the willett and witherby ladies did not seem to understand it quite and the gentlemen looked as if they thought this very undignified business for an educated american  mrs macallister feigned a yawn and put up her hand to hide it oh what a styupid song she said she sprang to her feet and began to put on her wraps the others were glad of this signal to go and followed her example good by she cried giving her hand to kinney i dont think your ideas are ridiculous i think theres no end of good sense in them i assure you i hope you wont leave off that regard for the brain in your cooking good by she waved her hand to the americans and then to the kanucks as she passed out between their respectfully parted ranks adieu messieurs she merely nodded to bartley the others parted from him coldly as he fancied and it seemed to him that he had been made responsible for that womans coquetries when he was conscious all the time of having forborne even to meet them halfway but this was not so much to his credit as he imagined the flirt can only practise her audacities safely by grace of those upon whom she uses them and if men really met them halfway there could be no such tiling as flirting     xi   the loggers pulled off their boots and got into their bunks where some of them lay and smoked while others fell asleep directly  bartley made some indirect approaches to kinney for sympathy in the snub which he had received and which rankled in his mind with unabated keenness  but kinney did not respond your beds ready he said you can turn in whenever you like  whats the matter asked bartley  nothings the matter if you say so answered kinney going about some preparations for the mornings breakfast  bartley looked at his resentful back he saw that he was hurt and he surmised that kinney suspected him of making fun of his eccentricities to mrs macallister he had laughed at kinney and tried to amuse her with him but he could not have made this appear as harmless as it was he rose from the bench on which he had been sitting and shut with a click the penknife with which he had been cutting a pattern on its edge  i shall have to say good night to you i believe he said going to the peg on which kinney had hung his hat and overcoat he had them on and was buttoning the coat in an angry tremor before kinney looked up and realized what his guest was about  why whatwhy whereyou goin he faltered in dismay  to equity said bartley feeling in his coat pockets for his gloves and drawing them on without looking at kinney whose great hands were in a pan of dough  whywhyno you aint he protested with a revulsion of feeling that swept away all his resentment and left him nothing but remorse for his inhospitality  no said bartley putting up the collar of the first ulster worn by a native in that region  why look here cried kinney pulling his hands out of the dough and making a fruitless effort to cleanse them upon each other i dont want you to go this way  dont you im sorry to disoblige you but im going said bartley  kinney tried to laugh why hubbardwhy bartleywhy bart he exclaimed whats the matter with you i aint mad  you have an unfortunate manner then good night he strode out between the bunks full of snoring loggers  kinney hurried after him imploring and protesting in a low voice trying to get before him and longing to lay his floury paws upon him and detain him by main force but even in his distress respecting bartleys overcoat too much to touch it he followed him out into the freezing air in his shirtsleeves and besought him not to be such a fool it makes me feel like the devil he exclaimed pitifully you come back now half a minute and ill make it all right with you i know i can youre a gentleman and youll understand do come back i shall never get over it if you dont  im sorry said bartley but im not going back good night  oh good lordy lamented kinney what am i goin to do why man its a good three mile and more to equity and the woods is full of catamounts i tell ye t aint safe for ye he kept following bartley down the path to the road  ill risk it said bartley  kinney had left the door of the camp open and the yells and curses of the awakened sleepers recalled him to himself well well if you will go he groaned in despair heres that money he plunged his doughy hand into his pocket and pulled out a roll of bills here it is i haint time to count it but itll be all right anyhow  bartley did not even turn his head to look round at him keep your money he said as he plunged forward through the snow i wouldnt touch a cent of it to save your life  all right said kinney in hapless contrition and he returned to shut himself in with the reproaches of the loggers and the upbraiding of his own heart  bartley dashed along the road in a fury that kept him unconscious of the intense cold and he passed half the night when he was once more in his own room packing his effects against his departure next day when all was done he went to bed half wishing that he might never rise from it again it was not that he cared for kinney that fools sulking was only the climax of a long series of injuries of which he was the victim at the hands of a hypercritical omnipotence  despite his conviction that it was useless to struggle longer against such injustice he lived through the night and came down late to breakfast which he found stale and without the compensating advantage of finding himself alone at the table some ladies had lingered there to clear up on the best authority the distracting rumors concerning him which they had heard the day before was it true that he had intended to spend the rest of the winter in logging and was it true that he was going to give up the free press and was it true that henry bird was going to be the editor bartley gave a sarcastic confirmation to all these reports and went out to the printingoffice to gather up some things of his he found henry bird there looking pale and sick but at work and seemingly in authority this was what bartley had always intended when he should go out but he did not like it and he resented some small changes that had already been made in the editors room in tacit recognition of his purpose not to occupy it again  bird greeted him stiffly the printer girls briefly nodded to him suppressing some little hysterical titters and tacitly let him feel that he was no longer master there while he was in the composingroom hannah morrison came in apparently from some errand outside and catching sight of him stared and pertly passed him in silence on his inkstand he found a letter from squire gaylord briefly auditing his last account and enclosing the balance due him from this the old lawyer with the careful smallness of a village business man had deducted various little sums for things which bartley had never expected to pay for with a like thriftiness the landlord when bartley asked for his bill had charged certain items that had not appeared in the bills before bartley felt that the charges were trumped up but he was powerless to dispute them besides he hoped to sell the landlord his colt and cutter and he did not care to prejudice that matter some bills from storekeepers which he thought he had paid were handed to him by the landlord and each of the churches had sent in a little account for pewrent for the past eighteen months he had always believed himself deadheaded at church he outlawed the latter by tearing them to pieces in the landlords presence and dropping the fragments into a spittoon it seemed to him that every soul in equity was making a clutch at the rapidly diminishing sum of money which squire gaylord had enclosed to him and which was all he had in the world on the other hand his popularity in the village seemed to have vanished over night he had sometimes fancied a general and rebellious grief when it should become known that he was going away but instead there was an acquiescence amounting to airiness  he wondered if anything about his affairs with henry bird and hannah morrison had leaked out but he did not care he only wished to shake the snow of equity off his feet as soon as possible  after dinner when the boarders had gone out and the loafers had not yet gathered in he offered the landlord his colt and cutter bartley knew that the landlord wanted the colt but now the latter said i dont know as i care to buy any horses right in the winter this way  all right answered bartley just have the colt put into the cutter  andy morrison brought it round the boy looked at bartleys set face with a sort of awestricken affection his adoration for the young man survived all that he had heard said against him at home during the series of family quarrels that had ensued upon his fathers interview with him he longed to testify somehow his unabated loyalty but he could not think of anything to do much less to say  bartley pitched his valise into the cutter and then as andy left the horses head to give him a hand with his trunk offered him a dollar i dont want anything said the boy shyly refusing the money out of pure affection  but bartley mistook his motive and thought it sulky resentment oh very well he said take hold  the landlord came out hold on a minute he said where you goin to take the cars  at the junction answered bartley i know a man there that will buy the colt what is it you want  the landlord stepped back a few paces and surveyed the establishment i should like to ride after that hoss he said if you aint in any great of a hurry  get in said bartley and the landlord took the reins  from time to time as he drove he rose up and looked over the dashboard to study the gait of the horse ive noticed he strikes some when he first comes out in the spring  yes bartley assented  pulls considable  he pulls  the landlord rose again and scrutinized the horses legs i dont know as i ever noticed t hed capped his hock before  didnt you  done it kickin nights i guess  i guess so  the landlord drew the whip lightly across the colts rear he shrank together and made a little spring forward but behaved perfectly well  i dont know as i should always be sure he wouldnt kick in the daytime  no said bartley you never can be sure of anything  they drove along in silence at last the landlord said well he aint so fast as i supposed  hes not so fast a horse as some answered bartley  the landlord leaned over sidewise for an inspection of the colts action forward haint never thought he had a splint on that forward off leg  a splint perhaps he has a splint  they returned to the hotel and both alighted  skittish devil remarked the landlord as the colt quivered under the hand he laid upon him  hes skittish said bartley  the landlord retired as far back as the door and regarded the colt critically well i spose youve always used him too well ever to winded him but dumn f he dont blow like it  look here simpson said bartley very quietly you know this horse as well as i do and you know there isnt an out about him you want to buy him because you always have now make me an offer  well groaned the landlord whatll you take for the whole rig just as it standscolt cutter leathers and robe  two hundred dollars promptly replied bartley  ill give ye seventyfive returned the landlord with equal promptness  andy take hold of the end of that trunk will you  the landlord allowed them to put the trunk into the cutter bartley got in too and shifting the baggage to one side folded the robe around him from his middle down and took his seat this colt can road you right along all day inside of five minutes and he can trot inside of twothirty every time and you know it as well as i do  well said the landlord make it an even hundred  bartley leaned forward and gathered up the reins let go his head andy he quietly commanded  make it one and a quarter cried the landlord not seeing that his chance was past what do you say  what bartley said as he touched the colt with the whip the landlord never knew he stood watching the cutters swift disappearance up the road in a sort of stupid expectation of its return when he realized that bartleys departure was final he said under his breath sold ye dumned old fool and serve ye right and went indoors with a feeling of admiration for colt and man that bordered on reverence     xii   this last drop of the local meanness filled bartleys bitter cup as he passed the house at the end of the street he seemed to drain it all he knew that the old lawyer was there sitting by the office stove drawing his hand across his chin and bartley hoped that he was still as miserable as he had looked when he last saw him but he did not know that by the window in the house which he would not even look at marcia sat selfprisoned in her room with her eyes upon the road famishing for the thousandth part of a chance to see him pass she saw him now for the instant of his coming and going with eyes trained to take in every point she saw the preparation which seemed like final departure and with a gasp of bartley as if she were trying to call after him she sank back into her chair and shut her eyes  he drove on plunging into the deep hollow beyond the house and keeping for several miles the road they had taken on that sunday together but he did not make the turn that brought them back to the village again the pale sunset was slanting over the snow when he reached the junction for he had slackened his colts pace after he had put ten miles behind him not choosing to reach a prospective purchaser with his horse all blown and bathed with sweat he wished to be able to say look at him hes come fifteen miles since three oclock and hes as keen as when he started  this was true when having left his baggage at the junction he drove another mile into the country to see the farmer of the gentleman who had his summerhouse here and who had once bantered bartley to sell him his colt the farmer was away and would not be at home till the uptrain from boston was in bartley looked at his watch and saw that to wait would lose him the six oclock downtrain there would be no other till eleven oclock but it was worth while the gentleman had said when you want the money for that colt bring him over any time my farmer will have it ready for you he waited for the uptrain but when the farmer arrived he was full of all sorts of scruples and reluctances he said he should not like to buy it till he had heard from mr farnham he ended by offering bartley eighty dollars for the colt on his own account he did not want the cutter  you write to mr farnham said bartley that you tried that plan with me and it wouldnt work hes lost the colt  he made this brave show of indifference but he was disheartened and having carried the farmer home from the junction for the convenience of talking over the trade with him he drove back again through the early nightfall in sullen desperation  the weather had softened and was threatening rain or snow the dark was closing in spiritlessly the colt shortening from a trot into a short springy jolt dropped into a walk at last as if he were tired and gave bartley time enough on his way back to the junction for reflection upon the disaster into which his life had fallen these passages of utter despair are commoner to the young than they are to those whom years have experienced in the impermanence of any fate good bad or indifferent unless perhaps the last may seem rather constant taken in reference to all that had been ten days ago the present ruin was incredible and had nothing reasonable in proof of its existence then he was prosperously placed and in the way to better himself indefinitely now he was here in the dark with fifteen dollars in his pocket and an unsalable horse on his hands outcast deserted homeless hopeless and by whose fault he owned even then that he had committed some follies but in his sense of marcias allgiving love he had risen for once in his life to a conception of selfdevotion and in taking herself from him as she did she had taken from him the highest incentive he had ever known and had checked him in his first feeble impulse to do and be all in all for another it was she who had ruined him  as he jumped out of the cutter at the junction the stationmaster stopped with a cluster of partycolored signallanterns in his hand and cast their light over the sorrel  nice colt you got there  yes said bartley blanketing the horse do you know anybody who wants to buy  whose is he asked the man  hes mine shouted bartley do you think i stole him  i dont know where you got him said the man walking off and making a soft play of red and green lights on the snow beyond the narrow platform  bartley went into the great ugly barn of a station trembling and sat down in one of the gouged and whittled armchairs near the stove a pomp of timetables and luminous advertisements of western railroads and their landgrants decorated the wooden walls of the gentlemens waitingroom which had been sanded to keep the gentlemen from writing and sketching upon them this was the more judicious because the ladies room in the absence of tourist travel was locked in winter and they were obliged to share the gentlemens in summer the junction was a busy place but after the snow fell and until the snow thawed it was a desolation relieved only by the arrival of the sparsely peopled throughtrains from the north and east and by such local travellers as wished to take trains not stopping at their own stations these broke in upon the solitude of the joint stationmaster and baggageman and switchtender with just sufficient frequency to keep him in a state of uncharitable irritation and unrest tonight bartley was the sole intruder and he sat by the stove wrapped in a cloud of rebellious memories when one side of a colloquy without made itself heard  what  some question was repeated  no it went down half an hour ago  an inaudible question followed  next downtrain at eleven  there was now a faintly audible lament or appeal  guess youll have to come earlier next time most folks doos that wants to take it  bartley now heard the despairing moan of a woman he had already divined the sex of the futile questioner whom the stationmaster was bullying but he had divined it without compassion and if he had not himself been a sufferer from the mans insolence he might even have felt a ferocious satisfaction in it in a word he was at his lowest and worst when the door opened and the woman came in with a movement at once bewildered and daring which gave him the impression of a despair as complete and final as his own he doggedly kept his place she did not seem to care for him but in the uncertain light of the lamp above them she drew near the stove and putting one hand to her pocket as if to find her handkerchief she flung aside her veil with her other and showed her tear stained face  he was on his feet somehow marcia  oh bartley  he had seized her by the arm to make sure that she was there in verity of flesh and blood and not by some trick of his own senses as a cold chill running over him had made him afraid at the touch their passion ignored all that they had made each other suffer her head was on his breast his embrace was round her it was a moment of delirious bliss that intervened between the sorrows that had been and the reasons that must come  whatwhat are you doing here marcia he asked at last  they sank on the benching that ran round the wall he held her hands fast in one of his and kept his other arm about her as they sat side by side  i dont knowi she seemed to rouse herself by an effort from her rapture i was going to see nettie spaulding and i saw you driving past our house and i thought you were coming here and i couldnt beari couldnt bear to let you go away without telling you that i was wrong and askingasking you to forgive me i thought you would do iti thought you would know that i had behaved that way because iicared so much for you i thoughti was afraid you had gone on the other train she trembled and sank back in his embrace from which she had lifted herself a little  how did you get here asked bartley as if willing to give himself all the proofs he could of the everyday reality of her presence  andy morrison brought me father sent him from the hotel i didnt care what you would say to me i wanted to tell you that i was wrong and not let you go away feeling thatthatyou were all to blame i thought when i had done that you might drive me awayor laugh at me or anything you pleased if only you would let me take back  yes he answered dreamily all that wicked hardness was breaking up within him he felt it melting drop by drop in his heart this poor lovetossed soul this frantic unguided reckless girl was an angel of mercy to him and in her folly and error a messenger of heavenly peace and hope i am a bad fellow marcia he faltered you ought to know that you did right to give me up i made love to hannah morrison i never promised to marry her but i made her think that i was fond of her  i dont care for that replied the girl i told you when we were first engaged that i would never think of anything that had gone before that and then when i would not listen to a word from you that day i broke my promise  when i struck henry bird because he was jealous of me i was as guilty as if i had killed him  if you had killed him i was bound to you by my word your striking him was part of the same thingpart of what i had promised i never would care for a gush of tears came into his eyes and she saw them oh poor bartley poor bartley  she took his head between her hands and pressed it hard against her heart and then wrapped her arms tight about him and softly bemoaned him  they drew a little apart when the man came in with his lantern and set it down to mend the fire but as a railroad employee he was far too familiar with the love that vaunts itself on all railroad trains to feel that he was an intruder he scarcely looked at them and went out when he had mended the fire and left it purring  where is andy morrison asked bartley has he gone back  no he is at the hotel over there i told him to wait till i found out when the train went north  so you inquired when it went to boston said bartley with a touch of his old raillery come he added taking her hand under his arm he led her out of the room to where his cutter stood outside she was astonished to find the colt there  i wonder i didnt see it but if i had i should have thought that you had sold it and gone away andy told me you were coming here to sell the colt when the man told me the express was gone i knew you were on it  they found the boy stolidly waiting for marcia on the veranda of the hotel stamping first upon one foot and then the other and hugging himself in his greatcoat as the coming snowfall blew its first flakes in his face  is that you andy asked bartley  yes sir answered the boy without surprise at finding him with marcia  well here just take hold of the colts head a minute  as the boy obeyed bartley threw the reins on the dashboard and leaped out of the cutter and went within he returned after a brief absence followed by the landlord  well it aint more n a mile n a half if its that you just keep straight along this street and take your first turn to the left and youre right at the house its the first house on the lefthand side  thanks returned bartley andy you tell the squire that you left marcia with me and i said i would see about her getting back you neednt hurry  all right said the boy and he disappeared round the corner of the house to get his horse from the barn  well ill be all ready by the time youre here said the landlord still holding the halldoor ajar luck to you he shouted shutting it  marcia locked both her hands through bartleys arm and leaned her head on his shoulder neither spoke for some minutes then he asked marcia do you know where you are  with you she answered in a voice of utter peace  do you know where we are going he asked leaning over to kiss her cold pure cheek  no she answered in as perfect content as before  we are going to get married  he felt her grow tense in her clasp upon his arm and hold there rigidly for a moment while the swift thoughts whirled through her mind then as if the struggle had ended she silently relaxed and leaned more heavily against him  theres still time to go back marcia he said if you wish that turn to the right yonder will take us to equity and you can be at home in two hours she quivered im a poor mani suppose you know that ive only got fifteen dollars in the world and the colt here i know i can get on im not afraid for myself but if you would rather waitif youre not perfectly certain of yourselfremember its going to be a struggle were going to have some hard times  you forgive me she huskily asked for all answer without moving her head from where it lay  yes marcia  thenhurry  the minister was an old man and he seemed quite dazed at the suddenness of their demand for his services but he gathered himself together and contrived to make them man and wife and to give them his marriage certificate  it seems as if there were something else he said absently as he handed the paper to bartley  perhaps its this said bartley giving him a fivedollar note in return  ah perhaps he replied in unabated perplexity he bade them serve god and let them out into the snowy night through which they drove back to the hotel  the landlord had kindled a fire on the hearth of the franklin stove in his parlor and the blazing hickory snapped in electrical sympathy with the storm when they shut themselves into the bright room and bartley took marcia fondly into his arms  wife  husband  they sat down before the fire hand in hand and talked of the light things that swim to the top and eddy round and round on the surface of our deepest moods they made merry over the old ministers perturbation which bartley found endlessly amusing then he noticed that the dress marcia had on was the one she had worn to the sociable in lower equity and she said yes she had put it on because he once said he liked it he asked her when and she said oh she knew but if he could not remember she was not going to tell him then she wanted to know if he recognized her by the dress before she lifted her veil in the station  no he said with a teasing laugh i wasnt thinking of you  oh bartley she joyfully reproached him you must have been  yes i was i was so mad at you that i was glad to have that brute of a stationmaster bullying some woman  bartley  he sat holding her hand marcia he said gravely we must write to your father at once and tell him i want to begin life in the right way and i think its only fair to him  she was enraptured at his magnanimity bartley thats like you poor father i declarebartley im afraid i had forgotten him its dreadful butyou put everything else out of my head i do believe ive died and come to life somewhere else  well i havent said bartley and i guess youd better write to your father youd better write at present he and i are not on speaking terms here he took out his notebook and gave her his stylographic pen after striking the fist that held it upon his other fist in the fashion of the amateurs of that reluctant instrument in order to bring down the ink  oh whats that she asked  its a new kind of pen i got it for a notice in the free press  is henry bird going to edit the paper  i dont know and i dont care answered bartley  ill go out and get an envelope and ask the landlord whats the quickest way to get the letter to your father  he took up his hat but she laid her hand on his arm oh send for him she said  are you afraid i shant come back he demanded with a laughing kiss i want to see him about something else too  well dont be gone long  they parted with an embrace that would have fortified older married people for a years separation when bartley came back she handed him the leaf she had torn out of his book and sat down beside him while he read it with her arm over his shoulder  dear father the letter ran bartley and i are married we were married an hour ago just across the new hampshire line by the rev mr jessup bartley wants i should let you know the very first thing i am going to boston with bartley tonight and as soon as we get settled there i will write again i want you should forgive us both but if you wont forgive bartley you mustnt forgive me you were mistaken about bartley and i was right bartley has told me everything and i am perfectly satisfied love to mother  marcia  psi did intend to visit netty spaulding but i saw bartley driving past on his way to the junction and i determined to see him if i could before he started for boston and tell him i was all wrong no matter what he said or did afterwards i ought to have told you i meant to see bartley but then you would not have let me come and if i had not come i should have died  theres a good deal of bartley in it said the young man with a laugh  you dont like it  yes i do its all right did you use to take the prize for composition at boardingschool  why i think its a very good letter for when im in such an excited state  its beautiful cried bartley laughing more and more the tears started to her eyes  marcia said her husband fondly what a child you are if ever i do anything to betray your trust in me  there came a shuffling of feet outside the door a clinking of glass and crockery and a jarring sort of blow as if some one were trying to rap on the panel with the edge of a heavyladen waiter bartley threw the door open and found the landlord there red and smiling with the waiter in his hand  i thought id bring your supper in here you know he explained confidentially so st you could have it a little more snug and my wife she kind o got wind o what was going onwomen will you know he said with a winkand shes sent ye in some hot biscuit and a little jell and some of her cake he set the waiter down on the table and stood admiring its mystery of napkined dishes she guessed you wouldnt object to some cold chicken and shes put a little of that on shant cost ye any more he hastened to assure them now this is your room till the train comes and there aint agoin to anybody come in here so you can make yourselves at home and i hope youll enjoy your supper as much as we did ourn the night we was married there i guess ill let the lady fix the table she looks as if she knowed how  he got himself out of the room again and then marcia who had made him some embarrassed thanks burst out in praise of his pleasantness  well he ought to be pleasant said bartley hes just beaten me on a horsetrade ive sold him the colt  sold him the colt cried marcia tragically dropping the napkin she had lifted from the plate of cold chicken  well we couldnt very well have taken him to boston with us and we couldnt have got there without selling him you know you havent married a millionnaire marcia  how much did you get for the colt  oh i didnt do so badly i got a hundred and fifty for him  and you had fifteen besides  that was before we were married i gave the minister five for youi think you are worth it i wanted to give fifteen  well then you have a hundred and sixty now isnt that a great deal  an everlasting lot said bartley with an impatient laugh dont let the supper cool marcia  she silently set out the feast but regarded it ruefully you oughtnt to have ordered so much bartley she said you couldnt afford it  i can afford anything when im hungry besides i only ordered the oysters and coffee all the rest is conscience moneyor sentimentfrom the landlord come come cheer up now we shant starve tonight anyhow  well i know father will help us  we shant count on him said bartley now drop it he put his arm round her shoulders and pressed her against him till she raised her face for his kiss  well i will she said and the shadow lifted itself from their wedding feast and they sat down and made merry as if they had all the money in the world to spend they laughed and joked they praised the things they liked and made fun of the others  how strange how perfectly impossible it all seems why last night i was taking supper at kinneys loggingcamp and hating you at every mouthful with all my might everything seemed against me and i was feeling ugly and flirting like mad with a fool from montreal she had come out there from portland for a frolic with the owners party you made me do it marcia he cried jestingly and remember that if you want me to be good you must be kind the other thing seems to make me worse and worse  i willi will bartley she said humbly i will try to be kind and patient with you i will indeed  he threw back his head and laughed and laughed poorpoor old kinney hes the cook you know and he thought id been making fun of him to that woman and he behaved so after they were gone that i started home in a rage and he followed me out with his hands all covered with dough and wanted to stop me but he couldnt for fear of spoiling my clothes he lost himself in another paroxysm  marcia smiled a little then what sort of a looking person was she she tremulously asked  bartley stopped abruptly not one tenthousandth part as goodlooking nor one millionth part as bright as marcia hubbard he caught her and smothered her against his breast  i dont care i dont care she cried i was to blame more than you if you flirted with her and it serves me right yes i will never say anything to you for anything that happened after i behaved so to you  there wasnt anything else happened cried bartley and the montreal woman snubbed me soundly before she was done with me  snubbed you exclaimed marcia with illogical indignation this delighted bartley so much that it was long before he left off laughing over her  then they sat down and were silent till she said and did you leave him in a temper  who kinney in a perfect devil of a temper i wouldnt even borrow some money he wanted to lend me  write to him bartley said his wife seriously i love you so i cant bear to have anybody bad friends with you     xiii   the whole thing was so crazy as bartley said that it made no difference if they kept up the expense a few days longer he took a hack from the depot when they arrived in boston and drove to the revere house instead of going up in the horsecar he entered his name on the register with a flourish bartley j hubbard and wife boston and asked for a room and fire with laconic gruffness but the clerk knew him at once for a country person and when the callboy followed him into the parlor where marcia sat in the tremor into which she fell whenever bartley was out of her sight the callboy discerned her provinciality at a glance and made free to say that he guessed they had better let him take their things up to their room and come up themselves after the porter had got their fire going  all right said bartley with hauteur and he added for no reason be quick about it  yes sir said the boy  what time is supperdinner i mean  its ready now sir  good take up the things come just as you are marcia let him take your capno keep it on a good many of them come down in their bonnets  marcia put off her sack and gloves and hastily repaired the ravages of travel as best she could she would have liked to go to her room just long enough to brush her hair a little and the fur cap made her head hot but she was suddenly afraid of doing something that would seem countrified in bartleys eyes and she promptly obeyed they had come from portland in a parlor car and she had been able to make a travellers toilet before they reached boston  she had been at portland several times with her father but he stopped at a secondclass hotel where he had always put up when alone and she was new to the vastness of hotel mirrors and chandeliers the glossy paint the frescoing the fluted pillars the tessellated marble pavements upon which she stepped when she left the brussels carpeting of the parlors she clung to bartleys arm silently praying that she might not do anything to mortify him and admiring everything he did with all her soul he made a halt as they entered the glittering diningroom and stood frowning till the headwaiter ran respectfully up to them and ushered them with sweeping bows to a table which they had to themselves bartley ordered their dinner with nonchalant ease beginning with soup and going to black coffee with dazzling intelligence while their waiter was gone with their order he beckoned with one finger to another and sent him out for a paper which he unfolded and spread on the table taking a toothpick into his mouth and running the sheet over with his eyes i just want to see whats going on tonight he said without looking at marcia  she made a little murmur of acquiescence in her throat but she could not speak for strangeness she began to steal little timid glances about and to notice the people at the other tables in her heart she did not find the ladies so very well dressed as she had expected the boston ladies to be and there was no gentleman there to compare with bartley either in style or looks she let her eyes finally dwell on him wishing that he would put his paper away and say something but afraid to ask lest it should not be quite right all the other gentlemen were reading papers she was feeling lonesome and homesick when he suddenly glanced at her and said how pretty you look marsh  do i she asked with a little grateful throb while her eyes joyfully suffused themselves  pretty as a pink he returned gayisnt it he continued with a wink that took her into his confidence again from which his study of the newspaper had seemed to exclude her ill tell you what im going to do im going to take you to the museum after dinner and let you see boucicault in the colleen bawn he swept his paper off the table and unfolded his napkin in his lap and leaning back in his chair began to tell her about the play we can walk its only just round the corner he said at the end  marcia crept into the shelter of his talkhe sometimes spoke rather loudand was submissively silent when they got into their own roomwhich had gilt lambrequin frames and a chandelier of three burners and a marble mantel and marbletopped table and washstandand bartley turned up the flaring gas she quite broke down and cried on his breast to make sure that she had got him all back again  why marcia he said i know just how you feel dont you suppose i understand as well as you do that were a country couple but im not going to give myself away and you mustnt either there wasnt a woman in that room that could compare with youdress or looks  you were splendid she whispered and just like the rest and that made me feel somehow as if i had lost you  i knowi saw just how you felt but i wasnt going to say anything for fear youd give way right there come theres plenty of time before the play begins i call this nice oldfashioned rather in the decorations he said but pretty good for its time he had pulled up two armchairs in front of the glowing grate of anthracite as he spoke he cast his eyes about the room and she followed his glance obediently he had kept her hand in his and now he held her slim fingertips in the fist which he rested on his knee no ill tell you what marcia if you want to get on in a city theres no use being afraid of people no use being afraid of anything so long as were good to each other and youve got to believe in me right along dont you let anything get you on the wrong track i believe that as long as you have faith in me i shall deserve it and when you dont  oh bartley you know i didnt doubt you i just got to thinking and i was a little worked up i suppose im excited  i knew it i knew it cried her husband dont you suppose i understand you  they talked a long time together and made each other loving promises of patience they confessed their faults and pledged each other that they would try hard to overcome them they wished to be good they both felt they had much to retrieve but they had no concealments and they knew that was the best way to begin the future of which they did their best to conceive seriously bartley told her his plans about getting some newspaper work till he could complete his law studies he meant to settle down to practice in boston you have to wait longer for it than you would in a country place but when you get it its worth while he asked marcia whether she would look up his friend halleck if she were in his place but he did not give her time to decide i guess i wont do it not just yet at any rate he might suppose that i wanted something of him ill call on him when i dont need his help  perhaps if they had not planned to go to the theatre they would have staid where they were for they were tired and it was very cosey but when they were once in the street they were glad they had come out bowdoin square and court street and tremont row were a glitter of gaslights and those shops with their placarded bargains dazzled marcia  is it one of the principal streets she asked bartley  he gave the laugh of a veteran habitué of boston tremont row no wait till i show you washington street tomorrow theres the museum he said pointing to the long row of globed lights on the façade of the building here we are in scollay square theres hanover street theres cornhill court crooks down that way theres pemberton square  his familiarity with these names estranged him to her again she clung the closer to his arm and caught her breath nervously as they turned in with the crowd that was climbing the stairs to the boxoffice of the theatre bartley left her a moment while he pushed his way up to the little window and bought the tickets firstrate seats he said coming back to her and taking her hand under his arm again and a great piece of luck they were just returned for sale by the man in front of me or i should have had to take something way up in the gallery theres a regular jam these are right in the centre of the parquet  marcia did not know what the parquet was she heard its name with the certainty that but for bartley she should not be equal to it all her village pride was quelled she had only enough selfcontrol to act upon bartleys instructions not to give herself away by any conviction of rusticity they passed in through the long colonnaded vestibule with its paintings and plaster casts and rows of birds and animals in glass cases on either side and she gave scarcely a glance at any of those objects endeared by association if not by intrinsic beauty to the boston playgoer gulliver with the liliputians swarming upon him the paintynecked ostriches and pelicans the mummied mermaid under a glass bell the governors portraits the stuffed elephant washington crossing the delaware cleopatra applying the asp sir william pepperell at full length on canvas and the pagan months and seasons in plasterif all these are indeed the subjectswere dim phantasmagoria amid which she and bartley moved scarcely more real the usher in his dresscoat ran up the aisle to take their checks and led them down to their seats half a dozen elegant people stood to let them into their places the theatre was filled with faces at portland where she saw the lady of lyons with her father threequarters of the house was empty  bartley only had time to lean over and whisper the place is packed with beacon street swellsits a regular field nightwhen the bell tinkled and the curtain rose  as the play went on the rich jacqueminotred flamed into her cheeks and burnt there a steady blaze to the end the people about her laughed and clapped and at times they seemed to be crying but marcia sat through every part as stoical as a savage making no sign except for the flaming color in her cheeks of interest or intelligence bartley talked of the play all the way home but she said nothing and in their own room he asked didnt you really like it were you disappointed i havent been able to get a word out of you about it didnt you like boucicault  i didnt know which he was she answered with impassioned exaltation i didnt care for him i only thought of that poor girl and her husband who despised her  she stopped bartley looked at her a moment and then caught her to him and fell alaughing over her till it seemed as if he never would end and you thoughtyou thought he cried trying to get his breathyou thought you were eily and i was hardress cregan oh i see i see he went on making a mock and a burlesque of her tragical hallucination till she laughed with him at last when he put his hand up to turn out the gas he began his joking afresh the real thing for hardress to do he said fumbling for the key is to blow it out thats what hardress usually does when he comes up from the rural districts with eily on their bridal tour that finishes off eily without troubling danny mann the only drawback is that it finishes off hardress too theyre both found suffocated in the morning     xiv   the next day after breakfast while they stood together before the parlor fire bartley proposed one plan after another for spending the day marcia rejected them all with perfectly recovered selfcomposure  then what shall we do he asked at last  oh i dont know she answered rather absently she added after an interval smoothing the warm front of her dress and putting her foot on the fender what did those theatretickets cost  two dollars he replied carelessly why  marcia gasped two dollars oh bartley we couldnt afford it  it seems we did  and herehow much are we paying here  that room with fire said bartley stretching himself is seven dollars a day  we mustnt stay another instant said marcia all a womans terror of spending money on anything but dress all a wifes conservative instinct rising within her how much have you got left  bartley took out his pocketbook and counted over the bills in it a hundred and twenty dollars  why what has become of it all we had a hundred and sixty  well our railroad tickets were nineteen the sleepingcar was three the parlorcar was three the theatre was two the hack was fifty cents and well have to put down the other two and a half to refreshments  marcia listened in dismay at the end she drew a long breath well we must go away from here as soon as possiblethat i know well go out and find some boardingplace thats the first thing  oh now marcia youre not going to be so severe as that are you pleaded bartley a few dollars more or less are not going to keep us out of the poorhouse i just want to stay here three days that will leave us a clean hundred and we can start fair he was half joking but she was wholly serious  no bartley not another hournot another minute come she took his arm and bent it up into a crook where she put her hand and pulled him toward the door  well after all he said it will be some fun looking up a room  there was no one else in the parlor in going to the door they took some waltzing steps together  while she dressed to go out he looked up places where rooms were let with or without board in the newspaper there dont seem to be a great many he said meditatively bending over the open sheet but he cut out half a dozen advertisements with his editorial scissors and they started upon their search  they climbed those pleasant old uphill streets that converge to the state house and looked into the houses on the quiet places that stretch from one thoroughfare to another they had decided that they would be content with two small rooms one for a chamber and the other for a parlor where they could have a fire they found exactly what they wanted in the first house where they applied one flight up with sunny windows looking down the street but it made marcias blood run cold when the landlady said that the price was thirty dollars a week at another place the rooms were only twenty the position was as good and the carpet and furniture prettier this was still too dear but it seemed comparatively reasonable till it appeared that this was the price without board  i think we should prefer rooms with board shouldnt we asked bartley with a sly look at marcia  the prices were of all degrees of exorbitance and they varied for no reason from house to house one landlady had been accustomed to take more and another less but never little enough for marcia who overruled bartley again and again when he wished to close with some small abatement of terms she declared now that they must put up with one room and they must not care what floor it was on but the cheapest room with board was fourteen dollars a week and marcia had fixed her ideal at ten even that was too high for them  the best way will be to go back to the revere house at seven dollars a day said bartley he had lately been leaving the transaction of the business entirely to marcia who had rapidly acquired alertness and decision in it  she could not respond to his joke what is there left she asked  there isnt anything left he said weve got to the end  they stood on the edge of the pavement and looked up and down the street and then by a common impulse they looked at the house opposite where a placard in the window advertised apartments to letto gentlemen only  it would be of no use asking there murmured marcia in sad abstraction  well lets go over and try said her husband they cant do more than turn us out of doors  i know it wont be of any use marcia sighed as people do when they hope to gain something by forbidding themselves hope but she helplessly followed and stood at the foot of the doorsteps while he ran up and rang  it was evidently the woman of the house who came to the door and shrewdly scanned them  i see you have apartments to let said bartley  well yes admitted the woman as if she considered it useless to deny it i have  i should like to look at them returned bartley with promptness come marcia and reinforced by her he invaded the premises before the landlady had time to repel him ill tell you what we want he continued turning into the little receptionroom at the side of the door and if you havent got it theres no need to trouble you we want a fairsized room anywhere between the cellarfloor and the roof with a bed and a stove and a table in it that shant cost us more than ten dollars a week with board  set down said the landlady herself setting the example by sinking into the rockingchair behind her and beginning to rock while she made a brief study of the intruders want it for yourselves  yes said bartley  well returned the landlady i always have preferred single gentlemen  i inferred as much from a remark which you made in your front window said bartley indicating the placard  the landlady smiled they were certainly a very prettyappearing young couple and the gentleman was evidently upandcoming mrs nash liked bartley as most people of her grade did at once its always ben my experence she explained with the lazily rhythmical drawl in which most halfbred newenglanders speak that i seemed to get along rather better with gentlemen they give less troubleas a general rule she added with a glance at marcia as if she did not deny that there were exceptions and marcia might be a striking one  bartley seized his advantage well my wife hasnt been married long enough to be unreasonable i guess youd get along  they both laughed and marcia blushing joined them  well i thought when you first come up the steps you hadnt been marriedwell not a great while said the landlady  no said bartley it seems a good while to my wife but we were only married day before yesterday  the land cried mrs nash  bartley whispered marcia in soft upbraiding  what well say last week then we were married last week and weve come to boston to seek our fortune  his wit overjoyed mrs nash youll find boston an awful hard place to get along she said shaking her head with a warning smile  i shouldnt think so by the price boston people ask for their rooms returned bartley if i had rooms to let i should get along pretty easily  this again delighted the landlady i guess you aint goin to get out of spirits anyway she said well she continued i have got a room t i guess would suit you unexpectedly vacated she seemed to recur to the language of an advertisement in these words which she pronounced as if reading them its pretty high up she said with another warning shake of the head  stairs to get to it asked bartley  plenty of stairs  well when a place is pretty high up i like to have plenty of stairs to get to it i guess well see it marcia he rose  well ill just go up and see if its fit to be seen first said the landlady  oh bartley said marcia when she had left them alone how could you joke so about our just being married  well i saw she wanted awfully to ask and anybody can tell by looking at us anyway we cant keep that to ourselves any more than we can our greenness besides its money in our pockets shell take something off our board for it youll see now will you manage the bargaining from this on i stepped forward because the rooms were for gentlemen only  i guess id better said marcia  all right then ill take a back seat from this out  oh i do hope it wont be too much sighed the young wife im so tired looking  you can come right along up the landlady called down through the oval spire formed by the ascending handrail of the stairs  they found her in a broad low room whose ceiling sloped with the roof and had the pleasant irregularity of the angles and recessions of two dormer windows the room was clean and cosey there was a table and a stove that could be used open or shut marcia squeezed bartleys arm to signify that it would do perfectlyif only the price would suit  the landlady stood in the middle of the floor and lectured now there i get five dollars a week for this room and i genly let it to two gentlemen its just been vacated by two gentlemen unexpectedly and its hard to get gentlemen at this time the year and thats the reason i thought of takin you as i say i dont much like ladies for inmates and so i put in the window for gentlemen only but its no use bein too particular i cant have the room layin empty on my hands if it suits you you can have it for four dollars its high up and theres no use tryin to deny it but there aint such another view as them winders commands anywheres you can see the harbor and pretty much the whole coast  anything extra for the view said bartley glancing out  no i throw that in  does the price include gas and fire asked marcia sharpened as to all details by previous interviews  it includes the gas but it dont include the fire said the landlady firmly and its pretty low at that as youve found out i guess  yes it is low said marcia bartley i think wed better take it  she looked at him timidly as if she were afraid he might not think it good enough she did not think it good enough for him but she felt that they must make their money go as far as possible  all right he said then its a bargain  and how much more will the board be  well there the landlady said with candor i dont know as i can meet your views i dont ever give board but theres plenty of houses right on the street here where you can get dayboard from four dollars a week up  oh dear sighed marcia and that would make it twelve dollars  why the dear suz child exclaimed the landlady you didnt expect to get it for less  we must said marcia  then youll have to go to a mechanics boardinhouse  i suppose we shall she returned dejectedly bartley whistled  look here said the landlady aint you from down east someeres  marcia started as if the woman had recognized them yes she said  well now said mrs nash im from down maine way myself and ill tell you what i should do if i was in your place you dont want much of anything tor breakfast or tea you can boil you an egg on the stove here and you can make your own tea or coffee and if i was you id go out for my dinners to an eatinhouse i heard some my lodgers tellin how they done well i heard the very gentlemen that occupied this room sayin how they used to go to an eatinhouse and one d order one thing and another another and then theyd halve it between em and make out a firstrate meal for about a quarter apiece plenty of places now where they give you a cut olamb or ribbeef for a shillin and they bring you bread and butter and potato with it an its always enough for two thats what they said i haint never tried it myself but as long as you haint got anybody but yourselves to care for there aint any reason why you shouldnt  they looked at each other  well added the landlady for a final touch say fire that stove wont burn a great deal anyway  all right said bartley well take the roomfor a month at least  mrs nash looked a little embarrassed if she had made some concession to the liking she had conceived for this pretty young couple she could not risk everything i always have to get the first week in advancewhere there aint no reference she suggested  of course said bartley and he took out his pocketbook which he had a boyish satisfaction in letting her see was well filled now marcia he continued looking at his watch ill just run over to the hotel and give up our room before they get us in for dinner  marcia accepted mrs nashs invitation to come and sit with her till the chill was off the room and she borrowed a pen and paper of her to write home the note she sent was brief she was not going to seem to ask anything of her father but she was going to do what was right she told him where she was and she sent her love to her mother she would not speak of her things he might send them or not as he chose but she knew he would this was the spirit of her letter and her training had not taught her to soften and sweeten her phrase but no doubt the old man who was like her would understand that she felt no compunction for what she had done and that she loved him though she still defied him  bartley did not ask her what her letter was when she demanded a stamp of him on his return but he knew he inquired of mrs nash where these cheap eatinghouses were to be found and he posted the letter in the first box they came to merely saying i hope you havent been asking any favors marsh  no indeed  because i couldnt stand that  marcia had never dined in a restaurant and she was somewhat bewildered by the one into which they turned there was a great show of roast and steak and fish and game and squash and cranberrypie in the window and at the door a tack was driven through a mass of bills of fare two of which bartley plucked off as they entered with a knowing air and then threw on the floor when he found the same thing on the table the table had a marble top and a silverplated castor in the centre the plates were laid with a coarse red doily in a cocked hat on each and a thinly plated knife and fork crossed beneath it the plates were thick and heavy the handle as well as the blade of the knife was metal and silvered besides the castor there was a bottle of leicestershire sauce on the table and salt in what marcia thought a pepperbox the marble was of an unctuous translucence in places and showed the course of the cleansing napkin on its smeared surface the place was hot and full of confused smells of cooking all the tables were crowded so that they found places with difficulty and pale plain girls of the provincial and irishamerican type in fashionable bangs and pullbacks went about taking the orders which they wailed out toward a semicircular hole opening upon a counter at the farther end of the room there they received the dishes ordered and hurried with them to the customers before whom they laid them with a noisy clacking of the heavy crockery a great many of the people seemed to be taking hulled corn and milk baked beans formed another favorite dish and squashpie was in large request marcia was not critical roast turkey for bartley and stewed chicken for herself with cranberrypie for both seemed to her a very good and sufficient dinner and better than they ought to have had she asked bartley if this were anything like parkers he had always talked to her about parkers  well marcia he said folding up his doily which does not betray use like the indiscreet white napkin ill just take you round and show you the outside of parkers and some day well go there and get dinner  he not only showed her parkers but the city hall they walked down school street and through washington as far as boylston and bartley pointed out the old south and brought marcia home by the common where they stopped to see the boys coasting under the care of the police between two long lines of spectators  the state house said bartley with easy command of the facts and pointing in the several directions beacon street public garden back bay  she came home to mrs nash joyfully admiring the city but admiring still more her husbands masterly knowledge of it  mrs nash was one of those people who partake intimately of the importance of the place in which they live to whom it is sufficient splendor and prosperity to be a bostonian or newyorker or chicagoan and who experience a delicious selfflattery in the celebration of the municipal grandeur in his degree bartley was of this sort and he exchanged compliments of boston with mrs nash till they grew into warm favor with each other  after a while he said he must go upstairs and do some writing and then he casually dropped the fact that he was an editor and that he had come to boston to get an engagement on a newspaper he implied that he had come to take one  well said mrs nash smoothing the back of the cat which she had in her lap i guess there aint anything like our boston papers and they say this new onethe daily eventsis goin to take the lead you acquainted any with our boston editors  bartley hemmed welli know the proprietor of the events  ah yes mr witherby well they say hes got the money i hear my lodgers talkin about that paper considable i havent ever seen it  bartley now went upstairs he had an idea in his head marcia remained with mrs nash a few moments hes been in boston before she said with proud satisfaction he visited here when he was in college  law is he collegebred cried mrs nash well i thought he looked most too wideawake for that he aint a bit offish he seems rel practical what you hurryin off so for she asked as marcia rose and stood poised on the threshold in act to follow her husband why dont you set here with me while hes at his writin youll just keep talkin to him and takin his mind off the whole while you stay here she commanded hospitably youll just be in the way up there  this was a novel conception to marcia but its good sense struck her well i will she said ill run up a minute to leave my things and then ill come back  she found bartley dragging the table on which he had already laid out his writingmaterials into a good light and she threw her arms round his neck as if they had been a great while parted  come up to kiss me good luck he asked finding her lips  yes and to tell you how splendid you are going right to work this way she answered fondly  oh i dont believe in losing time and ive got to strike while the irons hot if im going to write out that loggingcamp business ill take it over to that events man and hit him with it while its fresh in his mind  yes said marcia are you going to write that out  why i told you i was any objections he did not pay much attention to her and he asked his question jokingly as he went on making his preparations  its hard for me to realize that people can care for such things i thought perhaps youd begin with something else she suggested hanging up her sack and hat in the closet  no thats the very thing to begin with he answered carelessly what are you going to do want that book to read that i bought on the cars  no im going down to sit with mrs nash while youre writing  well thats a good idea  you can call me when youve done  done cried bartley i shant be done till this time tomorrow im going to make a lot about it  oh said his wife well i suppose the more there is the more you will get for it shall you put in about those people coming to see the camp  yes i think i can work that in so that old witherby will like it something about a distinguished boston newspaper proprietor and his refined and elegant ladies as a sort of contrast to the rude life of the loggers  i thought you didnt admire them a great deal  well i didnt much but i can work them up  marcia was quite ready to go bartley had seated himself at his table but she still hovered about and are youshall you put that montreal woman in  yes get it all in shell work up firstrate  marcia was silent then i shouldnt think youd put her in she said if she was so silly and disagreeable  bartley turned around and saw the look on her face that he could not mistake he rose and took her by the chin look here marsh he said didnt you promise me youd stop that  yes she murmured while the color flamed into her cheeks  and will you  i did try  he looked sharply into her eyes confound the montreal woman i wont put in a word about her there he kissed marcia and held her in his arms and soothed her as if she had been a jealous child  oh bartley oh bartley she cried i love you so  i think its a remark you made before he said and with a final kiss and laugh he pushed her out of the door and she ran down stairs to mrs nash again  your husband ever write poetry any inquired the landlady  no returned marcia he used to in college but he says it dont pay  one my lodgerswell she was a lady you cant seem to get gentlemen oftentimes in the summer season for love or money and i was puttin up with herbreakin joints as you may say for the time beinshe wrote poetry n i guess she found it pretty poor pickin used to write for the weekly papers she said n the childns magazines well she couldnt get more n a doll or two n i do know but what less for a piece as long as that mrs nash held her hands about a foot apart used to show em to me and tell me about em i declare i used to pity her i used to tell her i ruther break stone for my livin  marcia sat talking more than an hour to mrs nash informing herself upon the history of mrs nashs past and present lodgers and about the ways of the city and the prices of provisions and dressgoods the dearness of everything alarmed and even shocked her but she came back to her faith in bartleys ability to meet and overcome all difficulties she grew drowsy in the close air which mrs nash loved after all her fatigues and excitements and she said she guessed she would go up and see how bartley was getting on but when she stole into the room and saw him busily writing she said now i wont speak a word bartley and coiled herself down under a shawl on the bed near enough to put her hand on his shoulder if she wished and fell asleep     xv   it took bartley two days to write out his account of the loggingcamp he worked it up to the best of his ability giving all the facts that he had got out of kinney and relieving these with what he considered picturesque touches he had the newspaper instinct and he divined that his readers would not care for his picturesqueness without his facts he therefore subordinated this and he tried to give his description of the loggers a politicoeconomical interest dwelling upon the variety of nationalities engaged in the industry and the changes it had undergone in what he called its personnel he enlarged upon its present character and its future development in relation to what he styled in a line of small capitals with an early use of the favorite newspaper possessive  columbias moribund shipbuilding  and he interspersed his text plentifully with exclamatory headings intended to catch the eye with startling fragments of narration and statement such as  the pinetree states storied staple  more than a million of money  unbroken wilderness  wildcats lynxes and bears  bitten off  both legs frozen to the knees  canadian songs  joy unconfined  the lamplight on their swarthy faces  he spent a final forenoon in polishing his article up and stuffing it full of telling points but after dinner on this last day he took leave of marcia with more trepidation than he was willing to show or knew how to conceal her devout faith in his success seemed to unnerve him and he begged her not to believe in it so much  he seized what courage he had left in both hands and found himself after the usual reluctance of the people in the business office face to face with mr witherby in his private room mr witherby had lately dismissed his managing editor for his neglect of the true interests of the paper as represented by the countingroom and was managing the events himself he sat before a table strewn with newspapers and manuscripts and as he looked up bartley saw that he did not recognize him  how do you do mr witherby i had the pleasure of meeting you the other day in maineat mr willetts loggingcamp hubbard is my name remember me as editor of the equity free press  oh yes said mr witherby rising and standing at his desk as a sort of compromise between asking his visitor to sit down and telling him to go away he shook hands in a loose way and added i presume you would like to exchange but the fact is our list is so large already that we cant extend it just now we cant  bartley smiled i dont want any exchange mr witherby im out of the free press  ah said the city journalist with relief he added in a leading tone then  ive come to offer you an articlean account of lumbering in our state its a little sketch that ive prepared from what i saw in mr willetts camp and some facts and statistics ive picked up i thought it might make an attractive feature of your sunday edition  the events said mr witherby solemnly does not publish a sunday edition  of course not answered bartley inwardly cursing his blunderi mean your saturday evening supplement he handed him his manuscript  mr witherby looked at it with the worry of a dull man who has assumed unintelligible duties he had let the other papers get ahead of him on several important enterprises lately and he would have been glad to retrieve himself but he could not be sure that this was an enterprise he began by saying that their last saturday supplement was just out and the next was full and he ended by declaring with stupid pomp that the events preferred to send its own reporters to write up those matters then he hemmed and looked at bartley and he would really have been glad to have him argue him out of this position but bartley could not divine what was in his mind the cold fit which sooner or later comes to every form of authorship seized him he said awkwardly he was very sorry and putting his manuscript back in his pocket he went out feeling curiously lightheaded as if his rebuff had been a stunning blow the affair was so quickly over that he might well have believed it had not happened but he was sickeningly disappointed he had counted upon the sale of his article to the events his hope had been founded upon actual knowledge of the proprietors intention and although he had rebuked marcias overweening confidence he had expected that witherby would jump at it but witherby had not even looked at it  bartley walked a long time in the cold winter sunshine fie would have liked to go back to his lodging and hide his face in marcias hands and let her pity him but he could not bear the thought of her disappointment and he kept walking at last he regained courage enough to go to the editor of the paper for which he used to correspond in the summer and which had always printed his letters this editor was busy too but he apparently felt some obligations to civility with bartley and though he kept glancing over his exchanges as they talked he now and then glanced at bartley also he said that he should be glad to print the sketch but that they never paid for outside material and he advised bartley to go with it to the events or to the daily chronicleabstract the abstract and the brief chronicle had lately consolidated and they were showing a good deal of enterprise bartley said nothing to betray that he had already been at the events office and upon this friendly editors invitation to drop in again some time he went away considerably reinspirited  if you should happen to go to the chronicleabstract folks the editor called after him you can tell them i suggested your coming  the managing editor of the chronicleabstract was reading a manuscript and he did not desist from his work on bartleys appearance which he gave no sign of welcoming but he had a whimsical shrewd kind face and bartley felt that he should get on with him though he did not rise and though he let bartley stand  yes he said lumbering hey well theres some interest in that just now on account of this talk about the decay of our shipbuilding interests anything on that point  thats the very point i touch on first said bartley  the editor stopped turning over his manuscript lets see he said holding out his hand for bartleys article he looked at the first headline what i know about logging and smiled old but good then he glanced at the other headings and ran his eye down the long strips on which bartley had written nibbled at the text here and there a little returned to the first paragraph and read that through looked back at something else and then read the close  i guess you can leave it he said laying the manuscript on the table  no i guess not said bartley with equal coolness gathering it up  the editor looked fairly at him for the first time and smiled evidently he liked this whats the reason any particular hurry  i happen to know that the events is going to send a man down east to write up this very subject and i dont propose to leave this article here till they steal my thunder and then have it thrown back on my hands not worth the paper its written on  the editor tilted himself back in his chair and braced his knees against his table well i guess youre right he said what do you want for it  this was a terrible question bartley knew nothing about the prices that city papers paid he feared to ask too much but he also feared to cheapen his wares by asking too little twentyfive dollars he said huskily  lets look at it said the editor reaching out his hand for the manuscript again sit down he pushed a chair toward bartley with his foot having first swept a pile of newspapers from it to the floor he now read the article more fully and then looked up at bartley who sat still trying to hide his anxiety youre not quite a new hand at the bellows are you  ive edited a country paper  yes where  down in maine  the editor bent forward and took out a long narrow blankbook i guess we shall want your article what name  bartley j hubbard it sounded in his ears like some other name  going to be in boston some time  all the time said bartley struggling to appear nonchalant the revulsion from the despair into which he had fallen after his interview with witherby was still very great the order on the countingroom which the editor had given him shook in his hand he saw his way before him clearly now he wished to propose some other things that he would like to write but he was saved from this folly for the time by the editors saying in a tone of dismissal better come in tomorrow and see a proof we shall put you into the wednesday supplement  thanks said bartley good day  the editor did not hear him or did not think it necessary to respond from behind the newspaper which he had lifted up between them and bartley went out he did not stop to cash his order he made boyish haste to show it to marcia as something more authentic than the money itself and more sacred as he hurried homeward he figured marcias ecstasy in his thought he saw himself flying up the stairs to their attic three steps at a bound and bursting into the room where she sat eager and anxious and flinging the order into her lap and then when she had read it with rapture at the sum and pride in the smartness with which he had managed the whole affair he saw himself catching her up and dancing about the floor with her he thought how fond of her he was and he wondered that he could ever have been cold or lukewarm  she was standing at the window of mrs nashs little receptionroom when he reached the house it was not to be as he had planned but he threw her a kiss glad of the impatience which would not let her wait till he could find her in their own room and he had the precious order in his hand to dazzle her eyes as soon as he should enter but as he sprang into the hall his foot struck against a trunk and some boxes  hello he cried your things have come  marcia lingered within the door of the receptionroom she seemed afraid to come out yes she said faintly father brought them he has just been here  he seemed there still and the vision unnerved her as if bartley and he had been confronted there in reality her husband had left her hardly a quarter of an hour when a hack drove up to the door and her father alighted she let him in herself before he could ring and waited tremulously for what he should do or say but he merely took her hand and stooping over gave her the chary kiss with which he used to greet her at home when he returned from an absence  she flung her arms around his neck oh father  well well there there he said and then he went into the receptionroom with her and there was nothing in his manner to betray that anything unusual had happened since they last met he kept his hat on as his fashion was and he kept on his overcoat below which the skirts of his dresscoat hung an inch or two he looked old and weary and shabby  i cant leave bartley father she began hysterically  i havent come to separate you from your husband marcia what made you think so its your place to stay with him  hes out now she answered in an incoherent hopefulness hes just gone will you wait and see him father  no i guess i cant wait said the old man it wouldnt do any good for us to meet now  do you think he coaxed me away he didnt he took pity on mehe forgave me and i didnt mean to deceive you when i left home father but i couldnt help trying to see bartley again  i believe you marcia i understand the thing had to be let me see your marriage certificate  she ran up to her room and fetched it  her father read it carefully yes that is all right he said and returned it to her he added after an absent pause i have brought your things marcia your mother packed all she could think of  how is mother asked marcia as if this had first reminded her of her mother  she is usually well replied her father  wont youwont you come up and see our room father marcia asked after the interval following this feint of interest in her mother  no said the old man rising restlessly from his chair and buttoning at his coat which was already buttoned i guess i shant have time i guess i must be going  marcia put herself between him and the door wont you let me tell you about it father  about what  howi came to go off with bartley i want you should know  i guess i know all i want to know about it marcia i accept the facts i told you how i felt what youve done hasnt changed me toward you i understand you better than you understand yourself and i cant say that im surprised now i want you should make the best of it  you dont forgive bartley she cried passionately then i dont want you should forgive me  where did you pick up this nonsense about forgiving said her father knitting his shaggy brows a man does this thing or that and the consequence follows i couldnt forgive bartley so that he could escape any consequence of what hes done and youre not afraid i shall hurt him  stay and see him she pleaded he is so kind to me he works night and day and he has just gone out to sell something he has written for the papers  i never said he was lazy returned her father do you want any money marcia  no we have plenty and bartley is earning it all the time i wish you would stay and see him  no im glad he didnt happen to be in said the squire i shant wait for him to come back it wouldnt do any good just yet marcia it would only do harm bartley and i havent had time to change our minds about each other yet but ill say a good word for him to you youre his wife and its your part to help him not to hinder him you can make him worse by being a fool but you neednt be a fool dont worry him about other women dont be jealous hes your husband now and the worst thing you can do is to doubt him  i wont father i wont indeed i will be good and i will try to be sensible oh i wish bartley could know how you feel  dont tell him from me said her father and dont keep making promises and breaking them ill help the man in with your things  he went out and came in again with one end of a trunk as if he had been giving the man a hand with it into the house at home and she suffered him as passively as she had suffered him to do her such services all her life then he took her hand laxly in his and stooped down for another chary kiss good by marcia  why father are you going to leave me she faltered  he smiled in melancholy irony at the bewilderment the childish forgetfulness of all the circumstances which her words expressed oh no im going to take you with me  his sarcasm restored her to a sense of what she had said and she ruefully laughed at herself through her tears what am i talking about give my love to mother when will you come again she asked clinging about him almost in the old playful way  when you want me said the squire freeing himself  ill write she cried after him as he went down the steps and if there had been at any moment a consciousness of her cruelty to him in her heart she lost it when he drove away in her anxious waiting for bartleys return it seemed to her that though her father had refused to see him his visit was of happy augury for future kindness between them and she was proudly eager to tell bartley what good advice her father had given her but the sight of her husband suddenly turned these thoughts to fear she trembled and all that she could say was i know father will be all right bartley  how he retorted savagely by the way he abused me to you where is he  hes gonegone back  i dont care where hes gone so hes gone did he come to take you home with him why didnt you gooh marcia the brutal words had hardly escaped him when he ran to her as if he would arrest them before their sense should pierce her heart  she thrust him back with a stiffly extended arm keep away dont touch me she walked by him up the stairs without looking round at him and he heard her close their door and lock it     xvi   bartley stood for a moment and then went out and wandered aimlessly about till nightfall he went out shocked and frightened at what he had done and ready for any reparation but this mood wore away and he came back sullenly determined to let her make the advances toward reconciliation if there was to be one her love had already made his peace and she met him in the dimly lighted little hall with a kiss of silent penitence and forgiveness she had on her hat and shawl as if she had been waiting for him to come and take her out to tea and on their way to the restaurant she asked him of his adventure among the newspapers he told her briefly and when they sat down at their table he took out the precious order and showed it to her but its magic was gone it was only an order for twentyfive dollars now and two hours ago it had been success rapture a common hope and a common joy they scarcely spoke of it but talked soberly of indifferent things  she could not recur to her fathers visit at once and he would not be the first to mention it he did nothing to betray his knowledge of her intention as she approached the subject through those feints that women use and when they stood again in their little attic room she was obliged to be explicit  what hurt me bartley she said was that you should think for an instant that i would let father ask me to leave you or that he would ask such a thing he only came to tell me to be good to you and help you and trust you and not worry you with my silliness andandjealousy and i dont ever mean to and i know he will be good friends with you yet he praised you for working so hardshe pushed it a little beyond the bare facthe always did that and i know hes only waiting for a good chance to make it up with you  she lifted her eyes glistening with tears and it touched his peculiar sense of humor to find her offering him reparation when he had felt himself so outrageously to blame but he would not be outdone in magnanimity if it came to that  its all right marsh i was a furious idiot or i should have let you explain at once but you see i had only one thought in my mind and that was my luck which i wanted to share with you and when your father seemed to have come in between us again  oh yes yes she answered i understand and she clung to him in the joy of this perfect intelligence which she was sure could never be obscured again  when bartleys article came out she read it with a fond admiration which all her praises seemed to leave unsaid she bought a scrapbook and pasted the article into it and said that she was going to keep everything he wrote what are you going to write the next thing she asked  well thats what i dont know he answered i cant find another subject like that so easily  why if people care to read about a loggingcamp i should think they would read about almost anything nothing could be too common for them you might even write about the trouble of getting cheap enough rooms in boston  marcia cried bartley youre a treasure ill write about that very thing i know the chronicleabstract will be glad to get it  she thought he was joking till he came to her after a while for some figures which he did not remember he had the true newspaper instinct and went to work with a motive that was as different as possible from the literary motive he wrote for the effect which he was to make and not from any artistic pleasure in the treatment he did not attempt to give it formto imagine a young couple like himself and marcia coming down from the country to place themselves in the city he made no effort to throw about it the poetry of their ignorance and their poverty or the pathetic humor of their dismay at the disproportion of the prices to their means he set about getting all the facts he could and he priced a great many lodgings in different parts of the city then he went to a number of realestate agents and giving himself out as a reporter of the chronicleabstract he interviewed them as to houserents past and present upon these bottom facts as he called them he based a spicy sketch which had also largely the character of an exposé there is nothing the public enjoys so much as an exposé it seems to be made in the readers own interest it somehow constitutes him a party to the attack upon the abuse and its effectiveness redounds to the credit of all the newspapers subscribers after a weeks stay in boston bartley was able to assume the feelings of a native who sees his city falling into decay through the rapacity of its landladies in the heading of ten or fifteen lines which he gave his sketch the greater number were devoted to this feature of it though the space actually allotted to it in the text was comparatively small he called his report bostons boardinghouses and he spent a paragraph upon the relation of boardinghouses to civilization before detailing his own experience and observation this part had many of those strokes of crude picturesqueness and humor which he knew how to give and was really entertaining but it was when he came to contrast the rates of houserent and the cost of provisions with the landladies  perpendicular prices  that bartley showed all the virtue of a born reporter the sentences were vivid and telling the ensemble was very alarming and the conclusion was inevitable that unless this abuse could somehow be reached we should lose a large and valuable portion of our populationespecially those young married people of small means with whom the citys future prosperity so largely rested and who must drift away to find homes in rival communities if the present exorbitant demands were maintained  as bartley had foretold he had not the least trouble in selling this sketch to the chronicleabstract the editor probably understood its essential cheapness perfectly well but he also saw how thoroughly readable it was he did not grumble at the increased price which bartley put upon his work it was still very far from dear and he liked the young downeasters enterprise he gave him as cordial a welcome as an overworked man may venture to offer when bartley came in with his copy and he felt like doing him a pleasure some things out of the loggingcamp sketch had been copied and people had spoken to the editor about it which was a still better sign that it was a hit  dont you want to come round to our club tonight asked the editor as he handed bartley the order for his money across the table we have a bad dinner and we try to have a good time were all newspaper men together  why thank you said bartley i guess i should like to go  well come round at halfpast five and go with me  bartley walked homeward rather soberly he had meant if he sold this article to make amends for the disappointment they had both suffered before and to have a commemorative supper with marcia at parkers he had ignored a little hint of hers about his never having taken her there yet because he was waiting for this chance to do it in style he resolved that if she did not seem to like his going to the club he would go back and withdraw his acceptance but when he told her he had been invitedhe thought he would put the fact in this tentative wayshe said i hope you accepted  would you have liked me to he asked with relief  why of course its a great honor youll get acquainted with all those editors and perhaps some of them will want to give you a regular place a salaried employment was their common ideal of a provision for their future  well thats what i was thinking myself said bartley  go and accept at once she pursued  oh that isnt necessary if i get round there by halfpast five i can go he answered  his lurking regret ceased when he came into the receptionroom where the members of the club were constantly arriving and putting off their hats and overcoats and then falling into groups for talk his friend of the chronicleabstract introduced him lavishly as our american custom is bartley had a little strangeness but no bashfulness and with his essentially slight opinion of people he was promptly at his ease these men liked his handsome face his winning voice the goodfellowship of his instant readiness to joke he could see that they liked him and that his friend ricker was proud of the impression he made before the evening was over he kept himself with difficulty from patronizing ricker a little  the club has grown into something much more splendid and expensive but it was then content with a dinner certainly as bad as ricker promised but fabulously modest in price at an oldfashioned hotel whose site was long ago devoured by a drygoods palace the drink was commonly water or beer occasionally if a great actor or other distinguished guest honored the board some spendthrift ordered champagne but no one thought fit to go to this ruinous extreme for bartley ricker offered him his choice of beer or claret and bartley temperately preferred water to either he could see that this raised him in rickers esteem  no company of men can fail to have a good time at a public dinner and the good time began at once with these journalists whose overworked week ended in this saturday evening jollity they were mostly young men who found sufficient compensation in the excitement and adventure of their underpaid labors and in the vague hope of advancement there were grizzled beards among them for whom neither the novelty nor the expectation continued but who loved the life for its own sake and would hardly have exchanged it for prosperity here and there was an old fellow for whom probably all the illusion was gone but he was proud of his vocation proud even of the changes that left him somewhat superannuated in his tastes and methods none indeed who have ever known it can wholly forget the generous rage with which journalism inspires its followers to each of those young men beginning the strangely fascinating life as reporters and correspondents his paper was as dear as his king once was to a french noble to serve it night and day to wear himself out for its sake to merge himself in its glory and to live in its triumphs without personal recognition from the public was the loyal devotion which each expected his sovereign newspaper to accept as its simple right they went and came with the prompt and passive obedience of soldiers wherever they were sent and they struggled each to get in ahead of all the others with the individual zeal of heroes they expanded to the utmost limits of occasion and they submitted with an anguish that was silent to the editorial excision compression and mutilation of reports that were vitally dear to them what becomes of these ardent young spirits the inner history of journalism in any great city might pathetically show but the outside world knows them only in the fine frenzy of interviewing or of recording the midnight ravages of what they call the devouring element or of working up horrible murders or tragical accidents or of tracking criminals who have baffled all the detectives hearing their talk bartley began to realize that journalism might be a very different thing from what he had imagined it in a country printingoffice and that it might not be altogether wise to consider it merely as a steppingstone to the law  with the american eagerness to recognize talent numbers of good fellows spoke to him about his logging sketch even those who had not read it seemed to know about it as a hit they were all delighted to be able to say ricker tells me that you offered it to old witherby and he wouldnt look at it he found that this fact which he had doubtfully confided to ricker was not offensive to some of the events people who were there one of them got him aside and darkly owned to him that witherby was doing everything that any one man could to kill the events and that in fact the countingroom was running the paper  all the club united in abusing the dinner which in his rustic ignorance bartley had not found so infamous but they ate it with perfect appetite and with mounting good spirits the president brewed punch in a great bowl before him and rising with a glass of it in his hand opened a free parliament of speaking storytelling and singing whoever recollected a song or a story that he liked called upon the owner of it to sing it or tell it and it appeared not to matter how old the fun or the music was the company was resolved to be happy it roared and clapped till the glasses rang you will like this song bartleys neighbors to right and left of him prophesied or just listen to this story of masonsits capitalas one or another rose in response to a general clamor when they went back to the receptionroom they carried the punchbowl with them and there amid a thick cloud of smoke two clever amateurs took their places at the piano and sang and played to their hearts content while the rest glass in hand talked and laughed or listened as they chose bartley had not been called upon but he was burning to try that song in which he had failed so dismally in the loggingcamp when the pianist rose at last he slipped down into the chair and striking the chords of the accompaniment he gave his piece with brilliant audacity the room silenced itself and then burst into a roar of applause and cries of encore there could be no doubt of the success look here ricker said a leading man at the end of the repetition your friend must be one of usand rapping on the table he proposed bartleys name in that simple time the club voted viva voce on proposed members and bartley found himself elected by acclamation and in the act of paying over his initiation fee to the treasurer before he had well realized the honor done him everybody near him shook his hand and offered to be of service to him much of this cordiality was merely collective good feeling something of it might be justly attributed to the punch but the greater part was honest in this civilization of ours grotesque and unequal and imperfect as it is in many things we are bound together in a brotherly sympathy unknown to any other we new men have all had our hard rubs but we do not so much remember them in soreness or resentment as in the wish to help forward any other who is presently feeling them if he will but help himself too a hundred hands are stretched out to him  bartley had kept his head clear of the punch but he left the club drunk with joy and pride and so impatient to be with marcia and tell her of his triumphs that he could hardly wait to read the proof of his boardinghouse article which ricker had put in hand at once for the sunday edition he found marcia sitting up for him and she listened with a shining face while he hastily ran over the most flattering facts of the evening she was not so much surprised at the honors done him as he had expected but she was happier and she made him repeat it all and give her the last details he was afraid she would ask him what his initiation had cost but she seemed to have no idea that it had cost anything and though it had swept away a third of the money he had received for his sketch he still resolved that she should have that supper at parkers  i consider my future made he said aloud at the end of his swift cogitation on this point  oh yes she responded rapturously we neednt have a moments anxiety but we must be very saving still till you get a place  oh certainly said bartley     xvii   during several months that followed bartleys work consisted of interviewing of special reporting in all its branches of correspondence by mail and telegraph from points to which he was sent his leisure he spent in studying subjects which could be treated like that of the boardinghouses marcia entered into his affairs with the keen halfintelligence which characterizes a womans participation in business whatever could be divined she was quickly mistress of she vividly sympathized with his difficulties and his triumphs she failed to follow him in matters of political detail or of general effect she could not be dispassionate or impartial his relation to any enterprise was always more important than anything else about it on some of his missions he took her with him and then they made it a pleasure excursion and if they came home late with the material still unwritten she helped him with his notes wrote from his dictation and enabled him to give a fuller report than his rivals she caught up with amusing aptness the technical terms of the profession and was voluble about getting in ahead of the events and the other papers and she was indignant if any part of his report was cut out or garbled or any feature was spoiled  he made a card of grouping and treating with picturesque freshness the spring openings of the milliners and drygoods people and when he brought his article to ricker the editor ran it over and said guess you took your wife with you hubbard  yes i did bartley owned he was always proud of her looks and it flattered him that ricker should see the evidences of her feminine taste and knowledge in his account of the bonnets and dress goods you dont suppose i could get at all these things by inspiration do you  marcia was already known to some of his friends whom he had introduced to her in casual encounters they were mostly unmarried or if married they lived at a distance and they did not visit the hubbards at their lodgings marcia was a little shy and did not quite know whether they ought to call without being asked or whether she ought to ask them besides mrs nashs receptionroom was not always at her disposal and she would not have liked to take them all the way up to her own room her social life was therefore confined to the public places where she met these friends of her husbands they sometimes happened together at a restaurant or saw one another between the acts at the theatre or on coming out of a concert marcia was not so much admired for her conversation by her acquaintance as for her beauty and her style a rustic reluctance still lingered in her she was thin and dry in her talk with any one but bartley and she could not help letting even men perceive that she was uneasy when they interested him in matters foreign to her  bartley did not see why they could not have some of these fellows up in their room for tea but marcia told him it was impossible in fact although she willingly lived this irregular life with him she was at heart not at all a bohemian she did not like being in lodgings or dining at restaurants on their horsecar excursions into the suburbs when the spring opened she was always choosing this or that little house as the place where she would like to live and wondering if it were within their means she said she would gladly do all the work herself she hated to be idle so much as she now must the citys novelty wore off for her sooner than for him the concerts the lectures the theatres had already lost their zest for her and she went because he wished her to go or in order to be able to help him with what he was always writing about such things  as the spring advanced bartley conceived the plan of a local study something in the manner of the boardinghouse article but on a much vaster scale he proposed to ricker a timely series on the easily accessible hotweather resorts to be called bostons breathingplaces and to relate mainly to the seaside hotels and their surroundings his idea was encouraged and he took marcia with him on most of his expeditions for its realization these were largely made before the regular season had well begun but the boats were already running and the hotels were open and they were treated with the hospitality which a knowledge of bartleys mission must invoke as he said it was a matter of business give and take on both sides and the landlords took more than they gave in any such trade  on her part marcia regarded deadheading as a just and legitimate privilege of the press if not one of its chief attributes and these passes on boats and trains this system of paying hotelbills by the presentation of a card constituted distinguished and honorable recognition from the public to her simple experience when bartley told how magnificently the reporters had been accommodated at some civic or commercial or professional banquet with a table of their own where they were served with all the wines and courses he seemed to have been one of the principal guests and her fear was that his head should be turned by his honors but at the bottom of her heart though she enjoyed the brilliancy of bartleys present life she did not think his occupation comparable to the law in dignity bartley called himself a journalist now but his newspaper connection still identified him in her mind with those country editors of whom she had always heard her father speak with such contempt men dedicated to poverty and the despite of all the local notables who used them she could not shake off the old feeling of degradation even when she heard bartley and some of his fellowjournalists talking in their boastfulest vein of the sovereign character of journalism and she secretly resolved never to relinquish her purpose of having him a lawyer till he was fairly this in regular and prosperous practice she knew that she should not have shown her father that she was right in marrying bartley  in the mean time their life went ignorantly on in the obscure channels where their isolation from society kept it longer than was natural three or four months after they came to boston they were still country people with scarcely any knowledge of the distinctions and differences so important to the various worlds of any city so far from knowing that they must not walk in the common they used to sit down on a bench there in the pleasant weather and watch the opening of the spring among the lovers whose passion had a publicity that neither surprised nor shocked them after they were a little more enlightened they resorted to the public garden where they admired the bridge and the rockwork and the statues bartley who was already beginning to get up a taste for art boldly stopped and praised the venus in the presence of the gardeners planting tulipbulbs  they went sometimes to the museum of fine arts where they found a pleasure in the worst things which the best never afterwards gave them and where she became as hungry and tired as if it were the vatican they had a pride in taking books out of the public library where they walked about on tiptoe with bated breath and they thought it a divine treat to hear the great organ play at noon as they sat there in the music hall and let the mighty instrument bellow over their strong young nerves bartley whispered marcia the jokes he had heard about the organ and then upon the wave of aristocratic sensation from this experience they went out and dined at copelands or webers or feras or even at parkers they had long since forsaken the humble restaurant with its doilies and its ponderous crockery and they had so mastered the art of ordering that they could manage a dinner as cheaply at these finer places as anywhere especially if marcia pretended not to care much for her half of the portion and connived at its transfer to bartleys plate  in his hours of leisure they were so perpetually together that it became a joke with the men who knew them to say when asked if bartley were married very much married it was not wholly their inseparableness that gave the impression of this extreme conjugality as i said marcias uneasiness when others interested bartley in things alien to her made itself felt even by these men she struggled against it because she did not wish to put him to shame before them and often with an aching sense of desolation she sent him off with them to talk apart or left him with them if they met on the street and walked home alone rather than let any one say that she kept her husband tied to her apronstrings his club after the first sense of its splendor and usefulness wore away was an ordeal she had failed to conceal that she thought the initiation and annual fees extravagant she knew no other bliss like having bartley sit down in their own room with her it did not matter whether they talked if he were busy she would as lief sit and sew or sit and silently look at him as he wrote in these moments she liked to feign that she had lost him that they had never been married and then come back with a rush of joy to the reality but on his club nights she heroically sent him off and spent the evening with mrs nash sometimes she went out by day with the landlady who had a passion for auctions and cemeteries and who led marcia to an intimate acquaintance with such pleasures at mount auburn marcia liked the marble lambs and the emblematic hands pointing upward with the dexter finger and the infants carved in stone and the angels with folded wings and lifted eyes better than the casts which bartley said were from the antique in the museum on this side her mind was as wholly dormant as that of mrs nash herself she always came home feeling as if she had not seen bartley for a year and fearful that something had happened to him  the hardest thing about their irregular life was that he must sometimes be gone two or three days at a time when he could not take her with him then it seemed to her that she could not draw a full breath in his absence and once he found her almost wild on his return she had begun to fancy that he was never coming back again he laughed at her when she betrayed her secret but she was not ashamed and when he asked her well what if i hadnt come back she answered passionately it wouldnt have made much difference to me i should not have lived  the uncertainty of his income was another cause of anguish to her at times he earned forty or fifty dollars a week oftener he earned ten there was now and then a week when everything that he put his hand to failed and he earned nothing at all then marcia despaired her frugality became a mania and they had quarrels about what she called his extravagance she embittered his daily bread by blaming him for what he spent on it she wore her oldest dresses and would have had him go shabby in token of their adversity her economies were frantic childs playmethodless inexperienced fitful and they were apt to be followed by remorse in which she abetted him in some wanton excess  the future of any heroic action is difficult to manage and the sublime sacrifice of her pride and all the conventional proprieties which marcia had made in giving herself to bartley was inevitably tried by the same sordid tests that every married life is put to  that salaried place which he was always seeking on the staff of some newspaper proved not so easy to get as he had imagined in the flush of his first successes ricker willingly included him among the chronicleabstracts own correspondents and special reporters and he held the same offandon relation to several other papers but he remained without a more definite position he earned perhaps more money than a salary would have given him and in their way of living he and marcia laid up something out of what he earned but it did not seem to her that he exerted himself to get a salaried place she was sure that if so many others who could not write half so well had places he might get one if he only kept trying bartley laughed at these businessturns of marcias as he called them but sometimes they enraged him and he had days of sullen resentment when he resisted all her advances towards reconciliation but he kept hard at work and he always owned at last how disinterested her most ridiculous alarm had been  once when they had been talking as usual about that permanent place on some newspaper she said but i should only want that to be temporary if you got it i want you should go on with the law bartley ive been thinking about that i dont want you should always be a journalist  bartley smiled what could i do for a living i should like to know while i was studying law  you could do some newspaper workenough to support uswhile you were studying you said when we first came to boston that you should settle down to the law  i hadnt got my eyes open then ive got a good deal longer row to hoe than i supposed before i can settle down to the law  father said you didnt need to study but a little more  not if i were going into the practice at equity but its a very different thing i can tell you in boston i should have to go in for a course in the harvard law school just for a little startoff  marcia was silenced but she asked after a moment then youre going to give up the law altogether  i dont know what im going to do im going to do the best i can for the present and trust to luck i dont like special reporting for a finality but i shouldnt like shystering either  whats shystering asked marcia  its pettifogging in the city courts wait till i can get my basistill i have a fixed amount of money for a fixed amount of workand then ill talk to you about taking up the law again im willing to do it whenever it seems the right thing i guess i should like it though i dont see why its any better than journalism and i dont believe it has any more prizes  but youve been a long time trying to get your basis on a newspaper she reasoned why dont you try to get it in some other way why dont you try to get a clerks place with some lawyer  well suppose i was willing to starve along in that way how should i go about to get such a place demanded bartley with impatience  why dont you go to that mr halleck you visited here you used to tell me he was going to be a lawyer  well if you remember so distinctly what i said about going into the law when i first came to boston said her husband angrily perhaps youll remember that i said i shouldnt go to halleck until i didnt need his help i shall not go to him for his help  marcia gave way to spiteful tears it seems as if you were ashamed to let them know that you were in town are you afraid i shall want to get acquainted with them do you suppose i shall want to go to their parties and disgrace you  bartley took his cigar out of his mouth and looked blackly at her so thats what youve been thinking is it  she threw herself upon his neck no no it isnt she cried hysterically you know that i never thought it till this instant you know i didnt think it at all i just said it my nerves are all gone i dont know what im saying half the time and youre as strict with me as if i were as well as ever i may as well take off my thingsim not well enough to go with you today bartley  she had been dressing while they talked for an entertainment which bartley was going to report for the chronicleabstract and now she made a feint of wishing to remove her hat he would not let her he said that if she did not go he should not he reproached her with not wishing to go with him any more he coaxed her laughingly and fondly  its only because im not so strong now she said in a whisper that ended in a kiss on his cheek you must walk very slowly and not hurry me  the entertainment was to be given in aid of the indigent childrens surfbathing society and it was at the end of june rather late in the season but the society itself was an afterthought not conceived till a great many people had left town on whose assistance such a charity must largely depend strenuous appeals had been made however it was represented that ten thousand poor children could be transported to nantasket beach and there as one of the ladies on the committee said bathed clambaked and lemonaded three times during the summer at a cost so small that it was a saving to spend the money class day falling about the same time many exiles at newport and on the north shore came up and down and the affair promised to be one of social distinction if not pecuniary success the entertainment was to be varied a distinguished poet was to read an old poem of his and a distinguished poetess was to read a new poem of hers some professional people were to follow with comic singing an elocutionist was to give impressions of noted public speakers and a number of vocal and instrumental amateurs were to contribute their talent  bartley had instructions from ricker to see that his report was very full socially we want something lively and at the same time nice and tasteful about the whole thing and i guess youre the man to do it get mrs hubbard to go with you and keep you from making a fool of yourself about the costumes he gave bartley two tickets mighty hard to get i can tell you for love or moneyespecially love he said and bartley made much of this difficulty in impressing marcias imagination with the uncommon character of the occasion she had put on a new dress which she had just finished for herself and which was a marvel not only of cheapness but of elegance she had plagiarized the idea from the costume of a lady with whom she stopped to look in at a milliners window where she formed the notion of her bonnet but marcia had imagined the things anew in relation to herself and made them her own when bartley first saw her in them though he had witnessed their growth from the germ he said that he was afraid of her she was so splendid and he did not quite know whether he felt acquainted when they were seated at the concert and had time to look about them he whispered well marsh i dont see anything here that comes near you in style and she flung a little corner of her drapery out over his hand so that she could squeeze it she was quite happy again  after the concert bartley left her for a moment and went up to a group of the committee near the platform to get some points for his report he spoke to one of the gentlemen notebook and pencil in hand and the gentleman referred him to one of the ladies of the committee who after a moment of hesitation demanded in a rich tone of injury and surprise why isnt this mr hubbard and indignantly answering herself of course it is gave her hand with a sort of dramatic cordiality and flooded him with questions when did you come to boston are you at the hallecks did you comeor no youre not harvard youre not living in boston and what in the world are you getting items for mr hubbard mr atherton  she introduced him in a breathless climax to the gentleman to whom he had first spoken and who had listened to her attack on bartley with a smile which he was at no trouble to hide from her which question are you going to answer first mr hubbard he asked quietly while his eyes searched bartleys for an instant with inquiry which was at once kind and keen his face had the distinction which comes of being cleanshaven in our bearded times  oh the last said bartley im reporting the concert for the chronicleabstract and i want to interview some one in authority about it  then interview me mr hubbard cried the young lady im in authority about this affairits my own invention as the white knight saysand then ill interview you afterwards and youve gone into journalism like all the harvard men so glad its you for you can be a perfect godsend to the cause if you will the entertainment hasnt given us all the money we shall want by any means and we shall need all the help the press can give us ask me any questions you please mr hubbard there isnt a soul here that i wouldnt sacrifice to the last personal particular if the press will only do its duty in return youve no idea how weve been working during the last fortnight since this old man of the seabathing sprang upon us i was sitting quietly at home thinking of anything else in the world i can assure you when the atrocious idea occurred to me she ran on to give a full sketch of the inception and history of the scheme up to the present time suddenly she arrested herself and bartleys flying pencil why youre not putting all that nonsense down  certainly i am said bartley while mr atherton with a laugh turned and walked away to talk with some other ladies its the very thing i want i shall get in ahead of all the other papers on this they havent had anything like it yet  she looked at him for a moment in horror then well go on i would do anything for the cause she cried  tell me whos been here then said bartley  she recoiled a little i dont like giving names  but i cant say who the people were unless you do  thats true said the young lady thoughtfully she prided herself on her thoughtfulness which sometimes came before and sometimes after the fact youre not obliged to say who told you  of course not  she ran over a list of historical and distinguished names and he slyly asked if this and that lady were not dressed so and so and worked in the costumes from her unconsciously elaborate answers she was afterwards astonished that he should have known what people had on lastly he asked what the committee expected to do next and was enabled to enrich his report with many authoritative expressions and intimations the lady became all zeal in these confidences to the public at last she told everything she knew and a great deal that she merely hoped  and now come into the committeeroom and have a cup of coffee i know you must be faint with all this talking she concluded i want to ask you something about yourself she was not older than bartley but she addressed him with the freedom we use in encouraging younger people  thank you he said coolly i cant very well i must go back to my wife and hurry up this report  oh is mrs hubbard here asked the young lady with wellcontrolled surprise present me to her she cried with that fearlessness of social consequences for which she was noted she believed there were ways of getting rid of undesirable people without treating them rudely  the audience had got out of the hall and marcia stood alone near one of the doors waiting for bartley he glanced proudly toward her and said i shall be very glad  miss kingsbury drifted by his side across the intervening space and was ready to take marcia impressively by the hand when she reached her she had promptly decided her to be very beautiful and elegantly simple in dress but she found her smaller than she had looked at a distance miss kingsbury was herself rather largesometimes she thought rather too large certainly too large if she had not had such perfect command of every inch of herself in complexion she was richly blonde with beautiful fair hair roughed over her forehead as if by a breeze and apt to escape in sunny tendrils over the peachy tints of her temples her features were massive rather than fine and though she thoroughly admired her chin and respected her mouth she had doubts about her nose which she frankly referred to friends for solution had it not too much of a knob at the end she seemed to tower over marcia as she took her hand at bartleys introduction and expressed her pleasure at meeting her  i dont know why it need be such a surprise to find ones gentlemen friends married but it always is somehow i dont think mr hubbard would have known me if i hadnt insisted upon his recognizing me i cant blame him its three years since we met do you help him with his reports i know you do you must make him lenient to our entertainmentthe cause is so good how long have you been in boston though i dont know why i should ask thatyou may have always been in boston one used to know everybody but the place is so large now i should like to come and see you but im going out of town tomorrow for the summer im not really here now except ex officio i ought to have been away weeks ago but this indigent surfbathing has kept me youve no idea what such an undertaking is but you must let me have your address and as soon as i get back to town in the fall i shall insist upon looking you up good by i must run away now and leave you there are a thousand things for me to look after yet today she took marcia again by the hand and superadded some bows and nods and smiles of parting after she released her but she did not ask her to come into the committeeroom and have some coffee and bartley took his wifes hand under his arm and went out of the hall  well he said with a mans simple pleasure in miss kingsburys friendliness to his wife thats the girl i used to tell you aboutthe rich one with the money in her own right whom i met at the hallecks she seemed to think you were about the thing marsh i saw her eyes open as she came up and i felt awfully proud of you you never looked half so well but why didnt you say something  she didnt give me any chance said marcia and i had nothing to say anyway i thought she was very disagreeable  disagreeable repeated bartley in amaze  miss kingsbury went back to the committeeroom where one of the amateurs had been lecturing upon her clara kingsbury can say and do from the best heart in the world more offensive things in ten minutes than malice could invent in a week somebody ought to go out and drag her away from that reporter by main force but i presume its too late already shes had time to destroy us all youll see that there wont be a shred left of us in his paper at any rate really i wonder that in a city full of nervous and exasperated people like boston clara kingsbury has been suffered to live she throws her whole soul into everything she undertakes and she has gone so en masse into this indigent bathing and splashed about in it so that i cant understand how we got anybody to come today why i havent the least doubt that shes offered that poor man a ticket to go down to nantasket and bathe with the other indigents shes treated me as if i ought to be personally surfbathed for the last fortnight and if theres any chance for us left by her tactlessness you may be sure shes gone at it with her conscience and simply swept it off the face of the earth     xviii   one hot day in august when bartley had been doing nothing for a week and marcia was gloomily forecasting the future when they would have to begin living upon the money they had put into the savings bank she reverted to the question of his taking up the law again she was apt to recur to this in any moment of discouragement and she urged him now to give up his newspaper work with that wearisome persistence with which women torment the men they love  my newspaper work seems to have given me up my dear said bartley its like asking a fellow not to marry a girl that wont have him he laughed and then whistled and marcia burst into fretful futile tears which he did not attempt to assuage  they had been all summer in town the country would have been no change to them and they knew nothing of the seaside except the crowded noisy expensive resorts near the city bartley wished her to go to one of these for a week or two at any rate but she would not and in fact neither of them had the born citizens conception of the value of a summer vacation but they had found their attic intolerable and the single gentlemen having all given up their rooms by this time mrs nash let marcia have one lower down where they sat looking out on the hot street  well cried marcia at last you dont care for my feelings or you would take up the law again  her husband rose with a sigh that was half a curse and went out after what she had said he would not give her the satisfaction of knowing what he meant to do but he had it in his head to go to that mr atherton to whom miss kingsbury had introduced him and ask his advice he had found out that mr atherton was a lawyer and he believed that he would tell him what to do he could at least give him some authoritative discouragement which he might use in these discussions with marcia  mr atherton had his office in the events building and bartley was on his way thither when he met ricker  seen witherby asked his friend he was round looking for you  what does witherby want with me asked bartley with a certain resentment  wants to give you the managingeditorship of the events said ricker jocosely  pshaw well he knows where to find me if he wants me very badly  perhaps he doesnt suggested ricker in that case youd better look him up  why you dont advise  oh i dont advise anything but if he can let bygones be bygones i guess you can afford to i dont know just what he wants with you but if he offers you anything like a basis youd better take it  bartleys basis had come to be a sort of byword between them ricker usually met him with some such demand as well what about the basis or hows your poor basis bartleys ardor for a salaried position amused him and he often tried to argue him out of it youre much better off as a free lance you make as much money as most of the fellows in places and you lead a pleasanter life if you were on any one paper youd have to be on duty about fifteen hours out of the twentyfour youd be out every night till three or four oclock youd have to do fires and murders and all sorts of police business and now you work mostly on fancy jobssomething you suggest yourself or something youre specially asked to do thats a kind of a compliment and it gives you scope  nevertheless if bartley had his heart set upon a basis ricker wanted him to have it of course he said i was only joking about the basis but if witherby should have something permanent to offer dont quarrel with your bread and butter and dont hold yourself too cheap witherbys going to get all he can for as little as he can every time  ricker was a newspaper man in every breath his great interest in life was the chronicleabstract which paid him poorly and worked him hard to get in ahead of the other papers was the object for which he toiled with unremitting zeal but after that he liked to see a good fellow prosper and he had for bartley that feeling of comradery which comes out among journalists when their rivalries are off he would hate to lose bartley from the chronicleabstract if witherby meant business bartley and he might be excoriating each other before a week passed in sarcastic references to our esteemed contemporary of the events and our esteemed contemporary of the chronicleabstract but he heartily wished him luck and hoped it might be some sort of inside work  when ricker left him bartley hesitated he was half minded to go home and wait for witherby to look him up as the most dignified and perhaps the most prudent course but he was curious and impatient and he was afraid of letting the chance whatever it might be slip through his fingers he suddenly resolved upon a little ruse which would still oblige witherby to make the advance and yet would risk nothing by delay he mounted to witherbys room in the events building and pushed open the door then he drew back embarrassed as if he had made a mistake excuse me he said isnt mr athertons office on this floor  witherby looked up from the papers on his desk and cleared his throat when he overreached himself he was apt to hold any party to the transaction accountable for his error ever since he refused bartleys paper on the loggingcamp he had accused him in his heart of fraud because he had sold the rejected sketch to another paper and anticipated witherbys tardy enterprise in the same direction each little success that bartley made added to witherbys dislike and whilst bartley had written for all the other papers he had never got any work from the events witherby had the guilty sense of having hated him as he looked up and bartley on his part was uneasily sensible of some mocking paragraphs of a more or less personal cast which he had written in the chronicleabstract about the enterprise of the events  mr atherton is on the floor above said witherby but im very glad you happened to look in mr hubbard ii was just thinking about you ahwont you take a chair  thanks said bartley noncommittally but he sat down in the chair which the other rose to offer him  witherby fumbled about among the things on his desk before he resumed his own seat i hope you have been well since i saw you  oh yes im always well how have you been bartley wondered whither this exchange of civilities tended but he believed he could keep it up as long as old witherby could  why i have not been very well said witherby getting into his chair and taking up a paperweight to help him in talk the fact is i find that i have been working too hard i have undertaken to manage the editorial department of the events in addition to looking after its business and the care has been too great it has told upon me i flatter myself that i have not allowed either department to suffer  he referred this point so directly to him that bartley made a murmur of assent and witherby resumed  but the care has told upon me i am not so well as i could wish i need rest and i need help he added  bartley had by this time made up his mind that if witherby had anything to say to him he should say it unaided  witherby put down the paperweight and gave his attention for a moment to a papercutter i dont know whether you have heard that mr clayton is going to leave us  no bartley said i hadnt heard that  yes he is going to leave us mr clayton and i have not agreed upon some points and we have both judged it best that we should part witherby paused again and changed the positions of his inkstand and mucilagebottle mr clayton has failed me as i may say at the last moment and we have been compelled to part i found mr claytonunpractical  he looked again at bartley who said yes  yes i found mr clayton so much at variance in his views withwith my own viewsthat i could do nothing with him he has used language to me which i am sure he will regret but that is neither here nor there he is going i have had my eye on you mr hubbard ever since you came to boston and have watched your career with interest but i thought of mr clayton in the first instance because he was already attached to the events and i wished to promote him office during good behavior and promotion in the direct line im that much of a civilservice reformer said witherby  certainly said bartley  but of course my idea in starting the events was to make money  of course  i hold that the first duty of a public journal is to make money for the owner all the rest follows naturally  youre quite right mr witherby said bartley unless it makes money there can be no enterprise about it no independencenothing that was the way i did with my little paper down in maine the first thingi told the committee when i took hold of the paperis to keep it from losing money the next is to make money with it first peaceable then pure thats what i told them  precisely so witherby was now so much at his ease with bartley that he left off tormenting the things on his desk and used his hands in gesticulating look at the churches themselves no church can do any good till its on a paying basis as long as a church is in debt it cant secure the best talent for the pulpit or the choir and the members go about feeling discouraged and out of heart its just so with a newspaper i say that a paper does no good till it pays it has no influence its motives are always suspected and youve got to make it pay by hook or by crook before you can hope totoforward any good cause by it thats what i say of course he added in a large smooth way im not going to contend that a newspaper should be run solely in the interest of the countingroom not at all but i do contend that when the countingroom protests against a certain course the editorial room is taking it ought to be respectfully listened to there are always two sides to every question suppose all the newspapers pitch inas they sometimes doand denounce a certain public enterprise a projected scheme of railroad legislation or a peculiar system of banking or a cooperative mining interest and the countingroom sends up word that the company advertises heavily with us shall we go and join indiscriminately in that hue and cry or shall we give our friends the benefit of the doubt  give them the benefit of the doubt answered bartley thats what i say  and so would any other practical man said witherby and thats just where mr clayton and i differed well i neednt allude to him any more he added leniently what i wish to say is this mr hubbard i am overworked and i feel the need of some sort of relief i know that i have started the events in the right line at lastthe only line in which it can be made a great useful and respectable journal efficient in every good causeand what i want now is some sort of assistant in the management who shall be in full sympathy with my own ideas i dont want a mere slavea tool but i do want an independent rightminded man who shall be with me for the success of the paper the whole time and every time and shall not be continually setting up his will against mine on all sorts of doctrinaire points that was the trouble with mr clayton i have nothing against mr clayton personally he is an excellent young man in very many respects but he was all wrong about journalism all wrong mr hubbard i talked with him a great deal and tried to make him see where his interest lay he had been on the paper as a reporter from the start and i wished very much to promote him to this position which he could have made the best position in the country the events is an evening paper there is no nightwork and the whole thing is already thoroughly systematized mr clayton had plenty of talent and all he had to do was to step in under my direction and put his hand on the helm but no i should have been glad to keep him in a subordinate capacity but i had to let him go he said that he would not report the conflagration of a peanutstand for a paper conducted on the principles i had developed to him now that is no way to talk its absurd  perfectly bartley laughed his rich caressing laugh in which there was the insinuation of all worldlywise contempt for clayton and all worldlywise sympathy with witherby it made witherby feel goodbetter perhaps than he had felt at any time since his talk with clayton  well now what do you say mr hubbard cant we make some arrangement with you he asked with a burst of frankness  i guess you can said bartley the fact that witherby needed him was so plain that he did not care to practise any finesse about the matter  what are your present engagements  i havent any  then you can take hold at once  yes  thats good witherby now entered at large into the nature of the position which he offered bartley they talked a long time and in becoming better acquainted with each others views as they called them they became better friends bartley began to respect witherbys business ideas and witherby in recognizing all the admirable qualities of this clearsighted and levelheaded young man began to feel that he had secretly liked him from the first and had only waited a suitable occasion to unmask his affection it was arranged that bartley should come on as witherbys assistant and should do whatever he was asked to do in the management of the paper he was to write on topics as they occurred to him or as they were suggested to him i dont say whether this will lead to anything more mr hubbard or not but i do say that you will be in the direct line of promotion  yes i understand that said bartley  and now as to terms continued witherby a little tremulously  and now as to terms repeated bartley to himself but he said nothing aloud he felt that witherby had cut out a great deal of work for him and work of a kind that he could not easily find another man both willing and able to do he resolved that he would have all that his service was worth  what should you think of twenty dollars a week asked witherby  i shouldnt think it was enough said bartley amazed at his own audacity but enjoying it and thinking how he had left marcia with the intention of offering himself to mr atherton as a clerk for ten dollars a week there is a great deal of labor in what you propose and you command my whole time you would not like to have me do any work outside of the events  no witherby assented would twentyfive be nearer the mark he inquired soberly  it would be nearer certainly said bartley but i guess you had better make it thirty he kept a quiet face but his heart throbbed  well say thirty then replied witherby so promptly that bartley perceived with a pang that he might as easily have got forty from him but it was now too late and a salary of fifteen hundred a year passed the wildest hopes he had cherished half an hour before  all right he said quietly i suppose you want me to take hold at once  yes on monday oh by the way said witherby there is one little piece of outside work which i should like you to finish up for us and well agree upon something extra for it if you wish i mean our solid men series i dont know whether youve noticed the series in the events  yes said bartley i have  well then you know what they are they consist of interviewsguarded and inoffensive as respects the sanctity of private lifewith our leading manufacturers and merchant princes at their places of business and their residences and include a description of these and some account of the lives of the different subjects  yes i have seen them said bartley ive noticed the general plan  you know that mr clayton has been doing them he made them a popular feature the parties themselves were very much pleased with them  oh people are always tickled to be interviewed said bartley i know they put on airs about it and go round complaining to each other about the violation of confidence and so on but they all like it you know i reported that indigent surfbathing entertainment in june for the chronicleabstract i knew the lady who got it up and i interviewed her after the entertainment  miss kingsbury  yes witherby made an inarticulate murmur of respect for bartley in his throat and involuntarily changed toward him but not so subtly that bartleys finer instinct did not take note of the change she was a fresh subject and she told me everything of course i printed it all she was awfully shockedor pretended to beand wrote me a very odearhowcouldyou note about it but i went round to the office the next day and i found that nearly every lady mentioned in the interview had ordered half a dozen copies of that issue sent to her seaside address and the office had been full of beacon street swells all the morning buying chronicleabstractsthe one with the report of the concert in it these low views of high society coupled with an apparent familiarity with it modified witherby more and more he began to see that he had got a prize the way to do with such fellows as your solid men continued bartley is to submit a proof to em they never know exactly what to do about it and so you print the interview with their approval and make em particeps criminis ill finish up the series for you and i wont make any very heavy extra charge  i should wish to pay you whatever the work was worth said witherby not to be outdone in nobleness  all right we shant quarrel about that at any rate  bartley was getting toward the door for he was eager to be gone now to marcia but witherby followed him up as if willing to detain him my wife he said knows miss kingsbury they have been on the same charities together  i met her a good while ago when i was visiting a chum of mine at his fathers house here i didnt suppose shed know me but she did at once and began to ask me if i was at the hallecksas if i had never gone away  mr ezra b halleck inquired witherby reverently leather trade  yes said bartley i believe his first name was ezra ben halleck was my friend do you know the family asked bartley  yes we have met themin society i hope youre pleasantly situated where you are mr hubbard should be glad to have you call at the house  thank you said bartley my wife will be glad to have mrs witherby call  oh cried witherby i didnt know you were married thats good theres nothing like marriage mr hubbard to keep a man going in the right direction but youve begun pretty young  nothing like taking a thing in time answered bartley but i havent been married a great while and im not so young as i look well good afternoon mr witherby  what did you say was your address asked witherby taking out his notebook my wife will certainly call shes down at nantasket now but shell be up the first part of september and then shell call good afternoon  they shook hands at last and bartley ran home to marcia he burst into the room with a glowing face well marcia he shouted ive got my basis  hush no dont be so loud you havent she answered springing to her feet i dont believe it how hot you are  ive been runningalmost all the way from the events office ive got a place on the eventsassistant managingeditorthirty dollars a week he panted  i knew you would succeed yeti knew you would if i could only have a little patience ive been scolding myself ever since you went i thought you were going to do something desperate and i had driven you to it but bartley bartley it cant be true is it here here do take this fan or no ill fan you if youll let me sit on your knee o poor thing how hot you are but i thought you wouldnt white for the events i thought you hated that old witherby who acted so ugly to you when you first came  oh witherby is a pretty good old fellow said bartley who had begun to get his breath again he gave her a full history of the affair and they rejoiced together over it and were as happy as if bartley had been celebrating a high and honorable good fortune she was too ignorant to feel the disgrace if there were any in the compact which bartley had closed and he had no principles no traditions by which to perceive it to them it meant unlimited prosperity it meant provision for the future which was to bring a new responsibility and a new care  we will take the parlor with the alcove now said bartley dont excite yourself he added with tender warning  no no she said pillowing her head on his shoulder and shedding peaceful tears  it doesnt seem as if we should ever quarrel again does it  no no we never shall she murmured it has always come from my worrying you about the law and i shall never do that any more if you like journalism better i shall not urge you any more to leave it now youve got your basis  but im going on with the law now for that very reason i shall read law all my leisure time i feel independent and i shall not be anxious about the time i give because i shall know that i can afford it  well only you mustnt overdo she put her lips against his cheek youre more to me than anything you can do for me  oh marcia     xix   now that bartley had got his basis and had no favors to ask of any one he was curious to see his friend halleck again but when in the course of the solid men series he went to interview a nestor of the leather interest as he meant to call the elder halleck he resolved to let him make all the advances on a legitimate business errand it should not matter to him whether mr halleck welcomed him or not the old man did not wait for bartley to explain why he came he was so simply glad to see him that bartley felt a little ashamed to confess that he had been eight months in boston without making himself known he answered all the personal questions with which mr halleck plied him and in his turn he inquired after his college friend  ben is in europe said his father he has been there all summer but we expect him home about the middle of september hes been a good while settling down continued the old man with an unconscious sigh he talked of the law at first and then he went into business with me but he didnt seem to find his calling in it and now hes taken up the law again hes been in the law school at cambridge and hes going back there for a year or two longer i thought you used to talk of the law yourself when you were with us mr hubbard  yes i did bartley assented and i havent given up the notion yet ive read a good deal of law already but when i came up to boston i had to go into newspaper work till i could see my way out of the woods  well said mr halleck thats right and you say you like the arrangement youve made with mr witherby  its idealfor me answered bartley  well thats good said the old man and youve come to interview me well thats all right im not much used to being in print but i shall be glad to tell you all i know about leather  you may depend upon my not saying anything that will be disagreeable to you mr halleck said bartley touched by the old mans trusting friendliness when his inquisition ended he slipped his notebook back into his pocket and said with a smile we usually say something about the victims private residence but i guess ill spare you that mr halleck  why we live in the old place and i dont suppose there is much to say we are plain people and we dont like to change when i built there thirty years ago rumford street was one of the most desirable streets in boston there was no back bay then you know and we thought we were doing something very fashionable but fashion has drifted away and left us high and dry enough on rumford street though we dont mind it we keep the old house and the old garden pretty much as you saw them you can say whatever you think best theres a good deal of talk about the intrusiveness of the newspapers all i know is that theyve never intruded upon me we shall not be afraid that you will abuse our house mr hubbard because we expect you to come there again when shall it be mrs halleck and i have been at home all summer we find it the most comfortable place and we shall be very glad if youll drop in any evening and take tea with us we keep the old hours weve never taken kindly to the late dinners the girls are off at the mountains and youd see nobody but mrs halleck come this evening cried the old man with mounting cordiality  his warmth as he put his hand on bartleys shoulder made the young man blush again for the reserve with which he had been treating his own affairs he stammered out hoping that the other would see the relevancy of the statement why the fact is mr halleck iim married  married said mr halleck why didnt you tell me before of course we want mrs hubbard too where are you living we wont stand upon ceremony among old friends mrs halleck will come with the carriage and fetch mrs hubbard and your wife must take that for a call why you dont know how glad we shall be to have you both i wish ben was married youll come  of course we will said bartley but you mustnt let mrs halleck send for us we can walk perfectly well  you can walk if you want but mrs hubbard shall ride said the old man  when bartley reported this to marcia bartley she cried in her carriage im afraid  nonsense shell be a great deal more afraid than you are shes the bashfulest old lady you ever saw all that i hope is that you wont overpower her  bartley hush shall i wear my silk or  oh wear the silk by all means crush them at a blow  rumford street is one of those oldfashioned thoroughfares at the west end of boston which are now almost wholly abandoned to boardinghouses of the poorer class yet they are charming streets quiet clean and respectable and worthy still to be the homes as they once were of solid citizens the red brick houses with their swell fronts looking in perspective like a succession of round towers are reached by broad granite steps and their doors are deeply sunken within the wagonroofs of whitepainted roman arches over the door there is sometimes the bow of a fine transom and the parlor windows on the first floor of the swell front have the same azure gleam as those of the beautiful old houses which front the common on beacon street  when her husband bought his lot there mrs halleck could hardly believe that a house on rumford street was not too fine for her they had come to the city simple and good young village people and simple and good they had remained through the advancing years which had so wonderfullymrs halleck hoped with a trembling heart not wickedlyprospered them they were of faithful stock and they had been true to their traditions in every way one of these was constancy to the orthodox religious belief in which their young hearts had united and which had blessed all their life though their charity now abounded perhaps more than their faith they still believed that for themselves there was no spiritual safety except in their church but since their younger children had left it they were forced tacitly to own that this might not be so in all cases their last endeavor for the church in bens case was to send him to the college where he and bartley met and this was such a failure on the main point that it left them remorsefully indulgent he had submitted and had foregone his boyish dreams of harvard where all his mates were going but the sacrifice seemed to have put him at odds with life the years which had proved the old people mistaken would not come back upon their recognition of their error he returned to the associations from which they had exiled him too much estranged to resume them and they saw with the unavailing regrets which visit fathers and mothers in such cases that the young know their own world better than their elders can know it and have a right to be in it and of it superior to any theory of their advantage which their elders can form ben was not the fellow to complain in fact after he came home from college he was allowed to shape his life according to his own rather fitful liking his father was glad now to content him in anything he could it was so very little that ben asked if he had suffered it perhaps his family would have spoiled him  the halleck girls went early in july to the profile house where they had spent their summers for many years but the old people preferred to stay at home and only left their large comfortable house for short absences their ways of life had been fixed in other times and mrs halleck liked better than mountain or sea the highwalled garden that stretched back of their house to the next street they had bought through to this street when they built but they had never sold the lot that fronted on it they laid it out in boxbordered beds and there were clumps of hollyhocks sunflowers lilies and phlox in different corners grapes covered the trellised walls there were some peartrees that bore blossoms and sometimes ripened their fruit beside the walk mrs halleck used to work in the garden her husband seldom descended into it but he liked to sit on the ironrailed balcony overlooking it from the back parlor  as for the interior of the house it had been furnished once for all in the worst style of that most tasteless period of household art which prevailed from 1840 to 1870 and it would be impossible to say which were most hideous the carpets or the chandeliers the curtains or the chairs and sofas crude colors lumpish and meaningless forms abounded in a rich and horrible discord the old people thought it all beautiful and those daughters who had come into the new house as little girls revered it but ben and his youngest sister who had been born in the house used the right of children of their parents declining years to laugh at it yet they laughed with a sort of filial tenderness  i suppose you know how frightful you have everything about you olive said clara kingsbury one day after the eastlake movement began as she took a comprehensive survey of the halleck drawingroom through her pincenez  certainly answered the youngest miss halleck its a perfect chamber of horrors but i like it because everythings so exquisitely in keeping  really i feel as if i had seen it all for the first time said miss kingsbury i dont believe i ever realized it before  she and olive halleck were great friends though clara was fashionable and olive was not  it would all have been different ben used to say in whimsical sarcasm of what he had once believed if i had gone to harvard then the fellows in my class would have come to the house with me and we should have got into the right set naturally now were outside of everything and it makes me mad because weve got money enough to be inside and theres nothing to prevent it of course im not going to say that leather is quite as blameless as cotton socially but taken in the wholesale form it isnt so very malodorous and its quite as good as other things that are accepted  its not the leather ben answered olive and its not your not going to harvard altogether though that has something to do with it the troubles in me i was at school with all those girls clara goes with and i could have been in that set if id wanted but i didnt really want to i saw at a very tender age that it was going to be more trouble than it was worth and i just quietly kept out of it of course i couldnt have gone to papantis without a fuss but mother would have let me go if i had made the fuss and i could be hand and glove with those girls now if i tried they come here whenever i ask them and when i meet them on charities im awfully popular no if im not fashionable its my own fault but what difference does it make to you ben you dont want to marry any of those girls as long as your hearts set on that unknown charmer of yours ben had once seen his charmer in the street of a little down east town where he met her walking with some other boardingschool girls in a freak with his fellowstudents he had bribed the village photographer to let him have the picture of the young lady which he had sent home to olive marked my lost love  no i dont want to marry anybody said ben but i hate to live in a town where im not first chop in everything  pshaw cried his sister i guess it doesnt trouble you much  well i dont know that it does he admitted  mrs hallecks black coachman drove her to mrs nashs door on canary place where she alighted and rang with as great perturbation as if it had been a palace and these poor young people to whom she was going to be kind were princes it was sufficient that they were strangers but marcias anxiety evident even to meekness like mrs hallecks restored her somewhat to her selfpossession and the thought that bartley in spite of his personal splendor was a friend of bens was a help and she got home with her guests without any great chasms in the conversation though she never ceased to twist the windowtassel in her embarrassment  mr halleck came to her rescue at her own door and let them in he shook hands with bartley again and viewed marcia with a fatherly friendliness that took away half her awe of the ugly magnificence of the interior but still she admired that bartley could be so much at his ease he pointed to a stick at the foot of the hatrack and said how much that looks like halleck which made the old man laugh and clap him on the shoulder and cry so it does so it does recognized it did you well we shall soon have him with us again now seems a long time to us since he went  still limps a little asked bartley  yes i guess hell never quite get over that  i dont believe i should like him to said bartley he wouldnt seem natural without a cane in his hand or hanging by the crook over his left elbow while he stood and talked  the old man clapped bartley on the shoulder again and laughed again at the image suggested thats so thats so youre right i guess  as soon as marcia could lay off her things in the gorgeous chamber to which mrs halleck had shown her they went out to tea in the diningroom overlooking the garden  seems natural dont it asked the old man as bartley turned to one of the windows  not changed a bit except that i was here in winter and i hadnt a chance to see how pretty your garden was  it is pretty isnt it said the old man mothermrs halleck i meanlooks after it she keeps it about right heres cyrus he said as the servingman came into the room with something from the kitchen in his hands you remember cyrus i guess mr hubbard  oh yes said bartley and when cyrus had set down his dish bartley shook hands with the new hampshire exemplar of freedom and equality he was no longer so young as to wish to mark a social difference between himself and the insideman who had served mr halleck with unimpaired selfrespect for twentyfive years  there was a vacant place at table and mr halleck said he hoped it would be taken by a friend of theirs he explained that the possible guest was his lawyer whose office ben was going into after he left the law school and presently mr atherton came bartley was prepared to be introduced anew but he was flattered and the hallecks were pleased to find that he and mr atherton were already acquainted the latter was so friendly that bartley was confirmed in his belief that you could not make an interview too strong for he had celebrated mr atherton among the other people present at the indigent surfbathing entertainment  he was put next to marcia and after a while he began to talk with her feeling with a tacit skill for her highest note and striking that with kindly perseverance it was not a very high note and it was not always a certain sound she could not be sure that he was really interested in the simple matters he had set her to talking about and from time to time she was afraid that bartley did not like it she would not have liked him to talk so long or so freely with a lady but she found herself talking on about boarding and her own preference for keeping house about equity and what sort of place it was and how far from crawfords about boston and what she had seen and done there since she had come in the winter most of her remarks began or ended with mr hubbard many of her opinions especially in matters of taste were frank repetitions of what mr hubbard thought her conversation had the charm and pathos of that of the young wife who devotedly loves her husband who lives in and for him tests everything by him refers everything to him she had a good mind though it was as bare as it could well be of most of the things that the ladies of mr athertons world put into their minds  mrs halleck made from time to time a little murmur of satisfaction in marcias loyalty and then sank back into the meek silence that she only emerged from to propose more tea to some one or to direct cyrus about offering this dish or that  after they rose she took marcia about to show her the house ending with the room which bartley had when he visited there they sat down in this room and had a long chat and when they came back to the parlor they found mr atherton already gone marcia inferred the early habits of the household from the departure of this older friend but bartley was in no hurry he was enjoying himself and he could not see that mr halleck seemed at all sleepy  mrs halleck wished to send them home in her carriage but they would not hear of this they would far rather walk and when they had been followed to the door and bidden mind the steps as they went down the wide open night did not seem too large for their content in themselves and each other  did you have a nice time asked bartley though he knew he need not  the best time i ever had in the world cried marcia  they discussed the whole affair the two old people mr atherton and how pleasant he was the house and its splendors which they did not know were hideous bartley said marcia at last i told mrs halleck  did you he returned in trepidation but after a while he laughed well all right if you wanted to  yes i did and you cant think how kind she was she says we must have a house of our own somewhere and shes going round with me in her carriage to help me to find one  well said bartley and he fetched a sigh half of pride half of dismay  yes i long to go to housekeeping we can afford it now she says we can get a cheap little house or half a house up at the south end and it wont cost us any more than to board hardly and thats what i think too  go ahead if you can find the house i dont object to my own fireside and i suppose we must  yes we must aint you glad of it  they were in the shadow of a tall house and he dropped his face toward the face she lifted to his and gave her a silent kiss that made her heart leap toward him     xx   with the other news that hallecks mother gave him on his return she told him of the chance that had brought his old college comrade to them again and of how bartley was now married and was just settled in the little house she had helped his wife to find he has married a very pretty girl she said  oh i dare say answered her son he isnt the fellow to have married a plain girl  your father and i have been to call upon them in their new house and they seem very happy together mr hubbard wants you should come to see them he talks a great deal about you  ill look them up in good time said the young man hubbards ardor to see me will keep  that evening mr atherton came to tea and halleck walked home with him to his lodgings which were over the hill and beyond the public garden yes its very pleasant getting back he said as they sauntered down the common side of beacon street and the old town is picturesque after the best they can do across the water he halted his friend and brought himself to a rest on his cane for a look over the hollow of the common and the level of the garden where the late september dark was keenly spangled with lamps my heart leaps up and so forth when i see that now that athens and florence and edinburgh are past i dont think there is any place quite so well worth being born in as boston he moved forward again gently surging with his limp in a way that had its charm for those that loved him its more authentic and individual more municipal after the old pattern than any other modern city it gives its stamp it characterizes the boston irishman the boston jew is a quite different irishman or jew from those of other places even boston provinciality is a precious testimony to the authoritative personality of the city cosmopolitanism is a modern vice and were antique were classic in the other thing yes id rather be a bostonian at odds with boston than one of the curled darlings of any other community  a friend knows how to allow for mere quantity in your talk and only replies to the quality separates your earnest from your whimsicality and accounts for some whimsicality in your earnest i didnt know but you might have got that bee out of your bonnet on the other side said atherton  no sir we change our skies but not our bees what should i amount to without my grievance you wouldnt have known me this talk tonight about hubbard has set my bee to buzzing with uncommon liveliness and the thought of the law school next week does nothing to allay him the law school isnt harvard i realize that more and more though i have tried to fancy that it was no sir my wrongs are irreparable i had the making of a real harvard man in me and of a unitarian nicely balanced between radicalism and amateur episcopacy now i am an orthodox ruin and the undutiful stepson of a down east alma mater i belong nowhere im at oddsis hubbards wife really handsome or is she only countrypretty  shes beautifuli assure you shes beautiful said atherton with such earnestness that halleck laughed  well thats right as my father says hows she beautiful  thats difficult to tell its rather a superb sort of style andwhat did you really use to think of your friend atherton broke off to ask  who hubbard  yes  he was a poor cheap sort of a creature deplorably smart and regrettably handsome a fellow that assimilated everything to a certain extent and nothing thoroughly a fellow with no more moral nature than a baseball the sort of chap youd expect to find the next time you met him in congress or the house of correction  yes that accounts for it said atherton thoughtfully  accounts for what  the sort of look she had a look as if she were naturally above him and had somehow fascinated herself with him and were worshipping him in some sort of illusion  doesnt that sound a little like refining upon the facts recollect ive never seen her and i dont say youre wrong  im not sure im not though i talked with her and found her nothing more than honest and sensible and good simple in her traditions of course and countrified yet in her ideas with a tendency to the intensely practical i dont see why she mightnt very well be his wife i suppose every woman hoodwinks herself about her husband in some degree  yes and we always like to fancy something pathetic in the fate of pretty girls that other fellows marry i notice that we dont sorrow much over the plain ones hows the divine clara  i believe shes well said atherton i havent seen her all summer shes been at beverley  why i should have supposed she would have come up and surfbathed those indigent children with her own hand shes equal to it what made her falter in welldoing  i dont know that we can properly call it faltering there was a deficit in the appropriation necessary and she made it up herself after that she consulted me seriously as to whether she ought not to stay in town and superintend the execution of the plan but i told her she might fitly delegate that she was all the more anxious to perform her whole duty because she confessed that indigent children were personally unpleasant to her  halleck burst out laughing thats like clara how charming women are theyre charming even in their goodness i wonder the novelists dont take a hint from that fact and stop giving us those scaly heroines theyve been running lately why a real woman can make righteousness delicious and virtue piquant i like them for that  do you asked atherton laughing in his turn at the singleminded confession he was some years older than his friend  they had got down to charles street and halleck took out his watch at the corner lamp it isnt at all late yetonly halfpast eight the days are getting shorter  well  suppose we go and call on hubbard now hes right up here on clover street  i dont know said atherton it would do for you youre an old friend but for mewouldnt it be rather unceremonious  oh come along theyll not be punctilious theyll like our dropping in and i shall have hubbard off my conscience i must go to see him sooner or later for decencys sake  atherton suffered himself to be led away i suppose you wont stay long  oh no i shall cut it very short said halleck and they climbed the narrow little street where marcia had at last found a house after searching the south end quite to the highlands and ransacking charlestown and carnbridgeport these points all seemed to her terribly remote from where bartley must be at work during the day and she must be alone without the sight of him from morning till night the accessibility of canary place had spoiled her for distances she wanted bartley at home for their oneoclock dinner she wanted to have him within easy call at all times and she was glad when none of those faroff places yielded quite what they desired in a house they took the house on clover street though it was a little dearer than they expected for two years and they furnished it as far as they could out of the three or four hundred dollars they had saved including the remaining hundred from the colt and cutter kept sacredly intact by marcia when you entered the narrow staircase cramped you into the little parlor opening out of the hall and back of the parlor was the diningroom overhead were two chambers and overhead again were two chambers more in the basement was the kitchen the house seemed absurdly large to people who had been living for the last seven months in one room and the view of the back bay from the little bowwindow of the front chamber added all outdoors to their superfluous space  bartley came himself to answer hallecks ring and they met at once with such a why halleck and how do you do hubbard as restored something of their old college comradery bartley welcomed mr atherton under the gaslight he had turned up and then they huddled into the little parlor where bartley introduced his old friend to his wife marcia wore a sort of dark robe trimmed with bows of crimson ribbon which she had made herself and in which she looked a roman patrician in an avatar of boston domesticity and bartley was rather proud to see his friend so visibly dazzled by her beauty it quite abashed halleck who limped helplessly about after his cane had been taken from him before he sat down while marcia from the vantage of the sofa and the covert of her talk with atherton was content that halleck should be plain and awkward with closecut drab hair and a dull complexion she would not have liked even a man who knew bartley before she did to be very handsome  halleck and bartley had some talk about college days from which their eyes wandered at times and then marcia excused herself to atherton and went out reappearing after an interval at the sliding doors which she rolled open between the parlor and diningroom a table set for supper stood behind her and as she leaned a little forward with her hands each on a leaf of the door she said with shy pride bartley i thought the gentlemen would like to join you and he answered of course they would and led the way out refusing to hear any demur his heart swelled with satisfaction in marcia it was something like having fellows drop in upon you and be asked out to supper in this easy way it made bartley feel good and he would have liked to give marcia a hug on the spot he could not help pressing her foot under the table and exchanging a quiver of the eyelashes with her as he lifted the lid of the white tureen and looked at her across the glitter of their new crockery and cutlery they made the jokes of the season about the oyster being promptly on hand for the first of the r months and bartley explained that he was sometimes kept at the events office rather late and that then marcia waited supper for him and always gave him an oyster stew which she made herself she could not stop him and the guests praised the oysters and then they praised the diningroom and the parlor and when they rose from the table bartley said now we must show you the house and persisted against her deprecations in making her lead the way she was in fact willing enough to show it her taste had made their money go to the utmost in furnishing it and though most people were then still in the period of green reps and tan terry and of dull blackwalnut movables she had everywhere bestowed little touches that told she had covered the marble parlormantel with cloth and fringed it and she had set on it two vases in the pompeiian colors then liked her carpet was of wood color and a moss pattern she had done what could be done with folding carpet chairs to give the little room a specious air of luxury the centretable was heaped with her sewing and bartleys newspapers  weve just moved in and we havent furnished all the rooms yet she said of two empty ones which bartley perversely flung open  and i dont know that we shall the house is much too big for us but we thought wed better take it he added as if it were a castle for vastness  halleck and atherton were silent for some moments after they came away and then i dont believe he whips her suggested the latter  no i guess hes fond of her said halleck gravely  did you see how careful he was of her coming up and down stairs that was very pretty and it was pretty to see them both so ready to show off their young housekeeping to us  yes it improves a man to get married said halleck with a long stifled sigh its improved the most selfish hound i ever knew     xxi   the two elder miss hallecks were so much older than olive the youngest that they seemed to be of a sort of intermediary generation between her and her parents though olive herself was well out of her teens and was the senior of her brother ben by two or three years the elder sisters were always together and they adhered in common to the religion of their father and mother the defection of their brother was passive but olive having conscientiously adopted an alien faith was not a person to let others imagine her ashamed of it and her unitarianism was outspoken in her turn she formed a kind of party with ben inside the family and would have led him on in her own excesses of independence if his somewhat melancholy indifferentism had consented it was only in his absence that she had been with her sisters during their summer sojourn in the white mountains when they returned home she vigorously went her way and left them to go theirs she was fond of them in her defiant fashion but in such a matter as calling on mrs hubbard she chose not to be mixed up with her family or in any way to countenance her familys prepossessions her sisters paid their visit together and she waited for clara kingsbury to come up from the seaside then she went with her to call upon marcia sitting observant and noncommittal while clara swooped through the little house up stairs and down clamoring over its prettiness and admiring the art with which so few dollars could be made to go so far think of finding such a bower on clover street she made marcia give her the cost of everything and her heart swelled with pride in her sexwhen she heard that marcia had put down all the carpets herself i wanted to make them up marcia explained but mr hubbard wouldnt let meit cost so little at the store  wouldnt let you cried miss kingsbury i should hope as much indeed why my child youre a roman matron  she came away in agony lest marcia might think she meant her nose she drove early the next morning to tell olive halleck that she had spent a sleepless night from this cause and to ask her what she should do do you think she will be hurt olive tell me what led up to it how did i behave before that the context is everything in such cases  oh you went about praising everything and screaming and shouting and mydearing and mychilding her and patronizing  there there say no more thats sufficient i seei see it all ive done the very most offensive thing i could when i meant to be the most appreciative  these country people dont like to be appreciated down to the quick in that way said olive i should think mrs hubbard was rather a proud person  i know i know moaned miss kingsbury it was ghastly  i dont suppose shes ashamed of her nose  olive cried her friend be still why i cant bear it why you wretched thing  i dare say all the ladies in equity make up their own carpets and put them down and she thought you were laughing at her  will you be still olive halleck miss kingsbury was now a large blonde mass of suffering oh dear dear what shall i do it was sacrilegeyes it was nothing less than sacrilegeto go on as i did and i meant so well i did so admire and respect and revere her olive burst out laughing you wicked girl whimpered clara should youshould you write to her  and tell her you didnt mean her nose oh by all means claraby all means quite an inspiration why not make her an evening party  olive said clara with guilty meekness i have been thinking of that  no clara not seriously cried olive sobered at the idea  yes seriously would it be so very bad only just a little party she pleaded half a dozen people or so just to show them that i really feelfriendly i know that hes told her all about meeting me here and im not going to have her think i want to drop him because hes married and lives in a little house on clover street  noble clara so you wish to bring them out in boston society what will you do with them after youve got them there miss kingsbury fidgeted in her chair a little now look me in the eye clara whom were you going to ask to meet them your unfashionable friends the hallecks  my friends the hallecks of course  and mr atherton your legal adviser  i had thought of asking mr atherton you neednt say what he is if you please olive you know that theres no one i prize so much  very good and mr cameron  he has got backyes hes very nice  a cambridge tutor very young and of recent attachment to the college with no local affiliations yet what ladies  miss strong is a nice girl she is studying at the conservatory  yes povertystricken votary of miss kingsbury well  miss clancy  unfashionable sister of fashionable artist yes  the brayhems  young radical clergyman and his wife without a congregation and hoping for a pulpit in billerica parlor lectures on german literature in the mean time well  and mrs savage i thought  wellpreserved young widow of uncertain antecedents tending to grassiness outdoor protégée of the hostess yes clara go on and give your party it will be perfectly safe but do you think it will deceive anybody  now olive halleck cried clara i am not going to have you talking to me in that way you have no right to do it and you have no business to do it she added trying to pluck up a spirit is there anybody that i value more than i do you and your sisters and ben  no but you dont value us just in that way and you know it dont you be a humbug clara now go on with your excuses  im not making excuses isnt mr atherton in the most fashionable society  yes why dont you ask some other fashionable people  olive this is all nonsenseperfect nonsense i can invite any one i like to meet any one i like and if i choose to show mr hubbards wife a little attention i can do it cant i  oh of course  and what would be the use of inviting fashionable peopleas you call themto meet them it would just embarrass them all round  perfectly correct miss kingsbury all that want you to do is to face the facts of the case i want you to realize that in showing mr hubbards wife this little attention youre not doing it because you scorn to drop an old friend and want to do him the highest honor but because you think you can palm off your secondclass acquaintance on them for firstclass and try to make up in that way for telling her she had a hooked nose  you know that i didnt tell her she had a hooked nose  you told her that she was a roman matronits the same thing said olive  miss kingsbury bit her lip and tried to look a dignified resentment she ended by saying with feeble spite i shall have the little evening for all you say i suppose you wont refuse to come because i dont ask the whole blue book to meet them  of course we shall come i wouldnt miss it for anything i always like to see how you manage your pieces of social duplicity clara but you neednt expect that i will be a party to the swindle no clara i shall go to these poor young people and tell them plainly this is not the best society miss kingsbury keeps that for  olive i think i never saw even you in such a teasing humor the tears came into claras large tender blue eyes and she continued with an appeal that had no effect im sure i dont see why you should make it a question of anything of the sort its simply a wish toto have a little company of no particular kind for no particbecause i want to  oh thats it is it then i highly approve of it said olive when is it to be  i shant tell you now you may wait till im ready pouted clara as she rose to go  dont go away thinking im enough to provoke a saint because youve got mad at me clara  mad you know im not mad but i think you might be a little sympathetic sometimes olive said her friend kissing her  not in cases of social duplicity clara my wrath is all that saves you if you were not afraid of me you would have been a lost worldling long ago  i know you always really love me said miss kingsbury tenderly  no i dont retorted her friend promptly not when youre humbugging dont expect it for you wont get it she followed clara with a triumphant laugh as she went out of the door and except for this parting taunt clara might have given up her scheme she first ordered her coupé driven home in fact and then lowered the window to countermand the direction and drove to bartleys door on clover street  it was a very handsome equipage and was in keeping with all the outward belongings of miss kingsbury who mingled a sense of duty and a love of luxury in her life in very exact proportions when her coupé was not standing before some of the wretchedest doors in the city it was waiting at the finest and claras days were divided between the extremes of squalor and of fashion  she was the only child of parents who had early left her an orphan her father who was much her mothers senior was an old friend of olives father and had made him his executor and the guardian of his daughter mr halleck had taken her into his own family and in the conscientious pursuance of what he believed would have been her fathers preference he gave her worldly advantages which he would not have desired for one of his own children but the friendship that grew up between clara and olive was too strong for him in some things and the girls went to the same fashionable school together  when his ward came of age he made over to her the fortune increased by his careful management which her father had left her and advised her to put her affairs in the hands of mr atherton she had shown a quite ungirlish eagerness to manage them for herself in the midst of her profusion she had odd accesses of stinginess in which she fancied herself coming to poverty and her guardian judged it best that she should have a lawyer who could tell her at any moment just where she stood she hesitated but she did as he advised and having once intrusted her property to athertons care she added her conscience and her reason in large degree and obeyed him with embarrassing promptness in matters that did not interfere with her pleasures her pleasures were of various kinds she chose to buy herself a fine house and having furnished it luxuriously and unearthed a cousin of her fathers in vermont and brought her to boston to matronize her she kept house on a magnificent scale pinching however at certain points with unexpected meanness when she was alone her table was of a spartan austerity she exacted a great deal from her servants and paid them as small wages as she could after that she did not mind lavishing money upon them in kindness a seamstress whom she had once employed fell sick and miss kingsbury sent her to the bahamas and kept her there till she was well and then made her a guest in her house till the girl could get back her work she watched her cook through the measles caring for her like a mother and as olive halleck said she was always portioning or burying the sisters of her secondgirls she was in all sorts of charities but she was apt to cut her charities off with her pleasures at any moment if she felt poor she was fond of dress and went a great deal into society she suspected men generally of wishing to marry her for her money but with those whom she did not think capable of aspiring to her hand she was generously helpful with her riches she liked to patronize she had long supported an unpromising painter at rome and she gave orders to desperate artists at home  the world had pretty well hardened one half of her heart but the other half was still soft and loving and into this side of her mixed nature she cowered when she believed she had committed some blunder or crime and came whimpering to olive halleck for punishment she made olive her discipline partly in her lack of some fixed religion she had not yet found a religion that exactly suited her though she had many times believed herself about to be anchored in some faith forever  she was almost sorry that she had put her resolution in effect when she rang at the door and marcia herself answered the bell in place of the one servant who was at that moment hanging out the wash it seemed wicked to pretend to be showing this pretty creature a social attention when she meant to palm off a hollow imitation of society upon her why should she not ask the very superfinest of her friends to meet such a brilliant beauty it would serve olive halleck right if she should do this and leave the hallecks out and marcia would certainly be a sensation she half believed that she meant to do it when she quitted the house with marcias promise that she would bring her husband to tea on wednesday evening at eight and she drove away so far penitent that she resolved at least to make her company distinguished if not fashionable she said to herself that she would make it fashionable yet if she chose and as a first move in this direction she easily secured mr atherton he had no engagements so few people had got back to town she called upon mrs witherby needlessly reminding her of the charity committees they had served on together and then she went home and actually sent out notes to the plainest daughter and the maiden aunt of two of the most highborn families of her acquaintance she added to her list an artist and his wife now i shall have to let him paint me she reflected a young author whose book had made talk a teacher of italian with whom she was pretending to read dante and a musical composer  olive came late as if to get a whole effect of the affair at once and her smile revealed claras failure to her if she had not realized it before she read there that the aristocratic and aesthetic additions which she had made to the guests olive originally divined had not sufficed the party remained a humbug it had seemed absurd to invite anybody to meet two such little unknown people as the hubbards and then to avoid marking them as the subjects of the festivity by the precedence to be observed in going out to supper she resolved to have tea served in the drawingroom and to make it literally tea with bread and butter and some thin ascetic cakes  however sharp he was in business mr witherby was socially a dull man and his wife and daughter seemed to partake of his qualities by affinition and heredity they tried to make something of marcia but they failed through their want of art mrs witherby finding the wife of her husbands assistant in miss kingsburys house conceived an awe of her which marcia would not have known how to abate if she had imagined it and in a little while the witherby family segregated themselves among the photograph albums and the bricabrac from which clara seemed to herself to be fruitlessly detaching them the whole evening the plainest daughter and the maiden aunt of the patrician families talked to each other with unavailing intervals of the painter and the author and the radical clergyman and his wife were in danger of a conjugal devotion which society does not favor the unfashionable sister of the fashionable artist conversed with the young tutor and the japanese lawstudent whom he had asked leave to bring with him and whose small mouselike eyes continually twinkled away in pursuit of the blonde beauty of his hostess the widow was winningly attentive with a tendency to be confidential to everybody the italian could not disabuse himself of the notion that he was expected to be light and cheerful and when the pupil of the conservatory sang he abandoned himself to his error and clapped and cried bravo with unseemly vivacity but he was restored to reason when the composer sat down at the piano and played amid the hush that falls on society at such times something from beethoven and again something of his own which was so like beethoven that beethoven himself would not have known the difference  mr atherton and halleck moved about among the guests and did their best to second claras efforts for their encouragement but it was useless in the desperation which owns defeat she resolved to devote herself for the rest of the evening to trying to make at least the hubbards have a good time and then upon the dangerous theory of which young and pretty hostesses cannot be too wary that a wife is necessarily flattered by attentions to her husband she devoted herself exclusively to bartley to whom she talked long and with a reckless liveliness of the events of his former stay in boston their laughter and scraps of their reminiscence reached marcia where she sat in a feint of listening to ben hallecks perfunctory account of his college days with her husband till she could bear it no longer she rose abruptly and going to him she said that it was time to say goodnight oh so soon cried clara mystified and a little scared at the look she saw on marcias face good night she added coldly  the assembly hailed this first token of its disintegration with relief it became a little livelier there was a fleeting moment in which it seemed as if it might yet enjoy itself but its chance passed it crumbled rapidly away and clara was left looking humbly into olive hallecks pitiless eyes thank you for a delightful evening miss kingsbury congratulate you she mocked with an unsparing laugh such a success but why didnt you give them something to eat clara those poor hubbards have a oneoclock dinner and i famished for them i wasnt hungry myselfwe have a twooclock dinner     xxii   bartley came home elate from miss kingsburys entertainment it was something like the social success which he used to picture to himself he had been flattered by the attention specially paid him and he did not detect the imposition he was half starved but he meant to have up some cold meat and bottled beer and talk it all over with marcia  she did not seem inclined to talk it over on their way home and when they entered their own door she pushed in and ran upstairs why where are you going marcia he called after her  to bed she replied closing the door after her with a crash of unmistakable significance  bartley stood a moment in the fury that tempted him to pursue her with a taunt and then leave her to work herself out of the transport of senseless jealousy she had wrought herself into but he set his teeth and full of inward cursing he followed her upstairs with a slow dogged step he took her in his arms without a word and held her fast while his anger changed to pity and then to laughing when it came to that she put up her arms which she had kept rigidly at her side and laid them round his neck and began softly to cry on his breast  oh im not myself at all any more she moaned penitently  then this is very improperfor me said bartley  the helpless laughter broke through her lamentation but she cried a little more to keep herself in countenance  but i guess from a previous acquaintance with the partys character that its really all you marcia i dont blame you miss kingsburys hospitality has left me as hollow as if id had nothing to eat for a week and i know youre perishing from inanition hence these tears  it delighted her to have him make fun of miss kingsburys tea and she lifted her head to let him see that she was laughing for pleasure now before she turned away to dry her eyes  oh poor fellow she cried i did pity you so when i saw those mean little slices of bread and butter coming round  yes said bartley i felt sorry myself but dont speak of them any more dearest  and i suppose pursued marcia that all the time she was talking to you there you were simply ravening  i was casting lots in my own mind to see which of the company i should devour first  his drollery appeared to marcia the finest that ever was she laughed and laughed again when he made fun of the conjecturable toughness of the elderly aristocrat she implored him to stop if he did not want to kill her marcia was not in the state in which woman best convinces her enemies of her fitness for empire though she was charming in her silly happiness and bartley felt very glad that he had not yielded to his first impulse to deal savagely with her come he said let us go out somewhere and get some oysters  she began at once to take out her earrings and loosen her hair no ill get something here in the house im not very hungry but you go bartley and have a good supper or youll be sick tomorrow and not fit to work go she added to his hesitating image in the glass i insist upon it i wont have you stay his reflected face approached from behind she turned hers a little and their mirrored lips met over her shoulder oh how sweet you are bartley she murmured  yes you will always find me obedient when commanded to go out and repair my wasted tissue  i dont mean that dear she said softly i meanyour not quarrelling with me when im unreasonable why cant we always do so  well you see said bartley it throws the whole burden on the fellow in his senses it doesnt require any great degree of selfsacrifice to fly off at a tangent but its rather a maddening spectacle to the party that holds on  now i will show you said marcia that i can be reasonable too i shall let you go alone to make our party call on miss kingsbury she looked at him heroically  marcia said bartley youre such a reasonable person when youre the most unreasonable that i wonder i ever quarrel with you i rather think ill let you call on miss kingsbury alone i shall suffer agonies of suspicion but it will prove that i have perfect confidence in you he threw her a kiss from the door and ran down the stairs when he returned an hour later he found her waiting up for him why marcia he exclaimed  oh i just wanted to say that we will both go to call on her very soon if i sent you she might think i was mad and i wont give her that satisfaction  noble girl cried bartley with irony that pleased her better than praise women like to be understood even when they try not to be understood  when marcia went with bartley to call miss kingsbury received her with careful perhaps anxious politeness but made no further effort to take her up some of the people whom marcia met at miss kingsburys called and the witherbys came father mother and daughter together but between the evident fact that the hubbards were poor and the other evident fact that they moved in the best society the witherbys did not quite know what to do about them they asked them to dinner and bartley went alone marcia was not well enough to go  he was very kind and tractable now and went whenever she bade him go without her though tea at the hallecks was getting to be an old story with him and it was generally tea at the hallecks to which she sent him the halleck ladies came faithfully to see her and she got on very well with the two older sisters who gave her all the kindness they could spare from their charities and seemed pleased to have her so pretty and conjugal though these things were far from them but she was afraid of olive at first and disliked her as a friend of miss kingsbury this rather attracted the odd girl what she called marcias snubs enabled her to declare in her favor with a sense of disinterestedness and to indulge her repugnance for bartley with a good heart she resented his odious good looks and held it a shame that her mother should promote his visible tendency to stoutness by giving him such nice things for tea  now i like mr hubbard said her mother placidly its very kind of him to come to such plain folks as we are whenever we ask him now that his wife cant come i know he does it because he likes us  oh he comes for the eating said olive scornfully then another phase of her mothers remark struck her why mother she cried i do believe you think bartley hubbards a distinguished man somehow  your father says its very unusual for such a young man to be in a place like his mr witherby really leaves everything to him he says  well i think hed better not then the events has got to be perfectly horrid of late its full of murders and all uncleanness  that seems to be the way with the papers nowadays your father hears that the events is making money  why mother what a corrupt old thing you are i believe youve been bought up by that disgusting interview with father nestor of the leather interest father ought to have turned him out of doors well this family is getting a little too good for me and bens almost as bad as any of you of latei havent a bit of influence with him any more he seems determined to be friendlier with that person than ever hes always trying to do him goodi can see it and it makes me sick one thing i know im going to stop mr hubbards calling me olive impudent  mrs halleck shifted her ground with the pretence which women use even amongst themselves of having remained steadfast he is a very good husband  oh because he likes to be retorted her daughter nothing is easier than to be a good husband  ah my dear said mrs halleck wait till you have tried  this made olive laugh but she answered with an argument that always had weight with her mother ben doesnt think hes a good husband  what makes you think so olive asked her mother  i know he dislikes him intensely  why you just said yourself dear that he was friendlier with him than ever  oh thats nothing the more he disliked him the kinder he would be to him  thats true sighed her mother did he ever say anything to you about him  no cried olive shortly he never speaks of people he doesnt like  the mother returned with logical severity all that doesnt prove that ben thinks he isnt a good husband  he dislikes him do you believe a bad man can be a good husband then  no mrs halleck admitted as if confronted with indisputable proof of bartleys wickedness  in the mean time the peace between bartley and marcia continued unbroken and these days of waiting of suffering of hoping and dreading were the happiest of their lives he did his best to be patient with her caprices and fretfulness and he was at least manfully comforting and helpful and instant in atonement for every failure she said a thousand times that she should die without him and when her time came he thought that she was going to die before he could tell her of his sorrow for all that he had ever done to grieve her he did not tell her though she lived to give him the chance but he took her and her baby both into his arms with tears of as much fondness as ever a man shed he even began his confession but she said hush you never did a wrong thing yet that i didnt drive you to pale and faint she smiled joyfully upon him and put her hand on his head when he hid his face against hers on the pillow and put her lips against his cheek his heart was full he was grateful for the mercy that had spared him he was so strong in his silent repentance that he felt like a good man  bartley she said im going to ask a great favor of you  theres nothing that i can do that i shall think a favor darling he cried lifting his face to look into hers  write for mother to come i want her  why of course marcia continued to look at him and kept the quivering hold she had laid of his hand when he raised his head was that all  she was silent and he added i will ask your father to come with her  she hid her face for the space of one sob i wanted you to offer  why of course of course he replied  she did not acknowledge his magnanimity directly but she lifted the coverlet and showed him the little head on her arm and the little creased and crumpled face  pretty she asked bring me the letter before you send ityes that is just rightperfect she sighed when he came back and read the letter to her and she fell away to happy sleep  her father answered that he would come with her mother as soon as he got the better of a cold he had taken it was now well into the winter and the journey must have seemed more formidable in equity than in boston but bartley was not impatient of his fatherinlaws delay and he set himself cheerfully about consoling marcia for it she stole her white thin hand into his and now and then gave it a little pressure to accent the points she made in talking  father was the first one i thought ofafter you bartley it seems to me as if baby came half to show me how unfeeling i had been to him of course im not sorry i ran away and asked you to take me back for i couldnt have had you if i hadnt done it but i never realized before how cruel it was to father he always made such a pet of me and i know that he thought he was acting for the best  i knew that you were said bartley fervently  what sweet things you always say to me she murmured but dont you see bartley that i didnt think enough of him thats what baby seems to have come to teach me she pulled a little away on the pillow so as to fix him more earnestly with her eyes if baby should behave so to you when she grew up i should hate her  he laughed and said well perhaps your mother hates you  no they donteither of them answered marcia with a sigh and i behaved very stiffly and coldly with him when he came up to see memore than i had any need to i did it for your sake but he didnt mean any harm to you he just wanted to make sure that i was safe and well  oh thats all right marsh  yes i know but what if he had died  well he didnt die said bartley with a smile and youve corresponded with them regularly ever since and you know theyve been getting along all right and its going to be altogether different from this out he added leaning back a little weary with a matter in which he could not be expected to take a very cordial interest  truly she asked with one of the eagerest of those handpressures  it wont be my fault if it isnt he replied with a yawn  how good you are bartley she said with an admiring look as if it were the goodness of god she was praising  bartley released himself and went to the new crib in which the baby lay and with his hands in his pockets stood looking down at it with a curious smile  is it pretty she asked envious of his birdseye view of the baby  not definitively so he answered i dare say she will smooth out in time but she seems to be considerably puckered yet  well returned marcia with forced resignation i shouldnt let any one else say so  her husband set up a soft low thoughtful whistle ill tell you what marcia he said presently suppose we name this baby after your father  she lifted herself on her elbow and stared at him as if he must be making fun of her why how could we she demanded squire gaylords parents had called his name flavius josephus in a superstition once cherished by oldfashioned people that the jewish historian was somehow a sacred writer  we cant name her josephus but we can call her flavia said bartley and if she makes up her mind to turn out a blonde the name will just fit flaviaits a very pretty name he looked at his wife who suddenly turned her face down on the pillow  bartley hubbard she cried youre the best man in the world  oh no only the secondbest suggested bartley  in these days they took their fill of the delight of young fatherhood and motherhood after its morning bath bartley was called in and allowed to revere the babys mottled and dimpled back as it lay face downward on the nurses lap feebly wiggling its arms and legs and responding with ineffectual little sighs and gurgles to her acceptable rubbings with warm flannel when it was fully dressed and its long clothes pulled snugly down and its limp person stiffened into something tenable he was suffered to take it into his arms and to walk the room with it after all there is not much that a man can actually do with a small baby either for its pleasure or his own and barkleys usefulness had its strict limitations he was perhaps most beneficial when he put the child in its mothers arms and sat down beside the bed and quietly talked while marcia occasionally put up a slender hand and smoothed its golden brown hair bending her neck over to look at it where it lay with the action of a mother bird they examined with minute interest the details of the curious little creature its tiny fingernails fine and sharp and its small queer fist doubled so tight and closing on ones finger like a canarys claw on a perch the absurdity of its foot the absurdity of its toes the ridiculous inadequacy of its legs and arms to the work ordinarily expected of legs and arms made them laugh they could not tell yet whether its eyes would be black like marcias or blue like bartleys those long lashes had the sweep of hers but its mop of hair which made it look so odd and old was more like his in color  she will be a darkeyed blonde bartley decided  is that nice asked marcia  with the telescope sight theyre warranted to kill at five hundred yards  oh for shame bartley to talk of babys ever killing  why thats what they all come to its what you came to yourself  yes i know but its quite another thing with baby she began to mumble it with her lips and to talk babytalk to it in their common interest in this puppet they already called each other papa and mamma  squire gaylord came alone and when marcia greeted him with why father wheres mother he asked did you expect her well i guess your mothers feeling rather too old for such long winter journeys you know she dont go out a great deal i guess she expects your family down there in the summer  the old man was considerably abashed by the baby when it was put into his arms and being required to guess its name he naturally failed  flavia cried marcia joyfully bartley named it after you  this embarrassed the squire still more is that so he asked rather sheepishly well its quite a compliment  marcia repeated this to her husband as evidence that her father was all right now bartley and the squire were in fact very civil to each other and bartley paid the old man many marked attentions he took him to the top of the state house and walked him all about the city to show him its points of interest and introduced him to such of his friends as they met though the squires dresscoat whether fully revealed by the removal of his surtout or betraying itself below the skirt of the latter was a trial to a fellow of bartleys style he went with his fatherinlaw to see mr warren in jefferson scattering batkins and the squire grimly appreciated the burlesque of the member from cranberry centre but he was otherwise not a very amusable person and off his own ground he was not conversable while he refused to betray his impressions of many things that bartley expected to astonish him the events editorial rooms had no apparent effect upon him though they were as different from most editorial dens as tapestry carpets blackwalnut desks and swivel chairs could make them mr witherby covered him with urbanities and praises of bartley that ought to have delighted him as a fatherinlaw but apparently the great man of the events was but a strange variety of the type with which he was familiar in the despised country editors he got on better with mr atherton who was of a mans profession the squire wore his hat throughout their interview and everywhere except at table and in bed and as soon as he rose front either he put it on  bartley tried to impress him with such novel traits of cosmopolitan life as a table dhôte dinner at a french restaurant but the squire sat through the courses as if his barbarous old appetite had satisfied itself in that manner all his life after that bartley practically gave him up he pleaded his newspaper work and left the squire to pass the time as he could in the little house on clover street where he sat half a day at a stretch in the parlor with his hat on reading the newspapers his legs sprawled out towards the grate in this way he probably reconstructed for himself some image of his wonted life in his office at home and was for the time at peace but otherwise he was very restless except when he was with marcia he was as fond of her in his way as he had ever been and though he apparently cared nothing for the baby he enjoyed marcias pride in it and he bore to have it thrust upon him with the surly mildness of an old dog receiving childrens caresses he listened with the same patience to all her celebrations of bartley which were often tedious enough for she bragged of him constantly of his smartness and goodness and of the great success that had crowned the merit of both in him  mr halleck had called upon the squire the morning after his arrival and brought marcia a note from his wife offering to have her father stay with them if she found herself too much crowded at this eventful time there that is just the sort of people the hallecks are she cried showing the letter to her father and to think of our not going near them for months and mouths after we came to boston for fear they were stuck up but bartley is always just so proud now you must go right in father and not keep mr halleck waiting give me your hat or youll be sure to wear it in the parlor she made him stoop down to let her brush his coatcollar a little there now you look something like  squire gaylord had never received a visit except on business in his life and such a thing as one man calling socially upon another as women did was unknown to the civilization of equity but as he reported to marcia he got along with mr halleck and he got along with the whole family when he went with bartley to tea upon the invitation mr halleck made him that morning probably it appeared to him an objectless hospitality but he spent as pleasant an evening as he could hope to spend with his hat off and in a frockcoat which he wore as a more ceremonious garment than the dresscoat of his everyday life he seemed to take a special liking to olive halleck whose habit of speaking her mind with vigor and directness struck him as commendable it was olive who made the time pass for him and as the occasion was not one for personal sarcasm or question of the christian religion her task in keeping the old pagan out of rather abysmal silences must have had its difficulties  what did you talk about asked marcia requiring an account of his enjoyment from him the next morning after bartley had gone down to his work  mostly about you i guess said the squire with a laugh there was a large sandyhaired young woman there  miss kingsbury said marcia with vindictive promptness her eyes kindled and she began to grow rigid under the coverlet whom did she talk with  well she talked a little with me but she talked most of the time to the young man she engaged to him  no said marcia relaxing shes a great friend of the whole family i dont know what they meant by telling you it was to be just a family party when they were going to have strangers in she pouted  perhaps they didnt count her  no but marcias pleasure in the affair was tainted and she began to talk of other things  her father stayed nearly a week and they all found it rather a long week after showing him her baby and satisfying herself that he and bartley were on good terms again there was not much left for marcia bartley had been banished to the spare room by the presence of the nurse and he gave up his bed there to the squire and slept on a cot in the unfurnished attic room the cook and a small girl got in to help had the other the house that had once seemed so vast was full to bursting  i never knew how little it was till i saw your father coming down stairs said bartley hes too tall for it when he sits on the sofa and stretches out his legs his boots touch the mopboard on the other side of the room fact  he wont stay over sunday began marcia with a rueful smile  why marcia you dont think i want him to go  no youre as good as can be about it but i hope he wont stay over sunday  havent you enjoyed his visit asked bartley  oh yes ive enjoyed it the tears came into her eyes ive made it all up with father and he doesnt feel hard to me but bartleysit down dear here on the bed she took his hand and gently pulled him down i see more and more that father and mother can never be what they used to be to methat youre all the world to me yes my life is broken off from theirs forever could anything break it off from yours youll always be patient with me wont you and remember that id always rather be good when im behaving the worst  he rose and went over to the crib and kissed the head of their little girl ask flavia he said from the door  bartley she cried in utter fondness as he vanished from her happy eyes  the next morning they heard the squire moving about in his room and he was late in coming down to breakfast at which he was ordinarily so prompt hes packing said marcia sadly its dreadful to be willing to have him go  bartley went out and met him at his door bag in hand hollo he cried and made a decent show of surprise and regret  myes said the old man as they went down stairs ive made out a visit but im an old fellow and i aint easy away from home i shall tell mis gaylord how youre gettin along and shell be pleased to hear it yes shell be pleased to hear it i guess i shall get off on the tenoclock train  the conversation between bartley and his fatherinlaw was perfunctory men who have dealt so plainly with each other do not assume the conventional urbanities in their intercourse without effort they had both been growing more impatient of the restraint they could not have kept it up much longer  well i suppose its natural you should want to be home again but i cant understand how any one can want to go back to equity when he has the privilege of staying in boston  boston will do for a young man said the squire but im too old for it the city cramps me its too tight a fit and yet i cant seem to find myself in it  he suffered from the loss of identity which is a common affliction with country people coming to town the feeling that they are of no special interest to any of the thousands they meet bewilders and harasses them after the searching neighborhood of village life the fact that nobody would meddle in their most intimate affairs if they could is a vague distress the squire not only experienced this but after reigning so long as the censor of morals and religion in equity it was a deprivation for him to pass a whole week without saying a bitter thing to any one he was tired of the civilities that smoothed him down on every side  well if you must go said bartley ill order a hack  i guess i can walk to the depot returned the old man  oh no you cant bartley drove to the station with him and they bade each other adieu with a handshake they were no longer enemies but they liked each other less than ever  see you in equity next summer i suppose suggested the squire  so marcia says replied bartley well take care of yourselfyou confounded tightfisted old woodchuck he added under his breath for the squire had allowed him to pay the hack fare  he walked home composing variations on his parting malison to find that the squire had profited by his brief absence while ordering the hack to leave with marcia a silver cup knife fork and spoon which olive halleck had helped him choose for the baby in the cup was a check for five hundred dollars the squire was embarrassed in presenting the gifts and when marcia turned upon him with now look here father what do you mean he was at a loss how to explain  well its what i always meant to do for you  babys things are all right said marcia but im not going to let bartley take any money from you unless you think as well of him as i do and say so right out  the squire laughed you couldnt quite expect me to do that could you  no of course not but what i mean is do you think now that i did right to marry him  oh youre all right marcia im glad youre getting along so well  no no is bartley all right  the squire laughed again and rubbed his chin in enjoyment of her persistence you cant expect me to own up to everything all at once  so you see bartley said marcia in repeating these words to him it was quite a concession  well i dont know about the concession but i guess theres no doubt about the check replied bartley  oh dont say that dear protested his wife i think father was pleased with his visit every way i know hes been anxious about me all the time and yet it was a good deal for him to do after what he had said to come down here and as much as take it all back cant you look at it from his side  oh i dare say it was a dose bartley admitted the money had set several things in a better light if all the people that have abused me would take it back as handsomely as your father hashe held the check upwhy i wish there were twice as many of them  she laughed for pleasure in his joke i think father was impressed by everything about usbeginning with baby she said proudly  well he kept his impressions to himself  oh thats nothing but his way he never was demonstrativelike me  no he has his emotions under controlnot to say under lock and keynot to add in irons  bartley went on to give some instances of the squires fortitude when apparently tempted to express pleasure or interest in his boston experiences  they both undeniably felt freer now that he was gone bartley stayed longer than he ought from his work in tacit celebration of the squires departure and they were very merry together but when he left her marcia called for her baby and gathering it close to her heart sighed over it poor father poor father     xxiii   when the spring opened bartley pushed flavia about the sunny pavements in a baby carriage while marcia paced alongside looking in under the calash top from time to time arranging the bright afghan and twitching the little ones lace hood into place they never noticed that other perambulators were pushed by irish nursegirls or french bonnes they had paid somewhat more than they ought for theirs and they were proud of it merely as a piece of property it was rather bartleys ideal as it is that of most young american fathers to go out with his wife and baby in that way he liked to have his friends see him and he went out every afternoon he could spare when he could not go marcia went alone mrs halleck had given her a key to the garden and on pleasant mornings she always found some of the family there when she pushed the perambulator up the path to let the baby sleep in the warmth and silence of the sheltered place she chatted with olive or the elder sisters while mrs halleck drove cyrus on to the work of tying up the vines and trimming the shrubs with the pitiless rigor of women when they get a man about some outdoor labor sometimes ben halleck was briefly of the party and one morning when marcia opened the gate she found him there alone with cyrus who was busy at some belated tasks of horticulture the young man turned at the unlocking of the gate and saw marcia lifting the front wheels of the perambulator to get it over the steps of the pavement outside he limped hastily down the walk to help her but she had the carriage in the path before he could reach her and he had nothing to do but to walk back at its side as she propelled it towards the house you see what a useless creature a cripple is he said  marcia did not seem to have heard him is your mother at home she asked  i think she is said halleck cyrus go in and tell mother that mrs hubbard is here wont you  cyrus went after a moment of selfrespectful delay and marcia sat down on a bench under a peartree beside the walk its narrow young leaves and blossoms sprinkled her with shade shot with vivid sunshine and in her light dress she looked like a bright fresh figure from some painters study of spring she breathed quickly from her exertion and her cheeks had a rich dewy bloom she had pulled the perambulator round so that she might see her baby while she waited and she looked at the baby now and not at halleck as she said it is quite hot in the sun today she had a way of closing her lips after speaking in that sweet smile of hers and then of glancing sidelong at the person to whom she spoke  i suppose it is said halleck who remained on foot but i havent been out yet i gave myself a day off from the law school and i hadnt quite decided what to do with it  marcia leaned forward and brushed a tendril of the babys hair out of its eye shes the greatest little sleeper that ever was when she gets into her carriage she half mused leaning back with her hands folded in her lap and setting her head on one side for the effect of the baby without the stray ringlet shes getting so fat she said proudly  halleck smiled do you find it makes a difference in pushing her carriage from day to day  marcia took his question in earnest as she must take anything but the most obvious pleasantry concerning her baby the carriage runs very easily we picked out the lightest one we could and i never have any trouble with it except getting up curbstones and crossing cambridge street i dont like to cross cambridge street there are always so many horsecars but its all downhill coming here thats one good thing  that makes it a very bad thing going home though said halleck  oh i go round by charles street and come up the hill from the other side it isnt so steep there  there was no more to be said upon this point and in the lapse of their talk halleck broke off some boughs of the blooming pear and dropped them on the babys afghan  your mother wont like your spoiling her peartree said marcia seriously  she will when she knows that i did it for miss hubbard  miss hubbard repeated the young mother and she laughed in fond derision how funny to hear you saying that i thought you hated babies  halleck looked at her with strong selfdisgust and he dropped the bough which he had in his hand upon the ground there is something in a young mans ideal of women at once passionate and ascetic so fine that any words are too gross for it the event which intensified the interest of his mother and sisters in marcia had abashed halleck when she came so proudly to show her baby to them all it seemed to him like a mockery of his pity for her captivity to the love that profaned her he went out of the room in angry impatience which he could hardly hide when one of his sisters tried to make him take the baby little by little his compassion adjusted itself to the new conditions it accepted the child as an element of her misery in the future when she must realize the hideous deformity of her marriage his prophetic feeling of this and of her inaccessibility to human help here and hereafter made him sometimes afraid of her but all the more severely he exacted of his ideal of her that she should not fall beneath the tragic dignity of her fate through any levity of her own now at her innocent laugh a subtile irreverence which he was not able to exorcise infused itself into his sense of her  he stood looking at her after he dropped the pearbough and seeing her mere beauty as he had never seen it before the bees hummed in the blossoms which gave out a dull sweet smell the sunshine had the luxurious enervating warmth of spring he started suddenly from his reverie marcia had said something i beg your pardon he queried  oh nothing i asked if you knew where i went to church yesterday  halleck flushed ashamed of the wrong his thoughts or rather his emotions had done no i dont he answered  i was at your church  i ought to have been there myself he returned gravely and then i should have known  she took his selfreproach literally you couldnt have seen me i was sitting pretty far back and i went out before any of your family saw me dont you go there  not always im sorry to say or rather im sorry not to be sorry what church do you generally go to  oh i dont know sometimes to one and sometimes to another bartley used to report the sermons and we went round to all the churches then that is the way i did at home and it came natural to me but i dont like it very well i want flavia should belong to some particular church  there are enough to choose from said halleck with pensive sarcasm  yes thats the difficulty but i shall make up my mind to one of them and then i shall always keep to it what i mean is that i should like to find out where most of the good people belong and then have her be with them pursued marcia i think its best to belong to some church dont you  there was something so bare so spiritually povertystricken in these confessions and questions that halleck found nothing to say to them he was troubled moreover as to what the truth was in his own mind he answered with a sort of mechanical adhesion to the teachings of his youth i should be a recreant not to think so but im not sure that i know what you mean by belonging to some church he added i suppose you would want to believe in the creed of the church whichever it was  i dont know that i should be particular said marcia with perfect honesty  halleck laughed sadly im afraid they would then unless you joined the broad church  what is that he explained as well as he could at the end she repeated as if she had not followed him very closely i should like her to belong to the church where most of the good people went i think that would be the right one if you could only find which it is halleck laughed again i suppose what i say must sound very queer to you but ive been thinking a good deal about this lately  i beg your pardon said halleck i had no reason to laugh either on your account or my own its a serious subject she did not reply and he asked as if she had left the subject do you intend to pass the summer in boston  no im going down home pretty early and i wanted to ask your mother what is the best way to put away my winter things  youll find my mother very good authority on such matters said halleck through an obscure association with moths that corrupt he added shes a good authority on church matters too  i guess i shall talk with her about flavia said marcia  cyrus came out of the house mis halleck will be here in a minute shes got to get red of a lady thats calling first he explained  i will leave you then said halleck abruptly  good by answered marcia tranquilly the baby stirred she pushed the carriage to and fro without glancing after him as he walked away  his mother came down the steps from the house and kissed marcia for welcome and looked under the carriagetop at the sleeping baby how she does sleep she whispered  yes said marcia with the proud humility of a mother who cannot deny the merit of her child and she sleeps the whole night through im never up with her bartley says shes a perfect sevensleeper its a regular joke with himher sleeping  ben was a good baby for sleeping too said mrs halleck retrospectively emulous its one of the best signs it shows that the child is strong and healthy they went on to talk of their children and in their community of motherhood they spoke of the young man as if he were still an infant he has never been a moments care to me said mrs halleck a well baby will be well even in teething  and i had somehow thought of him as sickly said marcia in selfderision  tears of instant intelligence sprang into his mothers eyes and did you suppose he was always lame she demanded with gentle indignation he was the brightest and strongest boy that ever was till he was twelve years old thats what makes it so hard to bear thats what makes me wonder at the way the child bears it did you never hear how it happened one of the big boys as he called him tripped him up at school and he fell on his hip it kept him in bed for a year and hes never been the same since he will always be a cripple grieved the mother she wiped her eyes she never could think of her boys infirmity without weeping and what seemed the worst of all she continued was that the boy who did it never expressed any regret for it or acknowledged it by word or deed though he must have known that ben knew who hurt him hes a man here now and sometimes ben meets him but ben always says that he can stand it if the other one can he was always just so from the first he wouldnt let us blame the boy he said that he didnt mean any harm and that all was fair in play and now he says he knows the man is sorry and would own to what he did if he didnt have to own to what came of it ben says that very few of us have the courage to face the consequences of the injuries we do and thats what makes people seem hard and indifferent when they are really not so there cried mrs halleck i dont know as i ought to have told you about it i know ben wouldnt like it but i cant bear to have any one think he was always lame though i dont know why i shouldnt im prouder of him since it happened than ever i was before i thought he was here with you she added abruptly  he went out just before you came said marcia nodding toward the gate she sat listening to mrs hallecks talk about ben mrs halleck took herself to task from time to time but only to go on talking about him again sometimes marcia commented on his characteristics and compared them with bartleys or with flavias according to the period of bens life under consideration  at the end mrs halleck said i havent let you get in a word now you must talk about your baby dear little thing i feel that shes been neglected but im always just so selfish when i get to running on about ben they all laugh at me  oh i like to hear about other children said marcia turning the perambulator round i dont think any one can know too much that has the care of children of their own she added as if it followed from something they had been saying of vaccination mrs halleck i want to talk with you about getting flavia christened you know i never was christened  werent you said mrs halleck with a dismay which she struggled to conceal  no said marcia father doesnt believe in any of those things and mother had got to letting them go because he didnt take any interest in them they did have the first children christened but i was the last  i didnt speak with your father on the subject faltered mrs halleck i didnt know what his persuasion was  why father doesnt belong to any church he believes in a god but he doesnt believe in the bible mrs halleck sank down on the garden seat too much shocked to speak and marcia continued i dont know whether the bible is true or not but ive often wished that i belonged to church  you couldnt unless you believed in the bible said mrs halleck  yes i know that perhaps i should if anybody proved it to me i presume it could be explained i never talked much with any one about it there must be a good many people who dont belong to church although they believe in the bible i should be perfectly willing to try if i only knew how to begin  in view of this ruinous openmindedness mrs halleck could only say the way to begin is to read it  well i will try how do you know after youve become so that you believe the bible whether youre fit to join the church  its hard to tell you my dear you have to feel first that you have a saviourthat youve given your whole heart to himthat he can save you and that no one else canthat all you can do yourself wont help you its an experience  marcia looked at her attentively as if this were all a very hard saying yes ive heard of that some of the girls had it at school but i never did well she said at last i dont feel so anxious about myself just at present as i do about flavia i want to do everything i can for flavia mrs halleck i want her to be christenedi want her to be baptized into some church i think a good deal about it i think sometimes what if she should die and i hadnt done that for her when may be it was one of the most important things her voice shook and she pressed her lips together  of course said mrs halleck tenderly i think it is the most important thing  but there are so many churches marcia resumed and i dont know about any of them i told mr halleck just now that i should like her to belong to the church where the best people went if i could find it out of course it was a ridiculous way to talk i knew he thought so but what i meant was that i wanted she should be with good people all her life and i didnt care what she believed  its very important to believe the truth my dear said mrs halleck  but the truth is so hard to be certain of and you know goodness as soon as you see it mrs halleck ill tell you what i want i want flavia should be baptized into your church will you let her  let her o my dear child we shall be humbly thankful that it has been put into your heart to choose for her what we think is the true church said mrs halleck fervently  i dont know about that returned marcia i cant tell whether its the true church or not and i dont know that i ever could but i shall be satisfiedif its made you what you are she added simply  mrs halleck did not try to turn away her praise with vain affectations of humility we try to do right marcia she said whenever we do it we must be helped to it by some power outside of ourselves i cant tell you whether its our church im not so sure of that as i used to be i once thought that there could be no real good out of it but i cant think that any more olive and ben are as good children as ever lived i know they wont be lost but neither of them belongs to our church  why what church does he belong to  he doesnt belong to any my dear said mrs halleck sorrowfully  marcia looked at her absently i knew olive was a unitarian but i thoughti thought he  no he doesnt returned mrs halleck it has been a great cross to his father and me he is a good boy but we think the truth is in our church  marcia was silent a moment then she said decisively well i should like flavia to belong to your church  she couldnt belong to it now mrs halleck explained that would have to come later when she could understand but she could be christened in itdear little thing  well christened then it must be the training he got in it ive thought a great deal about it and i think my worst trouble is that ive been left too free in everything one mustnt be left too free ive never had any one to control me and now i cant control myself at the very times when i need to do it the most withwithwhen i in in danger of vexingwhen bartley and i  yes said mrs halleck sympathetically  and bartley is just so too hes always been left to himself and flavia will need all the control we can give heri know she will and i shall have her christened in your church and i shall teach her all about it she shall go to the sunday school and i will go to church so that she can have an example i told father i should do it when he was up here and he said there couldnt be any harm in it and ive told bartley and he doesnt care  they were both far too singleminded and too serious to find anything droll in the terms of the adhesion of marcias family to her plan and mrs halleck entered into its execution with affectionate zeal  ben dear she said tenderly that evening when they were all talking it over in the family council i hope you didnt drop anything when that poor creature spoke to you about it this morning that could unsettle her mind in any way  no mother said halleck gently  i was sure you didnt returned his mother repentantly  they had been talking a long time of the matter and halleck now left the room  mother how could you say such a thing to ben cried olive in a quiver of indignant sympathy ben say anything to unsettle anybodys religious purposes hes got more religion now than all the rest of the family put together  speak for yourself olive said one of the intermediary sisters  why olive i spoke because i thought she seemed to place more importance on bens belonging to the church than anything else and she seemed so surprised when i told her he didnt belong to any  i dare say she thinks ben is good when she compares him with that mass of selfishness of a husband of hers said olive but i will thank her she added hotly not to compare ben with bartley hubbard even to bartley hubbards disadvantage i dont feel flattered by it  of course she thinks all the world of her husband said mrs halleck and i know ben is good and as you say he is religious i feel that though i dont understand how exactly i wouldnt hurt his feelings for the world olive you know well enough but it was a stumblingblock when i had to tell that poor pretty young thing that ben didnt belong to church and i could see that it puzzled her i couldnt have believed continued mrs halleck that there was any person in a christian land except among the very lowest that seemed to understand so little about the christian religion or any scheme of salvation really she talked to me like a pagan she sat there much better dressed and better educated than i was but i felt like a missionary talking to a south sea islander  i wonder the old bartlett pear didnt burst into a palmtree over your heads said olive mrs halleck looked grieved at her levity and olive hastened to add dont take it to heart mother i understood just what you meant and i can imagine just how shocking mrs hubbards heathen remarks must have been we should all be shocked if we knew how many people there were like her and we should all try to deny it and so would they i guess christianity is about as uncommon as civilizationand thats very uncommon if her poor feeble mind was such a chaos what do you suppose her husbands is  this would certainly not have been easy for mrs halleck to say then or to say afterward when bartley walked up to the font in her church with marcia at his side and flavia in his arms and a faintly ironical smile on his face as if he had never expected to be got in for this but was going to see it through now he had in fact said well lets go the whole figure when marcia had expressed a preference for having the rite performed in church instead of in their own house  he was unquestionably growing stout and even mrs halleck noticed that his blonde face was unpleasantly red that day he was of course not intemperate he always had beer with his lunch which he had begun to take down town since the warm weather had come on and made the walk up the hill to clover street irksome and he drank beer at his dinnerhe liked a late dinner and they dined at six nowbecause it washed away the fatigues of the day and freshened you up he was rather particular about his beer which he had sent in by the grossit came cheaper that way after trying both the cincinnati and the milwaukee lagers and making a cursory test of the boston brand he had settled down upon the american tivoli it was cheap and you could drink a couple of bottles without feeling it freshened up by his two bottles he was apt to spend the evening in an amiable drowse and get early to bed when he did not go out on newspaper duty he joked about the three fingers of fat on his ribs and frankly guessed it was the beer that did it at such times he said that perhaps he should have to cut down on his tivoli  marcia and he had not so much time together as they used to have she was a great deal taken up with the baby and he found it dull at home not doing anything or saying anything and when he did not feel sleepy he sometimes invented work that took him out at night but he always came upstairs after putting his hat on and asked marcia if he could help her about anything  he usually met other newspaper men on these excursions and talked newspaper with them airing his favorite theories he liked to wander about with reporters who were working up cases to look in at the police stations and go to the fires and he was often able to give the events men points that had escaped the other reporters if asked to drink he always said thanks no i dont do anything in that way but if youll make it beer i dont mind he took nothing but beer when he hurried out of the theatre into one of the neighboring resorts just as the great platters of stewed kidneys and lyonnaise potatoes came steaming up out of the kitchen prompt to the drop of the curtain on the last act here sometimes he met a friend and shared with him his dish of kidneys and his schooner of beer and he once suffered himself to be lured by the click of the balls into the back room he believed that he played a very good game of billiards but he was badly beaten that night he came home at daylight fifty dollars out but he had lost like a gentleman in a game with gentlemen and he never played again  by day he worked hard and since his expenses had been increased by flavias coming he had undertaken more work for more pay he still performed all the routine labor of a managing editor and he now wrote the literary notices of the events and sometimes especially if there was anything new the dramatic criticisms he brought to the latter task all the freshness of a man who till the year before had not been half a dozen times inside a theatre  he attributed the fat on his ribs to the tivoli perhaps it was also owing in some degree to a good conscience which is a much easier thing to keep than people imagine at any rate he now led a tranquil industrious and regular life and a life which suited him so well that he was reluctant to interrupt it by the visit to equity which he and marcia had talked of in the early spring he put it off from time to time and one day when she was pressing him to fix some date for it he said why cant you go marcia  alone she faltered  well no take the baby of course and ill run down for a day or two when i get a chance  marcia seemed in these days to be schooling herself against the impulses that once brought on her quarrels with bartley a day or two she began and then stopped and added gravely i thought you said you were going to have several weeks vacation  oh dont tell me what i said cried bartley that was before i undertook this extra work or before i knew what a grind it was going to be equity is a good deal of a dose for me any way its all well enough for you and i guess the change from boston will do you good and do the baby good but i shouldnt look forward to three weeks in equity with unmitigated hilarity  i know it will be stupid for you but you need the rest and the hallecks are going to be at north conway and they said they would come over urged marcia i know we should have a good time  bartley grinned is that your idea of a good time marsh three weeks of equity relieved by a visit from such heavy weights as ben halleck and his sisters not any in mine thank you  how can youhow dare you speak of them so cried marcia lightening upon him such good friends of yourssuch good people her voice shook with indignation and wounded feeling  bartley rose and took a turn about the room pulling down his waistcoat and contemplating its outward slope with a smile oh ive got more friends than i can shake a stick at and with pleasure at the helm goodness is a drug in the marketif youll excuse the mixed metaphor look here marcia he added severely if you like the hallecks all well and good i shant interfere with you but they bore me i outgrew ben halleck years ago hes duller than death as for the old people theres no harm in themthough theyre bores toonor in the old girls but olive halleck doesnt treat me decently i suppose that just suits you ive noticed that you never like the women that do treat me decently  they dont treat me decently retorted marcia  oh miss kingsbury treated you very well that night she couldnt imagine your being jealous of her politeness to me  marcias temper fired at his treacherous recurrence to a grievance which he had once so sacredly and sweetly ignored if you wish to take up bygones why dont you go back to hannah morrison at once she treated you even better than miss kingsbury  i should have been very willing to do that said bartley but i thought it might remind you of a disagreeable little episode in your own life when you flung me away and had to go down on your knees to pick me up again  these thrusts which they dealt each other in their quarrels however blind and misdirected always reached their hearts it was the wicked will that hurt rather than the words marcia rose bleeding inwardly and her husband felt the remorse of a man who gets the best of it in such an encounter  oh im sorry i said that marcia i didnt mean it indeed i she disdained to heed him as she swept out of the room and up the stairs and his anger flamed out again  i give you fair warning he called after her not to try that trick of locking the door or i will smash it in  her answer was to turn the key in the door with a click which he could not fail to hear  the peace in which they had been living of late was very comfortable to bartley he liked it he hated to have it broken he was willing to do what he could to restore it at once if he had no better motive than this he still had this motive and he choked down his wrath and followed marcia softly upstairs he intended to reason with her and he began i say marsh as he turned the doorknob but you cannot reason through a keyhole and before he knew he found himself saying will you open this in a tone whose quiet was deadly she did not answer he heard her stop in her movements about the room and wait as if she expected him to ask again he hesitated a moment whether to keep his threat of breaking the door in but he turned away and went down stairs and so into the street once outside he experienced the sense of release that comes to a man from the violation of his better impulses but he did not know what to do or where to go he walked rapidly away but marcias eyes and voice seemed to follow him and plead with him for his forbearance but he answered his conscience as if it had been some such presence that he had forborne too much already and that now he should not humble himself that he was right and should stand upon his right there was not much comfort in it and he had to brace himself again and again with vindictive resolution     xxiv   bartley walked about the streets for a long time without purpose or direction brooding fiercely on his wrongs and reminding himself how marcia had determined to have him and had indeed flung herself upon his mercy with all sorts of good promises and had then at once taken the whiphand and goaded and tormented him ever since all the kindness of their common life counted for nothing in this furious reverie or rather it was never once thought of he cursed himself for a fool that he had ever asked her to marry him and for doubly a fool that he had married her when she had as good as asked him he was glad now that he had taunted her with that he only regretted that he had told her he was sorry he was presently aware of being so tired that he could scarcely pull one leg after another and yet he felt hopelessly wide awake it was in simple despair of anything else to do that he climbed the stairs to rickers lofty perch in the chronicleabstract office ricker turned about as he entered and stared up at him from beneath the green pasteboard visor with which he was shielding his eyes from the gas his hair which was of the harshness and color of hay was stiffly poked up and strewn about on his skull as if it were some foreign product  hello he said going to issue a morning edition of the events  what makes you think so  oh i supposed you eveningpaper gents went to bed with the hens what has kept you up esteemed contemporary he went on working over some despatches which lay upon his table  dont you want to come out and have some oysters asked bartley  why this princely hospitality ill come with you in half a minute ricker said going to the slide that carried up the copy to the composingroom and thrusting his manuscript into the box  where are you going he asked when they found themselves out in the soft starlit autumnal air and bartley answered with the name of an oysterhouse obscure but of singular excellence  yes thats the best place ricker commented what i always wonder at in you is the rapidity with which you ve taken on the city you were quite in the green wood when you came here and now you know your boston like a little man i suppose its your newspaper work thats familiarized you with the place well how do you like your friend witherby as far as youve gone  oh we shall get along i guess said bartley he still keeps me in the background and plays at being editor but he pays me pretty well  not too well i hope  i should like to see him try it  i shouldnt said ricker hed expect certain things of you if he did youll have to look out for witherby  you mean that hes a scamp  no there isnt a better conscience than witherby carries in the whole city hes perfectly honest he not only believes that he has a right to run the events in his way but he sincerely believes that he is right in doing it theres where he has the advantage of you if you doubt him i dont suppose he ever did a wrong thing in his life hed persuade himself that the thing was right before he did it  thats a common phenomenon isnt it sneered bartley nobody sins  youre right partly but some of us sinners have our misgivings and witherby never has you know he offered me your place  no i didnt said bartley astonished and not pleased  i thought he might have told you he made me inducements but i was afraid of him witherby is the countingroom incarnate i talked you into him for some place or other but he didnt seem to wake up to the value of my advice at once then i couldnt tell what he was going to offer you  thank you for letting me in for a thing you were afraid of  i didnt believe he would get you under his thumb as he would me youve got more backbone than i have i have to keep out of temptation you have noticed that i never drink and i would rather not look upon witherby when he is red and giveth his color in the cup im sorry if ive let you in for anything that you regret but witherbys sincerity makes him dangerousi own that  i think he has some very good ideas about newspapers said bartley rather sulkily  oh very assented ricker some of the very best going he believes that the press is a great moral engine and that it ought to be run in the interest of the engineer  and i suppose you believe that it ought to be run in the interest of the public  exactlyafter the public has paid  well i dont and i never did a newspaper is a private enterprise  its private property but it isnt a private enterprise and in its very nature it cant be you know i never talk journalism and stuff it amuses me to hear the young fellows at it though i think they might be doing something worse than magnifying their office they might be decrying it but ive got a few ideas and principles of my own in my back pantaloons pocket  haul them out said bartley  i dont know that theyre very well formulated returned ricker and i dont contend that theyre very new but i consider a newspaper a public enterprise with certain distinct duties to the public its sacredly bound not to do anything to deprave or debauch its readers and its sacredly bound not to mislead or betray them not merely as to questions of morals and politics but as to questions of what we may lump as advertising has friend witherby developed his great ideas of advertisers rights to you bartley did not answer and ricker went on well then you can understand my position when i say its exactly the contrary  you ought to be on a religious newspaper ricker said bartley with a scornful laugh  thank you a secular paper is bad enough for me  well i dont pretend that i make the events just what i want said bartley at present the most i can do is to indulge in a few cheap dreams of what i should do if i had a paper of my own  what are your dreams haul out as you say  i should make it pay to begin with and i should make it pay by making it such a thorough newspaper that every class of people must have it i should cater to the lowest class first and as long as i was poor i would have the fullest and best reports of every local accident and crime that would take all the rabble then as i could afford it id rise a little and give firstclass nonpartisan reports of local political affairs that would fetch the next largest class the ward politicians of all parties id lay for the local religious world after thatreligion comes right after politics in the popular mind and it interests the women like murder id give the minutest religious intelligence and not only that but the religious gossip and the religious scandal then id go in for fashion and societythat comes next id have the most reliable and thoroughgoing financial reports that money could buy when id got my local ground perfectly covered id begin to ramify every fellow that could spell in any part of the country should understand that if he sent me an account of a suicide or an elopement or a murder or an accident he should be well paid for it and id rise on the same scale through all the departments id add art criticisms dramatic and sporting news and book reviews more for the looks of the thing than for anything else they dont any of em appeal to a large class id get my paper into such a shape that people of every kind and degree would have to say no matter what particular objection was made to it yes thats so but its the best newspaper in the world and we cant get along without it  and then said ricker youd begin to clean up little by littlelet up on your murders and scandals and purge and live cleanly like a gentleman the tricks been tried before  they had arrived at the oysterhouse and were sitting at their table waiting for the oysters to be brought to them bartley tilted his chair back i dont know about the cleaning up i should want to keep all my audience if i cleaned up the dirty fellows would go off to some one else and the fellows that pretended to be clean would be disappointed  why dont you get witherby to put your ideas in force asked ricker dryly  bartley dropped his chair to all fours and said with a smile he belongs to church  ah he has his limitations what a pity he has the money to establish this great moral engine of yours and you havent its a loss to civilization  one thing i know said bartley with a certain effect of virtue nobody should buy or sell me and the advertising element shouldnt spread beyond the advertising page  isnt that rather high ground inquired ricker  bartley did not think it worth while to answer i dont believe that a newspaper is obliged to be superior in tone to the community he said  i quite agree with you  and if the community is full of vice and crime the newspaper cant do better than reflect its condition  ah there i should distinguish esteemed contemporary there are several tones in every community and it will keep any newspaper scratching to rise above the highest but if it keeps out of the mud at all it cant help rising above the lowest and no community is full of vice and crime any more than it is full of virtue and good works why not let your model newspaper mirror these  theyre not snappy  no thats true  you must give the people what they want  are you sure of that  yes i am  well its a beautiful dream said ricker nourished on a youth sublime why do not these lofty imaginings visit us later in life you make me quite ashamed of my own ideal newspaper before you began to talk i had been fancying that the vice of our journalism was its intense localism i have doubted a good while whether a drunken irishman who breaks his wifes head or a child who falls into a tub of hot water has really established a claim on the public interest why should i be told by telegraph how three negroes died on the gallows in north carolina why should an accurate correspondent inform me of the elopement of a married man with his maidservant in east machias why should i sup on all the horrors of a railroad accident and have the bleeding fragments hashed up for me at breakfast why should my newspaper give a succession of shocks to my nervous system as i pass from column to column and poultice me between shocks with the nastiness of a distant or local scandal you reply because i like spice but i dont i am sick of spice and i believe that most of our readers are  cater to them with milktoast then said bartley  ricker laughed with him and they fell to upon their oysters  when they parted bartley still found himself wakeful he knew that he should not sleep if he went home and he said to himself that he could not walk about all night he turned into a gaylylighted basement and asked for something in the way of a nightcap  the barkeeper said there was nothing like a hotscotch to make you sleep and a small man with his hat on who had been talking with the barkeeper and coming up to the counter occasionally to eat a bit of cracker or a bit of cheese out of the two bowls full of such fragments that stood at the end of the counter said that this was so  it was very cheerful in the barroom with the light glittering on the rows of decanters behind the barkeeper a large stout clean pale man in his shirtsleeves after the manner of his kind and bartley made up his mind to stay there till he was drowsy and to drink as many hotscotches as were necessary to the result he had his drink put on a little table and sat down to it easily stirring it to cool it a little and feeling its flattery in his brain from the first sip  the man who was munching cheese and crackers wore a hat rather large for him pulled down over his eyes he now said that he did not care if he took a ginsling and the barkeeper promptly set it before him on the counter and saluted with good evening colonel a large man who came in carrying a small dog in his arms bartley recognized him as the manager of a variety combination playing at one of the theatres and the manager recognized the little man with the ginsling as tommy he did not return the barkeepers salutation but he asked as he sat down at a table what do i want for supper charley  the barkeeper said oracularly as he leaned forward to wipe his counter with a napkin fricassee chicken  fricassee devil returned the manager get me a welsh rabbit  the barkeeper unperturbed by this rejection called into the tube behind him one welsh rabbit  i want some cold chicken for my dog said the manager  one cold chicken repeated the barkeeper in his tube  white meat said the manager  white meat repeated the barkeeper  i went into the parker house one night about midnight and i saw four doctors there eating lobster salad and devilled crab and washing it down with champagne and i made up my mind that the doctors neednt talk to me any more about what was wholesome i was going in for what was good and there aint anything better for supper than welsh rabbit in this world  as the manager addressed this philosophy to the company at large no one commented upon it which seemed quite the same to the manager who hitched one elbow over the back of his chair and caressed with the other hand the dog lying in his lap  the little man in the large hat continued to walk up and down leaving his ginsling on the counter and drinking it between his visits to the cracker and cheese  whats that new piece of yours colonel he asked after a while i aint seen it yet  legs principally sighed the manager thats what the public wants i give the public what it wants i dont pretend to be any better than the public nor any worse he added stroking his dog  these ideas struck bartley in their accordance with his own ideas of journalism as he had propounded them to ricker he had drunk half of his hotscotch  thats what i say assented the little man all that a theatre has got to do is to keep even with the public  thats so tommy said the manager of a school of morals with wisdom that impressed more and more the manager of a great moral engine  the same principle runs through everything observed bartley speaking for the first time  the drink had stiffened his tongue somewhat but it did not incommode his utterance it rather gave dignity to it and his head was singularly clear he lifted his empty glass from the table and catching the barkeepers eye said do it again the man brought it back full  it runs through the churches as well as the theatres as long as the public wanted hellfire the ministers gave them hellfire but you couldnt get hellfirenot the pure oldfashioned brimstone articleout of a popular preacher now for love or money  the little man said i guess youve got about the size of it there and the manager laughed  its just so with the newspapers too said bartley some newspapers used to stand out against publishing murders and personal gossip and divorce trials there aint a newspaper that pretends to keep anyways up with the times now that dont do it the public want spice and they will have it  well sir said the manager thats my way of looking at it i say if the public dont want shakespeare give em burlesque till theyre sick of it i believe in what grant said the quickest way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it  thats so said the little man every time he added to the barkeeper that he guessed he would have some brandy and soda and bartley found himself at the bottom of his second tumbler he ordered it replenished  the little man seemed to be getting further away he said from the distance to which he had withdrawn you want to go to bed with three nightcaps on like an oldclothes man  bartley felt like resenting the freedom but he was anxious to pour his ideas of journalism into the managers sympathetic ear and he began to talk with an impression that it behooved him to talk fast his brain was still very clear but his tongue was getting stiffer the manager now had his welsh rabbit before him but bartley could not make out how it had got there nor when he was talking fast and he knew by the way everybody was listening that he was talking well sometimes he left his table glass in hand and went and laid down the law to the manager who smilingly assented to all he said once he heard a low growling at his feet and looking down he saw the dog with his plate of cold chicken that had also been conjured into the room somehow  look out said the manager hell nip you in the leg  curse the dog he seems to be on all sides of you said bartley i cant stand anywhere  better sit down then suggested the manager  good idea said the little man who was still walking up and down it appeared as if he had not spoken for several hours his hat was further over his eyes bartley had thought he was gone  what business is it of yours he demanded fiercely moving towards the little man  come none of that said the barkeeper steadily  bartley looked at him in amazement wheres your hat he asked  the others laughed the barkeeper smiled  are you a married man  never mind said the barkeeper severely  bartley turned to the little man you married  not much replied the other he was now topping off with a whiskeystraight  bartley referred himself to the manager you  pas si bête said the manager who did his own adapting from the french  well youre scholar and youre gentleman said bartley the indefinite articles would drop out in spite of all his efforts to keep them in n i want ask you what you dotoaskyouwhatwouldyoudo he repeated with painful exactness but he failed to make the rest of the sentence perfect and he pronounced it all in a word fyourwifelockyouout  id take a walk said the manager  id bust the door in said the little man  bartley turned and gazed at him as if the little man were a much more estimable person than he had supposed he passed his arm through the little mans which the other had just crooked to lift his whiskey to his mouth look here said bartley thas jus what i told her i want you to go home th me i want t introduce you to my wife  all right answered the little man dont care if i do he dropped his tumbler to the floor hang it up charley glass and all hang up this gentlemans nightcapsmy account gentleman asks me home to his house ill hang himill get him hungwell fix it to suit yourselfevery time  they got themselves out of the door and the manager said to the barkeeper who came round to gather up the fragments of the broken tumbler think his wife will be glad to see em charley  oh theyll be taken care of before they reach his house     xxv   when they were once out under the stars bartley who still felt his brain clear said that he would not take his friend home at once but would show him where he visited when he first came to boston the other agreed to the indulgence of this sentiment and they set out to find rumford street together  youve heard of old man hallecklestor neather interest thas placetheres where i stayed his sons my friendamn stuckup supercilious beast he is too i do care fr him ill show you place sost youll know it when you come to itf i can ever find it  they walked up and down the street looking while bartley poured his sorrows into the ear of his friend who grew less and less responsive and at last ceased from his side altogether bartley then dimly perceived that he was himself sitting on a doorstep and that his head was hanging far down between his knees as if he had been sleeping in that posture  locked outlocked out of my own door and by my own wife he shed tears and fell asleep again from time to time he woke and bewailed himself to ricker as a poor boy who had fought his own way he owned that he had made mistakes as who had not again he was trying to convince squire gaylord that they ought to issue a daily edition of the equity free press and at the same time persuading mr halleck to buy the events for him and let him put it on a paying basis he shivered sighed hiccupped and was dozing off again when henry bird knocked him down and he fell with a cry which at last brought to the door the uneasy sleeper who had been listening to him within and trying to realize his presence catching his voice in waking intervals doubting it drowsing when it ceased and then catching it and losing it again  hello here what do you want hubbard is it you what in the world are you doing here  halleck said bartley who was unsteadily straightening himself upon his feet glad to find you at home been looking for your house all night want to introduce you to particicular friend of mine mr halleck mr  curse me if i know your name  hold on a minute said halleck  he ran into the house for his hat and coat and came out again closing the door softly after him he found bartley in the grip of a policeman whom he was asking his name that he might introduce him to his friend halleck  do you know this man mr halleck asked the policeman  yesyes i know him said ben in a low voice lets get him away quietly please hes all right its the first time i ever saw him so will you help me with him up to johnsons stable ill get a carriage there and take him home  they had begun walking bartley along between them he dozed and paid no attention to their talk  the policeman laughed i was just going to run him in when you came out you didnt come a minute too soon  they got bartley to the stable and he slept heavily in one of the chairs in the office while the ostlers were putting the horses to the carriage the policeman remained at the officedoor looking in at bartley and philosophizing the situation to halleck your speakin about its bein the first time you ever saw him so made me think t i rather help take home a regular habitual drunk to his family any day than a case like this they always seem to take it so much harder the first time boards with his mother i presume  hes married said halleck sadly he has a house of his own  well said the policeman  bartley slept all the way to clover street and when the carriage stopped at his door they had difficulty in waking him sufficiently to get him out  dont come in please said halleck to the policeman when this was done the man will carry you back to your beat thank you ever so much  all right mr halleck dont mention it said the policeman and leaned back in the hack with an air of luxury as it rumbled softly away  halleck remained on the pavement with bartley falling limply against him in the dim light of the dawn what you want what you doing with me he demanded with sullen stupidity  ive got you home hubbard here we are at your house he pulled him across the pavement to the threshold and put his hand on the bell but the door was thrown open before he could ring and marcia stood there with her face white and her eyes red with watching and crying  oh bartley oh bartley she sobbed oh mr halleck what is it is he hurt i did ityes i did it its my fault oh will he die is he sick  he isnt very well hed better go to bed said halleck  yes yes i will help you upstairs with him  do need any help said bartley sulkily go upstairs myself  he actually did so with the help of the handrail marcia running before to open the door and smooth the pillows which her head had not touched and halleck following him to catch him if he should fall she unlaced his shoes and got them off while halleck removed his coat  oh bartley where do you feel badly dear oh i what shall i do she moaned as he tumbled himself on the bed and lapsed into a drunken stupor  betterbetter come out mrs hubbard said halleck better let him alone now you only make him worse talking to him  quelled by the mystery of his manner she followed him out and down the stairs oh do tell me what it is she implored in a low voice or i shall go wild but tell me and i can bear it i can bear anything if i know what it is she came close to him in her entreaty and fixed her eyes beseechingly on his while she caught his hand in both of hers is heis he insane  he isnt quite in his right mind mrs hubbard halleck began softly releasing himself and retreating a little from her but she pursued him and put her hand on his arm  oh then go for the doctorgo instantly dont lose a minute i shall not be afraid to stay alone or if you think id better not i will go for the doctor myself  no no said halleck smiling sadly the case certainly had its ludicrous side he doesnt need a doctor you mustnt think of calling a doctor indeed you mustnt hell come out all right of himself if you sent for a doctor it would make him very angry  she burst into tears well i will do what you say she cried it would never have happened if it hadnt been for me i want to tell you what i did she went on wildly i want to tell  please dont tell me anything mrs hubbard it will all come rightand very soon it isnt anything to be alarmed about hell be well in a few hours iahgood by he had found his cane and he made a limp toward the door but she swiftly interposed herself  why she panted in mixed reproach and terror youre not going away youre not going to leave me before bartley is well he may get worsehe may die you mustnt go mr halleck  yes i musti cant stayi oughtnt to stayit wont do he wont get worse he wont die the perspiration broke out on hallecks face which he lifted to hers with a distress as great as her own  she only answered i cant let you go it would kill me i wonder at your wanting to go  there was something ghastly comical in it all and halleck stood in fear of its absurdity hardly less than of its tragedy he rapidly revolved in his mind the possibilities of the case he thought at first that it might be well to call a doctor and having explained the situation to him pay him to remain in charge but he reflected that it would be insulting to ask a doctor to see a man in hubbards condition he took out his watch and saw that it was six oclock and he said desperately you can send for me if you get anxious  i cant let you go  i must really get my breakfast  the girl will get something for you here oh dont go away her lip began to quiver again and her bosom to rise  he could not bear it mrs hubbard will you believe what i say  yes she faltered reluctantly  well i tell you that mr hubbard is in no sort of danger and i know that it would be extremely offensive to him if i stayed  then you must go she answered promptly and opened the door which she had closed for fear he might escape i will send for a doctor  no dont send for a doctor dont send for anybody dont speak of the matter to any one it would be very mortifying to him its merely aakind ofseizure that a great many peoplemenare subject to but he wouldnt like to have it known he saw that his words were making an impression upon her perhaps her innocence was beginning to divine the truth will you do what i say  yes she murmured  her head began to droop and her face to turn away in a dawning shame too cruel for him to see  ii will come back as soon as i get my breakfast to make sure that everything is right  she let him find his own way out and halleck issued upon the street as miserable as if the disgrace were his own it was easy enough for him to get back into his own room without alarming the family he ate his breakfast absently and then went out while the others were still at table  i dont think ben seems very well said his mother anxiously and she looked to her husband for the denial he always gave  oh i guess hes all right whats the matter with him  its nothing but his ridiculous romantic way of taking the world to heart olive interposed you may be sure hes troubled about something that doesnt concern him in the least its what comes of the lifelong conscientiousness of his parents if ben doesnt turn out a philanthropist of the deepest dye yet youll have me to thank for it i see more and more every day that i was providentially born wicked so as to keep this besottedly righteous familys head above water  she feigned an angry impatience with the condition of things but when her father went out she joined her mother in earnest conjectures as to what ben had on his mind  halleck wandered about till nearly ten oclock and then he went to the little house on clover street the servantgirl answered his ring and when he asked for mrs hubbard she said that mr hubbard wished to see him and please would he step upstairs  he found bartley seated at the window with a wet towel round his head and his face pale with headache  well old man he said with an assumption of comradery that was nauseous to halleck youve done the handsome thing by me i know all about it i knew something about it all the time he held out his hand without rising and halleck forced himself to touch it i appreciate your delicacy in not telling my wife of course you couldnt tell he said with depraved enjoyment of what he conceived of hallecks embarrassment but i guess she must have smelt a rat as the fellow says he added seeing the disgust that halleck could not keep out of his face i shall make a clean breast of it as soon as she can bear it shes pretty highstrung lying down now he explained you see i went out to get something to make me sleep and the first thing i knew i had got too much good thing i turned up on your doorstep might have been waltzing into the police court about now how did you happen to hear me  halleck briefly explained with an air of abhorrence for the facts  yes i remember most of it said bartley well i want to thank you halleck youve saved me from disgracefrom ruin for all i know whew how my head aches he said making an appeal to hallecks pity with closed eyes halleck he murmured feebly i wish you would do me a favor  yes what is it asked halleck dryly  go round to the events office and tell old witherby that i shant be able to put in an appearance today im not up to writing a note even and hed feel flattered at your coming personally it would make it all right for me  of course i will go said halleck  thanks returned bartley plaintively with his eyes closed     xxvi   bartley would willingly have passed this affair over with marcia like some of their quarrels and allowed a reconciliation to effect itself through mere lapse of time and daily custom but there were difficulties in the way to such an end his shameful escapade had given the quarrel a character of its own which could not be ignored he must keep his word about making a clean breast of it to marcia whether he liked or not but she facilitated his confession by the meek and dependent fashion in which she hovered about anxious to do something or anything for him if as he suggested to halleck she had divined the truth she evidently did not hold him wholly to blame for what had happened and he was not without a selfrighteous sense of having given her a useful and necessary lesson he was inclined to a severity to which his rasped and shaken nerves contributed when he spoke to her that night as they sat together after tea she had some sewing in her lap little mysteries of soft muslin for the baby which she was edging with lace and her head drooped over her work as if she could not confront him with her swollen eyes  look here marcia he said do you know what was the matter with me this morning  she did not answer in words her hands quivered a moment then she caught up the things out of her lap and sobbed into them the sight unmanned bartley he hated to see any one cryeven his wife to whose tears he was accustomed he dropped down beside her on the sofa and pulled her head over on his shoulder  it was my fault it was my fault bartley she sobbed oh how can i ever get over it  well dont cry dont cry it wasnt altogether your fault returned bartley we were both to blame  no i began it if i hadnt broken my promise about speaking of hannah morrison it never would have happened this was so true that bartley could not gainsay it but i couldnt seem to help it and you wereyou wereso quick with me you didnt give me time to think youbut i was the one to blame i was to blame  oh well never mind about it dont take on so coaxed bartley its all over now and it cant be helped and i can promise you he added that it shall never happen again no matter what you do and in making this promise he felt the glow of virtuous performance i think weve both had a lesson i suppose he continued sadly as one might from impersonal reflection upon the temptations and depravity of large cities that its common enough i dare say it isnt the first time ben halleck has taken a fellow home in a hack bartley got so much comfort from the conjecture he had thrown out for marcias advantage that he felt a sort of selfapproval in the fact with which he followed it up and theres this consolation about it if there isnt any other that it wouldnt have happened now if it had ever happened before  marcia lifted her head and looked into his face whatwhat do you mean bartley  i mean that i never was overcome before in my life bywine he delicately avoided saying whiskey  well she demanded  why dont you see if id had the habit of drinking i shouldnt have been affected by it  i dont understand she said anxiously  why i knew i shouldnt be able to sleep i was so mad at you  oh  and i dropped into the hotel barroom for a nightcapfor something to make me sleep  yes yes she urged eagerly  i took what wouldnt have touched a man that was in the habit of it  poor bartley  and the first thing i knew i had got too much i was drunkwild drunk he said with magnanimous frankness  she had been listening intensely exculpating him at every point and now his innocence all flashed upon her i see i see she cried and it was because you had never tasted it before  well i had tasted it once or twice interrupted bartley with heroic veracity  no matter it was because you had never more than hardly tasted it that a very little overcame you in an instant i see she repeated contemplating him in her ecstasy as the one habitually sober man in a boston full of inebriates and now i shall never regret it i shall never care for it i never shall think about it again or yes i shall always remember it because it showsbecause it proves that you are always strictly temperance it was worth happening for that i am glad it happened  she rose from his side and took her sewing nearer the lamp and resumed her work upon it with shining eyes  bartley remained in his place on the sofa feeling and perhaps looking rather sheepish he had made a clean breast of it and the confession had redounded only too much to his credit to do him justice he had not intended to bring the affair to quite such a triumphant conclusion and perhaps something better than his sense of humor was also touched when he found himself not only exonerated but transformed into an exemplar of abstinence  well he said it isnt exactly a thing to be glad of but it certainly isnt a thing to worry yourself about you know the worst of it and you know the best of it it never happened before and it never shall happen again thats all dont lament over it dont accuse yourself just let it go and well both see what we can do after this in the way of behaving better  he rose from the sofa and began to walk about the room  does your head still ache she asked fondly i wish i could do something for it  oh i shall sleep it off returned bartley  she followed him with her eyes bartley  well  do you supposedo you believethat mr halleckthat he was ever  no marcia i dont said bartley stopping i know he never was ben halleck is slow but hes good i couldnt imagine his being drunk any more than i could imagine your being so id willingly sacrifice his reputation to console you added bartley with a comical sense of his own regret that halleck was not for the occasion an habitual drunkard but i cannot tell a lie he looked at her with a smile and broke into a sudden laugh no my dear the only person i think of just now as having suffered similarly with myself is the great and good andrew johnson did you ever hear of him  was he the one they impeached she faltered not knowing what bartley would be at but smiling faintly in sympathy with his mirth  he was the one they impeached he was the one who was overcome by wine on his inauguration day because he had never been overcome before its a parallel case bartley got a great deal more enjoyment out of the parallel case than marcia the smile faded from her face  come come he coaxed be satisfied with andrew johnson and let halleck go ah marcia he added seriously ben halleck is the kind of man you ought to have married dont you suppose that i know im not good enough for you im pretty good by fits and starts but he would have been good right straight along i should never have had to bring him home in a hack to you  his generous admission had the just effect hush bartley dont talk so you know that youre better for me than the best man in the world dear and even if you were not i should love you the best dont talk please that way of any one else or it will make me hate you  he liked that and after all he was not without an obscure pride in his last nights adventure as a somewhat hazardous but decided assertion of manly supremacy it was not a thing to be repeated but for once in a way it was not wholly to be regretted especially as he was so well out of it  he pulled up a chair in front of her and began to joke about the things she had in her lap and the shameful and sorrowful day ended in the bliss of a more perfect peace between them than they had known since the troubles of their married life began i tell you said bartley to marcia i shall stick to tivoli after this religiously  it was several weeks later that halleck limped into athertons lodgings and dropped into one of his friends easychairs the room had a bachelor comfort of aspect and the shaded lamp on the table shed a mellow light on the green leathercovered furniture wrinkled and creased and worn full of such hospitable hollows as that which welcomed halleck some packages of law papers were scattered about on the table but the hour of the night had come when a lawyer permits himself a novel atherton looked up from his as halleck entered and stretched out a hand which the latter took on his way to the easychair across the table  how do you do said atherton after allowing him to sit for a certain time in the silence which expressed better than words the familiarity that existed between them in spite of the lawyers six or seven years of seniority  halleck leaned forward and tapped the floor with his stick then he fell back again and laid his cane across the arms of his chair and drew a long breath atherton he said if you had found a blackguard of your acquaintance drunk on your doorstep early one morning and had taken him home to his wife how would you have expected her to treat you the next time you saw her  the lawyer was too much used to the statement direct and hypothetical of all sorts of cases to be startled at this he smiled slightly and said that would depend a good deal upon the lady  oh but generalize from what you know of women as woman what should you expect shouldnt you expect her to make you pay somehow for your privity to her disgrace to revenge her misery upon you isnt there a theory that women forgive injuries but never ignominies  thats what the novelists teach and we bachelors get most of our doctrine about women from them he closed his novel on the papercutter and laying the book upon the table clasped his hands together at the back of his head we dont go to nature for our impressions but neither do the novelists for that matter now and then however in the way of business i get a glimpse of realities that make me doubt my prophets who had this experience  i did  im sorry for that said atherton  yes returned halleck with whimsical melancholy im not particularly adapted for it but i dont know that it would be a very pleasant experience for anybody  he paused drearily and atherton said and how did she actually treat you  i hardly know i hadnt been at the pains to look them up since the thing happened and i had been carrying their squalid secret round for a fortnight and suffering from it as if it were all my own  atherton smiled at the touch of selfcharacterization  when i met her and her husband and her baby todaya family partywell she made me ashamed of the melodramatic compassion i had been feeling for her it seemed that i had been going about unnecessarily not to say impertinently haggard with the recollection of her face as i saw it when she opened the door for her blackguard and me that morning she looked as if nothing unusual had happened at our last meeting i couldnt brace up all at once i behaved like a sneak in view of her serenity  perhaps nothing unusual had happened suggested atherton  no that theory isnt tenable said halleck it was the one fact in the blackguards favor that she had evidently never seen him in that state before and didnt know what was the matter she was wild at first she wanted to send for a doctor i think towards the last she began to suspect but i dont know how she looked then i couldnt look at her he stopped as if still in the presence of the pathetic figure with its sidelong drooping head  atherton respected his silence a moment before he again suggested as lightly as before perhaps she is magnanimous  no said halleck with the effect of having also given that theory consideration shes not magnanimous poor soul i fancy she is rather a narrowminded person with strict limitations in regard to people who think illor too wellof her husband  then perhaps said atherton with the air of having exhausted conjecture shes obtuse  i have tried to think that too replied halleck but i cant manage it no there are only two ways out of it the fellow has abused her innocence and made her believe its a common and venial affair to be brought home in that state or else shes playing a part hes capable of telling her that neither you nor i for example ever go to bed sober but she isnt obtuse i fancy shes only too keen in all the sensibilities that women suffer through and id rather think that he had deluded her in that way than that she was masquerading about it or she strikes me as an uncommonly truthful person i suppose you know whom im talking about atherton he said with a sudden look at his friends face across the table  yes i know said the lawyer im sorry its come to this already though i suppose youre not altogether surprised  no something of the kind was to be expected halleck sighed and rolled his cane up and down on the arms of his chair i hope we know the worst  perhaps we do but i recollect a wise remark you made the first time we talked of these people said atherton replying to the mood rather than the speech of his friend you suggested that we rather liked to grieve over the pretty girls that other fellows marry and that we never thought of the plain ones as suffering  oh i hadnt any data for my pity in this case then replied halleck im willing to allow that a plain woman would suffer under the same circumstances and i think i should be capable of pitying her but ill confess that the notion of a pretty womans sorrow is more intolerable theres no use denying a fact so universally recognized by the male consciousness i take my share of shame for it i wonder why it is pretty women always seem to appeal to us as more dependent and childlike i dare say theyre not  some of them are quite able to take care of themselves said atherton ive known striking instances of the kind how do you know but the object of your superfluous pity was cheerful because fate had delivered her husband bound forever into her hand through this little escapade of his  isnt that rather a coarse suggestion asked halleck  very likely i suggest it i dont assert it but i fancy that wives sometimes like a permanent grievance that is always at hand no matter what the mere passing occasion of the particular disagreement is it seems to me that i have detected obscure appeals to such a weapon in domestic interviews at which ive assisted in the way of business  dont atherton cried halleck  dont how in this particular case or in regard to wives generally we cant do women a greater injustice than not to account for a vast deal of human nature in them you may be sure that things havent come to the present pass with those people without blame on both sides  oh do you defend a man for such beastliness by that stale old plea of blame on both sides demanded halleck indignantly  no but i should like to know what she had said or done to provoke it before i excused her altogether  you would imagine the case reversed  it isnt imaginable  you think there is a special code of morals for womensins and shames for them that are no sins and shames for us  no i dont think that i merely suggest that you dont idealize the victim in this instance i dare say she hasnt suffered half as much as you have remember that shes a person of commonplace traditions and probably took a simple view of the matter and let it go as something that could not be helped  no that would not do either said halleck  youre hard to please suppose we imagine her proud enough to face you down on the fact for his sake too proud to revenge her disgrace on you  oh you come back to your old plea of magnanimity atherton it makes me sick at heart to think of that poor creature that look of hers haunts me i cant get rid of it  atherton sat considering his friend with a curious smile well im sorry this has happened to you halleck  oh why do you say that to me demanded halleck impatiently am i a nervous woman that i must be kept from unpleasant sights and disagreeable experiences if theres anything of the man about me you insult it why not be a little sorry for her  im sorry enough for her but i suspect that so far you have been the principal sufferer shes simply accepted the fact and survived it  so much the worse so much the worse groaned halleck shed better have died  well perhaps i dare say she thinks it will never happen again and has dismissed the subject while youve had it happening ever since whenever youve thought of her  halleck struck the arms of his chair with his clinched hands confound the fellow what business has he to come back into my way and make me think about his wife oh very likely its quite as you say i dare say shes stupidly content with him that shes forgiven it and forgotten all about it probably shes told him how i behaved and theyve laughed me over together but does that make it any easier to bear  it ought said atherton what did the husband do when you met them  everything but tip me the winkeverything but say in so many words you see ive made it all right with her dont you wish you knewhow halleck dropped his head with a wrathful groan  i fancy said atherton thoughtfully that if we really knew how it would surprise us married life is as much a mystery to us outsiders as the life to come almost the ordinary motives dont seem to count its the realm of unreason if a man only makes his wife suffer enough she finds out that she loves him so much she must forgive him and then theres a great deal in their being bound they cant live together in enmity and they must live together i dare say the offence had merely worn itself out between them  oh i dare say halleck assented wearily that isnt my idea of marriage though  its not mine either returned atherton the question is whether it isnt often the fact in regard to such peoples marriages  then they are so many hells cried halleck where selfrespect perishes with resentment and the husband and wife are enslaved to each other they ought to be broken up  i dont think so said atherton soberly the sort of men and women that marriage enslaves would be vastly more wretched and mischievous if they were set free i believe that the hell people make for themselves isnt at all a bad place for them its the best place for them  oh i know your doctrine said halleck rising its horrible how a man with any kindness in his heart can harbor such a coldblooded philosophy i dont understand i wish you joy of it good night he added gloomily taking his hat from the table it serves me right for coming to you with a matter that i ought to have been man enough to keep to myself  atherton followed him toward the door it wont do you any harm to consider your perplexity in the light of my philosophy an unhappy marriage isnt the only hell nor the worst  halleck turned what could be a worse hell than marriage without love he demanded fiercely  love without marriage said atherton  halleck looked sharply at his friend then he shrugged his shoulders as he turned again and swung out of the door youre too esoteric for me its quite time i was gone  the way through clover street was not the shortest way home but he climbed the hill and passed the little house he wished to rehabilitate in its pathetic beauty the image which his friends conjectures had jarred distorted insulted and he lingered for a moment before the door where this vision had claimed his pity for anguish that no after serenity could repudiate the silence in which the house was wrapped was like another fold of the mystery which involved him the night wind rose in a sudden gust and made the neighboring lamp flare and his shadow wavered across the pavement like the figure of a drunken man this and not that other was the image which he saw     xxvii   of course said marcia when she and bartley recurred to the subject of her visit to equity i have always felt as if i should like to have you with me so as to keep people from talking and show that its all right between you and father but if you dont wish to go i cant ask it  i understand what you mean and i should like to gratify you said bartley not that i care a rap what all the people in equity think ill tell you what ill do ill go down there with you and hang round a day or two and then ill come after you when your times up and stay a day or two there i couldnt stand three weeks in equity  in the end he behaved very handsomely he dressed flavia out to kill as he said in lace hoods and embroidered longclothes for which he tossed over half the readymade stock of the great drygoods stores and he made marcia get herself a new suit throughout with a bonnet to match which she thought she could not afford but he said he should manage it somehow in equity he spared no pains to deepen the impression of his success in boston and he was affable with everybody he hailed his friends across the street waving his hand to them and shouting out a jolly greeting he visited the hotel office and the stores to meet the loungers there he stepped into the printingoffice and congratulated henry bird on having stopped the free press and devoted himself to jobwork he said hello marilla hello hannah and he stood a good while beside the latter at her case joking and laughing he had no resentments he stopped old morrison on the street and shook hands with him well mr morrison do you find it as easy to get hannahs wages advanced nowadays as you used to  as for his relations with squire gaylord he flattened public conjecture out like a pancake as he told marcia by making the old gentleman walk armandarm with him the whole length of the village street the morning after his arrival and i never saw your honored father look as if he enjoyed a thing less added bartley well whats the use he couldnt help himself they had arrived on friday evening and after spending saturday in this social way bartley magnanimously went with marcia to church he was in good spirits and he shook hands right and left as he came out of church in the afternoon he had up the best team from the hotel stable and took marcia the long drive which they had taken the day of their engagement he could not be contented without pushing the perambulator out after tea and making marcia walk beside it to let people see them with the baby  he went away the next morning on an early train after a parting which he made very cheery and a promise to come down again as soon as he could manage it marcia watched him drive off toward the station in the hotel barge and then she went upstairs to their room where she had been so long a young girl and where now their child lay sleeping the little one seemed the least part of all the change that had taken place in this room she used to sit and think of him she used to fly up thither when he came unexpectedly and order her hair or change a ribbon of her dress that she might please him better at these windows she used to sit and watch and long for his coming from these she saw him go by that day when she thought she should see him no more and took heart of her despair to risk the wild chance that made him hers there was a deadly unsympathetic stillness in the room which seemed to leave to her all the responsibility for what she had done  the days began to go by in a sunny still midsummer monotony she pushed the baby out in its carriage and saw the summer boarders walking or driving through the streets she returned the visits that the neighbors paid her indoors she helped her mother about the housework an image of her maiden life reinstated itself at times it seemed almost as if she had dreamed her marriage when she looked at her baby in these moods she thought she was dreaming yet a young wife suddenly parted for the first time from her husband in whose intense possession she has lost her individual existence and devolving upon her old separate personality must have strong fancies strange sensations marcias marriage had been full of such shocks and storms as might well have left her dazed in their entire cessation  she seems to be pretty well satisfied here said her father one evening when she had gone upstairs with her sleeping baby in her arms  she seems to be pretty quiet her mother noncommittally assented  myes snarled the squire and he fell into a long revery while mrs gaylord went on crocheting the baby a bib and the smell of the petuniabed under the window came in through the mosquito netting myes he resumed i guess youre right i guess its only quiet i guess she aint any more likely to be satisfied than the rest of us  i dont see why she shouldnt be said mrs gaylord resenting the compassion in the squires tone with that curious jealousy a wife feels for her husbands indulgence of their daughter shes had her way  shes had her way poor girlyes but i dont know as it satisfies people to have their way always  doubtless mrs gaylord saw that her husband wished to talk about marcia and must be helped to do so by a little perverseness i dont know but what most of folks would say t shed made out pretty well i guess shes got a good provider  she didnt need any provider said the squire haughtily  no but so long as she would have something its well enough that she should have a provider mrs gaylord felt that this was reasoning and she smoothed out so much of the bib as she had crocheted across her knees with an air of selfcontent you cant have everything in a husband she added and marcia ought to know that by this time  ive no doubt she knows it said the squire  why what makes you think shes disappointed any mrs gaylord came plump to the question at last  nothing she ever said returned her husband promptly shed die first when i was up there i thought she talked about him too much to be feeling just right about him it was bartley this and bartley that the whole while she was always wanting me to say that i thought she had done right to marry him i did sort of say it at lastto please her but i kept thinking that if she felt sure of it she wouldnt want to talk it into me so now she never mentions him at all if she can help it she writes to him every day and she hears from him often enoughpostals mostly but she dont talk about bartley bartley the squire stretched his lips back from his teeth and inhaled a long breath as he rubbed his chin  you dont suppose anythings happened since you was up there said mrs gaylord  nothing but whats happened from the start hes happened he keeps happening right along i guess  mrs gaylord found herself upon the point of experiencing a painful emotion of sympathy but she saved herself by saying well mr gaylord i dont know as youve got anybody but yourself to thank for it all you got him here in the first place she took one of the kerosene lamps from the table and went upstairs leaving him to follow at his will  marcia sometimes went out to the squires office in the morning carrying her baby with her and propping her with lawbooks on a newspaper in the middle of the floor while she dusted the shelves or sat down for one of the desultory talks in the satisfactory silences which she had with her father  he usually found her there when he came up from the postoffice with the morning mail in the top of his hat the last evenings eventswhich bartley had said must pass for a letter from him when he did not writeand a letter or a postal card from him she read these and gave her lather any news or message that bartley sent and then she sat down at his table to answer them but one morning after she had been at home nearly a month she received a letter for which she postponed bartleys postal its from olive halleck she said with a glance at the handwriting on the envelope and she tore it open and ran it through yes and theyll come here any time i let them know theyve been at niagara and theyve come down the st lawrence to quebec and they will be at north conway the last of next week now father i want to do something for them she cried feeling an american daughters right to dispose of her father and all his possessions for the behoof of her friends at any time i want they should come to the house  well i guess there wont be any trouble about that if you think they can put up with our way of living he smiled at her over his spectacles  our way of living put up with it i should hope as much theyre just the kind of people that will put up with anything because theyve had everything and because theyre all as sweet and good as they can be you dont know them father you dont half know them now just get right awayshe pushed him out of the chair he had taken at the tableand let me write to bartley this instant hes got to come when theyre here and ill invite them to come over at once before they get settled at north conway  he gave his dry chuckle to see her so fired with pleasure and he enjoyed the ardor with which she drove him up out of his chair and dashed off her letters this was her old way he would have liked the prospect of the hallecks coming because it made his girl so happy if for nothing else  father i will tell you about ben halleck she said pounding her letter to olive with the thick of her hand to make the envelope stick you know that lameness of his  yes  well it came from his being thrown down by another boy when he was at school he knew the boy that did it and the boy must have known that mr halleck knew it but he never said a word to show that he was sorry or did anything to make up for it hes a man now and lives there in boston and ben halleck often meets him he says that if the man can stand it he can dont you think thats grand when i heard that i made up my mind that i wanted flavia to belong to ben hallecks churchor the church he did belong to he doesnt belong to any now  he couldnt have got any damages for such a thing anyway the squire said  marcia paid no heed to this legal opinion of the case she took off her fathers hat to put the letters into it and replacing it on his head now dont you forget them father she cried  she gathered up her baby and hurried into the house where she began her preparations for her guests  the elder miss hallecks had announced with much love through olive that they should not be able to come to equity and ben was to bring olive alone marcia decided that ben should have the guestchamber and olive should have her room she and bartley could take the little room in the l while their guests remained  but when the hallecks came it appeared that ben had engaged quarters for himself at the hotel and no expostulation would prevail with him to come to squire gaylords house  we have to humor him in such things mrs hubbard olive explained to marcias distress and most people get on very well without him  this explanation was of course given in hallecks presence his sister added behind his back ben has a perfectly morbid dread of giving trouble in a house he wont let us do anything to make him comfortable at home and the idea that you should attempt it drove him distracted you mustnt mind it i dont believe hed have come if his bachelor freedom couldnt have been respected and we both wanted to come very much  the hallecks arrived in the forenoon and bartley was due in the evening but during the afternoon marcia had a telegram saying that he could not come till two days later and asking her to postpone the picnic she had planned the hallecks were only going to stay three days and the suspicion that bartley had delayed in order to leave himself as little time as possible with them rankled in her heart so that she could not keep it to herself when they met  was that what made you give me such a cool reception he asked with cynical goodnature well youre mistaken i dont suppose i mind the hallecks any more than they do me ill tell you why i stayed some people dropped down on witherby who were a little out of his linefashionable people that he had asked to let him know if they ever came to boston and when they did come and let him know he didnt know what to do about it and he called on me to help him out ive been almost boarding with witherby for the last three days and ive been barouching round all over the moral vineyard with his friends out to mount auburn and the washington elm and bunker hill and brookline and the art museum and lexington weve been down the harbor and we havent left a monumental stone unturned they were going north and they came down here with me and i got them to stop over a day for the picnic  you got them to stop over for the picnic why i dont want anybody but ourselves bartley this spoils everything  the hallecks are not ourselves said bartley and these are jolly people theyll help to make it go off  who are they asked marcia with provisional selfcontrol  oh some people that witherby met in portland at willetts who used to have the loggingcamp out here  that montreal woman cried marcia with fatal divination  bartley laughed yes mrs macallister and her husband shes a regular case shell amuse you  marcias passionate eyes blazed she shall never come to my picnic in the world  no bartley looked at her in a certain way she shall come to mine then there will be two picnics the more the merrier  marcia gasped as if she felt the clutch in which her husband had her tightening on her heart she said that she could only carry her point against him at the cost of disgraceful division before the hallecks for which he would not care in the least she moved her head a little from side to side like one that breathes a stifling air oh let her come she said quietly at last  now youre talking business said bartley i havent forgotten the little snub mrs macallister gave me and youll see me pay her off  marcia made no answer but went downstairs to put what face she could upon the matter to olive whom she had left alone in the parlor while she ran up with bartley immediately upon his arrival to demand an explanation of him in her wrathful haste she had forgotten to kiss him and she now remembered that he had not looked at the baby which she had all the time had in her arms  the picnic was to be in a pretty glen three or four miles north of the village where there was shade on a bit of level green and a spring bubbling out of a fernhung bluff from which you looked down the glen over a stretch of the river marcia had planned that they were to drive thither in a fourseated carryall but the addition of bartleys guests disarranged this  theres only one way said mrs macallister who had driven up with her husband from the hotel to the squires house in a buggy mr halleck tells me he doesnt know how to drive and my husband doesnt know the way mr hubbard must get in here with me and you must take mr macallister in your party she looked authoritatively at the others  first rate cried bartley climbing to the seat which mr macallister left vacant well lead the way  those who followed had difficulty in keeping their buggy in sight sometimes bartley stopped long enough for them to come up and then after a word or two of gay banter was off again  they had taken possession of the picnic grounds and mrs macallister was disposing shawls for rugs and drapery while bartley who had got the horse out and tethered where he could graze was pushing the buggy out of the way by the shafts when the carryall came up  dont we look quite domestic she asked of the arriving company in her neat english tone and her rising english inflection you know i like this she added singling halleck out for her remark and making it as if it were brilliant i like being out of doors dont you know but theres one thing i dont like we werent able to get a drop of champagne at that ridiculous hotel they told us they were not allowed to keep intoxicating liquors now i call that jolly stupid you know i dont know whatever we shall do if you havent brought something  i believe this is a famous spring said halleck  how droll you are spring indeed cried mrs macallister is that the way you let your brother make game of people miss halleck she directed a good deal of her rattle at olive she scarcely spoke to marcia but she was nevertheless furtively observant of her mr macallister had his rattle too which after trying it unsatisfactorily upon marcia he plied almost exclusively for olive he made puns he asked conundrums he had all the accomplishments which keep people going in a lively mirthful colonial society and he had the idea that he must pay attentions and promote repartee his wife and he played into each others hands in their jeux desprit and kept olives inquiring boston mind at work in the vain endeavor to account for and to place them socially bartley hung about mrs macallister and was nearly as obedient as her husband he felt that the hallecks disapproved his behavior and that made him enjoy it he was almost rudely negligent of olive  the composition of the party left marcia and halleck necessarily to each other and she accepted this arrangement in a sort of passive seriousness but halleck saw that her thoughts wandered from her talk with him and that her eyes were always turning with painful anxiety to bartley after their lunch which left them with the whole afternoon before them marcia said in a timid effort to resume her best leadership of the affair bartley dont you think they would like to see the view from the devils backbone  would you like to see the view from the devils backbone he asked in turn of mrs macallister  and what is the devils backbone she inquired  its a ridge of rocks on the bluff above here said bartley nodding his head vaguely towards the bank  and how do you get to it asked mrs macallister pointing her pretty chin at him in lifting her head to look  walk  thanks then i shall try to be satisfied with me own backbone said mrs macallister who had that freedom in alluding to her anatomy which marks the superior civilization of great britain and its colonial dependencies  carry you suggested bartley  i dare say youd be very surefooted but id quite enough of donkeys in the hills at home  bartley roared with the resolution of a man who will enjoy a joke at his own expense  marcia turned away and referred her invitation with a glance to olive  i dont believe miss halleck wants to go said mr macallister  i couldnt said olive regretfully ive neither the feet nor the head for climbing over high rocky places  marcia was about to sink down on the grass again from which she had risen in the hopes that her proposition would succeed when bartley called out why dont you show ben the devils backbone the view is worth seeing halleck  would you like to go asked marcia listlessly  yes i should very much said halleck scrambling to his feet if it wont tire you too much  oh no said marcia gently and led the way she kept ahead of him in the climb as she easily could and she answered briefly to all he said when they arrived at the top there is the view she said coldly she waved her hand toward the valley she made a sound in her throat as if she would speak again but her voice died in one broken sob  halleck stood with downcast eyes and trembled he durst not look at her not for what he should see in her face but for what she should see in his the anguish of intelligence the helpless pity he beat the rock at his feet with the ferule of his stick and could not lift his head again when he did she stood turned from him and drying her eyes on her handkerchief their looks met and she trusted her selfbetrayal to him without any attempt at excuse or explanation  i will send hubbard up to help you down said halleck  well she answered sadly  he clambered down the side of the bluff and bartley started to his feet in guilty alarm when he saw him approach whats the matter  nothing but i think you had better help mrs hubbard down the bluff  oh cried mrs macallister a panic how interesting  halleck did not respond he threw himself on the grass and left her to change or pursue the subject as she liked bartley showed more savoirfaire when he came back with marcia after an absence long enough to let her remove the traces of her tears  pretty rough on your game foot halleck but marcia had got it into her head that it wasnt safe to trust you to help her down even after you had helped her up  ben said olive when they were seated in the train the next day why did you send marcias husband up there to her she had the effect of not having rested till she could ask him  she was crying he answered  what do you suppose could have been the matter  what you do she was miserable about his coquetting with that woman  yes i could see that she hated terribly to have her come and that she felt put down by her all the time what kind of person is mrs macallister  oh a fool replied halleck all flirts are fools  i think shes more wicked than foolish  oh no flirts are better than they seemperhaps because men are better than flirts think but they make misery just the same  yes sighed olive poor marcia poor marcia but i suppose that if it were not mrs macallister it would be some one else  given bartley hubbardyes  and given marcia welli dont like being mixed up with other peoples unhappiness ben its dangerous  i dont like it either but you cant very well keep out of peoples unhappiness in this world  no assented olive ruefully  the talk fell and halleck attempted to read a newspaper while olive looked out of the window she presently turned to him did you ever fancy any resemblance between mrs hubbard and the photograph of that girl we used to joke aboutyour lost love  yes said halleck  whats become of itthe photograph i cant find it any more i wanted to show it to her one day  i destroyed it i burnt it the first evening after i had met mrs hubbard it seemed to me that it wasnt right to keep it  why you dont think it was her photograph  i think it was said halleck he took up his paper again and read on till they left the cars  that evening when halleck came to his sisters room to bid her good night she threw her arms round his neck and kissed his plain common face in which she saw a heavenly beauty  ben dear she said if you dont turn out the happiest man in the world i shall say theres no use in being good  perhaps youd better say that after all i wasnt good he suggested with a melancholy smile  i shall know better she retorted  why whats the matter now  nothing i was only thinking good night  good night said halleck you seem to think my room is better than my company good as i am  yes she said laughing in that breathless way which means weeping next with women her eyes glistened  well said halleck limping out of the room youre quite goodlooking with your hair down olive  all girls are she answered she leaned out of her doorway to watch him as he limped down the corridor to his own room there was something pathetic something disappointed and weary in the movement of his figure and when she shut her door and ran back to her mirror she could not see the goodlooking girl there for her tears     xxviii   hello said bartley one day after the autumn had brought back all the summer wanderers to the city i havent seen you for a month of sundays he had ricker by the hand and he pulled him into a doorway to be a little out of the rush on the crowded pavement while they chatted  thats because i cant afford to go to the white mountains and swell round at the aristocratic summer resorts like some people returned ricker im a hornyhanded son of toil myself  pshaw said bartley who isnt ive been here hard at it except for three days at one time and live at another  well all i can say is that i saw in the record personals that mr hubbard of the events was spending the summer months with his fatherinlaw judge gaylord among the spurs of the white mountains i supposed you wrote it yourself youre full of ideas about journalism  oh come i wouldnt work that joke any more look here ricker ill tell you what i want i want you to dine with me  dines people said ricker in an awestricken aside  noi mean business you ve never seen my kid yet and youve never seen my house i want you to come weve all got back and were in nice running order what day are you disengaged  let me see said ricker thoughtfully so many engagements wait i could squeeze your dinner in some time next month hubbard  all right but suppose we say next sunday six is the hour  six oh i cant dine in the middle of the forenoon that way make it later  well well say one pm then i know your dinner hour we shall expect you  better not till i come bartley knew that this was rickers way of accepting and he said nothing but he answered his next question with easy joviality how are you making it with old witherby  oh hand over hand witherby and i were formed for each other by by  no hold on why dont you come to the club any more  weell the club isnt what it used to be said bartley confidentially  why of course it isnt just the thing for a gentleman moving in the select circles of clover street as you do but why not come sometimes in the character of distinguished guest and encourage your humble friends i was talking with a lot of the fellows about you the other night  were they abusing me  they were speaking the truth about you and i stopped them i told them that sort of thing wouldnt do why youre getting fat  youre behind the times kicker said bartley i began to get fat six months ago i dont wonder the chronicle abstract is running down on your hands come round and try my tivoli on sunday thats what gives a man girth my boy he tapped ricker lightly on his hollow waistcoat and left him with a wave of his hand  ricker leaned out of the doorway and followed him down the street with a troubled eye he had taken stock in bartley as the saying is and his heart misgave him that he should lose on the investment he could not have sold out to any of their friends for twenty cents on the dollar nothing that any one could lay his finger on had happened and yet there had been a general loss of confidence in that particular stock ricker himself had lost confidence in it and when he lightly mentioned that talk at the club with a lot of the fellows he had a serious wish to get at bartley some time and see what it was that was beginning to make people mistrust him the fellows who liked him at first and wished him well and believed in his talent had mostly dropped him bartleys associates were now the most raffish set on the press or the green hands and something had brought this to pass in less than two years ricker had believed that it was witherby at the club he had contended that it was bartleys association with witherby that made people doubtful of him as for those ideas that bartley had advanced in their discussion of journalism he had considered it all mere young mans nonsense that bartley would outgrow but now as he looked at bartleys back he had his misgivings it struck him as the back of a degenerate man and that increasing bulk seemed not to represent an increase of wholesome substance but a corky buoyant tissue materially responsive to some sort of moral dryrot  bartley pushed on to the events office in a blithe humor witherby had recently advanced his salary he was giving him fifty dollars a week now and bartley had made himself necessary in more ways than one he was not only readily serviceable but since he had volunteered to write those advertising articles for an advance of pay he was in possession of business facts that could be made very uncomfortable to witherby in the event of a disagreement witherby not only paid him well but treated him well he even suffered bartley to bully him a little and let him foresee the day when he must be recognized as the real editor of the events  at home everything went on smoothly the baby was well and growing fast she was beginning to explode airy bubbles on her pretty lips that a fond superstition might interpret as papa and mamma she had passed that stage in which a man regards his child with despair she had passed out of slippery and evasive doughiness into a firm tangibility that made it some pleasure to hold her  bartley liked to take her on his lap to feel the spring of her little legs as she tried to rise on her feet he liked to have her stretch out her arms to him from her mothers embrace the innocent tenderness which he experienced at these moments was satisfactory proof to him that he was a very good fellow if not a good man when he spent an evening at home with flavia in his lap for half an hour after dinner he felt so domestic that he seemed to himself to be spending all his evenings at home now once or twice it had happened when the housemaid was out that he went to the door with the baby on his arm and answered the ring of olive and ben halleck or of olive and one or both of the intermediary sisters  the hallecks were the only people at all apt to call in the evening and bartley ran so little chance of meeting any one else when he opened the door with flavia on his arm that probably he would not have thought it worth while to put her down even if he had not rather enjoyed meeting them in that domestic phase he had not only long felt how intensely olive disliked him but he had observed that somehow it embarrassed ben halleck to see him in his character of devoted young father at those times he used to rally his old friend upon getting married and laughed at the confusion to which the joke put him he said more than once afterwards that he did not see what fun ben halleck got out of coming there it must bore even such a dull fellow as he was to sit a whole evening like that and not say twenty words perhaps hes livelier when im not here though he suggested i always did seem to throw a wet blanket on ben halleck he did not at all begrudge hallecks having a better time in his absence if he could  one night when the bell rung bartley rose and saying i wonder which of the tribe it is this time went to the door but when he opened it instead of hearing the wellknown voices marcia listened through a hesitating silence which ended in a loud laugh from without and a cry from her husband of well i swear why you infamous old scoundrel come in out of the wet there ensued amidst bartleys voluble greetings a noise of shy shuffling about in the hall as of a man not perfectly master of his footing under social pressure a sound of husky embarrassed whispering a dispute about doffing an overcoat and question as to the disposition of a hat and then bartley reappeared driving before him the lank long figure of a man who blinked in the flash of gaslight as bartley turned it all up in the chandelier overhead and rubbed his immense hands in cruel embarrassment at the beauty of marcia set like a jewel in the pretty comfort of the little parlor  mr kinney mrs hubbard said bartley and having accomplished the introduction he hit kinney a thwack between the shoulders with the flat of his hand that drove him stumbling across marcias footstool into the seat on the sofa to which she had pointed him you old fool where did you come from  the refined warmth of bartleys welcome seemed to make kinney feel at home in spite of his trepidations at marcias presence he bobbed his head forward and stretched his mouth wide in one of his vast silent laughs better ask where im goin to  well ill ask that if itll be any accommodation where you going  illinois  for a divorce  try again  to get married  maybe after ive made my pile kinneys eyes wandered about the room and took in its evidences of prosperity with simple unenvious admiration he ended with a furtive glimpse of marcia who seemed to be a climax of good luck too dazzling for contemplation he withdrew his glance from her as if hurt by her splendor and became serious  well youre the last man i ever expected to see again said bartley sitting down with the baby in his lap and contemplating kinney with deliberation kinney was dressed in a long frockcoat of cheap diagonals black cassimere pantaloons a blue necktie and a celluloid collar he had evidently had one of his encounters with a cheap clothier in which the jew had triumphed but he had not yet visited a barber and his hair and beard were as shaggy as they were in the loggingcamp his hands and face were as brown as leather but im as glad bartley added as if you had telegraphed you were coming of course youre going to put up with us he had observed kinneys awe of marcia and he added this touch to let kinney see that he was master in his house and lord even of that radiant presence  kinney started in real distress oh no i couldnt do it ive got all my things round at the quincy house  trunk or bag asked bartley  well its a bag but  all right well step round and get it together i generally take a little stroll out after dinner said bartley tranquilly  kinney was beginning again when marcia who had been stealing some covert looks at him under her eye lashes while she put together the sewing she was at work on preparatory to going upstairs with the baby joined bartley in his invitation  you wont make us the least trouble mr kinney she said the guestchamber is all ready and we shall be glad to have you stay  kinney must have felt the note of sincerity in her words he hesitated and bartley clinched his tacit assent with a quotation the chief ornament of a house is the guests who frequent it who says that  kinneys little blue eyes twinkled old emerson  well i agree with him we dont care anything about your company kinney but we want you for decorative purposes  kinney opened his mouth for another noiseless laugh and said well fix it to suit yourselves  ill carry her up for you said bartley to marcia who was stooping forward to take the baby from him if mr kinney will excuse us a moment  all right said kinney  bartley ventured upon this bold move because he had found that it was always best to have things out with marcia at once and if she was going to take his hospitality to kinney in bad part he wanted to get through the trouble that was very nice of you marcia he said when they were in their own room my invitation rather slipped out and i didnt know how you would like it  oh im very glad to have him stay i never forget about his wanting to lend you money that time said marcia opening the babys crib  youre a mighty good fellow marcia cried bartley kissing her over the top of the babys head as she took it from him and im not half good enough for you you never forget a benefit nor an injury either he added with a laugh and im afraid that i forget one about as easily as the other  marcias eyes suffused themselves at this touch of selfanalysis which coming from bartley had its sadness but she said nothing and he was eager to escape and get back to their guest he told her he should go out with kinney and that she was not to sit up for they might be out late  in his pride he took kinney down to the events office and unlocked it and lit the gas so as to show him the editorial rooms and then he passed him into one of the theatres where they saw part of an offenbach opera after that they went to the parker house and had a new york stew kinney said he must be off by the sundaynight train and bartley thought it well to concentrate as many dazzling effects upon him as he could in the single evening at his disposal he only regretted that it was not the club night for he would have liked to take kinney round and show him some of the fellows  but never mind he said im going to have one of them dine with us tomorrow and youll see about the best of the lot  well sir observed kinney when they had got back into bartleys parlor and he was again drinking in its prettiness in the subdued light of the shaded argand burner i haint seen anything yet that suits me much better than this  it isnt bad said bartley he had got up a plate of crackers and two bottles of tivoli and was opening the first he offered the beaded goblet to kinney  thank you said kinney not any i never do  bartley quaffed half of it in tolerant content i always do find it takes my nerves down at the end of a hard weeks work well now tell me some thing about yourself what are you going to do in illinois  well sir ive got a friend out there thats got a coal mine and he thinks he can work me in somehow i guess he can ive tried pretty much everything why dont you come out there and start a newspaper weve got a town thats bound to grow  it amused bartley to hear kinney bragging already of a town that he had never seen he winked a goodnatured disdain over the rim of the goblet which he tilted on his lips and give up my chances here he said as he set the goblet down  well thats so said kinney responding to the sense of the wink ill tell you what bartley i didnt know as youd speak to me when i rung your bell tonight but thinks i to myself dumn it look here he cant moren slam the door in your face anyway and youve hankered after him so longgo and take your chances you old buzzard and so i got your address at the events office pretty early this morning and i went round all day screwing my courage up as old macbeth saysor ritchloo i dont know which it wasand at last i did get myself so that i toed the mark like a little man  bartley laughed so that he could hardly get the cork out of the second bottle  you see said kinney leaning forward and taking bartleys plump soft knee between his thumb and forefinger i felt awfully about the way we parted that night i felt bad i hadnt acted well just to my own mind and it cut me to have you refuse my money it cut me all the worse because i saw that you was partly right i hadnt been quite fair with you but i always did admire you and you know it some them little things you used to get off in the old free presswell i could see t you was smart and i liked you and it kind o hurt me when i thought youd been makin fun o me to that woman well i could see t i was a dumned old fool afterwards and i always wanted to tell you so and i always did hope that i should be able to offer you that money again twice over and get you to take it just to show that you didnt bear malice bartley looked up with quickened interest but i cant do it now sir added kinney  why whats happened asked bartley in a disappointed tone pouring out his second glass from his second bottle  well sir said kinney with a certain reluctance i undertook to provision the camp on spec last winter andwell you know i always run a little on food for the brainbartley broke into a reminiscent cackle and kinney smiled forlornlyand thinks i dumn it ill give em the real thing every time and i got hold of a healthfood circular and i sent on for a half a dozen barrels of their crackers and half a dozen of their flour and a lot of cracked cocoa and i put the camp on a healthfood basis i calculated to bring those fellows out in the spring physically vigorous and mentally enlightened but my goodness after the first bakin o that flour and the first round o them crackers it was all up fellows got so mad that i suppose if i hadnt gone back to doughnuts and sody biscuits and japan tea theyd a burnt the camp down of course i yielded but it ruined me bartley it bust me  bartley dropped his arms upon the table and hiding his face upon them laughed and laughed again  well sir said kinney with sad satisfaction im glad to see that you dont need any money from me he had been taking another survey of the parlor and the diningroom beyond i dont know as i ever saw anybody much better fixed i should say that you was a success and you deserve it youre a smart fellow bart and youre a good fellow youre a generous fellow kinneys voice shook with emotion  bartley having lifted his wet and flushed face managed to say oh theres nothing mean about me kinney as he felt blindly for the beer bottles which he shook in succession with an evident surprise at finding them empty  youve acted like a brother to me bartley hubbard continued kinney and i shant forget it in a hurry i guess it would about broke my heart if you hadnt taken it just the way you did tonight i should like to see the man that didnt use you well or the woman either said kinney with vague defiance though they dont seem to have done so bad by you he added in recognition of marcias merit i should say that was the biggest part of your luck shes a lady sir every inch of her mighty different stripe from that montreal woman that cut up so that night  oh mrs macallister wasnt such a scamp after all said bartley with magnanimity  well sir you can say so i aint going to be too strict with a girl but i like to see a married woman act like a married woman now i dont think youd catch mrs hubbard flirting with a young fellow the way that woman went on with you that night bartley grinned well sir youre getting along and youre happy  perfect clam said bartley  such a position as youve gotsuch a house such a wife and such a baby well said kinney rising its a little too much for me  want to go to bed asked bartley  yes i guess i better turn in returned kinney despairingly  show you the way  bartley tripped up stairs with kinneys bag which they had left standing in the hall while kinney creaked carefully after him and so led the way to the guestchamber and turned up the gaslight which had been left burning low  kinney stood erect dwarfing the room and looked round on the pink chintzing and soft carpet and white coverleted bed and lacehooded dressingmirror with meek veneration well i swear he said no more but sat hopelessly down and began to pull off his boots  he was in the same humble mood the next morning when having got up inordinately early he was found trying to fix his mind on a newspaper by bartley who came down late to the sunday breakfast and led his guest into the diningroom marcia in a bewitching morninggown was already there having put the daintier touches to the meal herself and the baby in a fresh white dress was there tied into its armchair with a napkin and beating on the table with a spoon bartleys nonchalance amidst all this impressed kinney with a yet more poignant sense of his superiority and almost deprived him of the powers of speech when after breakfast bartley took him out to cambridge on the horsecars and showed him the college buildings and memorial hall and the washington elm and mount auburn kinney fell into such a cowed and broken condition that something had to be specially done to put him in repair against rickers coming to dinner marcia luckily thought of asking him if he would like to see her kitchen in this region kinney found himself at home and praised its neat perfection with professional intelligence bartley followed them round with flavia on his arm and put in a jocose word here and there when he saw kinney about to fall a prey to his respect for marcia and so kept him going till ricker rang he contrived to give ricker a hint of the sort of man he had on his hands and by their joint effort they had kinney talking about himself at dinner before he knew what he was about he could not help talking well upon this theme and he had them so vividly interested as he poured out adventure after adventure in his strange career that bartley began to be proud of him  well sir said ricker when he came to a pause youve lived a romance  yes replied kinney looking at bartley for his approval and ive always thought that if i ever got run clean ashore high and dry id make a stagger to write it out and do something with it do you suppose i could  i promise to take it for the sunday edition of the chronicle abstract whenever you get it ready said ricker  bartley laid his hand on his friends arm its bought up old fellow that narrativeconfessions of an average americanbelongs to the events  they had their laugh at this and then ricker said to kinney but look here my friend whats to prevent our interviewing you on this little personal history of yours and using your material any way we like it seems to me that youve put your head in the lions mouth  oh im amongst gentlemen said kinney with an innocent swagger i understand that  well i dont know about it said ricker hubbard here is used to all sorts of hard names but ive never had that epithet applied to me before  kinney doubled himself up over the side of his chair in recognition of rickers joke and when bartley rose and asked him if he would come into the parlor and have a cigar he said with a wink no he guessed he would stay with the ladies he waited with great mystery till the foldingdoors were closed and bartley had stopped peeping through the crevice between them and then he began to disengage from his watchchain the golden nugget shaped to a rude sphere which hung there this done he asked if he might put it on the little necklacea christening gift from mrs halleckwhich the baby had on to see how it looked it looked very well like an old roman bolla though neither kinney nor marcia knew it guess well let it stay there he suggested timidly  mr kinney cried marcia in amaze i cant let you  oh do now maam pleaded the big fellow simply if you knew how much good it does me you would why its been like heaven to me to get into such a home as this for a dayit has indeed  like heaven said marcia turning pale oh my  well i dont mean any harm what i mean is ive knocked about the world so much and never had any home of my own that to see folks as happy as you be makes me happier than ive been since i dont know when now you let it stay it was the first piece of gold i picked up in californy when i went out there in 50 and its about the last i didnt have very good luck well of course i know i aint fit to give it but i want to do it i think bartleys about the greatest fellow and hes the best fellow this world can show thats the way i feel about him and i want to do it sho the thing want no use to me  marcia always gave her maid off all work sunday afternoon and she would not trespass upon her rule because she had guests that day except for the confusion to which kinneys unexpected gift had put her she would have waited for him to join the others before she began to clear away the dinner but now she mechanically began and kinney to whom these domestic occupations were a second nature joined her in the work equally absentminded in the fervor of his petition  bartley suddenly flung open the doors my dear mr ricker says he must be go he discovered marcia with the dish of potatoes in her hand and kinney in the act of carrying off the platter of turkey look here ricker  kinney came to himself and opening his mouth above the platter wide enough to swallow the remains of the turkey slapped his leg with the hand that he released for the purpose and shouted the ruling passion bartley the ruling passion  the men roared but marcia even while she took in the situation did not see anything so ridiculous in it as they she smiled a little in sympathy with their mirth and then said with a look and tone which he had not seen or heard in her since the day of their picnic at equity come see what mr kinney has given baby bartley  they sat up talking kinney over after he was gone but even at ten oclock bartley said he should not go to bed he felt like writing     xxix   bartley lived well now he felt that he could afford it on fifty dollars a week and yet somehow he had always a sheaf of unpaid bills on hand rent was so much the butcher so much the grocer so much these were the great outlays and he knew just what they were but the sum total was always much larger than he expected at a pinch he borrowed but he did not let marcia know of this for she would have starved herself to pay the debt what was worse she would have wished him to starve with her he kept the purse and he kept the accounts he was master in his house and he meant to be so  the pinch always seemed to come in the matter of clothes and then marcia gave up whatever she wanted and said she must make the old things do bartley hated this in his position he must dress well and as there was nothing mean about him he wished marcia to dress well to just at this time he had set his heart on her having a certain sacque which they had noticed in a certain window one day when they were on washington street together he surprised her a week later by bringing the sacque home to her and he surprised himself with a sealskin cap which he had long coveted it was coming winter now and for half a dozen days of the season he would really need the cap there would be many days when it would be comfortable and many others when it would be tolerable and he looked so handsome in it that marcia herself could not quite feel that it was an extravagance she asked him how they could afford both of the things at once but he answered with easy mystery that he had provided the funds and she went gayly round with him to call on the hallecks that evening and show off her sacque it was so stylish and pretty that it won her a compliment from ben halleck which she noticed because it was the first compliment or anything like it that he had ever paid her she repeated it to bartley he said that i looked like a hungarian princess that he saw in vienna  well i suppose it has a hussar kind of look with that fur trimming and that broad braid did anybody say anything about my cap asked bartley with burlesque eagerness  oh poor bartley she cried in laughing triumph i dont believe any of them noticed it and you kept twirling it round in your hands all the time to make them look  yes i did my level best said bartley  they had a jolly time about that marcia was proud of her sacque when she took it off and held it up by the loop in the neck so as to realize its prettiness she said she should make it last three winters at least and she leaned over and gave bartley a sweet kiss of gratitude and affection and told him not to try to make up for it by extra work but to help her scrimp for it  id rather do the extra work he protested in fact he already had the extra work done it was something that he felt he had the right to sell outside of the events and he carried his manuscript to ricker and offered it to him for his sunday edition  ricker read the title and ran his eye down the first slip and then glanced quickly at hubbard you dont mean it  yes i do said bartley why not  i thought he was going to use the material himself some time  bartley laughed he use the material why he cant write any more than a hen he can make tracks on paper but nobody would print em much less buy em i know him hes all right it wouldnt hurt the material for his purpose any way and hell be tickled to death when he sees it if he ever does look here ricker added bartley with a touch of anger at the hesitation in his friends face if youre going to spring any conscientious scruples on me i prefer to offer my manuscript elsewhere i give you the first chance at it but it neednt go begging do you suppose id do this if i didnt understand the man and know just how hed take it  why of course hubbard i beg your pardon if you say its all right i am bound to be satisfied what do you want for it  fifty dollars  thats a good deal isnt it  yes it is but i cant afford to do a dishonorable thing for less money said bartley with a wink  the next sunday when marcia came home from church she went into the parlor a moment to speak to bartley before she ran upstairs to the baby he was writing and she put her left hand on his back while with her right she held her sacque slung over her shoulder by the loop and leaned forward with a wandering eye on the papers that strewed the table in that attitude he felt her pause and grow absorbed and then rigid her light caress tightened into a grip why how base how shameful that man shall never enter my doors again why its stealing  whats the matter what are you talking about bartley looked up with a frown of preparation  this cried marcia snatching up the chronicleabstract at which she had been looking havent you seen it heres mr kinneys life all written out and when he said that he was going to keep it and write it out himself that thief has stolen it  look out how you talk said bartley kinneys an old fool and he never could have written it out in the world  that makes no difference he said that he told the things because he knew he was among gentlemen a great gentleman mr ricker is and i thought he was so nice the tears sprang to her eyes which flashed again i want you to break off with him bartley i dont want you to have anything to do with such a thief and i shall be proud to tell everybody that youve broken off with him because he was a thief oh bartley  hold your tongue shouted her husband  i wont hold my tongue and if you defend  dont you say a word against ricker its all right i tell you you dont understand such things you dont know what youre talking about iii wrote the thing myself  he could face her but she could not face him there was a subsidence in her proud attitude as if her physical strength had snapped with her breaking spirit  theres no theft about it bartley went on kinney would never write it out and if he did ive put the material in better shape for him here than he could ever have given it six weeks from now nobody will remember a word of it and he could tell the same things right over again and they would be just as good as new he went on to argue the point  she seemed not to have listened to him when he stopped she said in a quiet passionless voice i suppose you wrote it to get money for this sacque  yes i did replied bartley  she dropped it on the floor at his feet i shall never wear it again she said in the same tone and a little sigh escaped her  use your pleasure about that said bartley sitting down to his writing again as she turned and left the room  she went upstairs and came down immediately with the gold nugget which she had wrenched from the babys necklace and laid it on the paper before him perhaps you would like to spend it for tivoli beer she suggested flavia shall not wear it  ill get it fitted on to my watchchain bartley slipped it into his waistcoat pocket  the sacque still lay on the floor at his feet he pulled his chair a little forward and put his feet on it he feigned to write awhile longer and then he folded up his papers and went out leaving marcia to make her sunday dinner alone when he came home late at night he found the sacque where she had dropped it and with a curse he picked it up and hung it on the hatrack in the hall  he slept in the guestchamber and at times during the night the child cried in marcias room and waked him and then he thought he heard a sound of sobbing which was not the childs in the morning when he came down to breakfast marcia met him with swollen eyes  bartley she said tremulously i wish you would tell me how you felt justified in writing out mr kinneys life in that way  my dear said bartley with perfect amiability for he had slept off his anger and he really felt sorry to see her so unhappy i would tell you almost anything you want on any other subject but i think we had better remand that one to the safety of silence and go upon the general supposition that i know what im about  i cant bartley  cant you well thats a pity he pulled his chair to the breakfasttable it seems to me that girls imagination always fails her on mondays can she never give us anything but hash and cornbread when shes going to wash however the coffees good i suppose you made it  bartley persisted marcia i want to believe in everything you doi want to be proud of it  that will be difficult suggested bartley with an air of thoughtful impartiality for the wife of a newspaper man  no no it neednt be it mustnt be if you will only tell me she stopped as if she feared to repeat her offence  bartley leaned back in his chair and looked at her intense face with a smile tell you that in some way i had kinneys authority to use his facts well i should have done that yesterday if you had let me in the first place kinneys the most helpless ass in the world he could never have used his own facts in the second place there was hardly anything in his rigmarole the other day that he hadnt told me down there in the lumber camp with full authority to use it in any way i liked and i dont see how he could revoke that authority thats the way i reasoned about it  i seei see said marcia with humble eagerness  well thats all there is about it what ive done cant hurt kinney if he ever does want to write his old facts out hell be glad to take my report of them andspoil it said bartley ending with a laugh  and ifif there had been anything wrong about it said marcia anxious to justify him to herself mr ricker would have told you so when you offered him the article  i dont think mr ricker would have ventured on any impertinence with me said bartley with grandeur but he lapsed into his wonted easy way of taking everything what are you driving at marsh i dont care particularly for what happened yesterday weve had rows enough before and i dare say we shall have them again you gave me a bad quarter of an hour and you gave yourselfhe looked at her tearstained eyesa bad night apparently thats all there is about it  oh no that isnt all it isnt like the other quarrels weve had when i think how ive felt toward you ever since it scares me there cant be anything sacred in our marriage unless we trust each other in everything  well i havent done any of the mistrusting said bartley with humorous lightness but isnt sacred rather a strong word to use in regard to our marriage anyway  whywhywhat do you mean bartley we were married by a minister  well yes by what was left of one said bartley he couldnt seem to shake himself together sufficiently to ask for the proof that we had declared our intention to get married  marcia looked mystified dont you remember his saying there was something else and my suggesting to him that it was the fee  marcia turned white father said the certificate was all right  oh he asked to see it did he he is a prudent old gentleman well it is all right  and what difference did it make about our not proving that we had declared our intention asked marcia as if only partly reassured  no difference to us and only a difference of sixty dollars fine to him if it was ever found out  and you let the poor old man run that risk  well you see it couldnt be helped we hadnt declared our intention and the lady seemed very anxious to be married you neednt be troubled we are married right and tight enough but i dont know that theres anything sacred about it  no marcia wailed out its tainted with fraud from the beginning  if you like to say so bartley assented putting his napkin into its ring  marcia hid her face in her arms on the table the baby left off drumming with its spoon and began to cry  witherby was reading the sunday edition of the chronicleabstract when bartley got down to the events office and he cleared his throat with a premonitory cough as his assistant swung easily into the room good morning mr hubbard he said there is quite an interesting article in yesterdays chronicleabstract have you seen it  yes said bartley what article  this confessions of an average american witherby held out the paper where bartleys article vividly headlined and subheaded filled half a page what is the reason we cannot have something of this kind  well i dont know bartley began  have you any idea who wrote this  oh yes i wrote it  witherby had the task before him of transmuting an expression of rather low cunning into one of wounded confidence mingled with highminded surprise i thought it had your earmarks mr hubbard but i preferred not to believe it till i heard the fact from your own lips i supposed that our contract covered such contributions as this  i wrote it out of time and on sunday night you pay me by the week and all that i do throughout the week belongs to you the next day after that sunday i did a full days work on the events i dont see what you have to complain of you told me when i began that you would not expect more than a certain amount of work from me have i ever done less  no but  havent i always done more  yes i have never complained of the amount of work but upon this theory of yours what you did in your summer vacation would not belong to the events or what you did on legal holidays  i never have any summer vacation or holidays legal or illegal even when i was down at equity last summer i sent you something for the paper every day  this was true and witherby could not gainsay it very well sir if this is to be your interpretation of our understanding for the future i shall wish to revise our contract he said pompously  you can tear it up if you like returned bartley i dare say ricker would jump at a little study of the true inwardness of countingroom journalism unless you insist upon having it for the events bartley gave a chuckle of enjoyment as he sat down at his desk witherby rose and stalked away  he returned in half an hour and said with an air of frank concession touched with personal grief mr hubbard i can see how from your point of view you were perfectly justifiable in selling your article to the chronicleabstract my point of view is different but i shall not insist upon it and i wish to withdrawandand apologize forany hasty expressions i may have used  all right said bartley with a wicked grin he had triumphed but his triumph was one to leave some men with an uneasy feeling and there was not altogether a pleasant taste in bartleys mouth after that his position in the events office was whatever he chose to make it but he did not abuse his ascendency and he even made a point of increased deference towards witherby many courtesies passed between them each took some trouble to show the other that he had no ill feeling  three or four weeks later bartley received a letter with an illinois postmark which gave him a disagreeable sensation at first for he knew it must be from kinney but the letter was so amusingly characteristic so helplessly illspelled and illconstructed that he could not help laughing kinney gave an account of his travels to the mining town and of his present situation and future prospects he was full of affectionate messages and inquiries for bartleys family and he said he should never forget that sunday he had passed with them in a postscript he added they copied that string of lies into our paper here out of the chronab it was pretty well done but if your friend mr ricker done it ime not goen to insult him soon again by calling him a gentleman  this laconic reference to the matter in a postscript was delicious to bartley he seemed to hear kinney saying the words and imagined his air of ineffective sarcasm he carried the letter about with him and the first time he saw ricker he showed it to him ricker read it without appearing greatly diverted when he came to the postscript he flushed and demanded what have you done about it  oh i havent done anything it wasnt necessary you see now what kinney could have done with his facts if we had left them to him it would have been a wicked waste of material i thought the sight of some of his literature would help you wash up your uncleanly scruples on that point  how long have you had this letter pursued ricker  i dont know a week or ten days  ricker folded it up and returned it to him mr hubbard he said the next time we meet will you do me the favor to cut my acquaintance  bartley stared at him he thought he must be joking why ricker whats the matter i didnt suppose youd care anything about old kinney i thought it would amuse you why confound it id just as soon write out and tell him that i did the thing he began to be angry but i can cut your acquaintance fast enough or any mans if youre really on your ear  im on my ear said ricker he left bartley standing where they had met  it was peculiarly unfortunate for bartley had occasion within that week to ask rickers advice and he was debarred from doing so by this absurd displeasure since their recent perfect understanding witherby had slighted no opportunity to cement their friendship and to attach bartley more and more firmly to the events he now offered him some of the events stock on extremely advantageous terms with the avowed purpose of attaching him to the paper there seemed nothing covert in this and bartley had never heard any doubts of the prosperity of the events but he would have especially liked to have rickers mind upon this offer of stock witherby had urged him not to pay for the whole outright but to accept a somewhat lower salary and trust to his dividends to make up the difference the shares had paid fifteen per cent the year before and bartley could judge for himself of the present chances from that showing witherby advised him to borrow only fifteen hundred dollars on the three thousand of stock which he offered him and to pay up the balance in three years by dropping five hundred a year from his salary it was certainly a flattering proposal and under his breath where bartley still did most of his blaspheming he cursed ricker for an old fool and resolved to close with witherby on his own responsibility after he had done so he told marcia of the step he had taken  since their last quarrel there had been an alienation in her behavior toward him different from any former resentment she was submissive and quiescent she looked carefully after his comfort and was perfect in her housekeeping but she held aloof from him somehow and left him to a solitude in her presence in which he fancied if he did not divine her contempt but in this matter of common interest something of their community of feeling revived they met on a lower level but they met for the moment and marcia joined eagerly in the discussion of ways and means  the notion of dropping five hundred from his salary delighted her because they must now cut down their expenses as much and she had long grieved over their expenses without being able to make bartley agree to their reduction she went upstairs at once and gave the little nursemaid a weeks warning she told the maid of all work that she must take three dollars a week hereafter instead of four or else find another place she mentally forewent new spring dresses for herself and the baby and arranged to do herself all of the wash she had been putting out she put a note in the mouth of the can at the back door telling the milkman to leave only two quarts in future and she came radiantly back to tell bartley that she had saved half of the lost five hundred a year already but her countenance fell why where are you to get the other fifteen hundred dollars bartley  oh i ve thought of that said bartley laughing at her swift alternations of triumph and despair you trust to me for that  youre notnot going to ask father for it she faltered  not very much said bartley as he took his hat to go out  he meant to make a raise out of ben halleck as he phrased it to himself he knew that halleck had plenty of money he could make the stock itself over to him as security he did not see why halleck should hesitate but when he entered hallecks room having asked cyrus to show him directly there halleck gave a start which seemed ominous to bartley he had scarcely the heart to open his business and halleck listened with changing color and something only too like the embarrassment of a man who intends a refusal he would not look bartley in the face and when bartley had made an end he sat for a time without speaking at last he said with a quick sigh as if at the close of an internal conflict i will lend you the money  bartleys heart gave a bound and he broke out into an immense laugh of relief and clapped halleck on the shoulder you looked deucedly as it you wouldnt old man by george you had on such a dismal hangdog expression that i didnt know but youd come to borrow money of me and id made up my mind not to let you have it but im everlastingly obliged to you halleck and i promise you that you wont regret it  i shall have to speak to my father about this said halleck responding coldly to bartleys robust pressure of his hand  of courseof course  how soon shall you want the money  well the sooner the better now bring the check roundcant youtomorrow nightand take dinner with us you and olive and well celebrate a little i know it will please marcia when she finds out who my hardhearted creditor is  well assented halleck with a smile so ghastly that bartley noticed it even in his joy  curse me he said to himself if ever i saw a man so ashamed of doing a good action     xxx   the presidential canvas of the summerwhich followed upon these events in bartleys career was not very active sometimes in fact it languished so much that people almost forgot it and a good field was afforded the events for the practice of independent journalism to hold a course of strict impartiality and yet come out on the winning side was a theory of independent journalism which bartley illustrated with cynical enjoyment he developed into something rather artistic the gift which he had always shown in his newspaper work for ironical persiflage witherby was not a man to feel this burlesque himself but when it was pointed out to him by others he came to bartley in some alarm from its effect upon the fortunes of the paper we cant afford mr hubbard he said with virtuous trepidation we cant afford to make fun of our friends  bartley laughed at witherbys anxiety theyre no more our friends than the other fellows are we are independent journalists and this way of treating the thing leaves us perfectly free hereafter to claim just as we choose that we were in fun or in earnest on any particular question if were ever attacked see  i see said witherby with not wholly subdued misgiving but after due time for conviction no man enjoyed bartleys irony more than witherby when once he had mastered an instance of it sometimes it happened that bartley found him chuckling over a perfectly serious paragraph but he did not mind that he enjoyed witherbys mistake even more than his appreciation  in these days bartley was in almost uninterrupted good humor as he had always expected to be when he became fairly prosperous he was at no time an unamiable fellow as he saw it he had his sulks he had his moments of anger but generally he felt good and he had always believed and he had promised marcia that when he got squarely on his legs he should feel good perpetually this sensation he now agreeably realized and he was also now in that position in which he had proposed to himself some little moral reforms he was not much in the habit of taking stock but no man wholly escapes the contingencies in which he is confronted with himself and sees certain habits traits tendencies which he would like to change for the sake of his peace of mind hereafter to some souls these contingencies are full of anguish of remorse for the past of despair but bartley had never yet seen the time when he did not feel himself perfectly able to turn over a new leaf and blot the old one there were not many things in his life which he really cared to have very different but there were two or three shady little corners which he always intended to clean up he had meant some time or other to have a religious belief of some sort he did not much care what since marcia had taken to the hallecks church he did not see why he should not go with her though he had never yet done so he was not quite sure whether he was always as candid with her as he might be or as kind though he maintained against this question that in all their quarrels it was six of one and half a dozen of the other he had never been tipsy but once in his life and he considered that he had repented and atoned for that enough especially as nothing had ever come of it but sometimes he thought he might be overdoing the beer yes he thought he must cut down on the tivoli he was getting ridiculously fat if ever he met kinney again he should tell him that it was he and not ricker who had appropriated his facts and he intended to make it up with ricker somehow  he had not found just the opportunity yet but in the mean time he did not mind telling the real cause of their alienation to good fellows who could enjoy a joke he had his following though so many of his brother journalists had cooled toward him and those of his following considered him as smart as chainlightning and bound to rise these young men and not very wise elders roared over bartleys frank declaration of the situation between himself and ricker and they contended that if ricker had taken the article for the chronicleabstract he ought to take the consequences bartley told them that of course he should explain the facts to kinney but that he meant to let ricker enjoy his virtuous indignation awhile once after a confidence of this kind at the club where ricker had refused to speak to him he came away with a curious sense of moral decay it did not pain him a great deal but it certainly surprised him that now with all these prosperous conditions so favorable for cleaning up he had so little disposition to clean up he found himself quite willing to let the affair with ricker go and he suspected that he had been needlessly virtuous in his intentions concerning churchgoing and beer as to marcia it appeared to him that he could not treat a woman of her disposition otherwise than as he did at any rate if he had not done everything he could to make her happy she seemed to be getting along well enough and was probably quite as happy as she deserved to be they were getting on very quietly now there had been no violent outbreak between them since the trouble about kinney and then she had practically confessed herself in the wrong as bartley looked at it she had appeared contented with his explanation there was what might be called a perfect business amity between them if her life with him was no longer an expression of that intense devotion which she used to show him it was more like what married life generally comes to and he accepted her tractability and what seemed her commonsense view of their relations as greatly preferable with his growth in flesh bartley liked peace more and more  marcia had consented to go down to equity alone that summer for he had convinced her that during a heated political contest it would not do for him to be away from the paper he promised to go down for her when she wished to come home and it was easily arranged for her to travel as far as the junction under hallecks escort when he went to join his sisters in the white mountains bartley missed her and the baby at first but he soon began to adjust himself with resignation to his solitude they had determined to keep their maid over this summer for they had so much trouble in replacing her the last time after their return and bartley said he should live very economically it was quiet and the woman kept the house cool and clean she was a good cook and when bartley brought a man home to dinner she took an interest in serving it well bartley let her order the things from the grocer and butcher for she knew what they were used to getting and he had heard so much talk from marcia about bills since he bought that events stock that he was sick of the prices of things there was no extravagance and vet he seemed to live very much better after marcia went there is no doubt but he lived very much more at his ease one little restriction after another fell away from him he went and came with absolute freedom not only without having to account for his movements but without having a pang for not doing so he had the sensation of stretching himself after a cramping posture and he wrote marcia the cheerfulest letters charging her not to cut short her visit from anxiety on his account he said that he was working hard but hard work evidently agreed with him for he was never better in his life in this high content he maintained a feeling of loyalty by going to the hallecks where mrs halleck often had him to tea in pity of his loneliness they were dull company certainly but marcia liked them and the cooking was always good other evenings he went to the theatres where there were amusing variety bills and sometimes he passed the night at nantasket or took a run for a day to newport he always reported these excursions to marcia with expressions of regret that equity was too far away to run down to for a day  marcias letters were longer and more regular than his but he could have forgiven some want of constancy for the sake of a less searching anxiety on her part she was anxious not only for his welfare which was natural and proper but she was anxious about the housekeeping and the expenses things bartley could not afford to let trouble him though he did what he could in a general way to quiet her mind she wrote fully of the visit which olive halleck had paid her but said that they had not gone about much for ben halleck had only been able to come for a day she was very well and so was flavia  bartley realized flavias existence with an effort and for the rest this letter bored him what could he care about olive hallecks coming or ben hallecks staying away all that he asked of ben halleck was a little extension of time when his interest fell due the whole thing was disagreeable and he resented what he considered marcias endeavor to clap the domestic harness on him again his thoughts wandered to conditions to contingencies of which a man does not permit himself even to think without a degree of moral disintegration in these illadvised reveries he mused upon his life as it might have been if he had never met her or if they had never met after her dismissal of him as he recalled the facts he was at that time in an angry and embittered mood but he was in a mood of entire acquiescence and the reconciliation had been of her own seeking he could not blame her for it she was very much in love with him and he had been fond of her in fact he was still very fond of her when he thought of little ways of hers it filled him with tenderness he did justice to her fine qualities too her generosity her truthfulness her entire loyalty to his best interests he smiled to realize that he himself preferred his secondbest interests and in her absence he remembered that her virtues were tedious and even painful at times he had his doubts whether there was sufficient compensation in them he sometimes questioned whether he had not made a great mistake to get married he expected now to stick it through but this doubt occurred to him a moment came in which he asked himself what if he had never come back to marcia that night when she locked him out of her room might it not have been better for both of them she would soon have reconciled herself to the irreparable he even thought of her happy in a second marriage and the thought did not enrage him he generously wished marcia well he wishedhe hardly knew what he wished he wished nothing at all but to have his wife and child back again as soon as possible and he put aside with a laugh the fancies which really found no such distinct formulation as i have given them which were mere vague impulses arrested mental tendencies scraps of undirected revery their recurrence had nothing to do with what he felt to be his sane and waking state but they recurred and he even amused himself in turning them over     xxxi   one morning in september not long before marcia returned bartley found witherby at the office waiting for him witherby wore a pensive face which had the effect of being studied good morning mr hubbard he said and when bartley answered good morning cheerfully ignoring his mood he added what is this i hear mr hubbard about a personal misunderstanding between you and mr ricker  im sure i dont know said bartley but i suppose that if you have heard anything you know  i have heard proceeded witherby a little dashed by bartleys coolness that mr ricker accuses you of having used material in that article you sold him which had been intrusted to you under the seal of confidence and that you had left it to be inferred by the party concernedthat mr ricker had written the article himself  all right said bartley  but mr hubbard said witherby struggling to rise into virtuous supremacy what am i to think of such a report  i cant say unless you should think that it wasnt your affair that would be the easiest thing  but i cant think that mr hubbard such a report reflects through you upon the events it reflects upon me bartley laughed i cant approve of such a thing if you admit the report it appears to me that you haveadone aawrong action mr hubbard  bartley turned upon him with a curious look at the same time he felt a pang and there was a touch of real anguish in the sarcasm of his demand have i fallen so low as to be rebuked by you  ii dont know what you mean by such an expression as that mr hubbard said witherby i dont know what ive done to forfeit your esteemto justify you in using such language to me  i dont suppose you really do said bartley go on  i have nothing more to say mr hubbard exceptexcept to add that this has given me a great blowa great blow i had begun to have my doubts before as to whether we were quite adapted to each other and this hasincreased them i pass no judgment upon what you have done but i will say that it has made me anxious andaunrestful it has made me ask myself whether upon the whole we should not be happier apart i dont say that we should but i only feel that nine out of ten business men would consider you in the position you occupy on the eventsaadangerous person  bartley got up from his desk and walked toward witherby with his hands in his pockets he halted a few paces from him and looked down on him with a sinister smile i dont think theyd consider you a dangerous person in any position  may be not may be not said witherby striving to be easy and dignified in the effort he took up an open paper from the desk before him and lifting it between bartley and himself feigned to be reading it  bartley struck it out of his trembling hands you impudent old scoundrel do you pretend to be reading when i speak to you for half a cent  witherby slipping and sliding in his swivel chair contrived to get to his feet no violence mr hubbard no violence here  violence laughed bartley i should have to touch you come dont be afraid but dont you put on airs of any sort i understand your game you want for some reason to get rid of me and you have seized the opportunity with a sharpness that does credit to your cunning i dont condescend to deny this reportspeaking in this lofty strain bartley had a momentary sensation of its being a despicable slanderbut i see that as far as you are concerned it answers all the purposes of truth you think that with the chance of having this thing exploited against me i wont expose your nefarious practices and you can get rid of me more safely now than ever you could again well youre right i dare say you heard of this report a good while ago and youve waited till you could fill my place without inconvenience to yourself so i can go at once draw your check for all you owe me and pay me back the money i put into your stock and ill clear out at once he went about putting together a few personal effects on his desk  i must protest against any allusion to nefarious practices mr hubbard said witherby and i wish you to understand that i part from you without the slightest illfeeling i shall always have a high regard for your ability andandyour social qualities while he made these expressions he hastened to write two checks  bartley who had paid no attention to what witherby was saying came up and took the checks this is all right he said of one but looking at the other he added fifteen hundred dollars where is the dividend  that is not due till the end of the month said witherby if you withdraw your money now you lose it  bartley looked at the face to which witherby did his best to give a high judicial expression you old thief he said goodhumoredly almost affectionately i have a mind to tweak your nose but he went out of the room without saying or doing anything more he wondered a little at his own amiability but with the decay of whatever was rightprincipled in him he was aware of growing more and more incapable of indignation now his flash of rage over he was not at all discontented with these checks in his pocket with his youth his health and his practised hand he could have faced the world with a light heart if he had not also had to face his wife but when he thought of the inconvenience of explaining to her of pacifying her anxiety of clearing up her doubts on a thousand points and of getting her simply to eat or sleep till he found something else to do it dismayed him good lord he said to himself i wish i was deador some one that conclusion made him smile again  he decided not to write to marcia of the change in his affairs but to take the chance of finding something better before she returned there was very little time for him to turn round and he was still without a place or any prospect when she came home it had sufficed with his acquaintance when he said that he had left the events because he could not get on with witherby but he was very much astonished when it seemed to suffice with her  oh well she said i am glad of it you will do better by yourself and i know you can earn just as much by writing on the different papers  bartley knew better than this but he said yes i shall not be in a hurry to take another engagement just yet but marsh he added i was afraid you would blame methink i had been reckless or at fault  no she answered after a little pause i shall not do that any more i have been thinking all these things over while i was away from you and im going to do differently after this i shall believe that youve acted for the bestthat youve not meant to do wrong in anythingand i shall never question you or doubt you any more  isnt that giving me rather too much rope asked bartley with lightness that masked a vague alarm lest the old times of exaction should be coming back with the old times of devotion  no i see where my mistake has always been ive always asked too much and expected too much even when i didnt ask it now i shall be satisfied with what you dont do as well as what you do  i shall try to live up to my privileges said bartley with a sigh of relief he gave her a kiss and then he unclasped kinneys nugget from his watchchain and fastened it on the babys necklace which lay in a box marcia had just taken from her trunk she did not speak but bartley felt better to have the thing off him marcias gentleness the tinge of sadness in her tone made him long to confess himself wrong in the whole matter and justly punished by rickers contempt and witherbys dismissal but he did not believe that he could trust her to forgive him and he felt himself unable to go through all that without the certainty of her forgiveness  as she took the things out of her trunk and laid them away in this drawer and that she spoke of events in the village and told who was dead who was married and who had gone away i stayed longer than i expected a little because father seemed to want me to i dont think mothers so well as she used to be iim afraid she seems to be failing somehow  her voice dropped to a lower key and bartley said im sorry to hear that i guess she isnt failing but of course shes getting on and every year makes a difference  yes that must be it she answered looking at a bundle of collars she had in her hand as if absorbed in the question as to where she should put them  before they slept that night she asked bartley did you hear about hannah morrison  no what about her  shes gonegone away the last time she was seen was in portland they dont know whats become of her they say that henry bird is about heartbroken but everybody knows she never cared for him i hated to write to you about it  bartley experienced so disagreeable a sensation that he was silent for a time then he gave a short bitter laugh well thats what it was bound to come to sooner or later i suppose its a piece of good luck for bird  bartley went about picking up work from one paper and another but not securing a basis on any in that curious and unwholesome leniency which corrupt natures manifest he and witherby met at their next encounter on quite amicable terms bartley reported some meetings for the events and experienced no resentment when witherby at the office introduced him to the gentleman with whom he had replaced him of course bartley expected that witherby would insinuate things to his disadvantage but he did not mind that he heard of something of the sort being done in rickers presence and of rickers saying that in any question of honor and veracity between witherby and hubbard he should decide for hubbard bartley was not very grateful for this generous defence he thought that if ricker had not been such an ass in the first place there would have been no trouble between them and witherby would not have had that handle against him  he was enjoying himself very well and he felt entitled to the comparative rest which had not been of his seeking he wished that halleck would come back for he would like to ask his leave to put that money into some other enterprise his credit was good and he had not touched the money to pay any of his accumulated bills he would have considered it dishonorable to do so but it annoyed him to have the money lying idle in his leisure he studied the stock market and he believed that he had several points which were infallible he put a few hundredstwo or threeof hallecks money into a mining stock which was so low that it must rise in the mean time he tried a new kind of beernorwegian beer which he found a little lighter even than tivoli it was more expensive but it was very light and it was essential to bartley to drink the lightest beer he could find  he stayed a good deal at home now for he had leisure and it was a much more comfortable place since marcia had ceased to question or reproach him she did not interfere with some bachelor habits he had formed in her absence of sleeping far into the forenoon he now occasionally did nightwork on some of the morning papers and the rest was necessary he had his breakfast whenever he got up as if he had been at a hotel he wondered upon what new theory she was really treating him but he had always been apt to accept what was comfortable in life without much question and he did not wonder long he was immensely goodnatured now in his frequent leisure he went out to walk with marcia and flavia and sometimes he took the little girl alone he even went to church with them one sunday and called at the hallecks as often as marcia liked the young ladies had returned but ben halleck was still away it made bartley smile to hear his wife talking of halleck with his mother and sisters and falling quite into the family way of regarding him as if he were somehow a saint and martyr  bartley was still dabbling in stocks with hallecks money some of it had lately gone to pay an assessment which had unexpectedly occurred in place of a dividend he told marcia that he was holding the money ready to return to halleck when he came back or to put it into some other enterprise where it would help to secure bartley a new basis they were now together more than they had been since the first days of their married life in boston but the perfect intimacy of those days was gone he had his reserves and she her preoccupationswith the house with the little girl with her anxiety about her mother sometimes they sat a whole evening together with almost nothing to say to each other he reading and she sewing after an evening of this sort bartley felt himself worse bored than if marcia had spent it in taking him to task as she used to do once he looked at her over the top of his paper and distinctly experienced that he was tired of the whole thing  but the political canvass was growing more interesting now it was almost the end of october and the speechmaking had become very lively the democrats were hopeful and the republicans resolute and both parties were active in getting out their whole strength as the saying is at such times this was done not only by speechmaking but by long nocturnal processions of torchlights by day as well as by night drums throbbed and horns brayed and the feverish excitement spread its contagion through the whole population but it did not affect bartley he had cared nothing about the canvass from the beginning having an equal contempt for the bloody shirt of the republicans and the reform pretensions of the democrats the only thing that he took an interest in was the betting he laid his wagers with so much apparent science and sagacity that he had a certain following of young men who bet as hubbard did hubbard they believed had a long head he disdained bets of hats and of barrels of apples and ordeals by wheelbarrow he would bet only with people who could put up their money and his followers honored him for it when asked where he got his money being out of place and no longer instant to do work that fell in his way they answered from a ready faith that he had made a good thing in mining stocks  in her heart marcia probably did not share this faith but she faithfully forbore to harass bartley with her doubts and on those evenings when he found her such dull company she was silent because if she spoke she must express the trouble in her mind women are more apt to theorize their husbands than men in their stupid selfabsorption ever realize when a man is married his wife almost ceases to be exterior to his consciousness she afflicts or consoles him like a condition of health or sickness she is literally part of him in a spiritual sense even when he is rather indifferent to her but the most devoted wife has always a corner of her soul in which she thinks of her husband as him in which she philosophizes him wholly aloof from herself in such an obscure fastness of her being marcia had meditated a great deal upon bartley during her absence at equitymeditated painfully and in her sort prayerfully upon him she perceived that he was not her young dream of him and since it appeared to her that she could not forego that dream and live she could but accuse herself of having somehow had a perverse influence upon him she knew that she had never reproached him except for his good but she saw too that she had always made him worse and not better she recurred to what he said the first night they arrived in boston i believe that if you have faith in me i shall get along and when you dont i shall go to the bad she could reason to no other effect than that hereafter no matter what happened she must show perfect faith in him by perfect patience it was hard far harder than she had thought but she did forbear she did use patience  the election day came and went bartley remained out till the news of tildens success could no longer be doubted and then came home jubilant marcia seemed not to understand i didnt know you cared so much for tilden she said quietly mr halleck is for hayes and ben halleck was coming home to vote  thats all right a vote in massachusetts makes no difference im for tilden because i have the most money up on him the success of that noble old reformer is worth seven hundred dollars to me in bets bartley laughed rubbed her cheeks with his chilly hands and went down into the cellar for some beer he could not have slept without that in his excitement but he was out very early the next morning and in the raw damp of the rainy november day he received a more penetrating chill when he saw the bulletins at the newspaper offices intimating that a fair count might give the republicans enough southern states to elect hayes this appeared to bartley the most impudent piece of political effrontery in the whole history of the country and among those who went about denouncing republican chicanery at the democratic clubrooms no one took a loftier tone of moral indignation than he the thought that he might lose so much of hallecks money through the machinations of a parcel of carpetbagging tricksters filled him with a virtue at which he afterwards smiled when he found that people were declaring their bets off i laid a wager on the popular result not on the decision of the returning boards he said in reclaiming his money from the referees he had some difficulty in getting it back but he had got it when he walked homeward at night after having been out all day and there now ensued in his soul a struggle as to what he should do with this money he had it all except the three hundred he had ventured on the mining stock which would eventually he worth everything he had paid for it after his frightful escape from losing half of it on those bets he had an intense longing to be rid of it to give it back to halleck who never would ask him for it and then to go home and tell marcia everything and throw himself on her mercy better poverty better disgrace before halleck and her better her condemnation than this life of temptation that he had been leading he saw how hideous it was in the retrospect and he shuddered his good instincts awoke and put forth their strength such as it was tears came into his eyes he resolved to write to kinney and exonerate ricker he resolved humbly to beg rickers pardon he must leave boston but if marcia would forgive him he would go back with her to equity and take up the study of the law in her fathers office again and fulfil all her wishes he would have a hard time to overcome the old mans prejudices but he deserved a hard time and he knew he should finally succeed it would be bitter returning to that stupid little town and he imagined the intrusive conjecture and sarcastic comment that would attend his return but he believed that he could live this down and he trusted himself to laugh it down he already saw himself there settled in the squires office reinstated in public opinion a leading lawyer of the place with congress open before him whenever he chose to turn his face that way  he had thought of going first to halleck and returning the money but he was willing to give himself the encouragement of marcias pleasure of her forgiveness and her praise in an affair that had its difficulties and would require all his manfulness the maid met him at the door with little flavia and told him that marcia had gone out to the hallecks but had left word that she would soon return and that then they would have supper together her absence dashed his warm impulse but he recovered himself and took the little one from the maid he lighted the gas in the parlor and had a frolic with flavia in kindling a fire in the grate and making the room bright and cheerful he played with the child and made her laugh he already felt the pleasure of a good conscience though with a faint nether ache in his heart which was perhaps only his wish to have the disagreeable preliminaries to his better life over as soon as possible he drew two easychairs up at opposite corners of the hearth and sat down in one leaving the other for marcia he had flavia standing on his knees and clinging fast to his fingers laughing and crowing while he danced her up and down when he heard the front door open and marcia burst into the room  she ran to him and plucked the child from him and then went back as far as she could from him in the room crying give me the child and facing him with the look he knew her eyes were dilated and her visage white with the transport that had whirled her far beyond the reach of reason the frail structure of his good resolutions dropped to ruin at the sight but he mechanically rose and advanced upon her till she forbade him with a muffled shriek of dont touch me so she went on gasping and catching her breath it was you i might have known it i might have guessed it from the first you was that the reason why you didnt care to have me hurry home this summer was thatwas that she choked and convulsively pressed her face into the neck of the child which began to cry  bartley closed the doors and then with his hands in his pockets confronted her with a smile of wicked coolness will you be good enough to tell me what youre talking about  do you pretend that you dont know i met a woman at the bottom of the street just now do you know who  no but its very dramatic go on  it was hannah morrison she reeled against me and when isuch a fool as i waspitied her because i was on my way home to you and was thinking about you and loving you and was so happy in it and asked her how she came to that she struck me and told me totoask myhusband  the transport broke in tears the denunciation had turned to entreaty in everything but words but bartley had hardened his heart now past all entreaty the idiotic penitent that he had been a few moments ago the soft wellmeaning dolt was so far from him now as to be scarce within the reach of his contempt he was going to have this thing over once for all he would have no mercy upon himself or upon her the devil was in him and uppermost in him and the devil is fierce and proud and knows how to make many base emotions feel like a just selfrespect and did you believe a woman like that he sneered  do i believe a man like this she demanded with a dying flash of her fury youyou dont dare to deny it  oh no i dont deny it for one reason it would be of no use for all practical purposes i admit it what then  what then she asked bewildered bartley you dont mean it  yes i do i mean it i dont deny it what then what are you going to do about it she gazed at him in incredulous horror come i mean what i say what will you do  oh merciful god what shall i do she prayed aloud  thats just what im curious to know when you leaped in here just now you must have meant to do something if i couldnt convince you that the woman was lying well you see that i dont try i give you leave to believe whatever she said what then  bartley she besought him in her despair do you drive me from you  oh no certainly not that isnt my way you have driven me from you and i might claim the right to retaliate but i dont ive no expectation that youll go away and i want to see what else youll do you would have me before we were married you were tolerably shameless in getting me when your jealous temper made you throw me away you couldnt live till you got me back again you ran after me well i suppose youve learnt wisdom now at least you wont try that game again but what will you do he looked at her smiling while he dealt her these stabs one by one  she set down the child and went out to the entry where its hat and cloak hung she had not taken off her own things and now she began to put on the little ones garments with shaking hands kneeling before it i will never live with you again bartley she said  very well i doubt it as far as youre concerned but if you go away now you certainly wont live with me again for i shall not let you come back understand that  each had most need of the others mercy but neither would have mercy  it isnt for what you wont deny i dont believe that its for what youve said now she could not make the buttons and the buttonholes of the childs sack meet with her quivering fingers he actually stooped down and buttoned the little garment for her as if they had been going to take the child out for a walk between them she caught it up in her arms and sobbing good by bartley ran out of the room  recollect that if you go you dont come back he said the outer door crashing to behind her was his answer  he sat down to think before the fire he had built for her it was blazing brightly now and the whole room had a hideous cosiness he could not think he must act he went up to their room where the gas was burning low as if she had lighted it and then frugally turned it down as her wont was he did not know what his purpose was but it developed itself he began to pack his things in a travellingbag which he took out of the closet and which he had bought for her when she set out for equity in the summer it had the perfume of her dresses yet  when this was finished he went down stairs again and being now strangely hungry he made a meal of such things as he found set out on the teatable then he went over the papers in his secretary he burnt some of them and put others into his bag  after all this was done he sat down by the fire again and gave marcia a quarter of an hour longer in which to return he did not know whether he was afraid that she would or would not come but when the time ended he took up his bag and went out of the house it began to rain and he went back for an umbrella he gave her that one chance more and he ran up into their room but she had not come back he went out again and hurried away through the rain to the albany depot where he bought a ticket for chicago there was as yet nothing definite in his purpose beyond the fact that he was to be rid of her whether for a long or short time or forever he did not yet know whether he meant ever to communicate with her or seek or suffer a reconciliation the locomotive that leaped westward into the dark with him knew as well as he  yet all the mute obscure forces of habit which are doubtless the strongest forces in human nature were dragging him back to her because their lives had been united so long it seemed impossible to sever them though their union had been so full of misery and discord the custom of marriage was so subtile and so pervasive that his heart demanded her sympathy for what he was suffering in abandoning her the solitude into which he had plunged stretched before him so vast so sterile and hopeless that he had not the courage to realize it he insensibly began to give it limits he would return after so many months weeks days  he passed twentyfour hours on the train and left it at cleveland for the halfhour it stopped for supper but he could not eat he had to own to himself that he was beaten and that he must return or throw himself into the lake he ran hastily to the baggagecar and effected the removal of his bag then he went to the ticketoffice and waited at the end of a long queue for his turn at the window his turn came at last and he confronted the nervous and impatient ticketagent without speaking  well sir what do you want demanded the agent then with rising temper what is it are you deaf are you dumb you cant expect to stand there all night  the policeman outside the rail laid his hand on bartleys shoulder move on my friend  he obeyed and reeled away in a fashion that confirmed the policemans suspicions he searched his pockets again and again but his portemonnaie was in none of them it had been stolen and hallecks money with the rest now he could not return nothing remained for him but the ruin he had chosen     xxxii   halleck prolonged his summer vacation beyond the end of october he had been in town from time to time and then had set off again on some new absence he was so restless and so far from well during the last of these flying visits that the old people were glad when he wrote them that he should stay as long as the fine weather continued he spoke of an interesting man whom he had met at the mountain resort where he was staying a spanishamerican attached to one of the legations at washington who had a scheme for americanizing popular education in his own country he has made a regular set at me halleck wrote and if i had not fooled away so much time already on law and on leather i should like to fool away a little more on such a cause as this he did not mention the matter again in his letters but the first night after his return when they all sat together in the comfort of having him at home again he asked his father what should you think of my going to south america  the old man started up from the pleasant aftersupper drowse into which he was suffering himself to fall content with hallecks presence and willing to leave the talk to the women folk i dont know what you mean ben  i suppose its my having the matter so much in mind that makes me feel as if we had talked it over i mentioned it in one of my letters  yes returned his father but i presumed you were joking  halleck frowned impatiently he would not meet the gaze of his mother and sisters but he addressed himself again to his father i dont know that i was in earnest his mother dropped her eyes to her mending with a faint sigh of relief but i cant say he added that i was joking exactly the man himself was very serious about it he stopped apparently to govern an irritable impulse and then he went on to set the project of his spanishamerican acquaintance before them explaining it in detail  at the end thats good said his father but why need you have gone ben  the question seemed to vex halleck he did not answer at once his mother could not bear to see him crossed and she came to his help against herself and his father since it was only supposing the case i presume she said that we could have looked at it as a missionary work  it isnt a missionary work mother answered halleck severely in any sense that you mean i should go down there to teach and i should be paid for it and i want to say at once that they have no yellowfever nor earthquakes and that they have not had a revolution for six years the countrys perfectly safe every way and so wholesome that it will be a good thing for me but i shouldnt expect to convert anybody  of course not ben said his mother soothingly  i hope you wouldnt object to it if it were a missionary work said one of the elder sisters  no anna returned ben  i merely wanted to know said anna  then i hope youre satisfied anna olive cut in ben wont refuse to convert the uruguayans if they apply in a proper spirit  i think anna had a right to ask said miss louisa the eldest  oh undoubtedly miss halleck said olive i like to see ben reproved for misbehavior to his mother myself  her father laughed at olives prompt defence well its a cause that weve all got to respect but i dont see why you should go ben as i said before it would do very well for some young fellow who had no settled prospects but youve got your duties here i presume you looked at it in that light as you said in your letter youve fooled away so much time on leather and law  i shall never amount to anything in the law ben broke out his mother looked at him in anxiety his father kept a steady smile on his face olive sat alert for any chance that offered to put down her elder sisters who drew in their breath and grew silently a little primmer im not well  oh i know youre not dear interrupted his mother glad of another chance to abet him  im not strong enough to go on with the line of work ive marked out and i feel that im throwing away the feeble powers i have  his father answered with less surprise than halleck had evidently expected for he had thrown out his words with a sort of defiance probably the old man had watched him closely enough to surmise that it might come to this with him at last at any rate he was able to say without seeming to assent too readily well well give up the law then and come back into leather as you call it or take up something else we dont wish to make anything a burden to you but take up some useful work at home there are plenty of things to be done  not for me said halleck gloomily  oh yes there are said the old man  i see you are not willing to have me go said halleck rising in uncontrollable irritation but i wish you wouldnt all take this tone with me  we havent taken any tone with you ben said his mother with pleading tenderness  i think anna has decidedly taken a tone said olive  anna did not retort but what tone demanded louisa in her behalf  hush children said their mother  well well suggested his father to ben think it over think it over theres no hurry  ive thought it over there is hurry retorted halleck if i go i must go at once  his mother arrested her thread half drawn through the seam letting her hand drop while she glanced at him  it isnt so much a question of your giving up the law ben as of your giving up your family and going so far away from us all said his father thats what i shouldnt like  i dont like that either but i cant help it he added of course mother i shall not go without your full and free consent you and father must settle it between you he fetched a quick worried sigh as he put his hand on the door  ben isnt himself at all said mrs halleck with tears in her eyes after he had left the room  no said her husband hes restless hell get over this idea in a few days he urged this hope against his wifes despair and argued himself into low spirits  i dont believe but what it would be the best thing for his health may be said mrs halleck at the end  ive always had my doubts whether he would ever come to anything in the law said the father  the elder sisters discussed hallecks project apart between themselves as their wont was with any family interest and they bent over a map of south america so as to hide what they were doing from their mother  olive had left the room by another door and she intercepted halleck before he reached his own  what is the matter ben she whispered  nothing he answered coldly but he added come in olive  she followed him and hovered near after he turned up the gas  i cant stand it here i must go he said turning a dull weary look upon her  who was at the elm house that you knew this last time she asked quickly  laura dixmore isnt driving me away if you mean that replied halleck  i couldnt believe it was she i should have despised you if it was but i shall hate her whoever it was  halleck sat down before his table and his sister sank upon the corner of a chair near it and looked wistfully at him i know there is some one  if you think ive been fool enough to offer myself to any one olive youre very much mistaken  oh it neednt have come to that said olive with indignant pity  my lifes a failure here cried halleck moving his head uneasily from side to side i feel somehow as if i could go out there and pick up the time ive lost great heaven he cried if i were only running away from some innocent young girls rejection what a happy man i should be  its some horrid married thing then thats been flirting with you  he gave a forlorn laugh id almost confess it to please you olive but id prefer to get out of the matter without lying if i could why need you suppose any reason but the sufficient one ive givendont afflict me dont imagine things about me dont make a mystery of me ive been blunt and awkward and ive bungled the business with father and mother but i want to get away because im a miserable fraud here and i think i might rub on a good while there before i found myself out again  ben demanded olive regardless of his words what have you been doing  the old storynothing  is that true ben  you used to be satisfied with asking once olive  you havent been so wicked so careless as to get some poor creature in love with you and then want to run away from the misery youve made  i suppose if i look it theres no use denying it said halleck letting his sad eyes meet hers and smiling drearily you insist upon having a lady in the case  yes but i see you wont tell me anything and i wont afflict you only im afraid its just some silly thing that youve got to brooding over and that youll let drive you away  well you have the comfort of reflecting that i cant get away whatever the pressure is  you know better than that ben and so do i you know that if you havent got father and mothers consent already its only because you havent had the heart to ask for it as far as thats concerned youre gone already but i hope you wont go without thinking it over as father saysand talking it over i hate to have you seem unsteady and fickleminded when i know youre not and im going to set myself against this project till i know whats driving you from usor till im sure that its something worth while you neednt expect that i shall help to make it easy for you i shall help to make it hard  her loving looks belied her threats if the others could not resist ben when any sort of desire showed itself through his habitual listlessness how could she who understood him best and sympathized with him most there was something i was going to talk to you about tonight if you hadnt scared us all with this ridiculous scheme and ask you whether you couldnt do something she seemed to suggest the change of interest with the hope of winning his thoughts away from the direction they had taken but he listened apathetically and left her to go further or not as she chose i think she added abruptly that some trouble is hanging over those wretched hubbards  some new one asked halleck with sad sarcasm turning his eyes towards her as if with the resolution of facing her  you know hes left his place on that newspaper  yes i heard that when i was at home before  there are some very disagreeable stories about it they say he was turned away by mr witherby for behaving badlyfor printing something he oughtnt to have done  that was to have been expected said halleck  he hasnt found any other place and marcia says he gets very little work to do he must be running into debt terribly i feel very anxious about them i dont know what theyre living on  probably on some money i lent him said halleck quietly i lent him fifteen hundred in the spring it ought to make him quite comfortable for the present  oh ben why did you lend him money you might have known he wouldnt do any good with it  halleck explained how and why the loan had been made and added if hes supporting his family with it hes doing some good i lent it to him for her sake  halleck looked hardily into his sisters face but he dropped his eyes when she answered simply yes of course but i dont believe she knows anything about it and im glad of it it would only add to her trouble she worships you ben  does she  she seems to think you are perfect and she never comes here but she asks when youre to be home i suppose she thinks you have a good influence on that miserable husband of hers hes going from bad to worse i guess father heard that he is betting on the election thats what hes doing with your money  it would be somebody elses money if it wasnt mine said halleck bartley hubbard must live and he must have the little excitements that make life agreeable  poor thing sighed olive i dont know what she would do if she heard that you were going away to hear her talk you would think she had been counting the days and hours till you got back its ridiculous the way she goes on with mother asking everything about you as if she expected to make bartley hubbard over again on your pattern i should hate to have anybody think me such a saint as she does you but there isnt much danger thank goodness i could laugh sometimes at the way she questions us all about you and is so delighted when she finds that you and that wretch have anything in common but its all too miserably sad she certainly is the most singlehearted creature alive continued olive reflectively sometimes she scares me with her innocence i dont believe that even her jealousy ever suggested a wicked idea to her shes furious because she feels the injustice of giving so much more than he does she hasnt really a thought for anybody else i do believe that if she were free to choose from now till doomsday she would always choose bartley hubbard bad as she knows him to be and if she were a widow and anybody else proposed to her she would be utterly shocked and astonished  very likely said halleck absently  i feel very unhappy about her olive resumed i know that shes anxious and troubled all the time cant you do something ben have a talk with that disgusting thing and see if you cant put him straight again somehow  no exclaimed halleck bursting violently from his abstraction i shall have nothing to do with them let him go his own way and the sooner he goes to thei wont interferei cant i mustnt i wonder at you olive he pushed away from the table and went limping about the room searching here and there for his hat and stick which were on the desk where he had put them in plain view as he laid hand on them at last he met his sisters astonished eyes if i interfered i should not interfere because i cared for him at all he cried  of course not said olive but i dont see anything to make you wonder at me about that  it would be because i cared for her  certainly you didnt suppose i expected you to interfere from any other motive  he stood looking at her in stupefaction with his hand on his hat and stick like a man who doubts whether he has heard aright presently a shiver passed over him another light came into his eyes and he said quietly im going out to see atherton  tonight said his sister accepting provisionally as women do the apparent change of subject dont go tonight ben youre too tired  im not tired i intended to see him tonight at any rate i want to talk over this south american scheme with him he put on his hat and moved quickly toward the door  ask him about the hubbards said olive perhaps he can tell you something  i dont want to know anything i shall ask him nothing  she slipped between him and the door ben you havent heard anything against poor marcia have you  no  you dont think shes to blame in any way for his going wrong do you  how could i  then i dont understand why you wont do anything to help her  he looked at her again and opened his lips to speak once but closed them before he said ive got my own affairs to worry me isnt that reason enough for not interfering in theirs  not for you ben  then i dont choose to mix myself up in other peoples misery i dont like it as you once said  but you cant help it sometimes as you said  i can this time olive dont you see he began  i see theres something you wont tell me but i shall find it out she threatened him half playfully  i wish you could he answered then perhaps youd let me know she opened the door for him now and as he passed out he said gently i am tired but i shant begin to rest till i have had this talk with atherton i had better go  yes olive assented youd better she added in banter youre altogether too mysterious to be of much comfort at home  the family heard him close the outside door behind him after olive came back to them and she explained hes gone out to talk it over with mr atherton  his father gave a laugh of relief well if he leaves it to atherton i guess we neednt worry about it  the child isnt at all well said his mother     xxxiii   halleck met atherton at the door of his room with his hat and coat on why halleck i was just going to see if you had come home  you neednt now said halleck pushing by him into the room i want to see you atherton on business  atherton took off his hat and closed the door with one hand while he slipped the other arm out of his overcoat sleeve well to tell the truth i was going to mingle a little business myself with the pleasure of seeing you he turned up the gas in his droplight and took the chair from which he had looked across the table at halleck when they talked there before its the old subject he said with a sense of repetition in the situation i learn from witherby that hubbard has taken that money of yours out of the events and from what i hear elsewhere he is making ducks and drakes of it on election bets what shall you do about it  nothing said halleck  oh very well returned atherton with the effect of being a little snubbed but resolved to take his snub professionally he broke out however in friendly exasperation why in the world did you lend the fellow that money  halleck lifted his brooding eyes and fixed them half pleadingly half defiantly upon his friends face i did it for his wifes sake  yes i know returned atherton i remember how you felt i couldnt share your feeling but i respected it however i doubt if your loan was a benefit to either of them it probably tempted him to count upon money that he hadnt earned and thats always corrupting  yes halleck replied but i cant say that so far as hes concerned im very sorry i dont suppose it would do her any good if i forced him to disgorge any balance he may have left from his wagers  no hardly  then i shall let him alone  the subject was dismissed and atherton waited for halleck to speak of the business on which he had come but halleck only played with the paper cutter which his left hand had found on the table near him and with his chin sunk on his breast seemed lost in an unhappy reverie  i hope you wont accuse yourself of doing him an injury said atherton at last with a smile  injury demanded halleck quickly what injury how  by lending him that money  oh i had forgotten that i wasnt thinking of it returned halleck impatiently i was thinking of something different im aware of disliking the man so much that i should be willing to have greater harm than that happen to himthe greatest for what i know though i dont know after all that it would be harm in another life if there is one he might start in a new direction but that isnt imaginable of him here he can only go from bad to worse he can only make more and more sorrow and shame why shouldnt one wish him dead when his death could do nothing but good  i suppose you dont expect me to answer such a question seriously  but suppose i did  then i should say that no man ever wished any such good as that except from the worst motive and the less one has to do with such questions even as abstractions the better  youre right said halleck but why do you call it an abstraction  because in your case nothing else is conceivable  i told you i was willing the worst should happen to him  and i didnt believe you  halleck lay back in his chair and laughed wearily i wish i could convince somebody of my wickedness but it seems to be useless to try i say things that ought to raise the roof both to you here and to olive at home and you tell me you dont believe me and she tells me that mrs hubbard thinks me a saint i suppose now that if i took you by the buttonhole and informed you confidentially that i had stopped long enough at 129 clover street to put bartley hubbard quietly out of the way you wouldnt send for a policeman  i should send for a doctor said atherton  such is the effect of character and yet out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh out of the heart proceed all those unpleasant things enumerated in scripture but if you bottle them up there and keep your label fresh its all thats required of you by your fellowbeings at least what an amusing thing morality would be if it were nototherwise atherton do you believe that such a man as christ ever lived  i know you do halleck said atherton  well that depends upon what you call me it what i wasif my well sundayschooled youthis i i do but if i poising dubiously on the momentary present between the past and future am i im afraid i dont and yet it seems to me that i have a fairish sort of faith i know that if christ never lived on earth some one lived who imagined him and that one must have been a god the historical fact oughtnt to matter christ being imagined cant you see what a comfort what a rapture it must have been to all these poor souls to come into such a presence and be looked through and through the relief the rest the complete exposure of judgment day  every day is judgment day said atherton  yes i know your doctrine but i mean the last day we ought to have something in anticipation of it here in our social system character is a superstition a wretched fetish once a year wouldnt be too often to seize upon sinners whose blameless life has placed them above suspicion and turn them inside out before the community so as to show people how the smoke of the pit had been quietly blackening their interior that would destroy character as a cult he laughed again well this isnt businessthough it isnt pleasure either exactly what i came for was to ask you something ive finished at the law school and im just ready to begin here in the office with you dont you think it would be a good time for me to give up the law wait a moment he said arresting in atherton an impulse to speak we will take the decent surprise the friendly demur the conscientious scruple for granted now honestly do you believe ive got the making of a lawyer in me  i dont think youre very well halleck atherton began  ah youre a lawyer you wont give me a direct answer  i will if you wish retorted atherton  well  do you want to give it up  yes  then do it no man ever prospered in it yet who wanted to leave it and now since its come to this ill tell you what i really have thought all along ive thought that if your heart was really set on the law you would overcome your natural disadvantages for it but if the time ever came when you were tired of it your chance was lost you never would make a lawyer the question is whether that time has come  it has said halleck  then stop here and now youve wasted two years time but you cant get it back by throwing more after it i shouldnt be your friend i shouldnt be an honest man if i let you go on with me after this a bad lawyer is such a very bad thing this isnt altogether a surprise to me but it will be a blow to your father he added with a questioning look at halleck after a moment  it might have been if i hadnt taken the precaution to deaden the place by a heavier blow first  ah youve spoken to him already  yes ive had it out in a sneaking hypothetical way but i could see that so far as the law was concerned it was enough it served not that hes consented to the other thing theres where i shall need your help atherton ill tell you what my plan is he stated it bluntly at first and then went over the ground and explained it fully as he had done at home atherton listened without permitting any sign of surprise to escape him but he listened with increasing gravity as if he heard something not expressed in hallecks slow somewhat nasal monotone and at the end he said i approve of any plan that will take you away for a while yes ill speak to your father about it  if you think you need any conviction i could use arguments to bring it about in you said halleck in recognition of his friends ready concurrence  no i dont need any arguments to convince me i believe returned atherton  then i wish youd say something to bring me round unless argument is used by somebody the plan always produces a cold chill in me halleck smiled but atherton kept a sober face i wish my spanish american was here what makes you think its a good plan why should i disappoint my fathers hopes again and wring my mothers heart by proposing to leave them for any such uncertain good as this scheme promises he still challenged his friend with a jesting air but a deeper and stronger feeling of some sort trembled in his voice  atherton would not reply to his emotion he answered with obvious evasion its a good cause in some sortthe best sortits a missionary work  thats what my mother said to me  and the change will be good for your health  thats what i said to my mother  atherton remained silent waiting apparently for halleck to continue or to end the matter there as he chose  it was some moments before halleck went on you would say wouldnt you that my first duty was to my own undertakings and to those who had a right to expect their fulfilment from me you would say that it was an enormity to tear myself away from the affection that clings to me in that home of mine yonder and that nothing but some supreme motive could justify me and yet you pretend to be satisfied with the reasons ive given you youre not dealing honestly with me atherton  no said atherton keeping the same scrutiny of hallecks face which he had bent upon him throughout but seeming now to hear his thoughts rather than his words i knew that you would have some supreme motive and if i have pretended to approve your scheme on the reasons you have given me i havent dealt honestly with you but perhaps a little dishonesty is the best thing under the circumstances you havent told me your real motive and i cant ask it  but you imagine it  yes  and what do you imagine that i have been disappointed in love that i have been rejected that the girl who had accepted me has broken her engagement something of that sort demanded halleck scornfully  atherton did not answer  oh how far you are from the truth how blest and proud and happy i should be if it were the truth he looked into his friends eyes and added bitterly youre not curious atherton you dont ask me what my trouble really is do you wish me to tell you what it is without asking  atherton kept turning a pencil end for end between his fingers while a compassionate smile slightly curved his lips no he said finally i think you had better not tell me your trouble i can believe very well without knowing it that its serious  oh tragic said halleck selfcontemptuously  but i doubt if it would help you to tell it ive too much respect for your good sense to suppose that its an unreality and i suspect that confession would only weaken you if you told me you would feel that you had made me a partner in your responsibility and you would be tempted to leave the struggle to me if youre battling with some temptation some selfbetrayal you must make the fight alone you would only turn to an ally to be flattered into disbelief of your danger or your culpability  halleck assented with a slight nod to each point that the lawyer made youre right he said but a man of your subtlety cant pretend that he doesnt know what the trouble is in such a simple case as mine  i dont know anything certainly returned atherton and as far as i can i refuse to imagine anything if your trouble concerns some one besides yourselfand no great trouble can concern one man aloneyouve no right to tell it  another daniel come to judgment  you must trust to your principles your selfrespect to keep you right  halleck burst into a harsh laugh and rose from his chair ah there you abdicate the judicial function principles selfrespect against that dont you suppose i was approached through my principles and selfrespect why the devil always takes a man on the very highest plane he knows all about our principles and selfrespect and what theyre made of how the noblest and purest attributes of our nature with which we trap each other so easily must amuse him pity rectitude moral indignation a blameless lifehe knows that theyre all instruments for him no sir no more principles and selfrespect for meive had enough of them theres nothing for me but to run and thats what im going to do but youre quite right about the other thing atherton and i give you a beggars thanks for telling me that my trouble isnt mine alone and ive no right to confide it to you it is mine in the sense that no other soul is defiled with the knowledge of it and im glad you saved me from the ghastly profanation the sacrilege of telling it i was sneaking round for your sympathy i did want somehow to shift the responsibility on to you to get yougod help meto flatter me out of my wholesome fear and contempt of myself well thats past now andgood night he abruptly turned away from atherton and swung himself on his cane toward the door  atherton took up his hat and coat ill walk home with you he said  all right returned halleck listlessly  how soon shall you go asked the lawyer when they were in the street  oh theres a ship sailing from new york next week said halleck in the same tone of weary indifference i shall go in that  they talked desultorily of other things  when they came to the foot of clover street halleck plucked his hand out of athertons arm im going up through here he said with sullen obstinacy  better not returned his friend quietly  will it hurt her if i stop to look at the outside of the house where she lives  it will hurt you said atherton  i dont wish to spare myself retorted halleck he shook off the touch that atherton had laid upon his shoulder and started up the hill the other overtook him and like a man who has attempted to rule a drunkard by thwarting his freak and then hopes to accomplish his end by humoring it he passed his arm through hallecks again and went with him but when they came to the house halleck did not stop he did not even look at it but atherton felt the deep shudder that passed through him  in the week that followed they met daily and hallecks broken pride no longer stayed him from the shame of open selfpity and wavering purpose atherton found it easier to persuade the clinging reluctance of the father and mother than to keep hallecks resolution for him halleck could no longer keep it for himself not much like the behavior of people we read of in similar circumstances he said once they never falter when they see the path of duty they push forward without looking to either hand or else he added with a hollow laugh at his own satire they turn their backs on itlike men well  he grew gaunt and visibly feeble in this struggle the two men changed places the plan for hallecks flight was no longer his own but athertons and when he did not rebel against it he only passively acquiesced the decent pretence of ignorance on athertons part necessarily disappeared in all but words the trouble stood openly confessed between them and it came to athertons saying in one of hallecks lapses of purpose from which it had required all the others strength to lift him dont come to me any more halleck with the hope that i shall somehow justify your evil against your good i pitied you at first but i blame you now  youre atrocious said halleck with a puzzled baffled look what do you mean  i mean that you secretly think you have somehow come by your evil virtuously and you want me to persuade you that it is different from other evils of exactly the same kindthat it is beautiful and sweet and pitiable and not ugly as hell and bitter as death to be torn out of you mercilessly and flung from you with abhorrence well i tell you that you are suffering guiltily for no man suffers innocently from such a cause you must go and you cant go too soon dont suppose that i find anything noble in your position i should do you a great wrong if i didnt do all i could to help you realize that youre in disgrace and that youre only making a choice of shames in running away suppose the truth was knownsuppose that those who hold you dear could be persuaded of itcould you hold up your head  do i hold up my head as it is asked halleck did you ever see a more abject dog than i am at this moment your wounds are faithful atherton but perhaps you might have spared me this last stab if you want to know i can assure you that i dont feel any melodramatic vainglory i know that im running away because im beaten but no other man can know the battle ive fought dont you suppose i know how hideous this thing is no one else can know it in all its ugliness he covered his face with his hands you are right he said when he could find his voice i suffer guiltily i must have known it when i seemed to be suffering for pitys sake i knew it before and when you said that love without marriage was a worse hell than any marriage without love you left me without refuge i had been trying not to face the truth but i had to face it then i came away in hell and i have lived in hell ever since i had tried to think it was a crazy fancy and put it on my failing health i used to make believe that some morning i should wake and find the illusion gone i abhorred it from the beginning as i do now it has been torment to me and yet somewhere in my lost soulthe blackest depth i dare saythis shame has been so sweetit is so sweetthe one sweetness of lifeah he dashed the weak tears from his eyes and rose and buttoned his coat about him well i shall go and i hope i shall never come back though you neednt mention this to my father as an argument for my going when you talk me over with him he added with a glimmer of his wonted irony he waited a moment and then turned upon his friend in sad upbraiding when i came to you a year and a half ago after i had taken that ruffian home drunk to herwhy didnt you warn me then atherton did you see any danger  atherton hesitated i knew that with your habit of suffering for other people it would make you miserable but i couldnt have dreamed this would come of it but youve never been out of your own keeping for a moment you are responsible and you are to blame if you are suffering now and can find no safety for yourself but in running away  thats true said halleck very humbly and i wont trouble you any more i cant go on sinning against her belief in me here and live i shall go on sinning against it there as long as i live but it seems to me the harm will be a little less yes i will go  but the night before he went he came to athertons lodging to tell him that he should not go atherton was not at home and halleck was spared this last dishonor he returned to his fathers house through the rain that was beginning to fall lightly and as he let himself in with his key olives voice said its ben and at the same time she laid her hand upon his arm with a nervous warning clutch hush come in here she drew him from the dimly lighted hall into the little receptionroom near the door the gas was burning brighter there and in the light he saw marcia white and still where she sat holding her baby in her arms they exchanged no greeting it was apparent that her being there transcended all usage and that they need observe none  ben will go home with you said olive soothingly is it raining she asked looking at her brothers coat i will get my waterproof  she left them a moment i have beenbeen walkingwalking about marcia panted it has got so darkimafraid to go home i hate totake you from themthe lastnight  halleck answered nothing he sat staring at her till olive came back with the waterproof and an umbrella then while his sister was putting the waterproof over marcias shoulders he said let me take the little one and gathered it with or without her consent from her arms into his the baby was sleeping it nestled warmly against him with a luxurious quiver under the shawl that olive threw round it you can carry the umbrella he said to marcia  they walked fast when they got out into the rainy dark and it was hard to shelter halleck as he limped rapidly on marcia ran forward once to see if her baby were safely kept from the wet and found that halleck had its little face pressed close between his neck and cheek dont be afraid he said im looking out for it  his voice sounded broken and strange and neither of them spoke again till they came in sight of marcias door then she tried to stop him she put her hand on his shoulder oh im afraidafraid to go in she pleaded  he halted and they stood confronted in the light of a street lamp her face was twisted with weeping why are you afraid he demanded harshly  we had a quarrel and ii ran awayi said that i would never come back i left him  you must go back to him said halleck hes your husband he pushed on again saying over and over as if the words were some spell in which he found safety you must go back you must go back you must go back  he dragged her with him now for she hung helpless on his arm which she had seized and moaned to herself at the threshold i cant go in she broke out im afraid to go in what will he say what will he do oh come in with me you are goodand then i shall not be afraid  you must go in alone no man can be your refuge from your husband here he released himself and kissing the warm little face of the sleeping child he pressed it into her arms his fingers touched hers under the shawl he tore his hand away with a shiver  she stood a moment looking at the closed door then she flung it open and pausing as if to gather her strength vanished into the brightness within  he turned and ran crookedly down the street wavering from side to side in his lameness and flinging up his arms to save himself from falling as he ran with a gesture that was like a wild and hopeless appeal     xxxiv   marcia pushed into the room where she had left bartley she had no escape from her fate she must meet it whatever it was the room was empty and she began doggedly to search the house for him up stairs and down carrying the child with her she would not have been afraid now to call him but she had no voice and she could not ask the servant anything when she looked into the kitchen she saw the traces of the meal he had made in the diningroom and when she went a second time to their chamber to lay the little girl down in her crib she saw the drawers pulled open and the things as he had tossed them about in packing his bag she looked at the clock on the mantelan extravagance of bartleys for which she had scolded himand it was only half past eight she had thought it must be midnight  she sat all night in a chair beside the bed in the morning she drowsed and dreamed that she was weeping on bartleys shoulder and he was joking her and trying to comfort her as he used to do when they were first married but it was the little girl sitting up in her crib and crying loudly for her breakfast she put on the child a pretty frock that bartley liked and when she had dressed her own tumbled hair she went down stairs feigning to herself that they should find him in the parlor the servant was setting the table for breakfast and the little one ran forward babys chair mammas chair papas chair  yes answered marcia so that the servant might hear too papa will soon be home  she persuaded herself that he had gone as before for the night and in this pretence she talked with the child at the table and she put aside some of the breakfast to be kept warm for bartley i dont know just when he may be in she explained to the girl the utterance of her pretence that she expected him encouraged her and she went about her work almost cheerfully  at dinner she said mr hubbard must have been called away somewhere we must get his dinner for him when he comes the things dry up so in the oven  she put flavia to bed early and then trimmed the fire and made the parlor cosey against bartleys coming she did not blame him for staying away the night before it was a just punishment for her wickedness and she should tell him so and tell him that she knew he never was to blame for anything about hannah morrison she enacted over and over in her mind the scene of their reconciliation in every step on the pavement he approached the door at last all the steps died away and the second night passed  her head was light and her brain confused with loss of sleep when the child called her from above and woke her out of her morning drowse she went to the kitchen and begged the servant to give the little one its breakfast saying that she was sick and wanted nothing herself she did not say anything about bartleys breakfast and she would not think anything the girl took the child into the kitchen with her and kept it there all day  olive halleck came during the forenoon and marcia told her that bartley had been unexpectedly called away to new york she added without knowing why  ben sailed from there today said olive sadly  yes assented marcia  we want you to come and take tea with us this evening olive began  oh i cant marcia broke in i mustnt be away when bartley gets back the thought was something definite in the sea of uncertainty on which she was cast away she never afterwards lost her hold of it she confirmed herself in it by other inventions she pretended that he had told her where he was going and then that he had written to her she almost believed these childish fictions as she uttered them at the same time in all her longing for his return she had a sickening fear that when he came back he would keep his parting threat and drive her away she did not know how he could do it but this was what she feared  she seldom left the house which at first she kept neat and pretty and then let fall into slatternly neglect she ceased to care for her dress or the childs the time came when it seemed as if she could scarcely move in the mystery that beset her life and she yielded to a deadly lethargy which paralyzed all her faculties but the instinct of concealment  she repelled the kindly approaches of the hallecks sometimes sending word to the door when they came that she was sick and could not see them or when she saw any of them repeating those hopeless lies concerning bartleys whereabouts and her expectations of his return  for the time she was safe against all kindly misgivings but there were some of bartleys creditors who grew impatient of his long absence and refused to be satisfied with her fables she had a few dollars left from some money that her father had given her at home and she paid these all out upon the demand of the firstcomer afterwards as other bills were pressed she could only answer with incoherent promises and evasions that scarcely served for the moment the pursuit of these people dismayed her it was nothing that certain of them refused further credit she would have known both for herself and her child how to go hungry and cold but there was one of them who threatened her with the law if she did not pay she did not know what he could do she had read somewhere that people who did not pay their debts were imprisoned and if that disgrace were all she would not care but if the law were enforced against her the truth would come out she would be put to shame before the world as a deserted wife and this when bartley had not deserted her the pride that had bidden her heart break in secret rather than suffer this shame even before itself was baffled her one blind device had been concealment and this poor refuge was possible no longer if all were not to know some one must know  the law with which she had been threatened might be instant in its operation she could not tell her mind wavered from fear to fear even while the man stood before her she perceived the necessity that was upon her and when he left her she would not allow herself a moments delay  she reached the events building in which mr atherton had his office just as a lady drove away in her coupé it was miss kingsbury who made a point of transacting all business matters with her lawyer at his office and of keeping her social relations with him entirely distinct as she fancied by this means she was only partially successful but at least she never talked business with him at her house and doubtless she would not have talked anything else with him at his office but for that increasing dependence upon him in everything which she certainly would not have permitted herself if she had realized it as it was she had now come to him in a state of nervous exaltation which was not businesslike she had been greatly shocked by ben hallecks sudden freak she had sympathized with his family till she herself felt the need of some sort of condolence and she had promised herself this consolation from athertons habitual serenity she did not know what to do when he received her with what she considered an impatient manner and did not seem at all glad to see her there was no reason why he should be glad to see a lady calling on business and no doubt he often found her troublesome but he had never shown it before she felt like crying at first then she passed through an epoch of resentment and then through a period of compassion for him she ended by telling him with dignified severity that she wanted some money they usually made some jokes about her destitution when she came upon that errand he looked surprised and vexed and i have spent what you gave me last month she explained  then you wish to anticipate the interest on your bonds  certainly not said clara rather sharply i wish to have the interest up to the present time  but i told you said atherton and he could not in spite of himself help treating her somewhat as a child i told you then that i was paying you the interest up to the first of november there is none due now didnt you understand that  no i didnt understand answered clara she allowed herself to add it is very strange atherton struggled with his irritation and made no reply i cant be left without money she continued what am i to do without it she demanded with an air of unanswerable argument why i must have it  i felt that i ought to understand you fully said atherton with cold politeness its only necessary to know what sum you require  clara flung up her veil and confronted him with an excited face mr atherton i dont wish a loan i cant permit it and you know that my principles are entirely against anticipating interest  atherton from stooping over his table pencil in hand leaned back in his chair and looked at her with a smile that provoked her then may i ask what you wish me to do  no i cant instruct you my affairs are in your hands but i must say she bit her lip however and did not say it on the contrary she asked rather feebly is there nothing due on anything  i went over it with you last month said atherton patiently and explained all the investments i could sell some stocks but this election trouble has disordered everything and i should have to sell at a heavy loss there are your mortgages and there are your bonds you can have any amount of money you want but you will have to borrow it  and that you know i wont do there should always be a sum of money in the bank said clara decidedly  i do my very best to keep a sum there knowing your theory but your practice is against me you draw too many checks said atherton laughing  very well cried the lady pulling down her veil then im to have nothing  you wont allow yourself to have anything atherton began but she interrupted him haughtily  it is certainly very odd that my affairs should be in such a state that i cant have all the money of my own that i want whenever i want it  athertons thin face paled a little more than usual i shall be glad to resign the charge of your affair miss kingsbury  and i shall accept your resignation cried clara magnificently whenever you offer it she swept out of the office and descended to her coupé like an incensed goddess she drew the curtains and began to cry at her door she bade the servant deny her to everybody and went to bed where she was visited a little later by olive halleck whom no ban excluded clara lavishly confessed her sin and sorrow why i went there more than half to sympathize with him about ben i dont need any money just yet and the first thing i knew i was accusing him of neglecting my interests and i dont know what all of course he had to say he wouldnt have anything more to do with them and i should have despised him if he hadnt and now i dont care what becomes of the property its never been anything but misery to me ever since i had it and i always knew it would get me into trouble sooner or later she whirled her face over into her pillow and sobbed but i didnt suppose it would ever make me insult and outrage the best friend i ever hadand the truest manand the noblest gentleman oh what will he think of me  olive remained sadly quiet as if but superficially interested in these transports and clara lifted her face again to say in her handkerchief its a shame olive to burden you with all this at a time when youve care enough of your own  oh im rather glad of somebody elses care it helps to take my mind off said olive  then what would you do asked clara tempted by the apparent sympathy with her in the effect of her naughtiness  you might make a party for him clara suggested olive with lacklustre irony  clara gave way to a loud burst of grief oh olive halleck i didnt suppose you could be so cruel  olive rose impatiently then write to him or go to him and tell him that youre ashamed of yourself and ask him to take your property back again  never cried clara who had listened with fascination what would he think of me  why need you care its purely a matter of business  yes  and you neednt mind what he thinks  of course admitted clara thoughtfully  he will naturally despise you added olive but i suppose he does that now  clara gave her friend as piercing a glance as her soft blue eyes could emit and detecting no sign of jesting in olives sober face she answered haughtily i dont see what right mr atherton has to despise me  oh no he must admire a girl who has behaved to him as youve done  claras hauteur collapsed and she began to truckle to olive if he were merely a business man i shouldnt mind it but knowing him socially as i do and as afriend andan acquaintance that way i dont see how i can do it  i wonder you didnt think of that before you accused him of fraud and peculation and all those things  i didnt accuse him of fraud and peculation cried clara indignantly  you said you didnt know what all youd called him said olive with her hand on the door  clara followed her down stairs well i shall never do it in the world she said with reviving hope in her voice  oh i dont expect you to go to him this morning said olive dryly that would be a little too barefaced  her friend kissed her olive halleck youre the strangest girl that ever was i do believe youd joke at the point of death but im so glad you have been perfectly frank with me and of course its worth worlds to know that you think ive behaved horridly and ought to make some reparation  im glad you value my opinion clara and if you come to me for frankness you can always have all you want its a drug in the market with me she meagrely returned claras embrace and left her in a reverie of tactless scheming for the restoration of peace with mr atherton  marcia came in upon the lawyer before he had thought after parting with miss kingsbury to tell the clerk in the outer office to deny him but she was too full of her own trouble to see the reluctance which it tasked all his strength to quell and she sank into the nearest chair unbidden at sight of her atherton became the prey of one of those fantastic repulsions in which men visit upon women the blame of others thoughts about them he censured her for hallecks wrong but in another instant he recognized his cruelty and atoned by relenting a little in his intolerance of her presence she sat gazing at him with a face of blank misery to which he could not refuse the charity of a prompting question is there something i can do for you mrs hubbard  oh i dont knowi dont know she had a folded paper in her hands which lay helpless in her lap after a moment she resumed in a hoarse low voice they have all begun to come for their money and this onethis one says he will have the law of mei dont know what he meansif i dont pay him  marcia could not know how hard atherton found it to govern the professional suspicion which sprung up at the question of money but he overruled his suspicion by an effort that was another relief to the struggle in which he was wrenching his mind from miss kingsburys outrageous behavior what have you got there he asked gravely and not unkindly and being used to prompt the reluctance of lady clients he put out his hand for the paper she held it was the bill of the threatening creditor for indefinitely repeated dozens of tivoli beer  why do they come to you with this  mr hubbard is away  oh yes i heard when do you expect him home  i dont know  where is he  she looked at him piteously without speaking  atherton stepped to his door and gave the order forgotten before then he closed the door and came back to marcia dont you know where your husband is mrs hubbard  oh he will come back he couldnt leave me hes deadi know hes dead but he will come back he only went away for the night and something must have happened to him  the whole tragedy of her life for the past fortnight was expressed in these wild and inconsistent words she had not been able to reason beyond the pathetic absurdities which they involved they had the effect of assertions confirmed in the belief by incessant repetition and doubtless she had said them to herself a thousand times atherton read in them not only the confession of her despair but a prayer for mercy which it would have been inhuman to deny and for the present he left her to such refuge from herself as she had found in them he said quietly you had better give me that paper mrs hubbard and took the bill from her if the others come with their accounts again you must send them to me when did you say mr hubbard left home  the night after the election said marcia  and he didnt say how long he should be gone pursued the lawyer in the feint that she had known he was going  no she answered  he took some things with him  yes  perhaps you could judge how long he meant to be absent from the preparation he made  ive never looked to see i couldnt  atherton changed the line of his inquiry does any one else know of this  no said marcia quickly i told mrs halleck and all of them that he was in new york and i said that i had heard from him i came to you because you were a lawyer and you would not tell what i told you  yes said atherton  i want it kept a secret oh do you think hes dead she implored  no returned atherton gravely i dont think hes dead  sometimes it seems to me i could bear it better if i knew he was dead if he isnt dead hes out of his mind hes out of his mind dont you think and hes wandered off somewhere  she besought him so pitifully to agree with her bending forward and trying to read the thoughts in his face that he could not help saying perhaps  a gush of grateful tears blinded her but she choked down her sobs  i said things to him that night that were enough to drive him crazy i was always the one in fault but he was always the one to make up first and he never would have gone away from me if he had known what he was doing but he will come back i know he will she said rising and oh you wont say anything to anybody will you and hell get back before they find out i will send those men to you and bartley will see about it as soon as he comes home  dont go mrs hubbard said the lawyer i want to speak with you a little longer she dropped again in her chair and looked at him inquiringly have you written to your father about this  oh no she answered quickly with an effect of shrinking back into herself  i think you had better do so you cant tell when your husband will return and you cant go on in this way  i will never tell father she replied closing her lips inexorably  the lawyer forbore to penetrate the family trouble he divined are you all alone in the house he asked  the girl is there and the baby  that wont do mrs hubbard said atherton with a compassionate shake of the head you cant go on living there alone  oh yes i can im not afraid to be alone she returned with the air of having thought of this  but he may be absent some time yet urged the lawyer he may be absent indefinitely you must go home to your father and wait for him there  i cant do that he must find me here when he comes she answered firmly  but how will you stay pleaded atherton he had to deal with an unreasonable creature who could not be driven and he must plead you have no money and how can you live  oh replied marcia with the air of having thought of this too i will take boarders  atherton smiled at the hopeless practicality and shook his head but he did not oppose her directly mrs hubbard he said earnestly you have done well in coming to me but let me convince you that this is a matter which cant be kept it must be known before you can begin to help yourself you must let others help you either you must go home to your father and let your husband find you there  he must find me here in our own house  then you must tell your friends here that you dont know where he is nor when he will return and let them advise together as to what can be done you must tell the hallecks  i will never tell them cried marcia let me go i can starve there and freeze and if he finds me dead in the house none of them shall have the right to blame himto say that he left methat he deserted his little child oh oh oh oh what shall i do  the hapless creature shook with the thickcoming sobs that overpowered her now and atherton refrained once more she did not seem ashamed before him of the sorrows which he felt it a sacrilege to know and in a blind instinctive way he perceived that in proportion as he was a stranger it was possible for her to bear her disgrace in his presence he spoke at last from the hint he found in this fact will you let me mention the matter to miss kingsbury  she looked at him with sad intensity in the eyes as if trying to fathom any nether thought that he might have it must have seemed to her at first that he was mocking her but his words brought her the only relief from her selfupbraiding she had known to suffer kindness from miss kingsbury would be in some sort an atonement to bartley for the wrong her jealousy had done him it would be selfsacrifice for his sake it would be expiation yes tell her she answered with a promptness whose obscure motive was not illumined by the flash of passionate pride with which she added i shall not care for her  she rose again and atherton did not detain her but when she had left him he lost no time in writing to her father the facts of the case as her visit had revealed them he spoke of her reluctance to have her situation known to her family but assured the squire that he need have no anxiety about her for the present he promised to keep him fully informed in regard to her and to telegraph the first news of mr hubbard he left the squire to form his own conjectures and to take whatever action he thought best for his own part he had no question that hubbard had abandoned his wife and had stolen hallecks money and the detectives to whom he went were clear that it was a case of european travel     xxxv   atherton went from the detectives to miss kingsbury and boldly resisted the interdict at her door sending up his name with the message that he wished to see her immediately on business she kept him waiting while she made a frightened toilet and leaving the letter to him which she had begun half finished on her desk she came down to meet him in a flutter of despondent conjecture he took her mechanically yielded hand and seated himself on the sofa beside her i sent word that i had come on business he said but it is no affair of yoursshe hardly knew whether to feel relieved or disappointedexcept as you make all unhappy peoples affairs your own  oh she murmured in meek protest and at the same time she remotely wondered if these affairs were his  i came to you for help he began again and again she interrupted him in deprecation  you are very good afterafterwhat iwhat happenedim sure she put up her fan to her lips and turned her head a little aside of course i shall be glad to help you in anything mr atherton you know i always am  yes and that gave me courage to come to you even after the way in which we parted this morning i knew you would not misunderstand me  no said clara softly doing her best to understand him  or think me wanting in delicacy  oh no no  if i believed that we need not have any embarrassment in meeting in behalf of the poor creature who came to see me just after you left me the fact is he went on i felt a little freer to promise your interest since i had no longer any business relation to you and could rely on your kindness likelikeany other  yes assented clara faintly and she forbore to point out to him as she might fitly have done that he had never had the right to advise or direct her at which he hinted except as she expressly conferred it from time to time i shall be only too glad  and i will have a statement of your affairs drawn up tomorrow and sent to you her heart sank she ceased to move the fan which she had been slowly waving back and forth before her face i was going to set about it this morning but mrs hubbards visit  mrs hubbard cried clara and a little air of pique qualified her despair  yes she is in troublethe greatest her husband has deserted her  oh mr atherton claras mind was now far away from any concern for herself the woman whose husband has deserted her supremely appeals to all other women i cant believe it what makes you think so  what she concealed rather than what she told me i believe answered atherton he ran over the main points of their interview and summed up his own conjectures i know from things halleck has let drop that they havent always lived happily together hubbard has been speculating with borrowed money and hes in debt to everybody shes been alone in her house for a fortnight and she only came to me because people had begun to press her for money shes been pretending to the hallecks that she hears from her husband and knows where he is  oh poor poor thing said clara too shocked to say more then they dont know  no one knows but ourselves she came to me because i was a comparative stranger and it would cost her less to confess her trouble to me than to them and she allowed me to speak to you for very much the same reason  but i know she dislikes me  so much the better she cant doubt your goodness  oh  and if she dislikes you she can keep her pride better with you  clara let her eyes fall and fingered the edges of her fan there was reason in this and she did not care that the opportunity of usefulness was personally unflattering since he thought her capable of rising above the fact what do you want me to do she asked lifting her eyes docilely to his  you must find some one to stay with her in her house till she can be persuaded to leave it and you must lend her some money till her father can come to her or write to her ive just written to him and ive told her to send all her bills to me but im afraid she may be in immediate need  terrible sighed clara to whom the destitution of an acquaintance was appalling after all her charitable knowledge of want and suffering of course we mustnt lose a moment she added but she lingered in her corner of the sofa to discuss ways and means with him and to fathom that sad enjoyment which comfortable people find in the contemplation of alien sorrows it was not her fault if she felt too kindly toward the disaster that had brought atherton back to her on the old terms or if she arranged her plans for befriending marcia in her desolation with too buoyant a cheerfulness but she took herself to task for the radiant smile she found on her face when she ran up stairs and looked into her glass to see how she looked in parting with atherton she said to herself that he would think her perfectly heartless  she decided that it would be indecent to drive to marcias under the circumstances and she walked though with all the time this gave her for reflection she had not wholly banished this smile when she looked into marcias woebegone eyes but she found herself incapable of the awkwardnesses she had deliberated and fell back upon the native motherliness of her heart into which she took marcia with sympathy that ignored everything but her need of help and pity marcias bruised pride was broken before the goodness of the girl she had hated and she performed her sacrifice to bartleys injured memory not with the haughty selfdevotion which she intended should humiliate miss kingsbury but with the prostration of a woman spent with watching and fasting and despair she held clara away for a moment of scrutiny and then submitted to the embrace in which they recognized and confessed all  it was scarcely necessary for clara to say that mr atherton had told her marcia already knew that and clara became a partisan of her theory of bartleys absence almost without an effort in spite of the facts that atherton had suggested to the contrary of course he has wandered off somewhere and at soon as he comes to his senses he will hurry home why i was reading of such a case only the other daythe case of a minister who wandered off in just the same way and found himself out in western new york somewhere after he had been gone three mouths  bartley wont be gone three months protested marcia  certainly not cried clara in severe selfrebuke then she talked of his return for a while as if it might be expected any moment in the mean time she added you must stay here youre quite right about that too but you mustnt stay here alone hed be quite as much shocked at that as if he found you gone when he came back im going to ask you to let my friend miss strong stay with you and she must pay her board and you must let me lend you all the money you need and dearclara dropped her voice to a lower and gentler noteyou mustnt try to keep this from your friends you must let mr atherton write to your father you must let me tell the hallecks theyll be hurt if you dont you neednt be troubled of course he wandered off in a temporary hallucination and nobody will think differently  she adopted the fiction of bartleys aberration with so much fervor that she even silenced athertons injurious theories with it when he came in the evening to learn the result of her intervention she had forgotten or she ignored the facts as he had stated them in the morning she was now bartleys valiant champion as well as the tender protector of marcia she was the equal friend of the whole exemplary hubbard family  atherton laughed and she asked what he was laughing at  oh he answered at something ben halleck once said a real woman can make righteousness delicious and virtue piquant  clara reflected i dont know whether i like that she said finally  no said atherton why not  she was serving him with an afterdinner cup of tea which she had brought into the drawingroom and in putting the second lump of sugar into his saucer she paused again thoughtfully holding the little cube in the tongs she was rather elaborately dressed for so simple an occasion and her silken train coiled itself far out over the mossy depth of the moquette carpet the pale blue satin of the furniture and the delicate white and gold of the decorations became her wonderfully  i cant say exactly it seems depreciatory somehow as a generalization but a man might say it of the woman he was in love with she concluded  and you wouldnt approve of a mans saying it of the woman his friend was in love with pursued atherton taking his cup from her  if they were very close friends she did not know why but she blushed and then grew a little pale  i understand what you mean he said and i shouldnt have liked the speech from another kind of man but hallecks innocence characterized it he stirred his tea and then let it stand untasted in his abstraction  yes he is good sighed clara if he were not so good it would be hard to forgive him for disappointing all their hopes in the way hes done  its the best thing he could have done said atherton gravely even severely  i know you advised it asserted clara but its a great blow to them how strange that mr hubbard should have disappeared the last night ben was at home im glad that he got away without knowing anything about it  atherton drank off his tea and refused a second cup with a gesture of his hand yes so am i he said im glad of every league of sea he puts behind him he rose as if eager to leave the subject  clara rose too with the patient acquiescence of a woman and took his hand proffered in parting they had certainly talked out but there seemed no reason why he should go he held her hand while he asked how shall i make my peace with you  my peace what for she flushed joyfully i was the one in fault  he looked at her mystified why surely you didnt repeat hallecks remark  oh she cried indignantly withdrawing her hand i meant this morning it doesnt matter she added if you still wish to resign the charge of my affairs of course i must submit but i thoughti thought she did not go on she was too deeply hurt up to this moment she had imagined that she had befriended marcia and taken all that trouble upon herself for goodness sake but now she was ready to upbraid him for ingratitude in not seeing that she had done it for his sake you can send me the statement and thenand theni dont know what i shall do why do you mind what i said ive often said quite as much before and you know that i didnt mean it i want you to take my property back again and never to mind anything i say im not worth minding her intended upbraiding had come to this pitiful effect of selfcontempt and her hand somehow was in his again do take it back  if i do that said atherton gravely i must make my conditions and now they sat down together on the sofa from which he had risen i cant be subjected again to yourdisappointmentshe arrested with a motion of his hand the profuse expression of her penitence and good intentionsand ive felt for a long time that this was no attitude for your attorney you ought to have the right to question and censure but i confess i cant grant you this ive allowed myself to make your interests too much my own in everything to be able to bear it ive thought several times that i ought to give up the trust but it seemed like giving up so much more that i never had the courage to do it in cold blood this morning you gave me my chance to do it in hot blood and if i resume it i must make my terms  it seemed a long speech to clara who sometimes thought she knew whither it tended and sometimes not she said in a low voice yes  i must be relieved continued atherton of the sense ive had that it was indelicate in me to keep it while i felt as ive grown to feeltowards you he stopped if i take it back you must come with it he suddenly concluded  the inconsistency of accepting these conditions ought to have struck a woman who had so long imagined herself the chase of fortunehunters but clara apparently found nothing alarming in the demand of a man who openly acted upon his knowledge of what could only have been matter of conjecture to many suitors she had snubbed she found nothing incongruous in the transaction and she said with as tremulous breath and as swift a pulse as if the question had been solely of herself i acceptthe conditions  in the long happy talk that lasted till midnight they did not fail to recognize that but for their common pity of marcia they might have remained estranged and they were decently ashamed of their bliss when they thought of misery like hers when atherton rose to bid clara good night marcia was still watching for bartley indulging for the last time the folly of waiting for him as if she definitely expected him that night  every night since he disappeared she had kept the lights burning in the parlor and hall and drowsed before the fire till the dawn drove her to a few hours of sleep in bed but with the coming of the stranger who was to be her companion she must deny herself even this consolation and openly accept the fact that she no longer expected bartley at any given time she bitterly rebelled at the loss of her solitude in which she could be miserable in whatever way her sorrow prompted and the pangs with which she had submitted to miss kingsburys kindness grew sharper hour by hour till she maddened in a frenzy of resentment against the cruelty of her expiation she longed for the day to come that she might go to her and take back her promises and her submission and fling her insulting goodwill in her face she said to herself that no one should enter her door again till bartley opened it she would die there in the house she and her baby and as she stood wringing her hands and moaning over the sleeping little one a hideous impulse made her brain reel she wished to look if bartley had left his pistol in its place a cry for help against herself broke from her she dropped upon her knees  the day came and the hope and strength which the mere light so strangely brings to the sick in spirit as well as the sick in body visited marcia she abhorred the temptation of the night like the remembrance of a wicked dream and she went about with a humble and grateful prayerto something to some onein her heart her housewifely pride stirred again that girl should not think she was a slattern and miss strong when she preceded her small trunk in the course of the forenoon found the parlor and the guestchamber which she was to have swept and dusted and set in perfect order by marcias hands she had worked with fury and kept her heartache still but it began again at sight of the girl fortunately the conservatory pupil had embraced with even more than miss kingsburys ardor the theory of bartleys aberration and she met marcia with a sympathy in her voice and eyes that could only have come from sincere conviction she was a simple country thing who would never be a prima donna but the overflowing sentimentality which enabled her to accept herself at the estimate of her enthusiastic fellowvillagers made her of far greater comfort to marcia than the sublimest musical genius would have done she worshipped the heroine of so tragic a fact and her heart began to go out to her in honest helpfulness from the first she broke in upon the monotony of marcias days with the offices and interests of wholesome commonplace and exorcised the ghostly silence with her first stroke on the pianowhich bartley had bought on the instalment plan and had not yet paid for  in fine life adjusted itself with marcia to the new conditions as it does with women less wofully widowed by death who promise themselves reunion with their lost in another world and suffer through the first weeks and days in the hope that their parting will be for but days or weeks and then gradually submit to indefinite delay she prophesied bartleys return and fixed it in her own mind for this hour and that now in the morning i shall wake and find him standing by the bed no at night he will come in and surprise us at dinner she cheated herself with increasing faith at each renewal of her hopes when she ceased to formulate them at last it was because they had served their end and left her established if not comforted in the superstition by which she lived his return at any hour or any moment was the fetish which she let no misgiving blaspheme everything in her of woman and of wife consecrated it she kept the child in continual remembrance of him by talking of him and by making her recognize the photographs in which bartley had abundantly perpetuated himself at night when she folded the little ones hands for prayer she made her pray god to take care of poor papa and send him home soon to mamma she was beginning to canonize him  her father came to see her as soon as he thought it best after athertons letter and the old man had to endure talk of bartley to which all her former praises were as refreshing shadows of defamation she required him to agree with everything she said and he could not refuse she reproached him for being with herself the cause of all bartleys errors and he had to bear it without protest at the end he could say nothing but better come home with me marcia and he suffered in meekness the indignation with which she rebuked him i will stay in bartleys house till he comes back to me if he is dead i will die here  the old man had satisfied himself that bartley had absconded in his own rascally right mind and he accepted with tacit grimness the theory of the detectives that he had not gone to europe alone he paid back the money which bartley had borrowed from halleck and he set himself as patiently as he could to bear with marcias obstinacy it was a mania which must be indulged for the time and he could only trust to atherton to keep him advised concerning her when he offered her money at parting she hesitated but she finally took it saying bartley will pay it back every cent as soon as he gets home and if she added he doesnt get back soon i will take some other boarders and pay it myself  he could see that she was offended with him for asking her to go home but she was his girl he only pitied her he shook hands with her as usual and kissed her with the old stoicism but his lips set to fierceness by the lifelong habit of sarcasm trembled as he turned away she was eager to have him go for she had given him miss strongs room and had taken the girl into her own and bartley would not like it if he came back and found her there  bartleys disappearance was scarcely a days wonder with people outside his own circle in that time of anxiety for a fair count in louisiana and florida and long before the returning boards had partially relieved the tension of the public mind by their decision he had quite dropped out of it the reporters who called at his house to get the bottom facts in the case adopted marcias theory given them by miss strong and whatever were their own suspicions or convictions paragraphed him with merciful brevity as having probably wandered away during a temporary hallucination they spoke of the depression of spirits which many of his friends had observed in him and of pecuniary losses as the cause they mentioned his possible suicide only to give the report the authoritative denial of his family and they added that the case was in the hands of the detectives who believed themselves in possession of important clews the detectives in fact remained constant to their original theory that bartley had gone to europe and they were able to name with reasonable confidence the person with whom he had eloped but these were matters hushed up among the force and the press in the mean time bartley had been simultaneously seen at montreal and cincinnati at about the same time that an old friend had caught a glimpse of him on a train bound westward from chicago  so far as the world was concerned the surmise with which marcia saved herself from final despair was the only impression that even vaguely remained of the affair her friends who had compassionately acquiesced in it at first waited for the moment when they could urge her to relinquish it and go home to her father but while they waited she gathered strength to establish herself immovably in it and to shape her life more and more closely about it she had no idea no instinct but to stay where he had left her till he came back she opposed this singly and solely against all remonstrance and treated every suggestion to the contrary as an instigation to crime her father came from time to time during the winter to see her but she would never go home with him even for a day she put her plan in force she took other boarders other girl students like miss strong whom her friends brought her when they found that it was useless to oppose her and so began to abet her she worked hard and she actually supported herself at last in a frugal independence her father consulted with atherton and the hallecks he saw that she was with good and faithful friends and he submitted to what he could not help when the summer came he made a last attempt to induce her to go home with him he told her that her mother wished to see her she would not understand ill come she said if mother gets seriously sick but i cant go home for the summer if i hadnt been at home last summer he would never have got into that way and it would never have happened  she went home at last in obedience to a peremptory summons but her mother was too far gone to know her when she came her quiet narrow life had grown colder and more inward to the end and it passed without any apparent revival of tenderness for those once dear to her the funeral publicity that followed seemed a final touch of the fate by which all her preferences had been thwarted in the world  marcia stayed only till she could put the house in order after they had laid her mother to rest among the early reddening sumacs under the hot glare of the august sun and when she came away she brought her father with her to boston where he spent his days as he might taking long and aimless walks devouring heaps of newspapers rusting in idleness and aging fast as men do in the irksomeness of disuse  hallecks father was beginning to show his age too and hallecks mother lived only in her thoughts of him and her hopes of his return but he did not even speak of this in his letters to them he said very little of himself and they could merely infer that the experiment to which he had devoted himself was becoming less and less satisfactory their sense of this added its pang to their unhappiness in his absence  one day marcia said to olive halleck has any one noticed that you are beginning to look like your sisters  ive noticed it answered the girl i always was an old maid and now im beginning to show it  marcia wondered if she had not hurt olives feelings but she would never have known how to excuse herself and latterly she had been growing more and more like her father in certain traits perhaps her passion for bartley had been the one spring of tenderness in her nature and if ever it were spent she would stiffen into the old mans stern aridity     xxxvi   it was nearly two years after athertons marriage that halleck one day opened the door of the lawyers private office and turning the key in the lock limped forward to where the latter was sitting at his desk halleck was greatly changed the full beard that he had grown scarcely hid the savage gauntness of his face but the change was not so much in lines and contours as in that expression of qualities which we call looks  well atherton  halleck you  the friends looked at each other and atherton finally broke from his amaze and offered his hand with an effect even then of making conditions but it was halleck who was the first to speak again  how is she is she well is she still here have they heard anything from him yet  no said atherton answering the last question with the same provisional effect as before  then he is dead thats what i knew thats what i said and here i am the fight is over and thats the end of it im beaten  you look it said atherton sadly  oh yes i look it thats the reason i can afford to be frank in coming back to my friends i knew that with this look in my face i should make my own welcome and its cordial even beyond my expectations  im not glad to see you halleck said atherton for your own sake i wish you were at the other end of the world  oh i know that how are my people have you seen my father lately or my mother orolive a pathetic tremor shook his voice  why havent you seen them yet demanded atherton  halleck laughed cynically my dear friend my steamer arrived this morning and im just off the new york train ive hurried to your office in all the impatience of friendship im very lucky to find you here so late in the day you can take me home to dinner and let your domestic happiness preach to me come i rather like the notion of that  halleck said atherton without heeding his banter i wish you would go away again no one knows you are here you say and no one need ever know it  halleck set his lips and shook his head with a mocking smile im surprised at you atherton with your knowledge of human nature ive come to stay you must know that you must know that i had gone through everything before i gave up and that i havent the strength to begin the struggle over again i tell you im beaten and im glad of it for there is rest in it you would waste your breath if you talked to me in the old way theres nothing in me to appeal to any more if i was wrongbut i dont admit any more that i was wrong by heaven i was right  you are beaten halleck said atherton sorrowfully he pushed himself back in his chair and clasped his hands together behind his head as his habit was in reasoning with obstinate clients what do you propose to do  i propose to stay  what for  what for till i can prove that he is dead  and then  then i shall be free to ask her he added angrily you know what ive come back for why do you torment me with these questions i did what i could i ran away and the last night i saw her i thrust her back into that hell she called her home and i told her that no man could be her refuge from that devil her husbandwhen she had begged me in her mortal terror to go in with her and save her from him that was the recollection i had to comfort me when i tried to put her out of my mindout of my soul when i heard that he was gone i respected her days of mourning god knows how i endured it now its over but i did endure it i waited and here i am and you ask me to go away again ah he fetched his breath through his set teeth and struck his fist on his knee he is dead and now if she will she can marry me dont look at me as if i had killed him there hasnt been a time in these two infernal years when i wouldnt have given my life to save hisfor her sake i know that and that gives me courage it gives me hope  but if he isnt dead  then he has abandoned her and she has the right to be free she can get a divorce  oh said atherton compassionately has that poison got into you halleck you might ask her if she were a widow to marry you but how will you ask her if shes still a wife to get a divorce and then marry you how will you suggest that to a woman whose constancy to her mistake has made her sacred to you halleck seemed about to answer but he only panted drylipped and openmouthed and atherton continued you would have to corrupt her soul first i dont know what change youve made in yourself during these two years you look like a desperate and defeated man but you dont look like that you dont look like one of those scoundrels who lure women from their duty ruin homes and destroy society not in the old libertine fashion in which the seducer had at least the grace to risk his life but safely smoothly under the shelter of our infamous laws have you really come back here to give your fathers honest name and the example of a man of your own blameless life in support of conditions that tempt people to marry with a mental reservation and that weaken every marriage bond with the guilty hope of escape whenever a fickle mind or secret lust or wicked will may dictate have you come to join yourself to those miserable spectres who go shrinking through the world afraid of their own past and anxious to hide it from those they hold dear or do you propose to defy the world to help form within it the community of outcasts with whom shame is not shame nor dishonor dishonor how will you like the society of those uncertain men those certain women  you are very eloquent said halleck but i ask you to observe that these little abstractions dont interest me ive a concrete purpose and i cant contemplate the effect of other peoples actions upon american civilization when you ask me to believe that i oughtnt to try to rescue a woman from the misery to which a villain has left her simply because some justice of the peace consecrated his power over her i decline to be such a fool i use my reason and i see who it was that defiled and destroyed that marriage and i know that she is as free in the sight of god as if he had never lived if the world doesnt like my open shame let it look to its own secret shamethe marriages made and maintained from interest and ambition and vanity and folly i will take my chance with the men and women who have been honest enough to own their mistake and to try to repair it and i will preach by my life that marriage has no sanctity but what love gives it and that when love ceases marriage ceases before heaven if the laws have come to recognize that by whatever fiction so much the better for the laws halleck rose  well then cried atherton rising too you shall meet me on your own ground this poor creature is constant in every breath she draws to the ruffian who has abandoned her i must believe since you say it that you are ready to abet her in getting a divorce even one of those divorces that are obtained without publicity and for any causehalleck wincedthat you are willing to put your sisters to shame before the world to break your mothers heart and your fathers prideto insult the ideal of goodness that she herself has formed of you but how will you begin the love on her part at least hasnt ceased has the marriage  she shall tell me answered halleck he left atherton without another word and in resentment that effaced all friendship between them though after this parting they still kept up its outward forms and the athertons took part in the rejoicings with which the hallecks celebrated bens return his meeting with the lawyer was the renewal of the old conflict on terms of novel and hopeless degradation he had mistaken for peace that exhaustion of spirit which comes to a man in battling with his conscience he had fancied his struggle over and he was to learn now that its anguish had just begun in that delusion his love was to have been a law to itself able to loose and to bind and potent to beat down all regrets all doubts all fears that questioned it but the words with which marcia met him struck his passion dumb  oh i am so glad you have come lack she said now i know that we can find him you were such friends with him and you understood him so well that you will know just what to do yes we shall find him now and we should have found him long ago if you had been here oh if you had never gone away but i can never be grateful enough for what you said to me that night when you would not come in with me the words have rung in my ears ever since they showed that you had faith in him more faith than i had and ive made them my rule and my guide no one has been my refuge from him and no one ever shall be and i thank youyes i thank you on my bended kneesfor making me go into the house alone its my one comfort that i had the strength to come back to him and let him do anything he would to me after i had treated him so but ive never pretended it was my own strength i have always told everybody that the strength came from you  halleck had brought olive with him she and marcias father listened to these words with the patience of people who had heard them many times before but at the end olive glanced at hallecks downcast face with fond pride in the satisfaction she imagined they must give him the old man ruminated upon a bit of broom straw and absently let the little girl catch by his hands as she ran to and fro between him and her mother while her mother talked halleck made a formless sound in his throat for answer and marcia went on  ive got a new plan now but it seems as if father took a pleasure in discouraging all my plans i know that bartleys shut up somewhere in some asylum and i want them to send detectives to all the asylums in the united states and in canadayou cant tell how far off he would wander in that stateand inquire if any stray insane person has been brought to them doesnt it seem to you as if that would be the right way to find him i want to talk it all over with you mr halleck for i know you can sympathize with me and if need be i will go to the asylums myself i will walk to them i will crawl to them on my knees when i think of him shut up there among those raving maniacs and used as they use people in some of the asylumsoh oh oh oh  she broke out into sobs and caught her little girl to her breast the child must have been accustomed to her mothers tears she twisted her head round and looked at halleck with a laughing face  marcia dried her eyes and asked with quivering lips isnt she like him  yes replied halleck huskily  she has his long eyelashes exactly and his hair and complexion hasnt she  the old man sat chewing his broom straw in silence but when marcia left the room to get bartleys photograph so that halleck might see the childs resemblance to him her father looked at halleck from under his beetling brows i dont think we need trouble the asylums much for bartley hubbard but if it was to search the states prisons and the jails the rumholes and the gamblinghells or if it was to dig up the scoundrels who have been hung under assumed names during the last two years i should have some hopes of identifying him  marcia came back and the old man sat in castiron quiet as if he had never spoken it was clear that whatever hate he felt for bartley he spared her and that if he discouraged her plans as she said it was because they were infected by the craze in which she canonized bartley  you see how she is said olive when they came away  yes yes yes halleck desolately assented  sometimes she seems to me just like a querulous vulgar middleaged woman in her talk she repeats herself in the same scolding sort of way and shes so eager to blame somebody besides bartley for bartleys wickedness that when she cant punish herself she punishes her father shes merciless to that wretched old man and hes wearing his homesick life out here in the city for her sake you heard her just now about his discouraging her plans  yes said halleck as before  shes grown commoner and narrower but its hardly her fault poor thing and it seems terribly unjust that she should be made so by what she has suffered but thats just the way it has happened shes so undisciplined that she couldnt get any good out of her misfortunes shes only got harm theyve made her selfish and there seems to be nothing left of what she was two years ago but her devotion to that miserable wretch you mustnt let it turn you against her ben you mustnt forget what she might have been she had a rich nature but how its been wasted and turned back upon itself poor untrained impulsive innocent creaturemy heart aches for her its been hard to bear with her at times terribly hard and youll find it so ben but you must bear with her the awfulest thing about people in trouble is that they are such bores they tire you to death but youll only have to stand her praises of what bartley was and we had to stand them and her hopes of what you would be if you were only at home besides i dont know what all she expects of you but you must try not to disappoint her she worships the ground you tread on and i really think she believes you can do anything you will just because youre good  halleck listened in silence he was indeed helpless to be otherwise than constant with shame and grief in his heart he could only vow her there the greater fealty because of the change he found in her  he was doomed at every meeting to hear her glorify a man whom he believed a heartless traitor to plot with her for the rescue from imaginary captivity of the wretch who had cruelly forsaken her he actually took some of the steps she urged he addressed inquiries to the insane asylums far and near and in these futile endeavors made only with the desire of failure his own reason seemed sometimes to waver she insisted that atherton should know all the steps they were taking and his sense of his old friends exact and perfect knowledge of his motives was a keener torture than even her fathers silent scorn of his efforts or the worship in which his own family held him for them     xxxvii   halleck had come home in broken health and had promised his family with the selfcontempt that depraves not to go away again since the change had done him no good there was no talk for the present of his trying to do anything but to get well and for a while under the strong excitement he seemed to be better but suddenly he failed he kept his room and then he kept his bed and the weeks stretched into months before he left it  when the spring weather came he was able to go out again and he spent most of his time in the open air feeling every day a fresh accession of strength at the end of one long april afternoon he walked home with a light heart whose right to rejoice he would not let his conscience question he had met marcia in the public garden where they sat down on a bench and talked while her father and the little girl wandered away in the restlessness of age and the restlessness of childhood  we are going home to equity this summer she said and perhaps we shall not come back no we shall not come back i have given up i have waited hopinghoping but now i know that it is no use waiting any longer he is dead she spoke in tearless resignation and the peace of accepted widowhood seemed to diffuse itself around her  her words repeated themselves to halleck as he walked homeward he found the postman at the door with a newspaper which he took from him with a smile at its veteran appearance and its probable adventures in reaching him the wrapper seemed to have been several times slipped off and then slit up it was tied with a string now and was scribbled with rejections in the hands of various hallocks and halletts one of whom had finally indorsed upon it try 97 rumford street it was originally addressed as he made out to mr b halleck boston mass and he carried it to his room before he opened it with a careless surmise as to its interest for him it proved to be a flimsy shabbily printed country newspaper with an advertisement marked in one corner      state of indiana tecumseh county      in tecumseh circuit court april term 1879      bartley j hubbard      vs      marcia g hubbard      divorce no 5793      it appearing by affidavit this day filed in the office of the clerk of     the tecumseh circuit court that marcia g hubbard defendant in the     above entitled action for divorce on account of abandonment and gross     neglect of duty is a nonresident of the state of indiana notice of     the pendency of such action is therefore hereby given said defendant     above named and that the same will be called for answer on the 11th     day of april 1879 the same being the 3d judicial day of the april     term of said court for said year which said term of said court will     begin on the first monday in april 1879 and will be held at the court     house in the town of tecumseh in said county and state said 11th day     of april 1879 being the time fixed by said plaintiff by indorsement     on his complaint at which said time said defendant is required to     answer herein      witness my hand and the seal of the said court this 4th day of march     1879      augustus h hawkins      clerk      seal      milikin  ayres attys for plff  halleck read this advertisement again and again with a dull mechanical action of the brain he saw the familiar names but they were hopelessly estranged by their present relation to each other the legal jargon reached no intelligence in him that could grasp its purport  when his daze began to yield he took evidence of his own reality by some such tests as one might in waking from a long faint he looked at his hands his feet he rose and looked at his face in the glass turning about he saw the paper where he had left it on the table it was no illusion he picked up the cover from the floor and scanned it anew trying to remember the handwriting on it to make out who had sent this paper to him and why then the address seemed to grow into something different under his eye it ceased to be his name he saw now that the paper was directed to mrs b hubbard and that by a series of accidents and errors it had failed to reach her in its wanderings and by a final blunder had fallen into his hands  once solved it was a very simple affair and he had now but to carry it to her that was very simple too or he might destroy it this was equally simple her words repeated themselves once more i have given up he is dead why should he break the peace she had found and destroy her last sad illusion why should he not spare her the knowledge of this final wrong and let the merciful injustice accomplish itself the questions seemed scarcely to have any personal concern for halleck his temptation wore a heavenly aspect it softly pleaded with him to forbear like something outside of himself it was when he began to resist it that he found it the breath in his nostrils the blood in his veins then the mask dropped and the enemy of souls put forth his power against this weak spirit enfeebled by long strife and defeat already acknowledged  at the end halleck opened his door and called olive olive in a voice that thrilled the girl with strange alarm where she sat in her own room she came running and found him clinging to his doorpost pale and tremulous i want youwant you to help me he gasped i want to show you somethinglook here  he gave her the paper which he had kept behind him clutched fast in his hand as if he feared it might somehow escape him at last and staggered away to a chair  his sister read the notice oh ben she dropped her hands with the paper in them before her a gesture of helpless horror and pity and looked at him does she know it has she seen it  no one knows it but you and i the paper was left here for me by mistake i opened it before i saw that it was addressed to her  he panted forth these sentences in an exhaustion that would have terrified her if she had not been too full of indignant compassion for marcia to know anything else she tried to speak  dont you understand olive this is the notice that the law requires she shall have to come and defend her cause and it has been sent by the clerk of the court there to the address that villain must have given in the knowledge that it could reach her only by one chance in ten thousand  and it has come to you oh ben who sent it to you the brother and sister looked at each other but neither spoke the awestricken thought that was in both their hearts ben she cried in a solemn ecstasy of love and pride i would rather be you this minute than any other man in the world  dont pleaded halleck his head dropped and then he lifted it by a sudden impulse olivebut the impulse failed and he only said i want you to go to atherton with me we mustnt lose time have cyrus get a carriage go down and tell them were going out ill be ready as soon as you are  but when she called to him from below that the carriage had come and she was waiting he would have refused to go with her if he durst he no longer wished to keep back the fact but he felt an invalids weariness of it a sick mans inadequacy to the farther demands it should make upon him he crept slowly down the stairs keeping a tremulous hold upon the rail and he sank with a sigh against the carriage cushions answering olives eager questions and fervid comments with languid monosyllables  they found the athertons at coffee and clara would have them come to the diningroom and join them halleck refused the coffee and while olive told what had happened he looked listlessly about the room aware of a perverse sympathy with bartley from bartleys point of view bartley might never have gone wrong if he had had all that luxury and why should he not have had it as well as atherton what right had the untempted prosperity of such a man to judge the guilt of such men as himself and bartley hubbard  olive produced the newspaper from her lap where she kept both hands upon it and opened it to the advertisement in dramatic corroboration of what she had been telling atherton he read it and passed it to clara  when did this come to you  olive answered for him this eveningjust now didnt i say that  no said atherton and he added to halleck gently i beg your pardon did you notice the dates  yes answered halleck with cold refusal of athertons tone of reparation  the cause is set for hearing on the 11th said atherton this is the 8th the time is very short  its long enough said halleck wearily  oh telegraph cried clara telegraph them instantly that she never dreamt of leaving him abandonment oh if they only knew how she had been slaving her lingers off for the last two years to keep a home for him to come back to theyd give her the divorce  atherton smiled and turned to halleck do you know what their law is now it was changed two years ago  yes said halleck replying to the question atherton had asked and the subtler question he had looked i have read up the whole subject since i came home the divorce is granted only upon proof even when the defendant fails to appear and if this were to go against ushe instinctively identified himself with marcias causewe can have the default set aside and a new trial granted for cause shown  the women listened in awe of the legal phrases but when atherton rose and asked is your carriage here his wife sprang to her feet  why where are you going she demanded anxiously  not to indiana immediately answered her husband were first going to clover street to see squire gaylord and mrs hubbard better let me take the paper dear he said softly withdrawing it from her hands  oh its a cruel cruel law she moaned deprived of this moral support to suppose that such a notice as this is sufficient women couldnt have made such a law  no women only profit by such laws after theyre made they work both ways but its not such a bad law as divorce laws go we do worse now in some new england states  they found the squire alone in the parlor and with a few words of explanation atherton put the paper in his hands and he read the notice in emotionless quiet then he took off his spectacles and shut them in their case which he put back into his waistcoat pocket this is all right he said he cleared his throat and lifting the fierce glimmer of his eyes to athertons he asked drily what is the law at present  atherton briefly recapitulated the points as he had them from halleck  thats good said the old man we will fight this gentlemen he rose and from his gaunt height looked down on both of them with his sinuous lips set in a bitter smile bartley must have been disappointed when he found a divorce so hard to get in indiana he must have thought that the old law was still in force there hes not the fellow to swear to a lie if he could help it but i guess he expects to get this divorce by perjury  marcia was putting little flavia to bed she heard the talking below she thought she heard bartleys name she ran to the stairs and came hesitantly down the old wild hope and wild terror fluttering her pulse and taking her breath at sight of the three men apparently in council she crept toward them holding out her hands before her like one groping his way whatwhat is it she looked from athertons face to her fathers the old man stopped and tried to smile reassuringly he tried to speak atherton turned away  it was halleck who came forward and took her wandering hands he held them quivering in his own and said gravely and steadily using her name for the first time in the deep pity which cast out all fear and shame marcia we have found your husband  dead she made with her lips  he is alive said halleck there is something in this paper for you to seesomething you must see  i can bear anything if he is not dead wherewhat is it show it to me the paper shook in the hands which halleck released her eyes strayed blindly over its columns he had to put his finger on the place before she could find it then her tremor ceased and she seemed without breath or pulse while she read it through she fetched a long deep sigh and passed her hand over her eyes as if to clear them staying herself unconsciously against hallecks breast and laying her trembling arm along his arm till her fingers knit themselves among his fingers she read it a second time and a third then she dropped the paper and turned to look up at him why she cried as if she had made it out at last while an awful joyful light of hope flashed into her face it is a mistake dont you see he thinks that i never came back he thinks that i meant to abandon him that ithat ibut you know that i came backyou came back with me why i wasnt gone an houra halfhour hardly oh bartley poor bartley he thought i could leave him and take his child from him that i could be so wicked so heartlessoh no no no why i only stayed away that little time because i was afraid to go back dont you remember how i told you i was afraid and wanted you to come in with me her exaltation broke in a laugh but we can explain it now and it will be all right he will seehe will understandi will tell him just how it wasoh flavia flavia weve found papa weve found papa quick  she whirled away toward the stairs but her father caught her by the arm marcia he shouted in his old raucous voice youve got to understand thishe hesitated as if running over all terms of opprobrium in his mind and he resumed as if he had found them each too feeblebartley hasnt acted under any mistake  he set the facts before her with merciless clearness and she listened with an audible catching of the breath at times while she softly smoothed her forehead with her left hand i dont believe it she said when he had ended write to him tell him what i say and you will see  the old man uttered something between a groan and a curse oh you poor crazy child can nothing make you understand that bartley wants to get rid of you and that hes just as ready for one lie as another he thinks he can make out a case of abandonment with the least trouble and so he accuses you of that but hed just as soon accuse you of anything else write to him youve got to go to him youve got to go out there and fight him in open court with facts and witnesses do you suppose bartley hubbard wants any explanation from you do you think hes been waiting these two years to hear that you didnt really abandon him but came back to this house an hour after you left it and that youve waited for him here ever since when he knows that will he withdraw this suit of his and come home hell want the proof and the way to do is to go out there and let him have it if i had him on the stand for five minutes said the old man between his set teethjust five minutesid undertake to convince him from his own lips that he was wrong about you but i am afraid he wouldnt mind a letter you think i say so because i hate him and you dont believe me well ask either of these gentlemen here whether im telling you the truth  she did not speak but with a glance at their averted faces she sank into a chair and passed one hand over the other while she drew her breath in long shuddering respirations and stared at the floor with knit brows and starting eyes like one stifling a deadly pang she made several attempts to speak before she could utter any sound then she lifted her eyes to her fathers let uslet usgohome oh let us go home i will give him up i had given him up already i told you she said turning to halleck and speaking in a slow gentle tone only an hour ago that he was dead and thisthis thats happened it makes no difference why did you bring the paper to me when you knew that i thought he was dead  god knows i wished to keep it from you  well no matter now let him go free if he wants to i cant help it  you can help it interrupted her father youve got the facts on your side and youve got the witnesses  would you go out with me and tell him that i never meant to leave him she asked simply turning to halleck youand olive  we would do anything for you marcia  she sat musing and drawing her hands one over the other again while her quivering breath came and went on the silence she let her hands fall nervelessly on her lap i cant go im too weak i couldnt bear the journey no she shook her head i cant go  marcia began her father its your duty to go  does it say in the law that i have to go if i dont choose she asked of halleck  no you certainly need not go if you dont choose  then i will stay do you think its my duty to go she asked referring her question first to halleck and then to atherton she turned from the silence by which they tried to leave her free i dont care for my duty any more i dont want to keep him if its so that heleft meandand meant itand he doesntcare for me anymore  care for you he never cared for you marcia and you may be sure he doesnt care for you now  then let him go and let us go home  very well said the old man we will go home then and before the weeks out bartley hubbard will be a perjured bigamist  bigamist marcia leaped to her feet  yes bigamist dont you suppose he had his eye on some other woman out there before he began this suit  the languor was gone from marcias limbs as she confronted her father the wonderful likeness in the outline of their faces appeared his was dark and wrinkled with age and hers was gray with the anger that drove the blood back to her heart but one impulse animated those fierce profiles and the hoarded hate in the old mans soul seemed to speak in marcias thick whisper i will go     xxxviii   the athertons sat late over their breakfast in the luxurious diningroom where the april sun came in at the windows overlooking the back bay and commanding at that stage of the tide a long stretch of shallow with a flight of white gulls settled upon it  they had let claras house on the hill and she had bought another on the new land she insisted upon the change not only because everybody was leaving the hill but also because as she said it would seem too much like taking mr atherton to board if they went to housekeeping where she had always lived she wished to give him the effect before the world of having brought her to a house of his own she had even furnished it anew for the most part and had banished as far as possible the things that reminded her of the time when she was not his wife he humored her in this fantastic selfindulgence and philosophized her wish to give him the appearance of having the money as something orderly in its origin and not to be deprecated on other grounds since probably it deceived nobody they lived a very tranquil life and clara had no grief of her own unless it was that there seemed to be no great things she could do for him one day when she whimsically complained of this he said im very glad of that lets try to be equal to the little sacrifices we must make for each other they will be quite enough many a woman who would be ready to die for her husband makes him wretched because she wont live for him dont despise the day of small things  yes but when every day seems the day of small things she pouted  every day is the day of small things said atherton with people who are happy were never so prosperous as when we cant remember what happened last monday  oh but i cant bear to be always living in the present  its not so spacious i know as either the past or the future but its all we have  there cried clara thats fatalism its worse than fatalism  and is fatalism so very bad asked her husband  its mahometanism  well it isnt necessarily a plurality of wives returned atherton in subtle anticipation of her next point and its really only another name for resignation which is certainly a good thing  resignation oh i dont know about that  atherton laughed and put his arm round her waist an argument that no woman can answer in a man she loves it seems to deprive her of her reasoning faculties in the atmosphere of affection which she breathed she sometimes feared that her mental powers were really weakening as a girl she had lived a life full of purposes which if somewhat vague were unquestionably large she had then had great interestsart music literaturethe symphony concerts mr hunts classes the novels of george eliot and mr fiskes lectures on the cosmic philosophy and she had always felt that they expanded and elevated existence in her moments of question as to the shape which her life had taken since she tried to think whether the happiness which seemed so little dependent on these things was not beneath the demands of a spirit which was probably immortal and was certainly cultivated they all continued to be part of her life but only a very small part and she would have liked to ask her husband whether his influence upon her had been wholly beneficial she was not sure that it had but neither was she sure that it had not she had never fully consented to the distinctness with which he classified all her emotions and ideas as those of a woman in her heart she doubted whether a great many of them might not be those of a man though she had never found any of them exactly like his she could not complain that he did not treat her as an equal he deferred to her and depended upon her good sense to an extent that sometimes alarmed her for she secretly knew that she had a very large streak of silliness in her nature he seemed to tell her everything and to be greatly ruled by her advice especially in matters of business but she could not help observing that he often kept matters involving certain moral questions from her till the moment for deciding them was past when she accused him of this he confessed that it was so but defended himself by saying that he was afraid her conscience might sway him against his judgment  clara now recurred to these words of his as she sat looking at him through her tears across the breakfast table was that the reason you never told me about poor ben before  yes and i expect you to justify me what good would it have done to tell you  i could have told you at least that if ben had any such feeling as that it wasnt his fault altogether  but you wouldnt have believed that clara said atherton you know that whatever that poor creatures faults are coquetry isnt one of them  clara only admitted the fact passively how did he excuse himself for coming back she asked  he didnt excuse himself he defied himself we had a stormy talk and he ended by denying that he had any social duty in the matter  and i think he was quite right clara flashed out it was his own affair  he said he had a concrete purpose and wouldnt listen to abstractions yes he talked like a woman but you know he wasnt right clara though you talk like a woman too there are a great many things that are not wrong except as they wrong others ive no doubt that as compared with the highest love her husband ever felt for her bens passion was as light to darkness but if he could only hope for its return through the perversion of her soulthrough teaching her to think of escape from her marriage by a divorcethen it was a crime against her and against society  ben couldnt do such a thing  no he could only dream of doing it when it came to the attempt everything that was good in him revolted against it and conspired to make him help her in the efforts that would defeat his hopes if they succeeded it was a ghastly ordeal but it was sublime and when the climax camethat paper which he had only to conceal for a few days or weekshe was equal to the demand upon him but suppose a man of his pure training and traditions had yielded to temptationsuppose he had so far depraved himself that he could have set about persuading her that she owed no allegiance to her husband and might rightfully get a divorce and marry himwhat a ruinous blow it would have been to all who knew of it it would have disheartened those who abhorred it and encouraged those who wanted to profit by such an example it doesnt matter much socially what undisciplined people like bartley and marcia hubbard do but if a man like ben halleck goes astray its calamitous it confounds the human conscience as victor hugo says all that careful nurture in the right since he could speak all that lifelong decency of thought and act that noble ideal of unselfishness and responsibility to others trampled under foot and spit uponits horrible  yes answered clara deeply moved even as a woman may be in a pretty breakfastroom and such a good soul as ben always was naturally will you have some more tea  yes i will take another cup but as for natural goodness  wait i will ring for some hot water  when the maid had appeared disappeared reappeared and finally vanished atherton resumed the natural goodness doesnt count the natural man is a wild beast and his natural goodness is the amiability of a beast basking in the sun when his stomach is full the hubbards were full of natural goodness i dare say when they didnt happen to cross each others wishes no its the implanted goodness that savesthe seed of righteousness treasured from generation to generation and carefully watched and tended by disciplined fathers and mothers in the hearts where they have dropped it the flower of this implanted goodness is what we call civilization the condition of general uprightness that halleck declared he owed no allegiance to but he was better than his word  atherton lifted with his slim delicate hand the cup of translucent china and drained off the fragrant souchong sweetened and tempered with jersey cream to perfection something in the sight went like a pang to his wifes heart ah she said it is easy enough for us to condemn we have everything we want  i dont forget that clara said atherton gravely sometimes when i think of it i am ready to renounce all judgment of others the consciousness of our comfort our luxury almost paralyzes me at those times and i am ashamed and afraid even of our happiness  yes what right pursued clara rebelliously have we to be happy and united and these wretched creatures so  no rightnone in the world but somehow the effects follow their causes in some sort they chose misery for themselveswe make our own hell in this life and the nextor it was chosen for them by undisciplined wills that they inherited in the long run their fate must be a just one  ah but i have to look at things in the short run and i cant see any justice in marcias husband using her so cried clara why shouldnt you use me badly i dont believe that any woman ever meant better by her husband than she did  oh the meaning doesnt count its our deeds that judge us he is a thoroughly bad fellow but you may be sure she has been to blame though i dont blame the hubbards either of them so much as i blame halleck he not only had everything he wished but the training to know what he ought to wish  i dont know about his having everything i think ben must have been disappointed some time said clara evasively  oh thats nothing replied atherton with the contented husbands indifference to sentimental grievances  clara did not speak for some moments and then she summed up a turmoil of thoughts in a profound sigh well i dont like it i thought it was bad enough having a man even on the outskirts of my acquaintance abandon his wife but now ben halleck who has been like a brother to me to have him mixed up in such an affair in the way he is its intolerable  i agree with you said atherton playing with his spoon you know how i hate anything that sins against order and this whole thing is disorderly its intolerable as you say but we must bear our share of it were all bound together no one sins or suffers to himself in a civilized stateor religious state its the same thing every link in the chain feels the effect of the violence more or less intimately we rise or fall together in christian society its strange that it should be so hard to realize a thing that every experience of life teaches we keep on thinking of offences against the common good as if they were abstractions  well one thing said clara i shall always think unnecessarily shocking and disgraceful about it and that is bens going out with her on this journey i dont see how you could allow that eustace  yes said atherton after a thoughtful silence it is shocking the only consolation is that it is not unnecessarily shocking im afraid that its necessarily so when any disease of soul or body has gone far enough it makes its own conditions and other things must adjust themselves to it besides no one knows the ugliness of the situation but halleck himself i dont see how i could have interfered and upon the whole i dont know that i ought to have interfered if i could she would be helpless without him and he can get no harm from it in fact its part of his expiation which must have begun as soon as he met her again after he came home  clara was convinced but not reconciled she only said i dont like it  her husband did not reply he continued musingly when the old man made that final appeal to her jealousyall that there is really left probably of her love for her husbandand she responded with a face as wicked as his i couldnt help looking at halleck  oh poor ben how did he take it it must have scared it must have disgusted him  thats what i had expected but there was nothing in his face but pity he understood and he pitied her that was all  clara rose and turned to the window where she remained looking through her tears at the gulls on the shallow it seemed much more than twentyfour hours since she had taken leave of marcia and the rest at the station and saw them set out on their long journey with its uncertain and unimaginable end she had deeply sympathized with them all but at the same time she had felt very keenly the potential scandalousness of the situation she shuddered inwardly when she thought what if people knew she had always revolted from contact with such social facts as their errand involved she got olive aside for a moment and asked her dont you hate it olive did you ever dream of being mixed up in such a thing i should diesimply die  i shall not think of dying unless we fail answered olive and as for hating it i havent consulted my feelings a great deal but i rather think i like it  like going out to be a witness in an indiana divorce case  i dont look at it in that way clara its a crusade to me its a holy war its the cause of an innocent woman against a wicked oppression i know how you would feel about it clara but i never was as respectable as you are and im quite satisfied to do what ben and father and mr atherton approve they think its my duty and i am glad to go and to be of all the use i can but you shall have my heartfelt sympathy through all clara for your involuntary acquaintance with our proceedings  olive you know that im proud of your courage and bens goodness and that i fully appreciate the sacrifice youre making and im not ashamed of your business i think its grand and sublime and i would just as soon scream it out at the top of my voice right here in the albany depot  dont said olive it would frighten the child she had flavia by the hand and she made the little girl her special charge throughout the journey the old squire seemed anxious to be alone and he restlessly escaped from marcias care he sat all the first day apart chewing upon some fragment of wood that he had picked up and now and then putting up a lank hand to rasp his bristling jaw glancing furtively at people who passed him and lapsing into his ruminant abstraction he had been vexed that they did not start the night before and every halt the train made visibly afflicted him he would not leave his place to get anything to eat when they stopped for refreshment though he hungrily devoured the lunch that marcia brought into the car for him at new york he was in a tumult of fear lest they should lose the connecting train on the pennsylvania road and the sigh of relief with which he sank into his seat in the sleepingcar expressed the suffering he had undergone he said he was not tired but he went to bed early as if to sleep away as much of the time as he could  when halleck came into their car the next morning he found marcia and her father sitting together and looking out of the window at the wooded slopes of the alleghanies through which the train was running the old mans impatience had relaxed he let marcia lay her hand on his and he answered her with quiet submission when she spoke now and then of the difference between these valleys where the wild rhododendrons were growing and the frozen hollows of the hills at home which must be still choked with snow  but oh how much i would rather see them she said at last with a homesick throb  well he assented we can go right backafterwards  yes she whispered  well sir good morning said the old man to halleck we are getting along sir at this rate unless our calculations were mistaken we shall be there by midnight we are on time the porter tells me  yes we shall soon be at pittsburg said halleck and he looked at marcia who turned away her face she had not spoken of the object of the journey to him since they had left boston and it had not been so nearly touched by either of them before  he could see that she recoiled from it but the old man once having approached it could not leave it if everything goes well we shall have our grip on that fellows throat in less than fortyeight hours he looked down mechanically at his withered hands lean and yellow like the talons of a bird and lifted his accipitral profile with a predatory alertness i didnt sleep very well the last part of the night but i thought it all out i shant care whether i get there before or after judgment is rendered all i want is to get there before he has a chance to clear out i think i shall be able to convince bartley hubbard that there is a god in israel yet dont you be anxious marcia ive got this thing at my fingers ends as clear as a bell i intend to give bartley a little surprise  marcia kept her face averted and halleck relinquished his purpose of sitting down with them and went forward to the stateroom that marcia and olive had occupied with the little girl he tapped on the door and found his sister dressed but the child still asleep  what is the matter ben she asked you dont look well you oughtnt to have undertaken this journey  oh im all right but ive been up a good while with nothing to eat that old man is terrible olive  her father yes hes a terrible old man  it sickened me to hear him talk just nowthrowing out his threats of vengeance against hubbard it made me feel a sort of sympathy for that poor dog do you suppose she has the same motive i couldnt forgive her he said with a kind of passionate weakness i couldnt forgive myself  weve got nothing to do with their motive ben we are to be her witnesses for justice against a wicked wrong i dont believe in special providences of course but it does seem as if we had been called to this work as mother would say your happening to go home with her that night and then that paper happening to come to youdoesnt it look like it  it looks like it yes  we couldnt have refused to come thats what consoles me for being here this minute i put on a bold face with clara atherton yesterday morning at the depot but i was in a cold chill all the time our coming off in this way on such an errand is something so different from the rest of our whole life and i do like quiet and orderly ways and all that we call respectability ive been thinking that the trial will be reported by some such interviewing wretch as bartley himself and that we shall figure in the newspapers but ive concluded that we mustnt care its right and we must do it i dont shut my eyes to the kind of people were mixed up with i pity marcia and i love herpoor helpless unguided thingbut that old man is terrible hes as cruel as the grave where he thinks hes been wronged and crueller where he thinks shes been wronged youve forgiven so much ben that you cant understand a man who forgives nothing but i can for im a pretty good hater myself and marcias just like her father at times ive seen her look at clara atherton as if she could kill her  the little girl stirred in her berth and then lifted herself on her hands and stared round at them through her tangled golden hair is it morning yet she asked sleepily is it tomorrow  yes its tomorrow flavia said olive do you want to get up  and is next day the day after tomorrow  yes  then its only one day till i shall see papa thats what mamma said where is mamma asked the child rising to her knees and sweeping back her hair from her face with either hand  i will go and send her to you said halleck  at pittsburg the squire was eager for his breakfast and made amends for his fast of the day before he ate grossly of the heterogeneous abundance of the railroad restaurant and drank two cups of coffee that in his thin native air would have disordered his pulse for a week but he resumed his journey with a tranquil strength that seemed the physical expression of a mind clear and content he was willing and even anxious to tell halleck what his theories and plans were but the young man shrank from knowing them he wished only to know whether marcia were privy to them and this too he shrank from knowing     xxxix   they left pittsburg under the dun pall of smoke that hangs perpetually over the city and ran out of a world where the earth seemed turned to slag and cinders and the coal grime blackened even the sheathing from which the young leaves were unfolding their vivid green their train twisted along the banks of the ohio and gave them now and then a reach of the stream forgetful of all the noisy traffic that once fretted its waters and losing itself in almost primitive wildness among its softly rounded hills it is a beautiful land and it had even to their loath eyes a charm that touched their hearts they were on the borders of the illimitable west whose lands stretch like a sea beyond the hilly ohio shore but as yet this vastness which appalls and wearies all but the born westerner had not burst upon them they were still among heights and hollows and in a milder and softer new england  i have a strange feeling about this journey said marcia turning from the window at last and facing halleck on the opposite seat i want it to be over and yet i am glad of every little stop i feel like some one that has been called to a deathbed and is hurrying on and holding back with all her might at the same time i shall have no peace till i am there and then shall i have peace she fixed her eyes imploringly on his say something to me if you can what do you think  whether you willsucceed he was confounding what he knew of her fathers feeling with what he had feared of hers  do you mean about the lawsuit i dont care for that do you think he will hate me when he sees me do you think he will believe me when i tell him that i never meant to leave him and that im sorry for what i did to drive him away  she seemed to expect him to answer and he answered as well as he could he ought to believe thatyes he must believe it  then all the rest may go she said i dont care who gains the case but if he shouldnt believe meif he should drive me away from him as i drove him from me she held her breath in the terror of such a possibility and an awe of her ignorance crept over halleck apparently she had not understood the step that bartley had taken except as a stage in their quarrel from which they could both retreat if they would as easily as from any other dispute she had not realized it as a final an almost irrevocable act on his part which could only be met by reprisal on hers all those points of law which had been so sharply enforced upon her must have fallen blunted from her longing to be at one with him she had perhaps not imagined her defence in open court except as a sort of public reconciliation  but at another time she recurred to her wrongs in all the bitterness of her fathers vindictive purpose a young couple entered the car at one of the country stations and the bride made haste to take off her white bonnet and lay her cheek on her husbands shoulder while he passed his arm round her silken waist and drew her close to him on the seat in the loving rapture which is no wise inconvenienced by publicity on our railroad trains indeed after the first general recognition of their condition no one noticed them except marcia who seemed fascinated by the spectacle of their unsophisticated happiness it must have recalled the blissful abandon of her own wedding journey to her oh poor fool she said to olive let her wait and it will not be long before she will know that she had better lean on the empty air than on him some day he will let her fall to the ground and when she gathers herself up all bruised and bleedingbut he hasnt got the allbelieving simpleton to deal with that he used to have and he shall pay me back for alldrop by drop and ache for ache  she was in that strange mental condition into which women fall who brood long upon opposing purposes and desires she wished to be reconciled and she wished to be revenged and she recurred to either wish for the time as vehemently as if the other did not exist she took flavia on her knee and began to prattle to her of seeing papa tomorrow and presently she turned to olive and said i know he will find us both a great deal changed flavia looks so much olderand so do i but i shall soon show him that i can look young again i presume hes changed too  marcia held the little girl up at the window they had now left the river hills and the rolling country beyond and had entered the great plain which stretches from the ohio to the mississippi and mile by mile as they ran southward and westward the spring unfolded in the mellow air under the dull warm sun the willows were in perfect leaf and wore their delicate green like veils caught upon their boughs the mayapples had already pitched their tents in the woods beginning to thicken and darken with the young foliage of the oaks and hickories suddenly as the train dashed from a stretch of forest the peach orchards flushed pink beside the brick farmsteads the child gave a cry of delight and pointed and her mother seemed to forget all that had gone before and abandoned herself to flavias joy in the blossoms as if there were no trouble for her in the world  halleck rose and went into the other car he felt giddy as if her fluctuations of mood and motive had somehow turned his own brain he did not come back till the train stopped at columbus for dinner the old squire showed the same appetite as at breakfast he had the effect of falling upon his food like a bird of prey and as soon as the meal was despatched he went back to his seat in the car where he lapsed into his former silence and immobility his lank jaws working with fresh activity upon the wooden toothpick he had brought away from the table while they waited for a train from the north which was to connect with theirs halleck walked up and down the vast noisy station with olive and marcia and humored the little girl in her explorations of the place she made friends with a redbird that sang in its cage in the dininghall and with an old woman yellow and wrinkled and sunkeneyed sitting on a bundle tied up in a quilt beside the door and smoking her clay pipe as placidly as if on her own cabin threshold pears like you aint much afeard of strangers honey said the old woman taking her pipe out of her mouth to fill it where do you live at when youre home  boston said the child promptly where do you live  i used to live in old virginny but my son hes takin me out to illinoy now hes settled out there she treated the child with the serious equality which simple old people use with children and spat neatly aside in resuming her pipe which o them ladies yender is your maw honey  my mamma  the old woman nodded  flavia ran away and laid her hand on marcias dress and then ran back to the old woman  that your paw with her flavia looked blank and the old woman interpreted your father  no were going out to see papaout west were going to see him tomorrow and then hes coming back with us my grandpa is in that car  the old woman now laid her folded arms on her knees and smoked obliviously the little girl lingered a moment and then ran off laughing to her mother and pulled her skirt wasnt it funny mamma she thought mr halleck was my papa she hung forward by the hold she had taken as children do and tilted her head back to look into her mothers face what is mr halleck mamma  what is he the group halted involuntarily  yes what is he is he my uncle or my cousin or what is he going out to see papa too what is he going for oh look look the child plucked away her hand and ran off to join the circle of idle men and halfgrown boys who were forming about two shining negroes with banjos the negroes flung their hands upon the strings with an ecstatic joy in the music and lifted their black voices in a wild plantation strain the child began to leap and dance and her mother ran after her  naughty little girl she cried come into the car with me this minute  halleck did not see marcia again till the train had run far out of the city and was again sweeping through the thick woods and flashing out upon the levels of the fields where the farmers were riding their sulkyplows up and down the long furrows in the pleasant afternoon sun there was something in this transformation of mans oldtime laborious dependence into a lordly domination over the earth which strikes the westward journeyer as finally expressive of human destiny in the whole mighty region and which penetrated even to hallecks sore and jaded thoughts a different type of men began to show itself in the car as the western people gradually took the places of his fellowtravellers from the east the men were often slovenly and sometimes uncouth in their dress but they made themselves at home in the exaggerated splendor and opulence of the car as if born to the best in every way their faces suggested the security of people who trusted the future from the past and had no fears of the life that had always used them well they had not that eager and intense look which the eastern faces wore there was energy enough and to spare in them but it was not an anxious energy the sharp accent of the seaboard yielded to the rounded soft and slurring tones and the prompt address was replaced by a careless and confident neighborliness of manner  flavia fretted at her return to captivity in the car and demanded to be released with a teasing persistence from which nothing she was shown out of the window could divert her a large man leaned forward at last from a seat near by and held out an orange come here to me little trouble he said and flavia made an eager start toward this unlookedfor friend  marcia wished to check her but halleck pleaded to have her go it will be a relief to you he said  well let her go marcia consented but she was no trouble and she is no relief she sat looking dully at the little girl after the westerner had gathered her up into his lap should i have liked to tell her she said as if thinking aloud how we were really going to meet her father and that you were coming with me to be my witness against him in a courtto put him down and disgrace himto fight him as father says  you mustnt think of it in that way said halleck gently but as he felt feebly and inadequately  oh i shall not think of it in that way long she answered my head is in a whirl and i cant hold what were doing before my mind in any one shape for a minute at a time i dont know what will become of mei dont know what will become of me  but in another breath she rose from this desolation and was talking with impersonal cheerfulness of the sights that the carwindow showed as long as the light held they passed through the same opulent and monotonous landscape through little towns full of signs of material prosperity and then farms and farms again the brick houses set in the midst of evergreens and compassed by vast acreages of corn land where herds of black pigs wandered and the farmers were riding their ploughs or heaping into vast windrows for burning the winterworn stalks of the last years crop where they came to a stream the landscape was roughened into low hills from which it sank again luxuriously to a plain if there was any difference between ohio and indiana it was that in indiana the spring night whose breath softly buffeted their cheeks through the open window had gathered over those eternal cornfields where the long crooked windrows burning on either hand seemed a trail of fiery serpents writhing away from the train as it roared and clamored over the track  they were to leave their car at indianapolis and take another road which would bring them to tecumseh by daylight the next morning olive went away with the little girl and put her to bed on the sofa in their stateroom and marcia suffered them to go alone it was only by fits that she had cared for the child or even noticed it now tell me again she said to halleck why we are going  surely you know  yes yes i know but i cant thinki dont seem to remember didnt i give it up once didnt i say that i would rather go home and let bartley get the divorce if he wanted  yes you said that marcia  i used to make him very unhappy i was very strict with him when i knew he couldnt bear any kind of strictness and he was always so patient with me though he never really cared for me oh yes i knew that from the first he used to try but he must have been glad to get away poor bartley it was cruel cruel to put that in about my abandoning him when he knew i would come back but perhaps the lawyers told him he must he had to put in something why shouldnt i let him go father said he only wanted to get rid of me so that he could marry some one elseyes yes it was that that made me start father knew it would oh she grieved with a wild selfpity that tore hallecks heart he knew it would she fell wearily back against the seat and did not speak for some minutes then she said in a slow broken utterance but now i dont seem to mind even that any more why shouldnt he marry some one else that he really likes if he doesnt care for me  halleck laughed in bitterness of soul as his thought recurred to athertons reasons because he said you have a public duty in the matter you must keep him bound to you for fear some other woman whose husband doesnt care for her should let him go too and society be broken up and civilization destroyed in a matter like this which seems to concern yourself alone you are only to regard others  his reckless irony did not reach her through her manifold sorrow well she said simply it must be that but oh how can i bear it how can i bear it  the time passed olive did not return for an hour then she merely said that the little girl had just fallen asleep and that she should go back and lie down with her that she was sleepy too  marcia did not answer but halleck said he would call her in good time before they reached indianapolis  the porter made up the berths of such as were going through to st louis and marcia was left sitting alone with halleck i will go and get your father to come here he said  i dont want him to come i want to talk to youto say somethingwhat was it i cant think she stopped like one trying to recover a faded thought he waited but she did not speak again she had laid a nervous clutch upon his arm to detain him from going for her father and she kept her hand there mechanically but after a while he felt it relax she drooped against him and fell away into a sleep in which she started now and then like a frightened child he could not release himself without waking her but it did not matter her sorrow had unsexed her only the tenderness of his love for this hapless soul remained in his heart which ached and evermore heavily sank within him  he woke her at last when he must go to tell olive that they were running into indianapolis marcia struggled to her feet oh oh are we there are we there  we are at indianapolis said halleck  i thought it was tecumseh she shuddered we can go back oh yes we can still go back  they alighted from the train in the chilly midnight air and found their way through the crowd to the eatingroom of the station the little girl cried with broken sleep and the strangeness and olive tried to quiet her marcia clung to hallecks arm and shivered convulsively squire gaylord stalked beside them with a demoniac vigor a few more hours a few more hours sir he said he made a hearty supper while the rest scalded their mouths with hot tea which they forced with loathing to their lips  some women who were washing the floor of the ladies waitingroom told them they must go into the mens room and wait there for their train which was due at one oclock they obeyed and found the room full of emigrants and the air thick with their tobacco smoke there was no choice olive went in first and took the child on her lap where it straightway fell asleep the squire found a seat beside them and sat erect looking round on the emigrants with the air of being amused at their outlandish speech into which they burst clamorously from their silence at intervals marcia stopped halleck at the threshold stay out here with me she whispered i want to tell you something she added as he turned mechanically and walked away with her up the vast lampshot darkness of the depot i am not going on i am going back we will take the train that goes to the east father will never know till it is too late we neednt speak to him about it  halleck set himself against this delirious folly he consented to her return she could do what she would but he would not consent to cheat her father we must go and tell him he said for all answer to all her entreaties he dragged her back to the waitingroom but at the door she started at the figure of a man who was bending over a group of emigrant children asleep in the nearest cornerpoor uncouth stubbed little creatures in oldmannish clothes looking like children roughly blocked out of wood and stiffly stretched on the floor or resting woodenly against their mother  there said the man pressing a mug of coffee on the woman you drink that itll do you goodevery drop of it ive seen the time he said turning round with the mug when she had drained it in his hand and addressing marcia and halleck as the most accessible portion of the englishspeaking public when i used to be down on coffee i thought it was bad for the nerves but i tell you when youre travelling its a brainfood if ever there was a brain he dropped the mug and stumbled back into the heap of sleeping children fixing a ghastly stare on marcia  she ran toward him mr kinney  no you dontno you dont  why dont you know me mrs hubbard  hehetold me youwas dead roared kinney  he told you i was dead  moren a year ago the last time i seen him before i went out to leadville  he told you i was dead repeated marcia huskily he must have wished it she whispered oh mercy mercy mercy she stopped and then she broke into a wild laugh well you see he was wrong im on my way to him now to show him that im alive     xl   halleck woke at daybreak from the drowse into which he had fallen the train was creeping slowly over the track feeling its way and he heard fragments of talk among the passengers about a broken rail that the conductor had been warned of he turned to ask some question when the pull of rising speed came from the locomotive and at the same moment the car stopped with a jolting pitch it settled upon the track again but the two cars in front were overturned and the passengers were still climbing from their windows when halleck got his bewildered party to the ground children were crying and a woman was led by with her face cut and bleeding from the broken glass but it was reported that no one else was hurt and the trainmen gave their helplessness to the inspection of the rotten crosstie that had caused the accident one of the passengers kicked the decayed wood with his boot well he said i always like a little accident like this early it makes us safe the rest of the day the sentiment apparently commended itself to popular acceptance halleck went forward with part of the crowd to see what was the matter with the locomotive it had kept the track but seemed to be injured somehow the engineer was working at it hammer in hand he exchanged some dry pleasantries with a passenger who asked him if there was any chance of hiring a real fast oxteam in that neighborhood in case a man was in a hurry to get on to tecumseh  they were in the midst of a level prairie that stretched all round to the horizon where it was broken by patches of timber the rising sun slanted across the green expanse and turned its distance to gold the grass at their feet was full of wildflowers upon which flavia flung herself as soon as they got out of the car by the time halleck returned to them she was running with cries of joy and wonder toward a windmill that rose beautiful above the roofs of a group of commonplace houses at a little distance from the track it stirred its mighty vans in the thin sweet inland breeze and took the sun gayly on the light gallery that encircled it  a vision of belgian plains swept before hallecks eyes there ought to be storks on its roof he said absently  how strange that it should be here away out in the west said olive  if it were less strange than we are here i couldnt stand it he answered  a brakeman came up with a flag in his hand and nodded toward flavia shes on the right track for breakfast he said theres an old dutchman at that mill and his wife knows how to make coffee like a fellows mother youll have plenty of time this train has come here to staytill somebody can walk back five miles and telegraph for help  how far are we from tecumseh asked halleck  fifty miles the brakeman called back over his shoulder  dont you worry any marcia said her father moving off in pursuit of flavia this accident makes it all right for us if we dont get there for a week  marcia answered nothing halleck began to talk to her of that belgian landscape in which he had first seen a windmill and he laughed at the blank unintelligence with which she received his reminiscences of travel for the moment the torturing stress was lifted from his soul he wished that the breakfast in the millers house might never come to an end he explored the mill with flavia he bantered the squire on his saturnine preference for steam power in the milling business he made the others share his mood he pushed far from him the series of tragic or squalid facts which had continually brought the end to him in reveries in which he found himself holding his breath as if he might hold it till the end really came  but this respite could not last a puff of white steam showed on the horizon and after an interval the sound of the locomotive whistle reached them as it came backing down a train of empty cars towards them they were quickly on their journey again and a scanty hour before noon they arrived at tecumseh  the pretty town which in prospect had worn to olive hallecks imagination the blended hideousness of sodom and gomorrah was certainly very much more like a new england village in fact after the brick farmsteads and coalsmoked towns of central ohio its wooden houses set back from the street with an ample depth of dooryard were appealingly familiar and she exchanged some homesick whispers with marcia about them as they drove along under the fullleaved maples which shadowed the way the grass was denser and darker than in new england and pretty as the town was it wore a more careless and unscrupulous air than the true new england village the south had touched it and here and there it showed a wavering line of fence and a faltering conscientiousness in its paint presently all aspects of village quiet and seclusion ceased and a section of conventional american city with flabroofed brick blocks showy hotel stores paved street and stone sidewalks expressed the readiness of tecumseh to fulfil the destiny of every western town and become a metropolis at a days notice if need be the secondhand omnibus which reflected the actuality of tecumseh set them down at the broad steps of the courthouse fronting on an avenue which for a city street was not very crowded or busy such passers as there were had leisure and inclination as they loitered by to turn and stare at the strangers and the voice of the sheriff as he called from an upper window of the courthouse the names of absentee litigants or witnesses required to come into court easily made itself heard above all the other noises  it seemed to halleck as if the sheriff were calling them he lifted his head and looked at olive but she would not meet his eye she led by the hand the little girl who kept asking is this the house where papa lives with the merciless iteration of a child halleck dragged lamely after the squire who had mounted the steps with unnatural vigor he promptly found his way to the clerks office where he examined the docket and then returned to his party triumphant we are in time he said and he led them on up into the courtroom  a few spectators scattered about on the rows of benching turned to look at them as they walked up the aisle where the cocoa matting soaked and dried and soaked again with perpetual libations of tobaccojuice mercifully silenced their footsteps most of the faces turned upon them showed a slow and thoughtful movement of the jaws and as they were dropped or averted a general discharge of tobaccojuice seemed to express the general adoption of the newcomers whoever they were as a necessary element of the scene which it was useless to oppose and about which it was idle to speculate before the squire had found his party seats on one of the benches next the bar the spectators had again given their languid attention to the administration of justice which is everywhere informal with us and is only a little more informal in the west than in the east an effect of serene disoccupation pervaded the place such as comes at the termination of an interesting affair and no one seemed to care for what the clerk was reading aloud in a set mechanical tone the judge was busy with his docket the lawyers at their several little tables within the bar lounged in their chairs or stalked about laughing and whispering to each other the prosecuting attorney leaned upon the shoulder of a jollylooking man who lifted his face to joke up at him as he tilted his chair back a very stout youngish person who sat next him kept his face dropped while the clerk proceeded  and now on motion of plaintiff it is ordered by the court that said defendant be now here three times called which is done in open court and she comes not but wholly makes default herein and this cause is now submitted to the court for trial and the court having heard the evidence and being fully advised find for the plaintiffthat the allegations of his complaint are true and that he is entitled to a divorce it is therefore considered by the court that said plaintiff be and he is hereby divorced and the bonds of matrimony heretofore existing between said parties are dissolved and held for naught  as the clerk closed the large volume before him the jolly lawyer as if the record had been read at his request nodded to the court and said the record of the decree seems correct your honor he leaned forward and struck the fat mans expanse of back with the flat of his hand congratulate you my dear boy he said in a stage whisper that was heard through the room many happy returns of the day  a laugh went round and the judge said severely mr sheriff see that order is kept in the courtroom  the fat man rose to shake hands with another friend and at the same moment squire gaylord stretched himself to his full height before stooping over to touch the shoulder of one of the lawyers within the bar and his eyes encountered those of bartley hubbard in mutual recognition  it was not the fat on bartleys ribs only that had increased his broad cheeks stood out and hung down with it and his chin descended by the three successive steps to his breast his complexion was of a tender pink on which his blonde moustache showed white it almost vanished in the tallowy pallor to which the pink turned as he saw his fatherinlaw and then the whole group which the intervening spectators had hitherto hidden from him he dropped back into his chair and intimated to his lawyer with a wave of his hand and a twist of his head that some hopeless turn in his fortunes had taken place that jolly soul turned to him for explanation and at the same time the lawyer whom squire gaylord had touched on the shoulder responded to a few whispered words from him by beckoning to the prosecuting attorney who stepped briskly across to where they stood a brief dumbshow ensued and the prosecutor ended by taking the squires hand and inviting him within the bar the other attorney politely made room for him at his table and the prosecutor returned to his place near the jurybox where he remained standing for a moment  if it please the court he began in a voice breaking heavily upon the silence that had somehow fallen upon the whole room i wish to state that the defendant in the case of hubbard vs hubbard is now and here present having been prevented by an accident on the road between this place and indianapolis from arriving in time to make defence she desires to move the court to set aside the default  the prosecutor retired a few paces and nodded triumphantly at bartleys lawyer who could not wholly suppress his enjoyment of the joke though it told so heavily against him and his client but he was instantly on his feet with a technical objection  the judge heard him through and then opened his docket at the case of hubbard vs hubbard what name shall i enter for the defence he inquired formally  squire gaylord turned with an oldfashioned state and deliberation which had their effect and cast a glance of professional satisfaction in the situation at the attorneys and the spectators i ask to be allowed to appear for the defence in this case if the court please my friend mr hathaway will move my admission to this bar  the attorney to whom the squire had first introduced himself promptly complied your honor i move the admission of mr f j gaylord of equity equity county maine to practise at this bar  the judge bowed to the squire and directed the clerk to administer the usual oath i have entered your name for the defence mr gaylord do you desire to make any motion in the case he pursued the natural courtesy of his manner further qualified by a feeling which something pathetic in the old squires bearing inspired  yes your honor i move to set aside the default and i shall offer in support of this motion my affidavit setting forth the reasons for the nonappearance of the defendant at the calling of the cause  shall i note your motion as filed asked the judge  yes your honor replied the old man he made a futile attempt to prepare the paper the pen flew out of his trembling hand i cant write he said in despair that made other hands quick to aid him a young lawyer at the next desk rapidly drew up the paper and the squire duly offered it to the clerk of the court the clerk stamped it with the filemark of the court and returned it to the squire who read aloud the motion and affidavit setting forth the facts of the defendants failure to receive the notice in time to prepare for her defence and of the accident which had contributed to delay her appearance declaring that she had a just defence to the plaintiffs bill and asking to be heard upon the facts  bartleys attorney was prompt to interpose again he protested that the printed advertisement was sufficient notice to the defendant whenever it came to her knowledge or even if it never came to her knowledge and that her plea of failure to receive it in time was not a competent excuse this might be alleged in any case and any delay of travel might be brought forward to account for nonappearance as plausibly as this trumpedup accident in which nobody was hurt he did his best which was also his worst and the judge once more addressed the squire who stood waiting for bartleys counsel to close i was about to adjourn the court said the judge in that accent which is the gift of the south to some parts of the west it is curiously soft and gentle and expressive when the speaker will of a caressing deference but we have still some minutes before noon in which we can hear you in support of your motion if you are ready  i am mready your honor the old mans nasals cut across the judges rounded tones almost before they had ceased his lips compressed themselves to a waving line and his high hawkbeak came down over them the fierce light burned in his cavernous eyes and his grizzled hair erected itself like a crest he swayed slightly back and forth at the table behind which he stood and paused as if waiting for his hate to gather head  in this interval it struck several of the spectators who had appreciative friends outside that it was a pity they should miss the coming music and they risked the loss of some strains themselves that they might step out and inform these dilettanti one of them was stopped by a man at the door whats up now the other impatiently explained but the inquirer instead of hurrying in to enjoy the fun turned quickly about and ran down the stairs he crossed the street and by a system of alleys and byways modestly made his way to the outlying fields of tecumseh which he traversed at heightened speed plunging at last into the belt of timber beyond this excursion which had so much the appearance of a chase was an exigency of the witness who had corroborated on oath the testimony of bartley in regard to his wifes desertion such an establishment of facts purely imaginary with the witness was simple enough in the absence of rebutting testimony but confronted with this it became another affair it had its embarrassments its risks  mready repeated squire gay lord mready with facts and witnesses the word in which he exulted till it rang and echoed through the room drew the eyes of all to the little group on the bench next the bar where marcia heavily veiled in the black which she had worn ever since bartleys disappearance sat with halleck and olive the little girl spent with her long journey rested her head on her mothers lap and the mothers hand tremulously smoothed her hair and tried to hush the grieving whisper in which she incessantly repeated where is papa i want to see papa  olive looked straight before her and hallecks eyes were fixed upon the floor after the first glance at them bartley did not lift his head but held it bent forward where he sat and showed only a fold of fat red neck above his coatcollar marcia might have seen his face in that moment before it blanched and he sank into his chair she did not look toward him again  mr sheriff keep silence in the court ordered the judge in reprimand of the stir that ensued upon the general effort to catch sight of the witnesses  silence in the court keep your seats gentlemen cried the sheriff  and i thank the court resumed the squire for this immediate opportunity to redress an atrocious wrong and to vindicate an innocent and injured woman sir i think it will prejudice our cause with no one when i say that we are here not only in the relation of attorney and client but in that of father and daughter and that i stand in this place singularly and sacredly privileged to demand justice for my own child  order order shouted the sheriff but he could not quell the sensation that followed the point had been effectively made and it was some moments before the noise of the people beginning to arrive from the outside permitted the squire to continue he waited with one lean hand hanging at his side and the other resting in a loosely folded fist on the table before him he took this fist up as if it were some implement he had laid hold of and swung it in the air  by a chance which i shall not be the last to describe as providentialhe paused and looked round the room as if defying any one there to challenge the sincerity of his assertionthe notice which your law requires to be given by newspaper advertisement to the nonresident defendant in such a case as this came by one chance in millions to her hand by one chance more or less it would not have reached her and a monstrous crime against justice would have been irrevocably accomplished for she had mourned this man as deaddead to the universal frame of things when he was only dead to honor dead to duty and dead to her and it was that newspaper sent almost at random through the mail and wandering from hand to hand and everywhere rejected for weeks before it reached her at last which convinced her that he was still in such life as a man may live who has survived his own soul we are therefore here standing upon our right and prepared to prove it gods right and the everlasting truth two days ago a thousand miles and a thousand uncertainties intervened between us and this right but now we are here to show that the defendant basely defamed by the plea of abandonment returned to her home within an hour after she had parted there with the plaintiff and has remained there day and night ever since he stopped did i say she had never absented herself during all this time i was wrong i spoke hastily i forgot he dropped his voice she did absent herself at one timefor three dayswhile she could come home to close her mothers dying eyes and help me to lay her in the grave he tried to close his lips firmly again but the sinuous line was broken by a convulsive twitching perhaps he resumed with the utmost gentleness the plaintiff returned in this interval and finding her gone was confirmed in his belief that she had abandoned him  he felt blindly about on the table with his trembling hands and his whole figure had a pathos that gave the old dresscoat statuesque dignity the spectators quietly changed their places and occupied the benches near him till bartley was left sitting alone with his counsel we are beginning to talk here at the east of the decline of oratory but it is still a passion in the west and his listeners now clustered about the squire in keen appreciation of his power it seemed to summon even the loiterers in the street whose ascending tramp on the stairs continually made itself heard the lawyers the officers of the court the judge forgot their dinner and posed themselves anew in their chairs to listen  no doubt the electrical sphere of sympathy and admiration penetrated to the old mans consciousness when he pulled off his black satin stockthe relic of ancient fashion which the piety of his daughter kept in repairand laid it on the table there was a deep inarticulate murmur of satisfaction which he could not have mistaken his voice rose again  if the plaintiff indeed came at that time the walls of those empty rooms into which he peered like a thief in the night might have told himif walls had tongues to speak as they have ears to heara tale that would have melted even his heart with remorse and shame they might have told him of a woman waiting in hunger and cold for his return and willing to starve and freeze rather than own herself forsakenwaiting till she was hunted from her door by the creditors whom he had defrauded and forced to confess her disgrace and her despair in order to save herself from the unknown terrors of the law invoked upon her innocent head by his villany this is the history of the first two weeks of those two years during which as his perjured lips have sworn he was using every effort to secure her return to him i will not enlarge now upon this history nor upon that of the days and weeks and months that followed wringing the heart and all but crazing the brain of the wife who would not in the darkest hours of her desolation believe herself wilfully abandoned but we have the record unbroken and irrefragable which shall not only right his victim but shall bring yonder perjurer to justice  the words had an iron weight they fell like blows bartley did not stir but marcia moved uneasily in her chair and a low pitiful murmur broke from behind her veil her father stopped again panting and his dry lips closed and parted several times before he could find his voice again but at that sound of grief he partially recovered himself and went on brokenly  i now ask this court for due cause to set aside the default upon which judgment has been rendered against the defendant and i shall then ask leave to file her crosspetition for divorce  marcia started halfway from her chair and then fell back again she looked round at halleck as if for help and hid her face in her hands her father cast a glance at her as if for her approval of this development of his plan  then may it please the court upon the rendition of judgment in our favor upon that petitiona result of which i have no more doubt than of my own existencei shall demand under your law the indictment of yonder perjurer for his crime and i shall await in security the sentence which shall consign him to a felons cell in a felons garb  marcia flung herself upon her fathers arm outstretched toward bartley no no no she cried with deep shuddering breaths in a voice thick with horror never let him go i will not have it i didnt understand i never meant to harm him let him go it is my cause and i say  the old mans arm dropped he fixed a ghastly bewildered look upon his daughter and fell forward across the table at which he stood the judge started from his chair the people leaped over the benches and crushed about the squire who fetched his breath in convulsive gasps keep back give him air open the window get a doctor cried those next him  even bartleys counsel had joined the crowd about the squire from the midst of which broke the long frightened wail of a child this was bartleys opportunity when his counsel turned to look for him and advise his withdrawal from a place where he could do no good and where possibly he might come to harm he found that his advice had been anticipated bartleys chair was vacant     xli   that night when halleck had left the old man to the care of marcia and olive for the time a note was brought to him from bartleys lawyer begging the favor of a few moments interview on very important business it might be some offer of reparation or advance in marcias interest and halleck went with the bearer of the note the lawyer met him hospitably at the door of his office how do you do sir he said shaking hands then he indicated a bulk withdrawn into a corner of the dimlylighted room the blinds were drawn and he locked the door after hallecks entrance mr hubbard whom i think you know he added ill just step into the next room gentlemen and will be subject to your call at any moment  the bulk lifted itself and moved some paces toward halleck bartley even raised his hand with the vague expectation of taking hallecks but seeing no responsive gesture on his part he waved a salutation and dropped it again to his side  how d ye do halleck rather a secret black and midnight interview he said jocosely but i couldnt very well manage it otherwise im not just in the position to offer you the freedom of the city  what do you want hubbard asked halleck bluntly  how is the old squire  the doctor thinks he may rally from the shock  paralysis  yes  i have spent the day in the tall timber as our friends out here say communing with nature and ive only just come into town since dark so i hadnt any particulars he paused as if expecting that halleck might give them but upon his remaining silent he resumed of course as the case now stands i know very well that the law cant touch me but i didnt know what the popular feeling might be the squire laid it on pretty hot and he might have made it livelier for me than he intended he isnt aware of the inflammable nature of the material out here he gave a nervous chuckle i wanted to see you halleck to tell you that i havent forgotten that money i owe you and that i mean to pay it all up some time yet if it hadnt been for some expenses ive had latelydoctors bills and so forthi havent been very well myselfhe made a sort of involuntary appeal for hallecks sympathyand ive had to pay out a good deal of moneyi should be able to pay most of it now as it is i can only give you five hundred of it he tugged his portemonnaie with difficulty up the slope of his pantaloons that will leave me just three hundred to begin the world with for of course ive got to clear out of here and id got very comfortably settled after two years of pretty hard work at the printing business and hard reading at the law well its all right and i want to pay you this money now and ill pay you the rest whenever i can and i want you to tell marcia that i did it i always meant to do it  hubbard interrupted halleck you dont owe me any money your fatherinlaw paid that debt two years ago but you owe some one else a debt that no one can pay for you we neednt waste words what are you going to do to repair the wrong you have done the woman and the child he stopped the effort had perhaps been too much  bartley saw his emotion and in his benighted way he honored it halleck you are a good fellow you are such a good fellow that you cant understand this thing but its played out i felt badly about it myself at one time and if i hadnt been robbed of that money you lent me on my way here id have gone back inside of fortyeight hours i was sorry for marcia it almost broke my heart to think of the little one but i knew they were in the hands of friends and the more time i had to think it over the more i was reconciled to what i had done that was the only way out for either of us we had tried it for three years and we couldnt make it go we never could have made it go we were incompatible dont you suppose i knew marcias good qualities no one knows them better or appreciates them more you might think that i applied for this divorce because i had some one else in view not any more in mine at present but i thought we ought to be free both of us and if our marriage had become a chain that we ought to break it bartley paused apparently to give these facts and reasons time to sink into hallecks mind but theres one thing i should like to have you tell her halleck she was wrong about that girl i never had anything to do with her marcia will understand halleck made no reply and bartley resumed in a burst of generosity which marked his fall into the abyss as nothing else could have done look here halleck i cant marry again for two years but as i understand the law marcia isnt bound in any way i know that she always had a very high opinion of you and that she thinks you are the best man in the world why dont you fix it up with marcia  bartley was in effect driven into exile by the accidents of his suit for divorce which have been described he was not in bodily danger after the first excitement passed off if he was ever in bodily danger at all but he could not reasonably hope to establish himself in a community which had witnessed such disagreeable facts concerning him before which indeed he stood attainted of perjury and only saved from the penalty of his crime by the refusal of his wife to press her case  as soon as her father was strong enough to be removed marcia returned to the east with him in the care of the friends who continued with them they did not go back to boston but went directly to equity where in the first flush of the young and jubilant summer they opened the dim old house at the end of the village street and resumed their broken lives her father with one side palsystricken wavered out every morning to his office and sat there all day the tremulous shadow of his former will sometimes his old friends came in to see him but no one expected now to hear the squire get going he no longer got going on any topic he had become as a little childas the little child that played about him there in the still warm summer days and built houses with his lawbooks on the floor he laughed feebly at her pranks and submitted to her rule with pathetic meekness in everything where marcia had not charged them both to the contrary he was very obedient to marcia who looked vigilantly after his welfare and knew all his goings and comings as she knew those of his little comrade two or three times a day she ran out to see that they were safe but for the rest she kept herself closely housed and saw no one whom she was not forced to see only the meatman and the fishman could speak authoritatively concerning her appearance and behavior before folks they reported the latter as dry cold and uncommunicative doubtless the bitter experiences of her life had wrought their due effect in that passionate heart but probably it was as much a morbid sensitiveness as a hardened indifference that turned her from her kind the village inquisitiveness that invades also suffers much eccentricity and after it had been well ascertained that marcia was as queer as her mother she was allowed to lead her mothers unmolested life in the old house which had always turned so cold a shoulder to the world toward the end of the summer the lame young man and his sister who had been several times in equity before paid her a visit but stayed only a day or two as was accurately known by persons who had noted the opening and closing of the sparechamber blinds in the winter he came again but this time he came alone and stayed at the hotel he remained over a sunday and sat in the pulpit of the orthodox church where the minister extended to him the right hand of fellowship and invited him to make the opening prayer it was considered a good prayer generally speaking but it was criticised as not containing anything attractive to young people he was understood to be on his way to take charge of a backwoods church down in aroostook county where probably his prayers would be more acceptable to the popular taste  that winter squire gaylord had another stroke of paralysis and late in the following spring he succumbed to a third the old minister who had once been mrs gaylords pastor was now dead and the squire was buried by the lame man who came up to equity for that purpose at the wish often expressed of the deceased this at least was the common report and it is certain that halleck officiated  in entering the ministry he had returned to the faith which had been taught him almost before he could speak he did not defend or justify this course on the part of a man who had once thrown off all allegiance to creeds he said simply that for him there was no other course he freely granted that he had not reasoned back to his old faith he had fled to it as to a city of refuge his unbelief had been helped and he no longer suffered himself to doubt he did not ask if the truth was here or there any more he only knew that he could not find it for himself and he rested in his inherited belief he accepted everything if he took one jot or tittle away from the book the curse of doubt was on him he had known the terrors of the law and he preached them to his people he had known the divine mercy and he also preached that  the squires death occurred a few months before the news came of another event to which the press of the state referred with due recognition but without great fulness of detail this was the fatal case of shootingpenalty or consequence as we choose to consider it of all that had gone beforewhich occurred at whited sepulchre arizona where bartley hubbard pitched his tent and set up a printingpress after leaving tecumseh he began with the issue of a sunday paper and made it so spicy and so indispensable to all the residents of whited sepulchre who enjoyed the study of their fellowcitizens affairs that he was looking hopefully forward to the establishment of a daily edition when he unfortunately chanced to comment upon the domestic relations of one of whited sepulchres leading citizens the leading citizen promptly took the warpath as an esteemed contemporary expressed it in reporting the difficulty with the cynical lightness and the profusion of felicitous headlines with which our journalism often alleviates the history of tragic occurrences the parenthetical touch in the closing statement that mr hubbard leaves a divorced wife and child somewhere at the east was quite in bartleys own manner  marcia had been widowed so long before that this event could make no outward change in her what inner change if any it wrought is one of those facts which fiction must seek in vain to disclose but if love such as hers had been did not deny his end the pang of a fresh grief we may be sure that her sorrow was not unmixed with selfaccusal as unavailing as it was passionate and perhaps as unjust  one evening a year later the athertons sat talking over a letter from halleck which atherton had brought from boston with him it was summer and they were at their place on the beverley shore it was a long letter and atherton had read parts of it several times already on his way down in the cars and had since read it all to his wife its a very morbid letter he said with a perplexed air when he had finished  yes she assented but its a very good letter poor ben  her husband took it up again and read here and there a passage from it  but i am turning to you now for help in a matter on which my own conscience throws such a fitful and uncertain light that i cannot trust it i know that you are a good man atherton and i humbly beseech you to let me have your judgment without mercy though it slay me i will abide by it since her fathers death she lives there quite alone with her child i have seen her only once but we write to each other and there are times when it seems to me at last that i have the right to ask her to be my wife the words give me a shock as i write them and the things which i used to think reasons for my right rise up in witness against me above all i remember with horror that he approved it that he advised it it is true that i have never by word or deed suffered her to know what was in my heart but has there ever been a moment when i could do so it is true that i have waited for his death but if i have been willing he should die am i not a potential murderer  oh what ridiculous nonsense clara indignantly protested  atherton read on these are the questions which i ask myself in my despair she is free now but am i free am i not rather bound by the past to perpetual silence there are times when i rebel against these tortures when i feel a sanction for my love of her an assurance from somewhere that it is right and good to love her but then i sink again for if i ask whence this assurance comesi beseech you to tell me what you think has my offence been so great that nothing can atone for it must i sacrifice to this fear all my hopes of what i could be to her and for her  atherton folded up the letter and put it back into its envelope with a frown of exasperation i cant see what should have infatuated halleck with that woman i dont believe now that he loves her i believe he only pities her she is altogether inferior to him passionate narrowminded jealousshe would make him miserable hed much better stay as he is if it were not pathetic to have him deifying her in this way it would be laughable  she had a jealous temperament said clara looking down but all the hallecks are fond of her they think there is a great deal of good in her dont suppose ben himself thinks she is perfect but  i dare say interrupted her husband that he thinks hes entirely sincere in asking my advice but you can see how he wishes to be advised  of course he wishes to marry her it isnt so much a question of what a man ought to have as what he wants to have in marrying is it even the best of men if she is exacting and quicktempered he is good enough to get on with her if she had a husband that she could thoroughly trust she would be easy enough to get on with there is no woman good enough to get on with a bad man its terrible to think of that poor creature living there by herself with no one to look after her and her little girl and if ben  what do you mean clara dont you see that his being in love with her when she was another mans wife is what he feels it to bean indelible stain  she never knew it and no one ever knew it but you you said it was our deeds that judged us didnt ben go away when he realized his feeling for her  he came back  but he did everything he could to find that poor wretch and he tried to prevent the divorce ben is morbid about it but there is no use in our being so  there was a time when he would have been glad to profit by a divorce  but he never did you said the will didnt count and now she is a widow and any man may ask her to marry him  any man but the one who loved her during her husbands life that is if he is such a man as halleck of course it isnt a question of gross black and white mere right and wrong there are degrees there are shades there might be redemption for another sort of man in such a marriage but for halleck there could only be lossdeteriorationlapse from the ideal i should think that he might suffer something of this even in her eyes  oh how hard you are i wish ben hadnt asked your advice why you are worse than he is youre not going to write that to him  atherton flung the letter upon the table and drew a troubled sigh ah i dont know i dont know
