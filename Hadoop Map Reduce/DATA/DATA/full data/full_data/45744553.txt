garden lie   adorned with flowers before my eye   and many pleasant places more   that i had never seen before    i saw the dimpling river pass   and be the skys blue lookingglass   the dusty roads go up and down   with people tramping in to town    if i could find a higher tree   farther and farther i should see   to where the grownup river slips   into the sea among the ships    to where the roads on either hand   lead onward into fairyland   where all the children dine at five   and all the playthings come alive   ix  windy nights    whenever the moon and stars are set     whenever the wind is high   all night long in the dark and wet     a man goes riding by   late in the night when the fires are out   why does he gallop and gallop about    whenever the trees are crying aloud     and ships are tossed at sea   by on the highway low and loud     by at the gallop goes he   by at the gallop he goes and then   by he comes back at the gallop again   x  travel    i should like to rise and go   where the golden apples grow   where below another sky   parrot islands anchored lie   and watched by cockatoos and goats   lonely crusoes building boats   where in sunshine reaching out   eastern cities miles about   are with mosque and minaret   among sandy gardens set   and the rich goods from near and far   hang for sale in the bazaar   where the great wall round china goes   and on one side the desert blows   and with bell and voice and drum   cities on the other hum   where are forests hot as fire   wide as england tall as a spire   full of apes and cocoanuts   and the negro hunters huts   where the knotty crocodile   lies and blinks in the nile   and the red flamingo flies   hunting fish before his eyes   where in jungles near and far   mandevouring tigers are   lying close and giving ear   lest the hunt be drawing near   or a comerby be seen   swinging in a palanquin   where among the desert sands   some deserted city stands   all its children sweep and prince   grown to manhood ages since   not a foot in street or house   nor a stir of child or mouse   and when kindly falls the night   in all the town no spark of light   there ill come when im a man   with a camel caravan   light a fire in the gloom   of some dusty diningroom   see the pictures on the walls   heroes fights and festivals   and in a corner find the toys   of the old egyptian boys   xi  singing    of speckled eggs the birdie sings     and nests among the trees   the sailor sings of ropes and things     in ships upon the seas    the children sing in far japan     the children sing in spain   the organ with the organ man     is singing in the rain   xii  looking forward    when i am grown to mans estate   i shall be very proud and great   and tell the other girls and boys   not to meddle with my toys   xiii  a good play    we built a ship upon the stairs   all made of the backbedroom chairs   and filled it full of sofa pillows   to go asailing on the billows    we took a saw and several nails   and water in the nursery pails   and tom said let us also take   an apple and a slice of cake   which was enough for tom and me   to go asailing on till tea    we sailed along for days and days   and had the very best of plays   but tom fell out and hurt his knee   so there was no one left but me   xiv  where go the boats    dark brown is the river     golden is the sand   it flows along for ever     with trees on either hand    green leaves afloating     castles of the foam   boats of mine aboating     where will all come home    on goes the river     and out past the mill   away down the valley     away down the hill    away down the river     a hundred miles or more   other little children     shall bring my boats ashore   xv  aunties skirts    whenever auntie moves around   her dresses make a curious sound   they trail behind her up the floor   and trundle after through the door   xvi  the land of counterpane    when i was sick and lay abed   i had two pillows at my head   and all my toys beside me lay   to keep me happy all the day    and sometimes for an hour or so   i watched my leaden soldiers go   with different uniforms and drills   among the bedclothes through the hills    and sometimes sent my ships in fleets   all up and down among the sheets   or brought my trees and houses out   and planted cities all about    i was the giant great and still   that sits upon the pillowhill   and sees before him dale and plain   the pleasant land of counterpane   xvii  the land of nod    from breakfast on all through the day   at home among my friends i stay   but every night i go abroad   afar into the land of nod    all by myself i have to go   with none to tell me what to do   all alone beside the streams   and up the mountainsides of dreams    the strangest things are there for me   both things to eat and things to see   and many frightening sights abroad   till morning in the land of nod    try as i like to find the way   i never can get back by day   nor can remember plain and clear   the curious music that i hear   xviii  my shadow    i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me   and what can be the use of him is more than i can see   he is very very like me from the heels up to the head   and i see him jump before me when i jump into my bed    the funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow   not at all like proper children which is always very slow   for he sometimes shoots up taller like an indiarubber ball   and he sometimes gets so little that theres none of him at all    he hasnt got a notion of how children ought to play   and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way   he stays so close beside me hes a coward you can see   id think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me    one morning very early before the sun was up   i rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup   but my lazy little shadow like an arrant sleepyhead   had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed   xix  system    every night my prayers i say   and get my dinner every day   and every day that ive been good   i get an orange after food    the child that is not clean

ugly word but smiled and stuck to play    and now at last the sun is going down behind the wood   and i am very happy for i know that ive been good    my bed is waiting cool and fresh with linen smooth and fair   and i must off to sleepsinby and not forget my prayer    i know that till tomorrow i shall see the sun arise   no ugly dream shall fright my mind no ugly sight my eyes    but slumber hold me tightly till i waken in the dawn   and hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn   xxi  escape at bedtime    the lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out     through the blinds and the windows and bars   and high overhead and all moving about     there were thousands of millions of stars   there neer were such thousands of leaves on a tree     nor of people in church or the park   as the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me     and that glittered and winked in the dark   the dog and the plough and the hunter and all     and the star of the sailor and mars   these shone in the sky and the pail by the wall     would be half full of water and stars   they saw me at last and they chased me with cries     and they soon had me packed into bed   but the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes     and the stars going round in my head   xxii  marching song    bring the comb and play upon it     marching here we come   willie cocks his highland bonnet

door of the house   the bat that lies in bed at noon   all love to be out by the light of the moon    but all of the things that belong to the day   cuddle to sleep to be out of her way   and flowers

the cold candle bathe and dress    close by the jolly fire i sit   to warm my frozen bones a bit   or with a reindeersled explore   the colder countries round the door    when to go out my nurse doth wrap   me in my comforter and cap   the cold wind burns my face and blows   its frosty pepper up my nose    black are my steps on silver sod   thick blows my frosty breath abroad   and tree and house and hill and lake   are frosted like a weddingcake   xxxix  the hayloft    through all the pleasant meadowside     the grass grew shoulderhigh   till the shining scythes went far and wide     and cut it down to dry    these green and sweetly smelling crops     they led in waggons home   and they piled them here in mountain tops     for mountaineers to roam    here is mount clear mount rustynail     mount eagle and mount high   the mice that in these mountains dwell     no happier are than i    o what a joy to clamber there     o what a place for play   with the sweet the dim the dusty air

we behold the embers flee   about the firelit hearth and see   our faces painted as we pass   like pictures on the windowglass    must we to bed indeed well then   let us arise and go like men   and face with an undaunted tread   the long black passage up to bed    farewell o brother sister sire   o pleasant party round the fire   the songs you sing the tales you tell   till far tomorrow fare ye well      2 shadow march    all round the house is the jetblack night     it stares through the windowpane   it crawls in the corners hiding from the light     and it moves with the moving flame    now my little heart goes abeating like a drum     with the breath of the bogie in my hair   and all round the candle the crooked shadows come     and go marching along up the stair    the shadow of the balusters the shadow of the lamp     the shadow of the child that goes to bed   all the wicked shadows coming tramp tramp tramp     with the black night overhead      3 in port    last to the chamber where i lie   my fearful footsteps patter nigh   and come from out the cold and gloom   into my warm and cheerful room    there safe arrived we turned about   to keep the coming shadows out   and close the happy door at last   on all the perils that we passed    then when mamma goes by to bed   she shall come in with tiptoe tread   and see me lying warm and fast   and in the land of nod at last     the child alone   i  the unseen playmate    when children are playing alone on the green   in comes the playmate that never was seen   when children are happy and lonely and good   the friend

alone    he lies in the laurels he runs on the grass   he sings when you tinkle the musical glass   wheneer you are happy and cannot tell why   the friend of the children is sure to be by    he loves to be little he hates to be big   tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig   tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin   that sides with the frenchmen and never can win    tis he when at night

o its i that am the captain of a tidy little ship     of a ship that goes asailing on the pond   and my ship it keeps aturning all around and all about   but when im a little older i shall find the secret out     how to send my vessel sailing on beyond    for i mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm     and the dolly i intend to come alive   and with him beside to help me its asailing i shall go   its asailing on the water when the jolly breezes blow     and the vessel goes a diviediviedive    o its then youll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds     and youll hear the water singing at the prow   for beside the dolly sailor im to voyage and explore   to land upon the island where no dolly was before     and to fire the penny cannon in the bow   iii  my kingdom    down by a shining water well   i found a very little dell     no higher than my head   the heather and the gorse about   in summer bloom were coming out     some yellow and some red    i called the little pool a sea   the little hills were big to me     for i am very small   i made a boat i made a town   i searched the caverns up and down     and named them one and all    and all about was mine i said   the little sparrows overhead     the little minnows too   this was the world and i was king   for me the bees came by to sing     for me the swallows flew    i played there were no deeper seas   nor any wider plains than these     nor other kings than me   at last i heard my mother call   out from the house at evenfall     to call me home to tea    and i must rise and leave my dell   and leave my dimpled water well     and leave my heather blooms   alas and as my home i neared   how very big my nurse appeared     how great and cool the rooms   iv  picturebooks in winter    summer fading winter comes   frosty mornings tingling thumbs   window robins winter rooks   and the picture storybooks    water now is turned to stone   nurse and i can walk upon   still we find the flowing brooks   in the picture storybooks    all the pretty things put by   wait upon the childrens eye   sheep and shepherds trees and crooks   in the picture storybooks    we may see how all things are   seas and cities near and far   and the flying fairies looks   in the picture storybooks    how am i to sing your praise   happy chimneycorner days   sitting safe in nursery nooks   reading picture storybooks   v  my treasures    these nuts that i keep in the back of the nest   where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest   were gathered in autumn by nursie and me   in a wood with a well by the side of the sea    this whistle we made and how clearly it sounds   by the side of a field at the end of the grounds   of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own   it was nursie who made it and nursie alone    the stone with the white and the yellow and grey   we discovered i cannot tell how far away   and i carried it back although weary and cold   for though father denies it im sure it is gold    but of all of my treasures the last is the king   for theres very few children possess such a thing   and that is a chisel both handle and blade   which a man who was really a carpenter made   vi  block city    what are you able to build with your blocks   castles and palaces temples and docks   rain may keep raining and others go roam   but i can be happy and building at home    let the sofa be mountains the carpet be sea   there ill establish a city for me   a kirk and a mill and a palace beside   and a harbour as well where my vessels may ride    great is the palace with pillar and wall   a sort of a tower on the top of it all   and steps coming down in an orderly way   to where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay    this one is sailing and that one is moored   hark to the song of the sailors on board   and see on the steps of my palace the kings   coming and going with presents and things    now i have done with it down let it go   all in a moment the town is laid low   block upon block lying scattered and free   what is there left of my town by the sea    yet as i saw it i see it again   the kirk and the palace the ships and the men   and as long as i live and whereer i may be   ill always remember my town by the sea   vii  the land of storybooks    at evening when the lamp is lit   around the fire my parents sit   they sit at home and talk and sing   and do not play at anything    now with my little gun i crawl   all in the dark along the wall   and follow round the forest track   away behind the sofa back    there in the night where none can spy   all in my hunters camp i lie   and play at books that i have read   till it is time to go to bed    these are the hills these are the woods   these are my starry solitudes   and there the river by whose brink   the roaring lions come to drink    i see the others far away   as if in firelit camp they lay   and i like to an indian scout   around their party prowled about    so when my nurse comes in for me   home i return across the sea   and go to bed with backward looks   at my dear land of storybooks   viii  armies in the fire    the lamps now glitter down the street   faintly sound the falling feet   and the blue even slowly falls   about the garden trees and walls    now in the falling of the gloom   the red fire paints the empty room   and warmly on the roof it looks   and flickers on the backs of books    armies march by tower and spire   of cities blazing in the fire   till as i gaze with staring eyes   the armies fade the lustre dies    then once again the glow returns   again the phantom city burns   and down the redhot valley lo   the phantom armies marching go    blinking embers tell me true   where are those armies marching to   and what the burning city is   that crumbles in your furnaces   ix  the little land    when at home alone i sit   and am very tired of it   i have just to shut my eyes   to go sailing through the skies   to go sailing far away   to the pleasant land of play   to the fairy land afar   where the little people are   where the clovertops are trees   and the rainpools are the seas   and the leaves like little ships   sail about on tiny trips   and above the daisy tree      through the grasses   high oerhead the bumble bee      hums and passes    in that forest to and fro   i can wander i can go   see the spider and the fly   and the ants go marching by   carrying parcels with their feet   down the green and grassy street   i can in the sorrel sit   where the ladybird alit   i can climb the jointed grass      and on high   see the greater swallows pass      in the sky   and the round sun rolling by   heeding no such things as i    through that forest i can pass   till as in a lookingglass   humming fly and daisy tree   and my tiny self i see   painted very clear and neat   on the rainpool at my feet   should a leaflet come to land   drifting near to where i stand   straight ill board that tiny boat   round the rainpool sea to float    little thoughtful creatures sit   on the grassy coasts of it   little things with lovely eyes   see me sailing with surprise   some are clad in armour green   these have sure to battle been   some are pied with evry hue   black and crimson gold and blue   some have wings and swift are gone   but they all look kindly on    when my eyes i once again   open and see all things plain   high bare walls great bare floor   great big knobs on drawer and door   great big people perched on chairs   stitching tucks and mending tears   each a hill that i could climb   and talking nonsense all the time      o dear me      that i could be   a sailor on the rainpool sea   a climber in the clovertree   and just come back a sleepyhead   late at night to go to bed     garden days

seen the starry hours   and the springing of the flowers   and the fairy things that pass   in the forests of the grass    in the silence he has heard   talking bee and ladybird   and the butterfly

lured out of this book   for long ago the truth to say   he has grown up and gone away   and it is but a child of air   that lingers in the garden there     underwoods     of all my verse like not a single line   but like my title for it is not mine   that title from a better man i stole   ah how much better had i stoln the whole   dedication  there are men and classes of men that stand above the common herd the soldier the sailor and the shepherd not unfrequently the artist rarely rarelier still the clergyman the physician almost as a rule he is the flower such as it is of our civilisation and when that stage of man is done with and only remembered to be marvelled at in history he will be thought to have shared as little as any in the defects of the period and most notably exhibited the virtues of the race generosity he has such as is possible to those who practise an art never to those who drive a trade discretion tested by a hundred secrets tact tried in a thousand embarrassments and what are more important heraclean cheerfulness and courage so it is that he brings air and cheer into the sickroom and often enough though not so often as he wishes brings healing  gratitude is but a lame sentiment thanks when they are expressed are often more embarrassing than welcome and yet i must set forth mine to a few out of many doctors who have brought me comfort and help to dr willey of san francisco whose kindness to a stranger it must be as grateful to him as it is touching to me to remember to dr karl ruedi of davos the good genius of the english in his frosty mountains to dr herbert of paris whom i knew only for a week and to dr caissot of montpellier whom i knew only for ten days and who have yet written their names deeply in my memory to dr brandt of royat to dr wakefield of nice to dr chepmell whose visits make it a pleasure to be ill to dr horace dobell so wise in counsel to sir andrew clark so unwearied in kindness and to that wise youth my uncle dr balfour  i forget as many as i remember and i ask both to pardon me these for silence those for inadequate speech but one name i have kept on purpose to the last because it is a household word with me and because if i had not received favours from so many hands and in so many quarters of the world it should have stood upon this page alone that of my friend thomas bodley scott of bournemouth will he accept this although shared among so many for a dedication to himself and when next my illfortune which has thus its pleasant side brings him hurrying to me when he would fain sit down to meat or lie down to rest will he care to remember that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool enough to be ungrateful    r l s    skerryvore     bournemouth     book i  in english   underwoods   i  envoy

sons escapes from that command    so from the sally each obeys   the unseen almighty nod   so till the ending all their ways   blindfolded loth have trod   nor knew their task at all but were the tools of god    and as the fervent smith of yore   beat out the glowing blade   nor wielded in the front of war   the weapons that he made   but in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade

savages   when evening takes her on her way   she having roamed a summers day   along the mountainsides and scalp   sleeps in an antre of that alp     which is so broad and high that there   as in the topless fields of air   my fancy soars like to a kite   and faints in the blue infinite     which is so strong my strongest throes   and the rough worlds besieging blows   not break it and so weak withal   death ebbs and flows in its loose wall   as the green sea in fishers nets   and tops its topmost parapets     which is so wholly mine that i   can wield its whole artillery   and mine so little that my soul   dwells in perpetual control   and i but think and speak and do   as my dead fathers move me to     if this born body of my bones   the beggared soul so barely owns   what money

sires and fled the sea   the towers we founded and the lamps we lit   to play at home with paper like a child   but rather say in the afternoon of time   a strenuous family dusted from its hands   the sand of granite and beholding far   along the sounding coast its pyramids   and tall memorials catch the dying sun   smiled well content and to this childish task   around the fire addressed its evening hours     book ii  in scots   note to book ii  the human conscience has fled of late the troublesome domain of conduct for what i should have supposed to be the less congenial field of art there she may now be said to rage and with special severity in all that touches dialect so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are tortured and the reader wearied to commemorate shades of mispronunciation now spelling is an art of great difficulty in my eyes and i am inclined to lean upon the printer even in common practice rather than to venture abroad upon new quests and the scots tongue has an orthography of its own lacking neither authority nor author yet the temptation is great to lend a little guidance to the bewildered englishman some simple phonetic artifice might defend your verses from barbarous mishandling and yet not injure any vested interest so it seems at first but there are rocks ahead thus if i wish the diphthong ou to have its proper value i may write oor instead of our many have done so and lived and the pillars of the universe remained unshaken but if i did so and came presently to doun which is the classical scots spelling of the english down i should begin to feel uneasy and if i went on a little further and came to a classical scots word like stour or dour or clour i should know precisely where i wasthat is to say that i was out of sight of land on those high seas of spelling reform in which so many strong swimmers have toiled vainly to some the situation is exhilarating as for me i give one bubbling cry and sink the compromise at which i have arrived is indefensible and i have no thought of trying to defend it as i have stuck for the most part to the proper spelling i append a table of some common vowel sounds which no one need consult and just to prove that i belong to my age and have in me the stuff of a reformer i have used modification marks throughout thus i can tell myself not without pride that i have added a fresh stumblingblock for english readers and to a page of print in my native tongue have lent a new uncouthness sed non nobis  i note again that among our new dialecticians the local habitat of every dialect is given to the square mile i could not emulate this nicety if i desired for i simply wrote my scots as well as i was able not caring if it hailed from lauderdale or angus from the mearns or galloway if i had ever heard a good word i used it without shame and when scots was lacking or the rhyme jibbed i was glad like my betters to fall back on english for all that i own to a friendly feeling for the tongue of fergusson and of sir walter both edinburgh men and i confess that burns has always sounded in my ear like something partly foreign and indeed i am from the lothians myself it is there i heard the language spoken about my childhood and it is in the drawling lothian voice that i repeat it to myself let the precisians call my speech that of the lothians and if it be not pure alas what matters it the day draws near when this illustrious and malleable tongue shall be quite forgotten and burnss ayrshire and dr macdonalds aberdeenawa and scotts brave metropolitan utterance will be all equally the ghosts of speech till then i would love to have my hour as a native maker and be read by my own countryfolk in our own dying language an ambition surely rather of the heart than of the head so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance so parochial in bounds of space   table of common scottish vowel sounds    ae    ai   open a as in rare    a    au   aw as in law   aw

in english take it being done   and let me sign it with the name you gave      teriitera     ballads  the song of rahÉro   i  the slaying of tÁmatÉa    it fell in the days of old as the men of taiárapu tell   a youth went forth to the fishing and fortune favoured him well   támatéa his name gullible simple and kind   comely of countenance nimble of body empty of mind   his mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife   serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life   alone from the sea and the fishing came támatéa the fair   urging his boat to the beach and the mother awaited him there   long may you live said she your fishing has sped to a wish   and now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish   for fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land   marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand   the hours and the miles are counted the tributes numbered and weighed   and woe to him that comes short and woe to him that delayed   so spoke on the beach the mother and counselled the wiser thing   for rahéro stirred in the country and secretly mined the king   nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought   in the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought   and when last to the temple of oro the boat with the victim sped   and the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead   trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing   for there was the aito1 dead and he of the house of the king    so spake on the beach the mother matter worthy of note   and wattled a basket well and chose a fish from the boat   and támatéa the pliable shouldered the basket and went   and travelled and sang as he travelled a lad that was well content   still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast   where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most   on his left with smoke as of battle the billows battered the land   unscalable turreted mountains rose on the inner hand   and cape and village and river and vale and mountain above   each had a name in the land for men to remember and love   and never the name of a place but lo a song in its praise   ancient and unforgotten songs of the earlier days   that the elders taught to the young and at night in the full of the       moon   garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune   támatéa the placable went with a lingering foot   he sang as loud as a bird he whistled hoarse as a flute   he broiled in the sun he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees   in the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees   and still in his empty mind crowded a thousandfold   the deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old    and now was he come to a place taiárapu honoured the most   where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast   spewing a level river there was a haunt of pai2   there in his potent youth when his parents drove him to die   honoura lived like a beast lacking the lamp and the fire   washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire   and there so mighty his hands he bent the tree to his foot   so keen the spur of his hunger he plucked it naked of fruit   there as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills   ahupu the woman of song walked on high on the hills    of these was rahéro sprung a man of a godly race   and inherited cunning of spirit and beauty of body and face   of yore in his youth as an aito rahéro wandered the land   delighting maids with his tongue smiting men with his hand   famous he was in his youth but before the midst of his life   paused and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife    house of mine it went house upon the sea   belovd of all my fathers more belovd by me   vale of the strong honoura deep ravine of pai   again in your woody summits i hear the tradewind cry    house of mine in your walls strong sounds the sea   of all sounds on earth dearest sound to me   i have heard the applause of men i have heard it arise and die   sweeter now in my house i hear the tradewind cry    these were the words of his singing other the thought of his heart   for secret desire of glory vexed him dwelling apart   lazy and crafty he was and loved to lie in the sun   and loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun   lazy he was his roof was ragged his table was lean   and the fish swam safe in his sea and he gathered the near and the       green   he sat in his house and laughed but he loathed the king of the land   and he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand   treason spread from his door and he looked for a day to come   a day of the crowding people a day of the summoning drum   when the vote should be taken the king be driven forth in disgrace   and rahéro the laughing and lazy sit and rule in his place    here támatéa came and beheld the house on the brook   and rahéro was there by the way and covered an oven to cook3   naked he was to the loins but the tattoo covered the lack   and the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back   swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet   and the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat   for he marked the basket carried covered from flies and the sun4   and rahéro buried his fire but the meat in his house was done    forth he stepped and took and delayed the boy by the hand   and vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land   our sires of old in taiárapu they that created the race   ate ever with eager hand nor regarded season or place   ate in the boat at the oar on the way afoot and at night   arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite   it is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire   and behold how fitting the time for here do i cover my fire   i see the fire for the cooking but never the meat to cook   said támatéatut said rahéro here in the brook   and there in the tumbling sea the fishes are thick as flies   hungry like healthy men and like pigs for savour and size   crayfish crowding the river seafish thronging the sea   well it may be says the other and yet be nothing to me   fain would i eat but alas i have needful matter in hand   since i carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land    now at the word a light sprang in rahéros eyes   i will gain me a dinner thought he and lend the king a surprise   and he took the lad by the arm as they stood by the side of the track   and smiled and rallied and flattered and pushed him forward and back   it was you that sing like a bird i never have heard you sing   and the lads when i was a lad were none so feared of a king   and of what account is an hour when the heart is empty of guile   but come and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile   and i will but drop my hook and behold the dinner made    so támatéa the pliable hung up his fish in the shade   on a tree by the side of the way and rahéro carried him in   smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin   and chose him a shining hook5 and viewed it with sedulous eye   and breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh   and set a mat for the gull and bade him be merry and bide   like a man concerned for his guest and the fishing and nothing beside    now when rahéro was forth he paused and hearkened and heard   the gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word   and stealthily crossed to the side of the way to the shady place   where the basket hung on a mango and craft transfigured his face   deftly he opened the basket and took of the fat of the fish   the cut of kings and chieftains enough for a goodly dish   this he wrapped in a leaf set on the fire to cook   and buried and next the marred remains of the tribute he took   and doubled and packed them well and covered the basket close   there is a buffet my king quoth he and a nauseous dose   and hung the basket again in the shade in a cloud of flies   and there is a sauce to your dinner king of the crafty eyes    soon as the oven was open the fish smelt excellent good   in the shade by the house of rahéro down they sat to their food   and cleared the leaves6 in silence or uttered a jest and laughed   and raising the cocoanut bowls buried their faces and quaffed   but chiefly in silence they ate and soon as the meal was done   rahéro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun   and támatéa quoth he it is time to be jogging my lad    so támatéa arose doing ever the thing he was bade   and carelessly shouldered the basket and kindly saluted his host   and again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast   long he went and at length was aware of a pleasant green   and the stems and shadows of palms and roofs of lodges between   there sate in the door of his palace the king on a kingly seat   and aitos stood armed around and the yottowas7 sat at his feet   but fear was a worm in his heart fear darted his eyes   and he probed mens faces for treasons and pondered their speech for       lies   to him came támatéa the basket slung in his hand   and paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand   in silence hearkened the king and closed the eyes in his face   harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base   in silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away   so támatéa departed turning his back on the day    and lo as the king sat brooding a rumour rose in the crowd   the yottowas nudged and whispered the commons murmured aloud   tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing   at the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king   and the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame   in their midst and the heart in his body was water and then was flame   till of a sudden turning he gripped an aito hard   a youth that stood with his ómare8 one of the daily guard   and spat in his ear a command and pointed and uttered a name   and hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame    now támatéa the fool was far on his homeward way   the rising night in his face behind him the dying day   rahéro saw him go by and the heart of rahéro was glad   devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad   and all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well   for he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell   and pleased with the notice of folk and pleased that his journey was       done   támatéa drew homeward turning his back to the sun    and now was the hour of the bath in taiárapu far and near   the lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear   night massed in the valleys the sun on the mountain coast   struck endlong and above the clouds embattled their host   and glowed and gloomed on the heights and the heads of the palms were       gems   and far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems   and the shadow of támatéa hovered already at home    and sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam   struck on his ear and he turned and lo a man on his track   girded and armed with an ómare following hard at his back   at a bound the man was upon himand or ever a word was said   the loaded end of the ómare fell and laid him dead   ii  the venging of tÁmatÉa    thus was rahéros treason thus and no further it sped   the king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead    but the mother of támatéa arose with death in her eyes   all night long and the next taiárapu rang with her cries   as when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt   and perceives nor home nor friends for the trees have closed her       about   the mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair   so the lionlike woman idly wearied the air   for a while and pierced mens hearing in vain and wounded their       hearts   but as when the weather changes at sea in dangerous parts   and sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky   at once the ship lies idle the sails hang silent on high   the breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp   and the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp   so sudden the voice of her weeping ceased in silence she rose   and passed from the house of her sorrow a woman clothed with repose   carrying death in her breast and sharpening death in her hand    hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land   they tell that she feared not to slumber alone in the dead of night   in accursed places beheld unblenched the ribbon of light9   spin from temple to temple guided the perilous skiff   abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff   from end to end of the island thought not the distance long   but forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong   to king after king as they sat in the palace door she came   claiming kinship declaiming verses naming her name   and the names of all of her fathers and still with a heart on the       rack   jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back   so would deceive them a while and change and return in a breath   and on all the men of vaiau imprecate instant death   and tempt her kingsfor vaiau was a rich and prosperous land   and flatterfor who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand   and change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song   invoking the beaten drums beholding the fall of the strong   calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead   and they held the chin in silence and heard her and shook the head   for they knew the men of taiárapu famous in battle and feast   marvellous eaters and smiters the men of vaiau not least   to the land of the námunuúra to paea10 at length she came   to men who were foes to the tevas and hated their race and name   there was she well received and spoke with hiopa the king11   and hiopa listened and weighed and wisely considered the thing   here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place   quoth he to the woman in quiet a weak and peaceable race   but far in the teeth of the wind lofty taiárapu lies   strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face and cries   aloud in the top of arduous mountains and utters its song   in green continuous forests strong is the wind and strong   and fruitful and hardy the race famous in battle and feast   marvellous eaters and smiters the men of vaiau not least   now hearken to me my daughter and hear a word of the wise   how a strength goes linked with a weakness two by two like the eyes   they can wield the ómare well and cast the javelin far   yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are   plant we then here at paea a garden of excellent fruits   plant we bananas and kava and taro the king of roots   let the pigs in paea be tapu12 and no man fish for a year   and of all the meat in tahiti gather we threefold here   so shall the fame of our plenty fill the island and so   at last on the tongue of rumour go where we wish it to go   then shall the pigs of taiárapu raise their snouts in the air   but we sit quiet and wait as the fowler sits by the snare   and tranquilly fold our hands till the pigs come nosing the food   but meanwhile build us a house of trotéa the stubborn wood   bind it with incombustible thongs set a roof to the room   too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume   and there when the pigs come trotting there shall the feast be spread   there shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead   so be it done for i have a heart that pities your state   and nateva and námunuúra are fire and water for hate    all was done as he said and the gardens prospered and now   the fame of their plenty went out and word of it came to vaiau   for the men of námunuúra sailed to the windward far   lay in the offing by south where the towns of the tevas are   and cast overboard of their plenty and lo at the tevas feet   the surf on all the beaches tumbled treasures of meat   in the salt of the sea a harvest tossed with the refluent foam   and the children gleaned it in playing and ate and carried it home   and the elders stared and debated and wondered and passed the jest   but whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest   and little by little from one to another the word went round   in all the borders of paea the victual rots on the ground   and swine are plenty as rats and now when they fare to the sea   the men of the námunuúra glean from under the tree   and load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat   and all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat   the steersman eats at the helm the rowers munch at the oar   and at length when their bellies are full overboard with the store   now was the word made true and soon as the bait was bare   all the pigs of taiárapu raised their snouts in the air   songs were recited and kinship was counted and tales were told   how war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old   the clans of the island to war said they now set we an end   and hie to the námunuúra even as a friend to a friend    so judged and a day was named and soon as the morning broke   canoes were thrust in the sea and the houses emptied of folk   strong blew the wind of the south the wind that gathers the clan   along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran   and the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountainhigh   a mountain throned on a mountain the fleet of canoes swept by   in the midst on the green lagoon with a crew released from care   sailing an even water breathing a summer air   cheered by a cloudless sun and ever to left and right   bursting surge on the reef drenching storms on the height   so the folk of vaiau sailed and were glad all day   coasting the palmtree cape and crossing the populous bay   by all the towns of the tevas and still as they bowled along   boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song   and the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea   and gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree   hailing and cheering time failed them for more to do   the holiday village careened to the wind and was gone from view   swift as a passing bird and ever as onward it bore   like the cry of the passing bird bequeathed its song to the shore   desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child   and the gazer left behind stared at the wake and smiled   by all the towns of the tevas they went and pápara last   the home of the chief the place of muster in war and passed   the march of the lands of the clan to the lands of an alien folk   and there from the dusk of the shoreside palms a column of smoke   mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun   paea they cried it is paea and so was the voyage done    in the early fall of the night hiopa came to the shore   and beheld and counted the comers and lo they were forty score   the pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played   the cleanlipped smile of the boy the slender breasts of the maid   and mighty limbs of women stalwart mothers of men   the sires stood forth unabashed but a little back from   his ken   clustered the scarcely nubile the lads and maids in a ring   fain of each other afraid of themselves aware of the king   and aping behaviour but clinging together with hands and eyes   with looks that were kind like kisses and laughter tender as sighs   there too the grandsire stood raising his silver crest   and the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast   the childhood of love the pair well married the innocent brood   the tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed   hiopa beheld them together all the ages of man   and a moment shook in his purpose                but these were the foes of his clan   and he trod upon pity and came and civilly greeted the king   and gravely entreated rahéro and for all that could fight or sing   and claimed a name in the land had fitting phrases of praise   but with all who were welldescended he spoke of the ancient days   and tis true said he that in paea the victual rots on the ground   but friends your number is many and pigs must be hunted and found   and the lads must troop to the mountains to bring the féis down   and around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town   so for tonight sleep here but king common and priest   tomorrow in order due shall sit with me in the feast   sleepless the livelong night hiopas followers toiled   the pigs screamed and were slaughtered the spars of the guesthouse       oiled   the leaves spread on the floor in many a mountain glen   the moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men   plucking and bearing fruits and in all the bounds of the town   red glowed the cocoanut fires and were buried and trodden down   thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan   but the eighth wrought with his lads hid from the sight of man   in the deeps of the woods they laboured piling the fuel high   in fagots the load of a man fuel seasoned and dry   thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame    and now was the day of the feast the forests as morning came   tossed in the wind and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day   and the cocoanuts showered on the ground rebounding and rolling away   a glorious morn for a feast a famous wind for a fire   to the hall of feasting hiopa led them mother and sire   and maid and babe in a tale the whole of the holiday throng   smiling they came garlanded green not dreaming of wrong   and for every three a pig tenderly cooked in the ground   waited and féi the staff of life heaped in a mound   for each where he satfor each bananas roasted and raw   piled with a bountiful hand as for horses hay and straw   are stacked in a stable and fish the food of desire13   and plentiful vessels of sauce and breadfruit gilt in the fire   and kava was common as water feasts have there been ere now   and many but never a feast like that of the folk of vaiau   all day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes   and turned from the pigs to the fish and again from the fish to the       fruits   and emptied the vessels of sauce and drank of the kava deep   till the young lay stupid as stones and the strongest nodded to sleep   sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night   tethered them hand and foot and their souls were drowned and the light   was cloaked from their eyes senseless together the old and the young   the fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue   the woman wedded and fruitful inured to the pangs of birth   and the maid that knew not of kisses blindly sprawled on the earth   from the hall hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth    already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north   but the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn   showering the nuts in the dusk and een as a banner is torn   high on the peaks of the island shattered the mountain cloud   and now at once at a signal a silent emulous crowd   set hands to the work of death hurrying to and fro   like ants to furnish the fagots building them broad and low   and piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall   silence persisted within for sleep lay heavy on all   but the mother of támatéa stood at hiopas side   and shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride   night fell on the toilers and first hiopa the wise   made the round of the hose visiting all with his eyes   and all was piled to the eaves and fuel blockaded the door   and within in the house beleaguered slumbered the forty score    then was an aito despatched and came with fire in his hand   and hiopa took itwithin said he is the life of a land   and behold i breathe on the coal i breathe on the dales of the east   and silence falls on forest and shore the voice of the feast   is quenched and the smoke of cooking the rooftree decays and falls   on the empty lodge and the winds subvert deserted walls    therewithal to the fuel he laid the glowing coal   and the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a mole   and copious smoke was conceived but as when a dam is to burst   the water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first   and then of a sudden whelms and bears it away forthright   so now in a moment the flame sprang and towered in the night   and wrestled and roared in the wind and high over house and tree   stood like a streaming torch enlightening land and sea    but the mother of támatéa threw her arms abroad   pyre of my son she shouted debited vengeance of god   late late i behold you yet i behold you at last   and glory beholding for now are the days of my agony past   the lust that famished my soul now eats and drinks its desire   and they that encompassed my son shrivel alive in the fire   tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years   ye quenched the voice of my singerhark in your dying ears   the song of the conflagration ye left me a widow alone   behold the whole of your race consumes sinew and bone   and torturing flesh together man mother and maid   heaped in a common shambles and already borne by the trade   the smoke of your dissolution darkens the stars of night    thus she spoke and her stature grew in the peoples sight   iii  rahÉro    rahéro was there in the hall asleep beside him his wife   comely a mirthful woman one that delighted in life   and a girl that was ripe for marriage shy and sly as a mouse   and a boy a climber of trees all the hopes of his house   unwary with open hands he slept in the midst of his folk   and dreamed that he heard a voice crying without and awoke   leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears   a hellish glow and clouds were about himit roared in his ears   like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep   and rahéro swayed as he stood and his reason was still asleep   now the flame struck hard on the house windwielded a fracturing blow   and the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below   and the lofty hall and the feast and the prostrate bodies of folk   shone red in his eyes a moment and then were swallowed of smoke   in the mind of rahéro clearness came and he opened his throat   and as when a squall comes sudden the straining sail of a boat   thunders aloud and bursts so thundered the voice of the man   the wind and the rain he shouted the mustering word of the       clan14   and up and to arms men of vaiau but silence replied   or only the voice of the gusts of the fire and nothing beside    rahéro stooped and groped he handled his womankind   but the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their       mind   and they lay like pillars prone and his hand encountered the boy   and there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy   him can i save he thought if i were speedy enough   and he loosened the cloth from his loins and swaddled the child in the       stuff   and about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well    there where the roof had fallen it roared like the mouth of hell   thither rahéro went stumbling on senseless folk   and grappled a post of the house and began to climb in the smoke   the last alive of vaiau and the son borne by the sire   the post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire   and the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs   and the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes   and still he climbed and came to the top the place of proof   and thrust a hand through the flame and clambered alive on the roof   but even as he did so the wind in a garment of flames and pain   wrapped him from head to heel and the waistcloth parted in twain   and the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below    about the blazing feasthouse clustered the eyes of the foe   watching hand upon weapon lest ever a soul should flee   shading the brow from the glare straining the neck to see   only to leeward the flames in the wind swept far and wide   and the forest sputtered on fire and there might no man abide   thither rahéro crept and dropped from the burning eaves   and crouching low to the ground in a treble covert of leaves   and fire and volleying smoke ran for the life of his soul   unseen and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal   cairned with a wonder of flame and blotting the night with smoke   blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk    he fled unguided at first but hearing the breakers roar   thitherward shaped his way and came at length to the shore   soundlimbed he was dryeyed but smarted in every part   and the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart   with sorrow and rage and fools he cried fools of vaiau   heads of swinegluttonsalas and where are they now   those that i played with those that nursed me those that i nursed   god and i outliving them i the least and the worst   i that thought myself crafty snared by this herd of swine   in the tortures of hell and desolate stripped of all that was mine   allmy friends and my fathersthe silver heads of yore   that trooped to the council the children that ran to the open door   crying with innocent voices and clasping a fathers knees   and mine my wifemy daughtermy sturdy climber of trees   ah never to climb again                            thus in the dusk of the night   for clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight   pacing and gnawing his fists rahéro raged by the shore   vengeance that must be his but much was to do before   and first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place   a life the root of revenge surviving plant of the race   and next the race to be raised anew and the lands of the clan   repeopled so rahéro designed a prudent man   even in wrath and turned for the means of revenge and escape   a boat to be seized by stealth a wife to be taken by rape    still was the dark lagoon beyond on the coral wall   he saw the breakers shine he heard them bellow and fall   alone on the top of the reef a man with a flaming brand   walked gazing and pausing a fishspear poised in his hand   the foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came   and the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame   afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait   a figure dimly guiding it surely the fishermans mate   rahéro saw and he smiled he straightened his mighty thews   naked with never a weapon and covered with scorch and bruise   he straightened his arms he filled the void of his body with breath   and strong as the wind in his manhood doomed the fisher to death    silent he entered the water and silently swam and came   there where the fisher walked holding on high the flame   loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea   and hard at the back of the man rahéro crept to his knee   on the coral and suddenly sprang and seized him the elder hand   clutching the joint of his throat the other snatching the brand   ere it had time to fall and holding it steady and high   strong was the fisher brave and swift of mind and of eye   strongly he threw in the clutch but rahéro resisted the strain   and jerked and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain   and the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet    one moment and there on the reef where the breakers whitened and       beat   rahéro was standing alone glowing and scorched and bare   a victor unknown of any raising the torch in the air   but once he drank of his breath and instantly set him to fish   like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish   for what should the woman have seen a man with a torchand then   a moments blur of the eyesand a man with a torch again   and the torch had scarcely been shaken ah surely rahéro said   she will deem it a trick of the eyes a fancy born in the head   but time must be given the fool to nourish a fools belief   so for a while a sedulous fisher he walked the reef   pausing at times and gazing striking at times with the spear   lastly uttered the call and even as the boat drew near   like a man that was done with its use tossed the torch in the sea    lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman and she   lightly addressed him and yielded the paddle and place to sit   for now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit   rahéro set him to row never a word he spoke   and the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke   what ails you the woman asked and why did you drop the brand   we have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land   never a word rahéro replied but urged the canoe   and a chill fell on the womanatta speak is it you   speak why are you silent why do you bend aside   wherefore steer to the seaward thus she panted and cried   never a word from the oarsman toiling there in the dark   but right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark   and wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep   drove her the little fitted forth on the open deep   and fear there where she sat froze the woman to stone   not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone   but a keener fear of the night the dark and the ghostly hour   and the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortals power   and more than a mortals boldness for much she knew of the dead   that haunt and fish upon reefs toiling like men for bread   and traffic with human fishers or slay them and take their ware   till the hour when the star of the dead15 goes down and the morning       air   blows and the cocks are singing on shore and surely she knew   the speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave16                                                    it blew   all night from the south all night rahéro contended and kept   the prow to the cresting sea and silent as though she slept   the woman huddled and quaked and now was the peep of day   high and long on their left the mountainous island lay   and over the peaks of taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck   on shore the birds were beginning to sing the ghostly ruck   of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave   and here on the sea the woman waxing suddenly brave   turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man   and sure he was none that she knew none of her country or clan   a stranger mothernaked and marred with the marks of fire   but comely and great of stature a man to obey and admire    and rahéro regarded her also fixed with a frowning face   judging the womans fitness to mother a warlike race   broad of shoulder ample of girdle long in the thigh   deep of bosom she was and bravely supported his eye    woman said he last night the men of your folk   man woman and maid smothered my race in smoke   it was done like cowards and i a mighty man of my hands   escaped a single life and now to the empty lands   and smokeless hearths of my people sail with yourself alone   before your mother was born the die of today was thrown   and you selectedyour husband vainly striving to fall   broken between these handsyourself to be severed from all   the places the people you lovehome kindred and clan   and to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man     the feast of famine  marquesan manners   i  the priests vigil    in all the land of the tribe was neither fish nor fruit   and the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot1   the clans upon the left and the clans upon the right   now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright   they gat them to the thicket to the deepest of the shade   and lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade   and oft in the starry even the song of morning rose   what time the oven smoked in the country of their foes   for oft to loving hearts and waiting ears and sight   the lads that went to forage returned not with the night   now first the children sickened and then the women paled   and the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed   hushed was the deep drum discarded was the dance   and those that met the priest now glanced at him askance   the priest was a man of years his eyes were rubyred2   he neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead   he knew the songs of races the names of ancient date   and the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chiefs estate   he dwelt in a highbuilt lodge hard by the roaring shore   raised on a noble terrace and with tikis3 at the door   within it was full of riches for he served his nation well   and full of the sound of breakers like the hollow of a shell   for weeks he let them perish gave never a helping sign   but sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine   but sat on his high terrace with the tikis by his side   and stared on the blue ocean like a parrot rubyeyed    dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height   out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light   up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun   but down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun   in the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoahusk   and the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk   a word that began to go round a word a whisper a start   hope that leaped in the bosom fear that knocked on the heart   see the priest is not risenlook for his door is fast   he is going to name the victims he is going to help us at last    thrice rose the sun to noon and ever like one of the dead   the priest lay still in his house with the roar of the sea in his head   there was never a foot on the floor there was never a whisper of       speech   only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach   again were the mountains fired again the morning broke   and all the houses lay still but the house of the priest awoke   close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan   but the aged redeyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man   and the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again   in the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain   frenzy shook in his limbs frenzy shone in his eyes   and still and again as he ran the valley rang with his cries   all day long in the land by cliff and thicket and den   he ran his lunatic rounds and howled for the flesh of men   all day long he ate not nor ever drank of the brook   and all day long in their houses the people listened and shook   all day long in their houses they listened with bated breath   and never a soul went forth for the sight of the priest was death    three were the days of his running as the gods appointed of yore   two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore   the drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees   on the sacred stones of the highplace under the sacred trees   with a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast   and the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest   last when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree   and the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea   and all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk   the wreck of the redeyed priest came gasping home in the dusk   he reeled across the village he staggered along the shore   and between the leering tikis crept groping through his door    there went a stir through the lodges the voice of speech awoke   once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke   and those who were mighty in war and those renowned for an art   sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart   ii  the lovers    hark away in the woodsfor the ears of love are sharp   stealthily quietly touched the note of the onestringed harp4   in

the swallow goes   and rua stood on the hill and sighed and followed her flight   and there were the lodges below each with its door alight   from folk that sat on the terrace and drew out the even long   sudden crowings of laughter monotonous drone of song   the quiet passage of souls over his head in the trees7   and from all around the haven the crumbling thunder of seas   farewell my home said rua farewell o quiet seat   tomorrow in all your valleys the drum of death shall beat   iii  the feast    dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the naked peak   and all the village was stirring for now was the priest to speak   forth on his terrace he came and sat with the chief in talk   his lips were blackened with fever his cheeks were whiter than chalk   fever clutched at his hands fever nodded his head   but quiet and steady and cruel his eyes shone rubyred   in the earliest rays of the sun the chief rose up content   braves were summoned and drummers messengers came and went   braves ran to their lodges weapons were snatched from the wall   the commons herded together and fear was over them all   festival dresses they wore but the tongue was dry in their mouth   and the blinking eyes in their faces skirted from north to south    now to the sacred enclosure gathered the greatest and least   and from under the shade of the banyan arose the voice of the feast   the frenzied roll of the drum and a swift monotonous song   higher the sun swam up the tradewind level and strong   awoke in the tops of the palms and rattled the fans aloud   and over the garlanded heads and shining robes of the crowd   tossed the spiders of shadow scattered the jewels of sun   forty the tale of the drums and the forty throbbed like one   a thousand hearts in the crowd and the even chorus of song   swift as the feet of a runner trampled a thousand strong   and the old men leered at the ovens and licked their lips for the food   and the women stared at the lads and laughed and looked to the wood   as when the sweltering baker at night when the city is dead   alone in the trough of labour treads and fashions the bread   so in the heat and the reek and the touch of woman and man   the naked spirit of evil kneaded the hearts of the clan    now cold was at many a heart and shaking in many a seat   for there were the empty baskets but who was to furnish the meat   for here was the nation assembled and there were the ovens anigh   and out of a thousand singers nine were numbered to die   till of a sudden a shock a mace in the air a yell   and struck in the edge of the crowd the first of the victims fell8   terror and horrible glee divided the shrinking clan   terror of what was to follow glee for a diet of man   frenzy hurried the chant frenzy rattled the drums   the nobles high on the terrace greedily mouthed their thumbs   and once and again and again in the ignorant crowd below   once and again and again descended the murderous blow   now smoked the oven and now with the cutting lip of a shell   a butcher of ninety winters jointed the bodies well   unto the carven lodge silent in order due   the grandees of the nation one after one withdrew   and a line of laden bearers brought to the terrace foot   on poles across their shoulders the last reserve of fruit   the victims bled for the nobles in the old appointed way   the fruit was spread for the commons for all should eat today   and now was the kava brewed and now the cocoa ran   now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man   and mirth was in every heart and a garland on every head   and all was well with the living and well with the eight who were dead   only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted a while   tomorrow they said and tomorrow and nodded and seemed to smile   rua the child of dirt the creature of common clay   rua must die tomorrow since rua is gone today   out of the groves of the valley where clear the blackbirds sang   sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain sprang   sheer and bare it rose unscalable barricade   beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade   dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light   close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night   here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees   or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze   high overhead with a cry the torrents leaped for the main   and silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain   dark in the staring noon dark was ruas ravine   damp and cold was the air and the face of the cliffs was green   here in the rocky pit accursed already of old   on a stone in the midst of a river rua sat and was cold    valley of midday shadows valley of silent falls   rua sang and his voice went hollow about the walls   valley of shadow and rock a doleful prison to me   what is the life you can give to a child of the sun and the sea   and rua arose and came to the open mouth of the glen   whence he beheld the woods and the sea and houses of men   wide blew the riotous trade and smelt in his nostrils good   it bowed the boats on the bay and tore and divided the wood   it smote and sundered the groves as moses smote with the rod   and the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad   and ever and on in a lull the tradewind brought him along   a faroff patter of drums and a faroff whisper of song    swift as the swallows wings the diligent hands on the drum   fluttered and hurried and throbbed ah woe that i hear you come   rua cried in his grief a sorrowful sound to me   mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea   woe in the song for the grave breathes in the singers breath   and i hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death   home of my youth no more through all the length of the years   no more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and tears   no more shall rua return no more as the evening ends   to crowded eyes of welcome to the reaching hands of friends    all day long from the highplace the drums and the singing came   and the even fell and the sun went down a wheel of flame   and night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the wood   and silence slept on all where rua sorrowed and stood   but still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival rang   and still the crowd in the highplace danced and shouted and sang    now over all the isle terror was breathed abroad   of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod   and before the nostrils of night the shuddering hunter of men   hurried with beard on shoulder back to his lighted den   taheia here to my siderua my rua you   and cold from the clutch of terror cold with the damp of the dew   taheia heavy of hair leaped through the dark to his arms   taheia leaped to his clasp and was folded in from alarms    rua beloved here see what your love has brought   comingalas returningswift as the shuttle of thought   returning alas for tonight with the beaten drum and the voice   in the shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice   and taheia the welldescended the daughter of chief and priest   taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the feast   so it was spoken and she girding her garment high   fled and was swallowed of woods swift as the sight of an eye    night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of stars   then a trouble awoke in the air the east was banded with bars   dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height   dawn in the deepest glen fell a wonder of light   high and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening east   and lo from the sides of the sea the broken sound of the feast   as when in days of summer through open windows the fly   swift as a breeze and loud as a trump goes by   but when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse   blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house   so the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night   so it staggered and drooped and droned in the morning light   iv  the raid    it chanced that as rua sat in the valley of silent falls   he heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls   fire had fashioned of yore and time had broken the rocks   there were rooting crannies for trees and nestingplaces for flocks   and he saw on the top of the cliffs looking up from the pit of the       shade   a flicker of wings and sunshine and trees that swung in the trade   the trees swing in the trade quoth rua doubtful of words   and the sun stares from the sky but what should trouble the birds   up from the shade he gazed where high the parapet shone   and he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon   what manner of things are these are they spirits abroad by day   or the foes of my clan that are come bringing death by a perilous way    the valley was gouged like a vessel and round like the vessels lip   with a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a       ship   on the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair   and the cape overhung like a chin a gulf of sunless air   silence heart what is thatthat which flickered and shone   into the sun for an instant and in an instant gone   was it a warriors plume a warriors girdle of hair   swung in the loop of a rope is he making a bridge of the air   once and again rua saw in the trenchant edge of the sky   the giddy conjuring done and then in the blink of an eye   a scream caught in with the breath a whirling packet of limbs   a lump that dived in the gulf more swift than a dolphin swims   and there was a lump at his feet and eyes were alive in the lump   sick was the soul of rua ambushed close in a clump   sick of soul he drew near making his courage stout   and he looked in the face of the thing and the life of the thing went       out   and he gazed on the tattooed limbs and behold he knew the man   hoka a chief of the vais the truculent foe of his clan   hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope   filled with the lust of war and alive with courage and hope    again to the giddy cornice rua lifted his eyes   and again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies   foes of my race cried rua the mouth of rua is true   never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you   there was never a nobler foray never a bolder plan   never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man   and rua your evildoer through all the days of his years   counts it honour to hate you honour to fall by your spears   and rua straightened his back o vais a scheme for a scheme   cried rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream   leaping from rock to rock as the waterwagtail at home   flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam   and rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook   and straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took   swift were the heels of his flight and loud behind as he went   rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent   and ever he thought as he ran and caught at his gasping breath   o the fool of a rua rua that runs to his death   but the right is the right thought rua and ran like the wind on the       foam   the right is the right for ever and home for ever home   for what though the oven smoke and what though i die ere morn   there was i nourished and tended and there was taheia born    noon was high on the highplace the second noon of the feast   and heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest   and the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals   and the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels   and crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh   with a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye   as about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall   the dead and the maimed are scattered and lie and stagger and crawl   so on the grades of the terrace in the ardent eye of the day   the halfawake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay   and loud as the dome of the bees in the time of a swarming horde   a horror of many insects hung in the air and roared   rua looked and wondered he said to himself in his heart   poor are the pleasures of life and death is the better part   but lo on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk   sat by themselves nor raised their serious eyes nor spoke   women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged   gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged   and quiet amongst the quiet and fairer than all the fair   taheia the welldescended taheia heavy of hair   and the soul of rua awoke courage enlightened his eyes   and he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise   over against him at once in the spotted shade of the trees   owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees   on the grades of the sacred terrace the driveller woke to fear   and the hand of the hamdrooped warrior brandished a wavering spear   and rua folded his arms and scorn discovered his teeth   above the warcrowd gibbered and rua stood smiling beneath   thick like leaves in the autumn faint like april sleet   missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet   and taheia leaped from her place and the priest the rubyeyed   ran to the front of the terrace and brandished his arms and cried   hold o fools he brings tidings and hold tis the love of my       heart   till lo in front of the terrace rua pierced with a dart    taheia cherished his head and the aged priest stood by   and gazed with eyes of ruby at ruas darkening eye   taheia here is the end i die a death for a man   i have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan   see them the drooping of hams behold me the blinking crew   fifty spears they cast and one of fifty true   and you o priest the foreteller foretell for yourself if you can   foretell the hour of the day when the vais shall burst on your clan   by the head of the tapu cleft with death and fire in their hand   thick and silent like ants the warriors swarm in the land    and they tell that when next the sun had climbed to the noonday skies   it shone on the smoke of feasting in the country of the vais     ticonderoga  a legend of the west highlands   ticonderoga    this is the tale of the man     who heard a word in the night   in the land of the heathery hills     in the days of the feud and the fight   by the sides of the rainy sea     where never a stranger came   on the awful lips of the dead     he heard the outlandish name   it sang in his sleeping ears     it hummed in his waking head   the nameticonderoga     the utterance of the dead   i  the saying of the name    on the lochsides of appin     when the mist blew from the sea   a stewart stood with a cameron     an angry man was he   the blood beat in his ears     the blood ran hot to his head   the mist blew from the sea     and there was the cameron dead   o what have i done to my friend     o what have i done to mysel   that he should be cold and dead     and i in the danger of all    nothing but danger about me     danger behind and before   death at wait in the heather     in appin and mamore   hate at all of the ferries     and death at each of the fords   camerons priming gunlocks     and camerons sharpening swords    but this was a man of counsel     this was a man of a score   there dwelt no pawkier stewart     in appin or mamore   he looked on the blowing mist     he looked on the awful dead   and there came a smile on his face     and there slipped a thought in his head    out over cairn and moss     out over scrog and scaur   he ran as runs the clansman     that bears the cross of war   his heart beat in his body     his hair clove to his face   when he came at last in the gloaming     to the dead mans brothers place   the east was white with the moon     the west with the sun was red   and there in the housedoorway     stood the brother of the dead    i have slain a man to my danger     i have slain a man to my death   i put my soul in your hands     the panting stewart saith   i lay it bare in your hands     for i know your hands are leal   and be you my targe and bulwark     from the bullet and the steel    then up and spoke the cameron     and gave him his hand again   there shall never a man in scotland     set faith in me in vain   and whatever man you have slaughtered     of whatever name or line   by my sword and yonder mountain     i make your quarrel mine1   i bid you in to my fireside     i share with you house and hall   it stands upon my honour     to see you safe from all    it fell in the time of midnight     when the fox barked in the den   and the plaids were over the faces     in all the houses of men   that as the living cameron     lay sleepless on his bed   out of the night and the other world     came in to him the dead    my blood is on the heather     my bones are on the hill   there is joy in the home of ravens     that the young shall eat their fill   my blood is poured in the dust     my soul is spilled in the air   and the man that has undone me     sleeps in my brothers care   im wae for your death my brother     but if all of my house were dead   i couldna withdraw the plighted hand     nor break the word once said    o what shall i say to our father     in the place to which i fare   o what shall i say to our mother     who greets to see me there   and to all the kindly camerons     that have lived and died longsyne   is this the word you send them     fausehearted brother mine    its neither fear nor duty     its neither quick nor dead   shall gar me withdraw the plighted hand     or break the word once said    thrice in the time of midnight     when the fox barked in the den   and the plaids were over the faces     in all the houses of men   thrice as the living cameron     lay sleepless on his bed   out of the night and the other world     came in to him the dead   and cried to him for vengeance     on the man that laid him low   and thrice the living cameron     told the dead cameron no    thrice have you seen me brother     but now shall see me no more   till you meet your angry fathers     upon the farther shore   thrice have i spoken and now     before the cock be heard   i take my leave for ever     with the naming of a word   it shall sing in your sleeping ears     it shall hum in your waking head   the nameticonderoga     and the warning of the dead    now when the night was over     and the time of peoples fears   the cameron walked abroad     and the word was in his ears   many a name i know     but never a name like this   o where shall i find a skilly man     shall tell me what it is   with many a man he counselled     of high and low degree   with the herdsman on the mountains     and the fishers of the sea   and he came and went unweary     and read the books of yore   and the runes that were written of old     on stones upon the moor   and many a name he was told     but never the name of his fears   never in east or west     the name that rang in his ears   names of men and of clans     names for the grass and the tree   for the smallest tarn in the mountains     the smallest reef in the sea   names for the high and low     the names of the craig and the flat   but in all the land of scotland     never a name like that   ii  the seeking of the name    and now there was speech in the south     and a man of the south that was wise   a periwigd lord of london2     called on the clans to rise   and the riders rode and the summons     came to the western shore   to the land of the sea and the heather     to appin and mamore   it called on all to gather     from every scrog and scaur   that loved their fathers tartan     and the ancient game of war   and down the watery valley     and up the windy hill   once more as in the olden     the pipes were sounding shrill   again in highland sunshine     the naked steel was bright   and the lads once more in tartan     went forth again to fight    o why should i dwell here     with a weird upon my life   when the clansmen shout for battle     and the warswords clash in strife   i canna joy at feast     i canna sleep in bed   for the wonder of the word     and the warning of the dead   it sings in my sleeping ears     it hums in my waking head   the nameticonderoga     the utterance of the dead   then up and with the fighting men     to march away from here   till the cry of the great warpipe     shall drown it in my ear    where flew king georges ensign     the plaided soldiers went   they drew the sword in germany     in flanders pitched the tent   the bells of foreign cities     rang far across the plain   they passed the happy rhine     they drank the rapid main   through asiatic jungles     the tartans filed their way   and the neighing of the warpipes     struck terror in cathay3    many a name have i heard he thought     in all the tongues of men   full many a name both here and there     full many both now and then   when i was at home in my fathers house     in the land of the naked knee   between the eagles that fly in the lift     and the herrings that swim in the sea   and now that i am a captainman     with a braw cockade in my hat   many a name have i heard he thought     but never a name like that   iii  the place of the name    there fell a war in a woody place     lay far across the sea   a war of the march in the mirk midnight     and the shot from behind the tree   the shaven head and the painted face     the silent foot in the wood   in the land of a strange outlandish tongue     that was hard to be understood    it fell about the gloaming     the general stood with his staff   he stood and he looked east and west     with little mind to laugh   far have i been and much have i seen     and kennt both gain and loss   but here we have woods on every hand     and a kittle water to cross   far have i been and much have i seen     but never the beat of this   and theres one must go down to that waterside     to see how deep it is    it fell in the dusk of the night     when unco things betide   the skilly captain the cameron     went down to that waterside   canny and soft the captain went     and a man of the woody land   with the shaven head and the painted face     went down at his right hand   it fell in the quiet night     there was never a sound to ken   but all of the woods to the right and the left     lay filled with the painted men    far have i been and much have i seen     both as a man and boy   but never have i set forth a foot     on so perilous an employ   it fell in the dusk of the night     when unco things betide   that he was aware of a captainman     drew near to the waterside   he was aware of his coming     down in the gloaming alone   and he looked in the face of the man     and lo the face was his own   this is my weird he said     and now i ken the worst   for many shall fall the morn     but i shall fall with the first   o you of the outland tongue     you of the painted face   this is the place of my death     can you tell me the name of the place    since the frenchmen have been here     they have called it saultmarie   but that is a name for priests     and not for you and me   it went by another word     quoth he of the shaven head   it was called ticonderoga     in the days of the great dead   and it fell on the morrows morning     in the fiercest of the fight   that the cameron bit the dust     as he foretold at night   and far from the hills of heather     far from the isles of the sea   he sleeps in the place of the name     as it was doomed to be     heather ale  a galloway legend   heather ale    from the bonny bells of heather     they brewed a drink longsyne   was sweeter far than honey     was stronger far than wine   they brewed it and they drank it     and lay in a blessed swound   for days and days together     in their dwellings underground    there rose a king in scotland     a fell man to his foes   he smote the picts in battle     he hunted them like roes   over miles of the red mountain     he hunted as they fled   and strewed the dwarfish bodies     of the dying and the dead    summer came in the country     red was the heather bell   but the manner of the brewing     was none alive to tell   in the graves that were like childrens     on many a mountain head   the brewsters of the heather     lay numbered with the dead    the king in the red moorland     rode on a summers day   and the bees hummed and the curlews     cried beside the way   the king rode and was angry     black was his brow and pale   to rule in a land of heather     and lack the heather ale    it fortuned that his vassals     riding free on the heath   came on a stone that was fallen     and vermin hid beneath   rudely plucked from their hiding     never a word they spoke   a son and his aged father     last of the dwarfish folk    the king sat high on his charger     he looked on the little men   and the dwarfish and swarthy couple     looked at the king again   down by the shore he had them     and there on the giddy brink   i will give you life ye vermin     for the secret of the drink    there stood the son and father     and they looked high and low   the heather was red around them     the sea rumbled below   and up and spoke the father     shrill was his voice to hear   i have a word in private     a word for the royal ear    life is dear to the aged     and honour a little thing   i would gladly sell the secret     quoth the pict to the king   his voice was small as a sparrows     and shrill and wonderful clear   i would gladly sell my secret     only my son i fear    for life is a little matter     and death is nought to the young   and i dare not sell my honour     under the eye of my son   take him o king and bind him     and cast him far in the deep   and its i will tell the secret     that i have sworn to keep    they took the son and bound him     neck and heels in a thong   and a lad took him and swung him     and flung him far and strong   and the sea swallowed his body     like that of a child of ten   and there on the cliff stood the father     last of the dwarfish men    true was the word i told you     only my son i feared   for i doubt the sapling courage     that goes without the beard   but now in vain is the torture     fire shall never avail   here dies in my bosom     the secret of heather ale     christmas at sea   christmas at sea    the sheets were frozen hard and they cut the naked hand   the decks were like a slide where a seaman scarce could stand   the wind was a norwester blowing squally off the sea   and cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things alee    they heard the surf aroaring before the break of day   but twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay   we tumbled every hand on deck instanter with a shout   and we gave her the maintopsl and stood by to go about    all day we tacked and tacked between the south head and the north   all day we hauled the frozen sheets and got no further forth   all day as cold as charity in bitter pain and dread   for very life and nature we tacked from head to head    we gave the south a wider berth for there the tiderace roared   but every tack we made we brought the north head close aboard   sos we saw the cliffs and houses and the breakers running high   and the coastguard in his garden with his glass against his eye    the frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam   the good red fires were burning bright in every longshore home   the windows sparkled clear and the chimneys volleyed out   and i vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about    the bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer   for its just that i should tell you how of all days in the year   this day of our adversity was blessèd christmas morn   and the house above the coastguards was the house where i was born    o well i saw the pleasant room the pleasant faces there   my mothers silver spectacles my fathers silver hair   and well i saw the firelight like a flight of homely elves   go dancing round the chinaplates that stand upon the shelves    and well i knew the talk they had the talk that was of me   of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea   and o the wicked fool i seemed in every kind of way   to be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessèd christmas day    they lit the high sealight and the dark began to fall   all hands to loose topgallant sails i heard the captain call   by the lord shell never stand it our first mate jackson cried    its the one way or the other mr jackson he replied    she staggered to her bearings but the sails were new and good   and the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood   as the winters day was ending in the entry of the night   we cleared the weary headland and passed below the light    and they heaved a mighty breath every soul on board but me   as they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea   but all that i could think of in the darkness and the cold   was just that i was leaving home and my folks were growing old     notes to the song of rahÉro   introductionthis tale of which i have not consciously changed a single feature i received from tradition it is highly popular through all the country of the eight tevas the clan to which rahéro belonged and particularly in taiárapu the windward peninsula of tahiti where he lived i have heard from end to end two versions and as many as five different persons have helped me with details there seems no reason why the tale should not be true  note 1 page 140 the aito quasi champion or brave one skilled in the use of some weapon who wandered the country challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in local quarrels it was in the natural course of his advancement to be at last employed by a chief or king and it would then be a part of his duties to purvey the victim for sacrifice one of the doomed families was indicated the aito took his weapon and went forth alone a little behind him bearers followed with the sacrificial basket sometimes the victim showed fight sometimes prevailed more often without doubt he fell but whatever body was found the bearers indifferently took up  note 2 page 141 pai honoura and ahupu legendary persons of tahiti all natives of taiárapu of the first two i have collected singular although imperfect legends which i hope soon to lay before the public in another place of ahupu except in snatches of song little memory appears to linger she dwelt at least about teparithe seacliffsthe eastern fastness of the isle walked by paths known only to herself upon the mountains was courted by dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent islands and defended and rescued as i gather by the loyalty of native fish my anxiety to learn more of ahupu vehine became during my stay in taiárapu a cause of some diversion to that mirthful people the inhabitants  note 3 page 142 covered an oven the cooking fire is made in a hole in the ground and is then buried  note 4 page 143 flies this is perhaps an anachronism even speaking of today in tahiti the phrase would have to be understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes and these only in watered valleys with close woods such as i suppose to form the surroundings of rahéros homestead a quarter of a mile away where the air moves freely you shall look in vain for one  note 5 page 144 hook of motherofpearl brighthook fishing and that with the spear appear to be the favourite native

loaded quarterstaff one of the two favourite weapons of the tahitian brave the javelin or casting spear was the other  note 9 page 148 the ribbon of light still to be seen and heard spinning from one marae to another on tahiti or so i have it upon evidence that would rejoice the psychical society  note 10 page 149 námunuúra the complete name is námunuúra te aropa why it should be pronounced námunu dactylically i cannot see but so i have always heard it this was the clan immediately beyond the tevas on the south coast of the island at the date of the tale the clan organisation must have been very weak there is no particular mention of támatéas mother going to pápara to the head chief of her own clan which would appear her natural recourse on the other hand she seems to have visited various lesser chiefs among the tevas and these to have excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise the broad distinction here drawn between nateva and námunuúra is therefore not impossibly anachronistic  note 11 page 149 hiopa the king hiopa was really the name of the king chief of vaiau but i could never learn that of the king of paeapronounce to rhyme with the indian ayahand i gave the name where it was most needed this note must appear otiose indeed to readers who have never heard of either of these two gentlemen and perhaps there is only one person in the world capable at once of reading my verses and spying the inaccuracy for him for mr tati salmon hereditary high chief of the tevas the note is solely written a small attention from a clansman to his chief  note 12 page 150 let the pigs be tapu it is impossible to explain tapu in a note we have it as an english word taboo suffice it that a thing which was tapu must not be touched nor a place that was tapu visited  note 13 page 155 fish the food of desire there is a special word in the tahitian language to signify hungering after fish i may remark that here is one of my chief difficulties about the whole story how did king commons women and all come to eat together at this feast but it troubled none of my numerous authorities so there must certainly be some natural explanation  note 14 page 160 the mustering word of the clan    teva te ua   teva te matai    teva the wind   teva the rain  notes 15 and 16 page 165 the star of the dead venus as a morning star i have collected much curious evidence as to this belief the dead retain their taste for a fish diet enter into copartnery with living fishers and haunt the reef and the lagoon the conclusion attributed to the nameless lady of the legend would be reached today under the like circumstances by ninety per cent of polynesians and here i probably understate by onetenth   notes to the feast of famine  in this ballad i have strung together some of the more striking particularities of the marquesas it rests upon no authority it is in no sense like rahéro a native story but a patchwork of details of manners and the impressions of a traveller it may seem strange when the scene is laid upon these profligate islands to make the story hinge on love but love is not less known in the marquesas than elsewhere nor is there any cause of suicide more common in the islands  note 1 page 169 pit of popoi where the breadfruit was stored for preservation  note 2 page 169 rubyred the priests eyes were probably red from the abuse of kava his beard ib is said to be worth an estate for the beards of old men are the favourite headadornment of the marquesans as the hair of women formed their most costly girdle the former among this generally beardless and shortlived people fetch today considerable sums  note 3 page 169 tikis the tiki is an ugly image hewn out of wood or stone  note 4 page 172 the onestringed harp usually employed for serenades  note 5 page 173 the sacred cabin of palm which however no woman could approach i do not know where women were tattooed probably in the common house or in the bush for a woman was a creature of small account i must guard the reader against supposing taheia was at all disfigured the art of the marquesan tattooer is extreme and she would appear to be clothed in a web of lace inimitably delicate exquisite in pattern and of a bluish hue that at once contrasts and harmonises with the warm pigment of the native skin it would be hard to find a woman more becomingly adorned than a welltattooed marquesan  note 6 page 175 the horror of night the polynesian fear of ghosts and of the dark has been already referred to their life is beleaguered by the dead  note 7 page 176 the quiet passage of souls so i am told the natives explain the sound of a little wind passing overhead unfelt  note 8 page 178 the first of the victims fell without doubt this whole scene is untrue to fact the victims were disposed of privately and some time before and indeed i am far from claiming the credit of any high degree of accuracy for this ballad even in the time of famine it is probable that marquesan life went far more gaily than is here represented but the melancholy of today lies on the writers mind   notes to ticonderoga  introductioni first heard this legend of my own country from that friend of men of letters mr alfred nutt there in roaring londons central stream and since the ballad first saw the light of day in scribners magazine mr nutt and lord archibald campbell have been in public controversy on the facts two clans the camerons and the campbells lay claim to this bracing story and they do well the man who preferred his plighted troth to the commands and menaces of the dead is an ancestor worth disputing but the campbells must rest content they have the broad lands and the broad page of history this appanage must be denied them for between the name of cameron and that of campbell the muse will never hesitate  note 1 page 191 mr nutt reminds me it was by my sword and ben cruachan the cameron swore  note 2 page 194 a periwigd lord of london the first pitt  note 3 page 195 cathay there must be some omission in general stewarts charming history of the highland regiments a book that might well be republished and continued or it scarce appears how our friend could have got to china   note to heather ale  among the curiosities of human nature this legend claims a high place it is needless to remind the reader that the picts were never exterminated and form to this day a large proportion of the folk of scotland occupying the eastern and the central parts from the firth of forth or perhaps the lammermoors upon the south to the ord of caithness on the north that the blundering guess of a dull chronicler should have inspired men with imaginary loathing for their own ancestors is already strange that it should have begotten this wild legend seems incredible is it possible the chroniclers error was merely nominal that what he told and what the people proved themselves so ready to receive about the picts was true or partly true of some anterior
