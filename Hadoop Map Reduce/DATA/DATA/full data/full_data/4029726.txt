4029726	a set of six  by joseph conrad    les petites marionnettes font font font trois petits tours et puis sen vont nursery rhyme     to miss m h m capes     authors note   the six stories in this volume are the result of some three or four years of occasional work the dates of their writing are far apart their origins are various none of them are connected directly with personal experiences in all of them the facts are inherently true by which i mean that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened for instance the last story in the volume the one i call pathetic whose first title is il conde misspelt bytheby is an almost verbatim transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom i met in italy i dont mean to say it is only that anybody can see that it is something more than a verbatim report but where he left off and where i began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be interested in the problem i dont mean to say that the problem is worth the trouble what i am certain of however is that it is not to be solved for i am not at all clear about it myself by this time all i can say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite apart from the story he was telling me i heard a few years ago that he had died far away from his beloved naples where that abominable adventure did really happen to him  thus the genealogy of il conde is simple it is not the case with the other stories various strains contributed to their composition and the nature of many of those i have forgotten not having the habit of making notes either before or after the fact i mean the fact of writing a story what i remember best about gaspar ruiz is that it was written or at any rate begun within a month of finishing nostromo but apart from the locality and that a pretty wide one all the south american continent the novel and the story have nothing in common neither mood nor intention and certainly not the style the manner for the most part is that of general santierra and that old warrior i note with satisfaction is very true to himself all through looking now dispassionately at the various ways in which this story could have been presented i cant honestly think the general superfluous it is he an old man talking of the days of his youth who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it an air of actuality which i doubt whether i could have achieved without his help in the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at all because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of his simple mind but all this is but a laborious searching of memories my present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise the hint for gaspar ruiz the man i found in a book by captain basil hall rn who was for some time between the years 1824 and 1828 senior officer of a small british squadron on the west coast of south america his book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and i suppose is to be found still in some libraries the curious who may be mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document vol ii i forget the page but it is somewhere not far from the end another document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind from a friend then in burma passing certain strictures upon the gentleman with the gun on his back which i do not intend to make accessible to the public yet the gun episode did really happen or at least i am bound to believe it because i remember it described in an extremely matteroffact tone in some book i read in my boyhood and i am not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth  the brute which is the only seastory in the volume is like il conde associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on warm human lips i will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship but the first i heard of her homicidal habits was from the late captain blake commanding a london ship in which i served in 1884 as second officer captain blake was of all my commanders the one i remember with the greatest affection i have sketched in his personality without however mentioning his name in the first paper of the mirror of the sea in his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is perhaps for that reason that i have put the story into the mouth of a young man and made of it what the reader will see the existence of the brute was a fact the end of the brute as related in the story is also a fact wellknown at the time though it really happened to another ship of great beauty of form and of blameless character which certainly deserved a better fate i have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story thinking that i had there something in the nature of poetical justice i hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty of my proceedings as a writer of tales  of the informer and an anarchist i will say next to nothing the pedigree of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at this distance of time i found them and here they are the discriminating reader will guess that i have found them within my mind but how they or their elements came in there i have forgotten for the most part and for the rest i really dont see why i should give myself away more than i have done already  it remains for me only now to mention the duel the longest story in the book that story attained the dignity of publication all by itself in a small illustrated volume under the title the point of honour that was many years ago it has been since reinstated in its proper place which is the place it occupies in this volume in all the subsequent editions of my work its pedigree is extremely simple it springs from a tenline paragraph in a small provincial paper published in the south of france that paragraph occasioned by a duel with a fatal ending between two wellknown parisian personalities referred for some reason or other to the wellknown fact of two officers in napoleons grand army having fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars and on some futile pretext the pretext was never disclosed i had therefore to invent it and i think that given the character of the two officers which i had to invent too i have made it sufficiently convincing by the mere force of its absurdity the truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction i had heard in my boyhood a good deal of the great napoleonic legend i had a genuine feeling that i would find myself at home in it and the duel is the result of that feeling or if the reader prefers of that presumption personally i have no qualms of conscience about this piece of work the story might have been better told of course all ones work might have been better done but this is the sort of reflection a worker must put aside courageously if he doesnt mean every one of his conceptions to remain for ever a private vision an evanescent reverie how many of those visions have i seen vanish in my time this one however has remained a testimony if you like to my courage or a proof of my rashness what i care to remember best is the testimony of some french readers who volunteered the opinion that in those hundred pages or so i had managed to render wonderfully the spirit of the whole epoch exaggeration of kindness no doubt but even so i hug it still to my breast because in truth that is exactly what i was trying to capture in my small net the spirit of the epochnever purely militarist in the long clash of arms youthful almost childlike in its exaltation of sentimentnaively heroic in its faith   1920 j c      contents   gaspar ruiz  the informer  the brute  an anarchist  the duel  il conde      a set of six     gaspar ruiz   i   a revolutionary war raises many strange characters out of the obscurity which is the common lot of humble lives in an undisturbed state of society  certain individualities grow into fame through their vices and their virtues or simply by their actions which may have a temporary importance and then they become forgotten the names of a few leaders alone survive the end of armed strife and are further preserved in history so that vanishing from mens active memories they still exist in books  the name of general santierra attained that cold paperandink immortality he was a south american of good family and the books published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators of that continent from the oppressive rule of spain  that long contest waged for independence on one side and for dominion on the other developed in the course of years and the vicissitudes of changing fortune the fierceness and inhumanity of a struggle for life all feelings of pity and compassion disappeared in the growth of political hatred and as is usual in war the mass of the people who had the least to gain by the issue suffered most in their obscure persons and their humble fortunes  general santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot army raised and commanded by the famous san martin afterwards conqueror of lima and liberator of peru a great battle had just been fought on the banks of the river biobio amongst the prisoners made upon the routed royalist troops there was a soldier called gaspar ruiz his powerful build and his big head rendered him remarkable amongst his fellowcaptives the personality of the man was unmistakable some months before he had been missed from the ranks of republican troops after one of the many skirmishes which preceded the great battle and now having been captured arms in hand amongst royalists he could expect no other fate but to be shot as a deserter  gaspar ruiz however was not a deserter his mind was hardly active enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages or perils of treachery why should he change sides he had really been made a prisoner had suffered illusage and many privations neither side showed tenderness to its adversaries there came a day when he was ordered together with some other captured rebels to march in the front rank of the royal troops a musket had been thrust into his hands he had taken it he had marched he did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar atrocity for refusing to march he did not understand heroism but it was his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity meantime he had gone on loading and firing from fear of having his brains blown out at the first sign of unwillingness by some noncommissioned officer of the king of spain he tried to set forth these elementary considerations before the sergeant of the guard set over him and some twenty other such deserters who had been condemned summarily to be shot  it was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries which command the roadstead of valparaiso the officer who had identified him had gone on without listening to his protestations his doom was sealed his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back his body was sore all over from the many blows with sticks and butts of muskets which had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to the gate of the fort this was the only kind of systematic attention the prisoners had received from their escort during a four days journey across a scantily watered tract of country at the crossings of rare streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly like dogs in the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as they dropped down deadbeat upon the stony ground of the haltingplace  as he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning after having been driven hard all night gaspar ruizs throat was parched and his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth  and gaspar ruiz besides being very thirsty was stirred by a feeling of sluggish anger which he could not very well express as though the vigour of his spirit were by no means equal to the strength of his body  the other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their heads looking obstinately on the ground but gaspar ruiz kept on repeating what should i desert for to the royalists why should i desert tell me estaban  he addressed himself to the sergeant who happened to belong to the same part of the country as himself but the sergeant after shrugging his meagre shoulders once paid no further attention to the deep murmuring voice at his back it was indeed strange that gaspar ruiz should desert his people were in too humble a station to feel much the disadvantages of any form of government there was no reason why gaspar ruiz should wish to uphold in his own person the rule of the king of spain neither had he been anxious to exert himself for its subversion he had joined the side of independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner a band of patriots appeared one morning early surrounding his fathers ranche spearing the watchdogs and hamstringing a fat cow all in the twinkling of an eye to the cries of viva la libertad their officer discoursed of liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence after a long and refreshing sleep when they left in the evening taking with them some of ruiz the fathers best horses to replace their own lamed animals gaspar ruiz went away with them having been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent officer  shortly afterwards a detachment of royalist troops coming to pacify the district burnt the ranche carried off the remaining horses and cattle and having thus deprived the old people of all their worldly possessions left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of life   ii   gaspar ruiz condemned to death as a deserter was not thinking either of his native place or of his parents to whom he had been a good son on account of the mildness of his character and the great strength of his limbs the practical advantage of this last was made still more valuable to his father by his obedient disposition gaspar ruiz had an acquiescent soul  but it was stirred now to a sort of dim revolt by his dislike to die the death of a traitor he was not a traitor he said again to the sergeant you know i did not desert estaban you know i remained behind amongst the trees with three others to keep the enemy back while the detachment was running away  lieutenant santierra little more than a boy at the time and unused as yet to the sanguinary imbecilities of a state of war had lingered near by as if fascinated by the sight of these men who were to be shot presentlyfor an exampleas the commandante had said  the sergeant without deigning to look at the prisoner addressed himself to the young officer with a superior smile  ten men would not have been enough to make him a prisoner mi teniente moreover the other three rejoined the detachment after dark why should he unwounded and the strongest of them all have failed to do so  my strength is as nothing against a mounted man with a lasso gaspar ruiz protested eagerly he dragged me behind his horse for half a mile  at this excellent reason the sergeant only laughed contemptuously the young officer hurried away after the commandante  presently the adjutant of the castle came by he was a truculent rawboned man in a ragged uniform his spluttering voice issued out of a flat yellow face the sergeant learned from him that the condemned men would not be shot till sunset he begged then to know what he was to do with them meantime  the adjutant looked savagely round the courtyard and pointing to the door of a small dungeonlike guardroom receiving light and air through one heavily barred window said drive the scoundrels in there  the sergeant tightening his grip upon the stick he carried in virtue of his rank executed this order with alacrity and zeal he hit gaspar ruiz whose movements were slow over his head and shoulders gaspar ruiz stood still for a moment under the shower of blows biting his lip thoughtfully as if absorbed by a perplexing mental processthen followed the others without haste the door was locked and the adjutant carried off the key  by noon the heat of that vaulted place crammed to suffocation had become unbearable the prisoners crowded towards the window begging their guards for a drop of water but the soldiers remained lying in indolent attitudes wherever there was a little shade under a wall while the sentry sat with his back against the door smoking a cigarette and raising his eyebrows philosophically from time to time gaspar ruiz had pushed his way to the window with irresistible force his capacious chest needed more air than the others his big face resting with its chin on the ledge pressed close to the bars seemed to support the other faces crowding up for breath from moaned entreaties they had passed to desperate cries and the tumultuous howling of those thirsty men obliged a young officer who was just then crossing the courtyard to shout in order to make himself heard  why dont you give some water to these prisoners  the sergeant with an air of surprised innocence excused himself by the remark that all those men were condemned to die in a very few hours  lieutenant santierra stamped his foot they are condemned to death not to torture he shouted give them some water at once  impressed by this appearance of anger the soldiers bestirred themselves and the sentry snatching up his musket stood to attention  but when a couple of buckets were found and filled from the well it was discovered that they could not be passed through the bars which were set too close at the prospect of quenching their thirst the shrieks of those trampled down in the struggle to get near the opening became very heartrending but when the soldiers who had lifted the buckets towards the window put them to the ground again helplessly the yell of disappointment was still more terrible  the soldiers of the army of independence were not equipped with canteens a small tin cup was found but its approach to the opening caused such a commotion such yells of rage and pain in the vague mass of limbs behind the straining faces at the window that lieutenant santierra cried out hurriedly no noyou must open the door sergeant  the sergeant shrugging his shoulders explained that he had no right to open the door even if he had had the key but he had not the key the adjutant of the garrison kept the key those men were giving much unnecessary trouble since they had to die at sunset in any case why they had not been shot at once early in the morning he could not understand  lieutenant santierra kept his back studiously to the window it was at his earnest solicitations that the commandante had delayed the execution this favour had been granted to him in consideration of his distinguished family and of his fathers high position amongst the chiefs of the republican party lieutenant santierra believed that the general commanding would visit the fort some time in the afternoon and he ingenuously hoped that his naive intercession would induce that severe man to pardon some at least of those criminals in the revulsion of his feeling his interference stood revealed now as guilty and futile meddling it appeared to him obvious that the general would never even consent to listen to his petition he could never save those men and he had only made himself responsible for the sufferings added to the cruelty of their fate  then go at once and get the key from the adjutant said lieutenant santierra  the sergeant shook his head with a sort of bashful smile while his eyes glanced sideways at gaspar ruizs face motionless and silent staring through the bars at the bottom of a heap of other haggard distorted yelling faces  his worship the adjutant de plaza the sergeant murmured was having his siesta and supposing that he the sergeant would be allowed access to him the only result he expected would be to have his soul flogged out of his body for presuming to disturb his worships repose he made a deprecatory movement with his hands and stood stockstill looking down modestly upon his brown toes  lieutenant santierra glared with indignation but hesitated his handsome oval face as smooth as a girls flushed with the shame of his perplexity its nature humiliated his spirit his hairless upper lip trembled he seemed on the point of either bursting into a fit of rage or into tears of dismay  fifty years later general santierra the venerable relic of revolutionary times was well able to remember the feelings of the young lieutenant since he had given up riding altogether and found it difficult to walk beyond the limits of his garden the generals greatest delight was to entertain in his house the officers of the foreign menofwar visiting the harbour for englishmen he had a preference as for old companions in arms english naval men of all ranks accepted his hospitality with curiosity because he had known lord cochrane and had taken part on board the patriot squadron commanded by that marvellous seaman in the cutting out and blockading operations before callaoan episode of unalloyed glory in the wars of independence and of endless honour in the fighting tradition of englishmen he was a fair linguist this ancient survivor of the liberating armies a trick of smoothing his long white beard whenever he was short of a word in french or english imparted an air of leisurely dignity to the tone of his reminiscences   iii   yes my friends he used to say to his guests what would you have a youth of seventeen summers without worldly experience and owing my rank only to the glorious patriotism of my father may god rest his soul i suffered immense humiliation not so much from the disobedience of that subordinate who after all was responsible for those prisoners but i suffered because like the boy i was i myself dreaded going to the adjutant for the key i had felt before his rough and cutting tongue being quite a common fellow with no merit except his savage valour he made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day i joined my battalion in garrison at the fort it was only a fortnight before i would have confronted him sword in hand but i shrank from the mocking brutality of his sneers  i dont remember having been so miserable in my life before or since the torment of my sensibility was so great that i wished the sergeant to fall dead at my feet and the stupid soldiers who stared at me to turn into corpses and even those wretches for whom my entreaties had procured a reprieve i wished dead also because i could not face them without shame a mephitic heat like a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place in which they were confined those at the window who had heard what was going on jeered at me in very desperation one of these fellows gone mad no doubt kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers to fire through the window his insane loquacity made my heart turn faint and my feet were like lead there was no higher officer to whom i could appeal i had not even the firmness of spirit to simply go away  benumbed by my remorse i stood with my back to the window you must not suppose that all this lasted a long time how long could it have been a minute if you measured by mental suffering it was like a hundred years a longer time than all my life has been since no certainly it was not so much as a minute the hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died out in their dry throats and then suddenly a voice spoke a deep voice muttering calmly it called upon me to turn round  that voice senores proceeded from the head of gaspar ruiz of his body i could see nothing some of his fellowcaptives had clambered upon his back he was holding them up his eyes blinked without looking at me that and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his overloaded state and when i turned round this head that seemed more than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads asked me whether i really desired to quench the thirst of the captives  i said yes yes eagerly and came up quite close to the window i was like a child and did not know what would happen i was anxious to be comforted in my helplessness and remorse  have you the authority senor teniente to release my wrists from their bonds gaspar ruizs head asked me  his features expressed no anxiety no hope his heavy eyelids blinked upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard  as if in an ugly dream i spoke stammering what do you mean and how can i reach the bonds on your wrists  i will try what i can do he said and then that large staring head moved at last and all the wild faces piled up in that window disappeared tumbling down he had shaken his load off with one movement so strong he was  and he had not only shaken it off but he got free of the crush and vanished from my sight for a moment there was no one at all to be seen at the window he had swung about butting and shouldering clearing a space for himself in the only way he could do it with his hands tied behind his back  finally backing to the opening he pushed out to me between the bars his wrists lashed with many turns of rope his hands very swollen with knotted veins looked enormous and unwieldy i saw his bent back it was very broad his voice was like the muttering of a bull  cut senor teniente cut  i drew my sword my new unblunted sword that had seen no service as yet and severed the many turns of the hide rope i did this without knowing the why and the wherefore of my action but as it were compelled by my faith in that man the sergeant made as if to cry out but astonishment deprived him of his voice and he remained standing with his mouth open as if overtaken by sudden imbecility  i sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers an air of awestruck expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy i heard the voice of gaspar ruiz shouting inside but the words i could not make out plainly i suppose that to see him with his arms free augmented the influence of his strength i mean by this the spiritual influence that with ignorant people attaches to an exceptional degree of bodily vigour in fact he was no more to be feared than before on account of the numbness of his arms and hands which lasted for some time  the sergeant had recovered his power of speech by all the saints he cried we shall have to get a cavalry man with a lasso to secure him again if he is to be led to the place of execution nothing less than a good enlazador on a good horse can subdue him your worship was pleased to perform a very mad thing  i had nothing to say i was surprised myself and i felt a childish curiosity to see what would happen next but the sergeant was thinking of the difficulty of controlling gaspar ruiz when the time for making an example would come  or perhaps the sergeant pursued vexedly we shall be obliged to shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is opened he was going to give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper carrying out of the sentence but he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation snatched a musket from a soldier and stood watchful with his eyes fixed on the window   iv   gaspar ruiz had clambered up on the sill and sat down there with his feet against the thickness of the wall and his knees slightly bent the window was not quite broad enough for the length of his legs it appeared to my crestfallen perception that he meant to keep the window all to himself he seemed to be taking up a comfortable position nobody inside dared to approach him now he could strike with his hands  por dios i heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow i shall shoot him through the head now and get rid of that trouble he is a condemned man  at that i looked at him angrily the general has not confirmed the sentence i saidthough i knew well in my heart that these were but vain words the sentence required no confirmation you have no right to shoot him unless he tries to escape i added firmly  but sangre de dios the sergeant yelled out bringing his musket up to the shoulder he is escaping now look  but i as if that gaspar ruiz had cast a spell upon me struck the musket upward and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere the sergeant dashed his arm to the ground and stared he might have commanded the soldiers to fire but he did not and if he had he would not have been obeyed i think just then  with his feet against the thickness of the wall and his hairy hands grasping the iron bar gaspar sat still it was an attitude nothing happened for a time and suddenly it dawned upon us that he was straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms his lips were twisted into a snarl next thing we perceived was that the bar of forged iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness of his pull the sun was beating full upon his cramped unquivering figure a shower of sweatdrops burst out of his forehead watching the bar grow crooked i saw a little blood ooze from under his fingernails then he let go for a moment he remained all huddled up with a hanging head looking drowsily into the upturned palms of his mighty hands indeed he seemed to have dozed off suddenly he flung himself backwards on the sill and setting the soles of his bare feet against the other middle bar he bent that one too but in the opposite direction from the first  such was his strength which in this case relieved my painful feelings and the man seemed to have done nothing except for the change of position in order to use his feet which made us all start by its swiftness my recollection is that of immobility but he had bent the bars wide apart and now he could get out if he liked but he dropped his legs inwards and looking over his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers hand up the water he said i will give them all a drink  he was obeyed for a moment i expected man and bucket to disappear overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness i thought they would pull him down with their teeth there was a rush but holding the bucket on his lap he repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere swinging of his feet they flew backwards at every kick yelling with pain and the soldiers laughed gazing at the window  they all laughed holding their sides except the sergeant who was gloomy and morose he was afraid the prisoners would rise and break outwhich would have been a bad example but there was no fear of that and i stood myself before the window with my drawn sword when sufficiently tamed by the strength of gaspar ruiz they came up one by one stretching their necks and presenting their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong man tilted towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of charity gentleness and compassion that benevolent appearance was of course the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his attitude as he sat on the sill for if a man lingered with his lips glued to the rim of the bucket after gaspar ruiz had said you have had enough there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove of the foot which would send him groaning and doubled up far into the interior of the prison where he would knock down two or three others before he fell himself they came up to him again and again it looked as if they meant to drink the well dry before going to their death but the soldiers were so amused by gaspar ruizs systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the window cheerfully  when the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble over this affair i can assure you and the worst of it was that the general whom we expected never came to the castle that day  the guests of general santierra unanimously expressed their regret that the man of such strength and patience had not been saved  he was not saved by my interference said the general the prisoners were led to execution half an hour before sunset gaspar ruiz contrary to the sergeants apprehensions gave no trouble there was no necessity to get a cavalry man with a lasso in order to subdue him as if he were a wild bull of the campo i believe he marched out with his arms free amongst the others who were bound i did not see i was not there i had been put under arrest for interfering with the prisoners guard about dusk sitting dismally in my quarters i heard three volleys fired and thought that i should never hear of gaspar ruiz again he fell with the others but we were to hear of him nevertheless though the sergeant boasted that as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap of the slain he had slashed his neck with a sword he had done this he said to make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous traitor  i confess to you senores that i thought of that strong man with a sort of gratitude and with some admiration he had used his strength honourably there dwelt then in his soul no fierceness corresponding to the vigour of his body   v   gaspar ruiz who could with ease bend apart the heavy iron bars of the prison was led out with others to summary execution every bullet has its billet runs the proverb all the merit of proverbs consists in the concise and picturesque expression in the surprise of our minds is found their persuasiveness in other words we are struck and convinced by the shock  what surprises us is the form not the substance proverbs are artcheap art as a general rule they are not true unless indeed they happen to be mere platitudes as for instance the proverb half a loaf is better than no bread or a miss is as good as a mile some proverbs are simply imbecile others are immoral that one evolved out of the naive heart of the great russian people man discharges the piece but god carries the bullet is piously atrocious and at bitter variance with the accepted conception of a compassionate god it would indeed be an inconsistent occupation for the guardian of the poor the innocent and the helpless to carry the bullet for instance into the heart of a father  gaspar ruiz was childless he had no wife he had never been in love he had hardly ever spoken to a woman beyond his mother and the ancient negress of the household whose wrinkled skin was the colour of cinders and whose lean body was bent double from age if some bullets from those muskets fired off at fifteen paces were specifically destined for the heart of gaspar ruiz they all missed their billet one however carried away a small piece of his ear and another a fragment of flesh from his shoulder  a red and unclouded sun setting into a purple ocean looked with a fiery stare upon the enormous wall of the cordilleras worthy witnesses of his glorious extinction but it is inconceivable that it should have seen the antlike men busy with their absurd and insignificant trials of killing and dying for reasons that apart from being generally childish were also imperfectly understood it did light up however the backs of the firing party and the faces of the condemned men some of them had fallen on their knees others remained standing a few averted their heads from the levelled barrels of muskets gaspar ruiz upright the burliest of them all hung his big shock head the low sun dazzled him a little and he counted himself a dead man already  he fell at the first discharge he fell because he thought he was a dead man he struck the ground heavily the jar of the fall surprised him i am not dead apparently he thought to himself when he heard the execution platoon reloading its arms at the word of command it was then that the hope of escape dawned upon him for the first time he remained lying stretched out with rigid limbs under the weight of two bodies collapsed crosswise upon his back  by the time the soldiers had fired a third volley into the slightly stirring heaps of the slain the sun had gone out of sight and almost immediately with the darkening of the ocean dusk fell upon the coasts of the young republic above the gloom of the lowlands the snowy peaks of the cordilleras remained luminous and crimson for a long time the soldiers before marching back to the fort sat down to smoke  the sergeant with a naked sword in his hand strolled away by himself along the heap of the dead he was a humane man and watched for any stir or twitch of limb in the merciful idea of plunging the point of his blade into any body giving the slightest sign of life but none of the bodies afforded him an opportunity for the display of this charitable intention not a muscle twitched amongst them not even the powerful muscles of gaspar ruiz who deluged with the blood of his neighbours and shamming death strove to appear more lifeless than the others  he was lying face down the sergeant recognized him by his stature and being himself a very small man looked with envy and contempt at the prostration of so much strength he had always disliked that particular soldier moved by an obscure animosity he inflicted a long gash across the neck of gaspar ruiz with some vague notion of making sure of that strong mans death as if a powerful physique were more able to resist the bullets for the sergeant had no doubt that gaspar ruiz had been shot through in many places then he passed on and shortly afterwards marched off with his men leaving the bodies to the care of crows and vultures  gaspar ruiz had restrained a cry though it had seemed to him that his head was cut off at a blow and when darkness came shaking off the dead whose weight had oppressed him he crawled away over the plain on his hands and knees after drinking deeply like a wounded beast at a shallow stream he assumed an upright posture and staggered on lightheaded and aimless as if lost amongst the stars of the clear night a small house seemed to rise out of the ground before him he stumbled into the porch and struck at the door with his fist there was not a gleam of light gaspar ruiz might have thought that the inhabitants had fled from it as from many others in the neighbourhood had it not been for the shouts of abuse that answered his thumping in his feverish and enfeebled state the angry screaming seemed to him part of a hallucination belonging to the weird dreamlike feeling of his unexpected condemnation to death of the thirst suffered of the volleys fired at him within fifteen paces of his head being cut off at a blow open the door he cried open in the name of god  an infuriated voice from within jeered at him come in come in this house belongs to you all this land belongs to you come and take it  for the love of god gaspar ruiz murmured  does not all the land belong to you patriots the voice on the other side of the door screamed on are you not a patriot  gaspar ruiz did not know i am a wounded man he said apathetically  all became still inside gaspar ruiz lost the hope of being admitted and lay down under the porch just outside the door he was utterly careless of what was going to happen to him all his consciousness seemed to be concentrated in his neck where he felt a severe pain his indifference as to his fate was genuine the day was breaking when he awoke from a feverish doze the door at which he had knocked in the dark stood wide open now and a girl steadying herself with her outspread arms leaned over the threshold lying on his back he stared up at her her face was pale and her eyes were very dark her hair hung down black as ebony against her white cheeks her lips were full and red beyond her he saw another head with long grey hair and a thin old face with a pair of anxiously clasped hands under the chin   vi   i knew those people by sight general santierra would tell his guests at the diningtable i mean the people with whom gaspar ruiz found shelter the father was an old spaniard a man of property ruined by the revolution his estates his house in town his money everything he had in the world had been confiscated by proclamation for he was a bitter foe of our independence from a position of great dignity and influence on the viceroys council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves made free by our glorious revolution he had not even the means to flee the country as other spaniards had managed to do it may be that wandering ruined and houseless and burdened with nothing but his life which was left to him by the clemency of the provisional government he had simply walked under that broken roof of old tiles it was a lonely spot there did not seem to be even a dog belonging to the place but though the roof had holes as if a cannonball or two had dropped through it the wooden shutters were thick and tightclosed all the time  my way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable rancho i rode from the fort to the town almost every evening to sigh at the window of a lady i was in love with then when one is young you understand    she was a good patriot you may believe caballeros credit me or not political feeling ran so high in those days that i do not believe i could have been fascinated by the charms of a woman of royalist opinions     murmurs of amused incredulity all round the table interrupted the general and while they lasted he stroked his white beard gravely  senores he protested a royalist was a monster to our overwrought feelings i am telling you this in order not to be suspected of the slightest tenderness towards that old royalists daughter moreover as you know my affections were engaged elsewhere but i could not help noticing her on rare occasions when with the front door open she stood in the porch  you must know that this old royalist was as crazy as a man can be his political misfortunes his total downfall and ruin had disordered his mind to show his contempt for what we patriots could do he affected to laugh at his imprisonment at the confiscation of his lands the burning of his houses and at the misery to which he and his womenfolk were reduced this habit of laughing had grown upon him so that he would begin to laugh and shout directly he caught sight of any stranger that was the form of his madness  i of course disregarded the noise of that madman with that feeling of superiority the success of our cause inspired in us americans i suppose i really despised him because he was an old castilian a spaniard born and a royalist those were certainly no reasons to scorn a man but for centuries spaniards born had shown their contempt of us americans men as well descended as themselves simply because we were what they called colonists we had been kept in abasement and made to feel our inferiority in social intercourse and now it was our turn it was safe for us patriots to display the same sentiments and i being a young patriot son of a patriot despised that old spaniard and despising him i naturally disregarded his abuse though it was annoying to my feelings others perhaps would not have been so forbearing  he would begin with a great yelli see a patriot another of them long before i came abreast of the house the tone of his senseless revilings mingled with bursts of laughter was sometimes piercingly shrill and sometimes grave it was all very mad but i felt it incumbent upon my dignity to check my horse to a walk without even glancing towards the house as if that mans abusive clamour in the porch were less than the barking of a cur always i rode by preserving an expression of haughty indifference on my face  it was no doubt very dignified but i should have done better if i had kept my eyes open a military man in war time should never consider himself off duty and especially so if the war is a revolutionary war when the enemy is not at the door but within your very house at such times the heat of passionate convictions passing into hatred removes the restraints of honour and humanity from many men and of delicacy and fear from some women these last when once they throw off the timidity and reserve of their sex become by the vivacity of their intelligence and the violence of their merciless resentment more dangerous than so many armed giants  the generals voice rose but his big hand stroked his white beard twice with an effect of venerable calmness si senores women are ready to rise to the heights of devotion unattainable by us men or to sink into the depths of abasement which amazes our masculine prejudices i am speaking now of exceptional women you understand     here one of the guests observed that he had never met a woman yet who was not capable of turning out quite exceptional under circumstances that would engage her feelings strongly that sort of superiority in recklessness they have over us he concluded makes of them the more interesting half of mankind  the general who bore the interruption with gravity nodded courteous assent si si under circumstances    precisely they can do an infinite deal of mischief sometimes in quite unexpected ways for who could have imagined that a young girl daughter of a ruined royalist whose life was held only by the contempt of his enemies would have had the power to bring death and devastation upon two flourishing provinces and cause serious anxiety to the leaders of the revolution in the very hour of its success he paused to let the wonder of it penetrate our minds  death and devastation somebody murmured in surprise how shocking  the old general gave a glance in the direction of the murmur and went on yes that is warcalamity but the means by which she obtained the power to work this havoc on our southern frontier seem to me who have seen her and spoken to her still more shocking that particular thing left on my mind a dreadful amazement which the further experience of life of more than fifty years has done nothing to diminish he looked round as if to make sure of our attention and in a changed voice i am as you know a republican son of a liberator he declared my incomparable mother god rest her soul was a frenchwoman the daughter of an ardent republican as a boy i fought for liberty ive always believed in the equality of men and as to their brotherhood that to my mind is even more certain look at the fierce animosity they display in their differences and what in the world do you know that is more bitterly fierce than brothers quarrels  all absence of cynicism checked an inclination to smile at this view of human brotherhood on the contrary there was in the tone the melancholy natural to a man profoundly humane at heart who from duty from conviction and from necessity had played his part in scenes of ruthless violence  the general had seen much of fratricidal strife certainly there is no doubt of their brotherhood he insisted all men are brothers and as such know almost too much of each other butand here in the old patriarchal head white as silver the black eyes humorously twinkledif we are all brothers all the women are not our sisters  one of the younger guests was heard murmuring his satisfaction at the fact but the general continued with deliberate earnestness they are so different the tale of a king who took a beggarmaid for a partner of his throne may be pretty enough as we men look upon ourselves and upon love but that a young girl famous for her haughty beauty and only a short time before the admired of all at the balls in the viceroys palace should take by the hand a guasso a common peasant is intolerable to our sentiment of women and their love it is madness nevertheless it happened but it must be said that in her case it was the madness of hatenot of love  after presenting this excuse in a spirit of chivalrous justice the general remained silent for a time i rode past the house every day almost he began again and this was what was going on within but how it was going on no mind of man can conceive her desperation must have been extreme and gaspar ruiz was a docile fellow he had been an obedient soldier his strength was like an enormous stone lying on the ground ready to be hurled this way or that by the hand that picks it up  it is clear that he would tell his story to the people who gave him the shelter he needed and he needed assistance badly his wound was not dangerous but his life was forfeited the old royalist being wrapped up in his laughing madness the two women arranged a hidingplace for the wounded man in one of the huts amongst the fruit trees at the back of the house that hovel an abundance of clear water while the fever was on him and some words of pity were all they could give i suppose he had a share of what food there was and it would be but little a handful of roasted corn perhaps a dish of beans or a piece of bread with a few figs to such misery were those proud and once wealthy people reduced   vii   general santierra was right in his surmise such was the exact nature of the assistance which gaspar ruiz peasant son of peasants received from the royalist family whose daughter had opened the door of their miserable refuge to his extreme distress her sombre resolution ruled the madness of her father and the trembling bewilderment of her mother  she had asked the strange man on the doorstep who wounded you  the soldiers senora gaspar ruiz had answered in a faint voice  patriots  si  what for  deserter he gasped leaning against the wall under the scrutiny of her black eyes i was left for dead over there  she led him through the house out to a small hut of clay and reeds lost in the long grass of the overgrown orchard he sank on a heap of maize straw in a corner and sighed profoundly  no one will look for you here she said looking down at him nobody comes near us we too have been left for deadhere  he stirred uneasily on his heap of dirty straw and the pain in his neck made him groan deliriously  i shall show estaban some day that i am alive yet he mumbled  he accepted her assistance in silence and the many days of pain went by her appearances in the hut brought him relief and became connected with the feverish dreams of angels which visited his couch for gaspar ruiz was instructed in the mysteries of his religion and had even been taught to read and write a little by the priest of his village he waited for her with impatience and saw her pass out of the dark hut and disappear in the brilliant sunshine with poignant regret he discovered that while he lay there feeling so very weak he could by closing his eyes evoke her face with considerable distinctness and this discovered faculty charmed the long solitary hours of his convalescence later on when he began to regain his strength he would creep at dusk from his hut to the house and sit on the step of the garden door  in one of the rooms the mad father paced to and fro muttering to himself with short abrupt laughs in the passage sitting on a stool the mother sighed and moaned the daughter in rough threadbare clothing and her white haggard face half hidden by a coarse manta stood leaning against the side of the door gaspar ruiz with his elbows propped on his knees and his head resting in his hands talked to the two women in an undertone  the common misery of destitution would have made a bitter mockery of a marked insistence on social differences gaspar ruiz understood this in his simplicity from his captivity amongst the royalists he could give them news of people they knew he described their appearance and when he related the story of the battle in which he was recaptured the two women lamented the blow to their cause and the ruin of their secret hopes  he had no feeling either way but he felt a great devotion for that young girl in his desire to appear worthy of her condescension he boasted a little of his bodily strength he had nothing else to boast of because of that quality his comrades treated him with as great a deference he explained as though he had been a sergeant both in camp and in battle  i could always get as many as i wanted to follow me anywhere senorita i ought to have been made an officer because i can read and write  behind him the silent old lady fetched a moaning sigh from time to time the distracted father muttered to himself pacing the sala and gaspar ruiz would raise his eyes now and then to look at the daughter of these people  he would look at her with curiosity because she was alive and also with that feeling of familiarity and awe with which he had contemplated in churches the inanimate and powerful statues of the saints whose protection is invoked in dangers and difficulties his difficulty was very great  he could not remain hiding in an orchard for ever and ever he knew also very well that before he had gone half a days journey in any direction he would be picked up by one of the cavalry patrols scouring the country and brought into one or another of the camps where the patriot army destined for the liberation of peru was collected there he would in the end be recognized as gaspar ruizthe deserter to the royalistsand no doubt shot very effectually this time there did not seem any place in the world for the innocent gaspar ruiz anywhere and at this thought his simple soul surrendered itself to gloom and resentment as black as night  they had made him a soldier forcibly he did not mind being a soldier and he had been a good soldier as he had been a good son because of his docility and his strength but now there was no use for either they had taken him from his parents and he could no longer be a soldiernot a good soldier at any rate nobody would listen to his explanations what injustice it was what injustice  and in a mournful murmur he would go over the story of his capture and recapture for the twentieth time then raising his eyes to the silent girl in the doorway si senorita he would say with a deep sigh injustice has made this poor breath in my body quite worthless to me and to anybody else and i do not care who robs me of it  one evening as he exhaled thus the plaint of his wounded soul she condescended to say that if she were a man she would consider no life worthless which held the possibility of revenge  she seemed to be speaking to herself her voice was low he drank in the gentle as if dreamy sound with a consciousness of peculiar delight of something warming his breast like a draught of generous wine  true senorita he said raising his face up to hers slowly there is estaban who must be shown that i am not dead after all  the mutterings of the mad father had ceased long before the sighing mother had withdrawn somewhere into one of the empty rooms all was still within as well as without in the moonlight bright as day on the wild orchard full of inky shadows gaspar ruiz saw the dark eyes of dona erminia look down at him  ah the sergeant she muttered disdainfully  why he has wounded me with his sword he protested bewildered by the contempt that seemed to shine livid on her pale face  she crushed him with her glance the power of her will to be understood was so strong that it kindled in him the intelligence of unexpressed things  what else did you expect me to do he cried as if suddenly driven to despair have i the power to do more am i a general with an army at my backmiserable sinner that i am to be despised by you at last   viii   senores related the general to his guests though my thoughts were of love then and therefore enchanting the sight of that house always affected me disagreeably especially in the moonlight when its close shutters and its air of lonely neglect appeared sinister still i went on using the bridlepath by the ravine because it was a short cut the mad royalist howled and laughed at me every evening to his complete satisfaction but after a time as if wearied with my indifference he ceased to appear in the porch how they persuaded him to leave off i do not know however with gaspar ruiz in the house there would have been no difficulty in restraining him by force it was now part of their policy in there to avoid anything which could provoke me at least so i suppose  notwithstanding my infatuation with the brightest pair of eyes in chile i noticed the absence of the old man after a week or so a few more days passed i began to think that perhaps these royalists had gone away somewhere else but one evening as i was hastening towards the city i saw again somebody in the porch it was not the madman it was the girl she stood holding on to one of the wooden columns tall and whitefaced her big eyes sunk deep with privation and sorrow i looked hard at her and she met my stare with a strange inquisitive look then as i turned my head after riding past she seemed to gather courage for the act and absolutely beckoned me back  i obeyed senores almost without thinking so great was my astonishment it was greater still when i heard what she had to say she began by thanking me for my forbearance of her fathers infirmity so that i felt ashamed of myself i had meant to show disdain not forbearance every word must have burnt her lips but she never departed from a gentle and melancholy dignity which filled me with respect against my will senores we are no match for women but i could hardly believe my ears when she began her tale providence she concluded seemed to have preserved the life of that wronged soldier who now trusted to my honour as a caballero and to my compassion for his sufferings  wronged man i observed coldly well i think so too and you have been harbouring an enemy of your cause  he was a poor christian crying for help at our door in the name of god senor she answered simply  i began to admire her where is he now i asked stiffly  but she would not answer that question with extreme cunning and an almost fiendish delicacy she managed to remind me of my failure in saving the lives of the prisoners in the guardroom without wounding my pride she knew of course the whole story gaspar ruiz she said entreated me to procure for him a safeconduct from general san martin himself he had an important communication to make to the commanderinchief  por dios senores she made me swallow all that pretending to be only the mouthpiece of that poor man overcome by injustice he expected to find she said as much generosity in me as had been shown to him by the royalist family which had given him a refuge  ha it was well and nobly said to a youngster like me i thought her great alas she was only implacable  in the end i rode away very enthusiastic about the business without demanding even to see gaspar ruiz who i was confident was in the house  but on calm reflection i began to see some difficulties which i had not confidence enough in myself to encounter it was not easy to approach a commanderinchief with such a story i feared failure at last i thought it better to lay the matter before my generalofdivision robles a friend of my family who had appointed me his aidedecamp lately  he took it out of my hands at once without any ceremony  in the house of course he is in the house he said contemptuously you ought to have gone sword in hand inside and demanded his surrender instead of chatting with a royalist girl in the porch those people should have been hunted out of that long ago who knows how many spies they have harboured right in the very midst of our camps a safeconduct from the commanderinchief the audacity of the fellow ha ha now we shall catch him tonight and then we shall find out without any safeconduct what he has got to say that is so very important ha ha ha  general robles peace to his soul was a short thick man with round staring eyes fierce and jovial seeing my distress he added  come come chico i promise you his life if he does not resist and that is not likely we are not going to break up a good soldier if it can be helped i tell you what i am curious to see your strong man nothing but a general will do for the picarowell he shall have a general to talk to ha ha i shall go myself to the catching and you are coming with me of course  and it was done that same night early in the evening the house and the orchard were surrounded quietly later on the general and i left a ball we were attending in town and rode out at an easy gallop at some little distance from the house we pulled up a mounted orderly held our horses a low whistle warned the men watching all along the ravine and we walked up to the porch softly the barricaded house in the moonlight seemed empty  the general knocked at the door after a time a womans voice within asked who was there my chief nudged me hard i gasped  it is i lieutenant santierra i stammered out as if choked open the door  it came open slowly the girl holding a thin taper in her hand seeing another man with me began to back away before us slowly shading the light with her hand her impassive white face looked ghostly i followed behind general robles her eyes were fixed on mine i made a gesture of helplessness behind my chiefs back trying at the same time to give a reassuring expression to my face none of us three uttered a sound  we found ourselves in a room with bare floor and walls there was a rough table and a couple of stools in it nothing else whatever an old woman with her grey hair hanging loose wrung her hands when we appeared a peal of loud laughter resounded through the empty house very amazing and weird at this the old woman tried to get past us  nobody to leave the room said general robles to me  i swung the door to heard the latch click and the laughter became faint in our ears  before another word could be spoken in that room i was amazed by hearing the sound of distant thunder  i had carried in with me into the house a vivid impression of a beautiful clear moonlight night without a speck of cloud in the sky i could not believe my ears sent early abroad for my education i was not familiar with the most dreaded natural phenomenon of my native land i saw with inexpressible astonishment a look of terror in my chiefs eyes suddenly i felt giddy the general staggered against me heavily the girl seemed to reel in the middle of the room the taper fell out of her hand and the light went out a shrill cry of misericordia from the old woman pierced my ears in the pitchy darkness i heard the plaster off the walls falling on the floor it is a mercy there was no ceiling holding on to the latch of the door i heard the grinding of the rooftiles cease above my head the shock was over  out of the house the door fly santierra fly howled the general you know senores in our country the bravest are not ashamed of the fear an earthquake strikes into all the senses of man one never gets used to it repeated experience only augments the mastery of that nameless terror  it was my first earthquake and i was the calmest of them all i understood that the crash outside was caused by the porch with its wooden pillars and tiled roof projection falling down the next shock would destroy the house maybe that rumble as of thunder was approaching again the general was rushing round the room to find the door perhaps he made a noise as though he were trying to climb the walls and i heard him distinctly invoke the names of several saints out out santierra he yelled  the girls voice was the only one i did not hear  general i cried i cannot move the door we must be locked in  i did not recognize his voice in the shout of malediction and despair he let out senores i know many men in my country especially in the provinces most subject to earthquakes who will neither eat sleep pray nor even sit down to cards with closed doors the danger is not in the loss of time but in thisthat the movement of the walls may prevent a door being opened at all this was what had happened to us we were trapped and we had no help to expect from anybody there is no man in my country who will go into a house when the earth trembles there never wasexcept one gaspar ruiz  he had come out of whatever hole he had been hiding in outside and had clambered over the timbers of the destroyed porch above the awful subterranean groan of coming destruction i heard a mighty voice shouting the word erminia with the lungs of a giant an earthquake is a great leveller of distinctions i collected all my resolution against the terror of the scene she is here i shouted back a roar as of a furious wild beast answered mewhile my head swam my heart sank and the sweat of anguish streamed like rain off my brow  he had the strength to pick up one of the heavy posts of the porch holding it under his armpit like a lance but with both hands he charged madly the rocking house with the force of a batteringram bursting open the door and rushing in headlong over our prostrate bodies i and the general picking ourselves up bolted out together without looking round once till we got across the road then clinging to each other we beheld the house change suddenly into a heap of formless rubbish behind the back of a man who staggered towards us bearing the form of a woman clasped in his arms her long black hair hung nearly to his feet he laid her down reverently on the heaving earth and the moonlight shone on her closed eyes  senores we mounted with difficulty our horses getting up plunged madly held by the soldiers who had come running from all sides nobody thought of catching gaspar ruiz then the eyes of men and animals shone with wild fear my general approached gaspar ruiz who stood motionless as a statue above the girl he let himself be shaken by the shoulder without detaching his eyes from her face  que guape shouted the general in his ear you are the bravest man living you have saved my life i am general robles come to my quarters tomorrow if god gives us the grace to see another day  he never stirredas if deaf without feeling insensible  we rode away for the town full of our relations of our friends of whose fate we hardly dared to think the soldiers ran by the side of our horses everything was forgotten in the immensity of the catastrophe overtaking a whole country          gaspar ruiz saw the girl open her eyes the raising of her eyelids seemed to recall him from a trance they were alone the cries of terror and distress from homeless people filled the plains of the coast remote and immense coming like a whisper into their loneliness  she rose swiftly to her feet darting fearful glances on all sides what is it she cried out low and peering into his face where am i  he bowed his head sadly without a word     who are you  he knelt down slowly before her and touched the hem of her coarse black baize skirt your slave he said  she caught sight then of the heap of rubbish that had been the house all misty in the cloud of dust ah she cried pressing her hand to her forehead  i carried you out from there he whispered at her feet  and they she asked in a great sob  he rose and taking her by the arms led her gently towards the shapeless ruin half overwhelmed by a landslide come and listen he said  the serene moon saw them clambering over that heap of stones joists and tiles which was a grave they pressed their ears to the interstices listening for the sound of a groan for a sigh of pain  at last he said they died swiftly you are alone  she sat down on a piece of broken timber and put one arm across her face he waitedthen approaching his lips to her ear let us go he whispered  nevernever from here she cried out flinging her arms above her head  he stooped over her and her raised arms fell upon his shoulders he lifted her up steadied himself and began to walk looking straight before him  what are you doing she asked feebly  i am escaping from my enemies he said never once glancing at his light burden  with me she sighed helplessly  never without you he said you are my strength  he pressed her close to him his face was grave and his footsteps steady the conflagrations bursting out in the ruins of destroyed villages dotted the plain with red fires and the sounds of distant lamentations the cries of misericordia misericordia made a desolate murmur in his ears he walked on solemn and collected as if carrying something holy fragile and precious  the earth rocked at times under his feet   ix   with movements of mechanical care and an air of abstraction old general santierra lighted a long and thick cigar  it was a good many hours before we could send a party back to the ravine he said to his guests we had found onethird of the town laid low the rest shaken up and the inhabitants rich and poor reduced to the same state of distraction by the universal disaster the affected cheerfulness of some contrasted with the despair of others in the general confusion a number of reckless thieves without fear of god or man became a danger to those who from the downfall of their homes had managed to save some valuables crying misericordia louder than any at every tremor and beating their breast with one hand these scoundrels robbed the poor victims with the other not even stopping short of murder  general robles division was occupied entirely in guarding the destroyed quarters of the town from the depredations of these inhuman monsters taken up with my duties of orderly officer it was only in the morning that i could assure myself of the safety of my own family my mother and my sisters had escaped with their lives from that ballroom where i had left them early in the evening i remember those two beautiful young womengod rest their soulsas if i saw them this moment in the garden of our destroyed house pale but active assisting some of our poor neighbours in their soiled balldresses and with the dust of fallen walls on their hair as to my mother she had a stoical soul in her frail body halfcovered by a costly shawl she was lying on a rustic seat by the side of an ornamental basin whose fountain had ceased to play for ever on that night  i had hardly had time to embrace them all with transports of joy when my chief coming along dispatched me to the ravine with a few soldiers to bring in my strong man as he called him and that pale girl  but there was no one for us to bring in a landslide had covered the ruins of the house and it was like a large mound of earth with only the ends of some timbers visible here and therenothing more  thus were the tribulations of the old royalist couple ended an enormous and unconsecrated grave had swallowed them up alive in their unhappy obstinacy against the will of a people to be free and their daughter was gone  that gaspar ruiz had carried her off i understood very well but as the case was not foreseen i had no instructions to pursue them and certainly i had no desire to do so i had grown mistrustful of my interference it had never been successful and had not even appeared creditable he was gone well let him go and he had carried off the royalist girl nothing better vaya con dios this was not the time to bother about a deserter who justly or unjustly ought to have been dead and a girl for whom it would have been better to have never been born  so i marched my men back to the town  after a few days order having been reestablished all the principal families including my own left for santiago we had a fine house there at the same time the division of robles was moved to new cantonments near the capital this change suited very well the state of my domestic and amorous feelings  one night rather late i was called to my chief i found general robles in his quarters at ease with his uniform off drinking neat brandy out of a tumbleras a precaution he used to say against the sleeplessness induced by the bites of mosquitoes he was a good soldier and he taught me the art and practice of war no doubt god has been merciful to his soul for his motives were never other than patriotic if his character was irascible as to the use of mosquito nets he considered it effeminate shamefulunworthy of a soldier i noticed at the first glance that his face already very red wore an expression of high goodhumour  aha senor teniente he cried loudly as i saluted at the door behold your strong man has turned up again  he extended to me a folded letter which i saw was superscribed to the commanderinchief of the republican armies  this general robles went on in his loud voice was thrust by a boy into the hand of a sentry at the quartel general while the fellow stood there thinking of his girl no doubtfor before he could gather his wits together the boy had disappeared amongst the market people and he protests he could not recognize him to save his life  my chief told me further that the soldier had given the letter to the sergeant of the guard and that ultimately it had reached the hands of our generalissimo his excellency had deigned to take cognizance of it with his own eyes after that he had referred the matter in confidence to general robles  the letter senores i cannot now recollect textually i saw the signature of gaspar ruiz he was an audacious fellow he had snatched a soul for himself out of a cataclysm remember and now it was that soul which had dictated the terms of his letter its tone was very independent i remember it struck me at the time as nobledignified it was no doubt her letter now i shudder at the depth of its duplicity gaspar ruiz was made to complain of the injustice of which he had been a victim he invoked his previous record of fidelity and courage having been saved from death by the miraculous interposition of providence he could think of nothing but of retrieving his character this he wrote he could not hope to do in the ranks as a discredited soldier still under suspicion he had the means to give a striking proof of his fidelity he had ended by proposing to the generalinchief a meeting at midnight in the middle of the plaza before the moneta the signal would be to strike fire with flint and steel three times which was not too conspicuous and yet distinctive enough for recognition  san martin the great liberator loved men of audacity and courage besides he was just and compassionate i told him as much of the mans story as i knew and was ordered to accompany him on the appointed night the signals were duly exchanged it was midnight and the whole town was dark and silent their two cloaked figures came together in the centre of the vast plaza and keeping discreetly at a distance i listened for an hour or more to the murmur of their voices then the general motioned me to approach and as i did so i heard san martin who was courteous to gentle and simple alike offer gaspar ruiz the hospitality of the headquarters for the night but the soldier refused saying that he would be not worthy of that honour till he had done something  you cannot have a common deserter for your guest excellency he protested with a low laugh and stepping backwards merged slowly into the night  the commanderinchief observed to me as we turned away he had somebody with him our friend ruiz i saw two figures for a moment it was an unobtrusive companion  i too had observed another figure join the vanishing form of gaspar ruiz it had the appearance of a short fellow in a poncho and a big hat and i wondered stupidly who it could be he had dared take into his confidence i might have guessed it could be no one but that fatal girlalas  where he kept her concealed i do not know he hadit was known afterwardsan uncle his mothers brother a small shopkeeper in santiago perhaps it was there that she found a roof and food whatever she found it was poor enough to exasperate her pride and keep up her anger and hate it is certain she did not accompany him on the feat he undertook to accomplish first of all it was nothing less than the destruction of a store of war material collected secretly by the spanish authorities in the south in a town called linares gaspar ruiz was entrusted with a small party only but they proved themselves worthy of san martins confidence the season was not propitious they had to swim swollen rivers they seemed however to have galloped night and day outriding the news of their foray and holding straight for the town a hundred miles into the enemys country till at break of day they rode into it sword in hand surprising the little garrison it fled without making a stand leaving most of its officers in gaspar ruiz hands  a great explosion of gunpowder ended the conflagration of the magazines the raiders had set on fire without loss of time in less than six hours they were riding away at the same mad speed without the loss of a single man good as they were such an exploit is not performed without a still better leadership  i was dining at the headquarters when gaspar ruiz himself brought the news of his success and it was a great blow to the royalist troops for a proof he displayed to us the garrisons flag he took it from under his poncho and flung it on the table the man was transfigured there was something exulting and menacing in the expression of his face he stood behind general san martins chair and looked proudly at us all he had a round blue cap edged with silver braid on his head and we all could see a large white scar on the nape of his sunburnt neck  somebody asked him what he had done with the captured spanish officers  he shrugged his shoulders scornfully what a question to ask in a partisan war you do not burden yourself with prisoners i let them goand here are their swordknots  he flung a bunch of them on the table upon the flag then general robles whom i was attending there spoke up in his loud thick voice you did then my brave friend you do not know yet how a war like ours ought to be conducted you should have donethis and he passed the edge of his hand across his own throat  alas senores it was only too true that on both sides this contest in its nature so heroic was stained by ferocity the murmurs that arose at general robles words were by no means unanimous in tone but the generous and brave san martin praised the humane action and pointed out to ruiz a place on his right hand then rising with a full glass he proposed a toast caballeros and comradesinarms let us drink the health of captain gaspar ruiz and when we had emptied our glasses i intend the commanderinchief continued to entrust him with the guardianship of our southern frontier while we go afar to liberate our brethren in peru he whom the enemy could not stop from striking a blow at his very heart will know how to protect the peaceful populations we leave behind us to pursue our sacred task and he embraced the silent gaspar ruiz by his side  later on when we all rose from table i approached the latest officer of the army with my congratulations and captain ruiz i added perhaps you do not mind telling a man who has always believed in the uprightness of your character what became of dona erminia on that night  at this friendly question his aspect changed he looked at me from under his eyebrows with the heavy dull glance of a guassoof a peasant senor teniente he said thickly and as if very much cast down do not ask me about the senorita for i prefer not to think about her at all when i am amongst you  he looked with a frown all about the room full of smoking and talking officers of course i did not insist  these senores were the last words i was to hear him utter for a long long time the very next day we embarked for our arduous expedition to peru and we only heard of gaspar ruiz doings in the midst of battles of our own he had been appointed military guardian of our southern province he raised a partida but his leniency to the conquered foe displeased the civil governor who was a formal uneasy man full of suspicions he forwarded reports against gaspar ruiz to the supreme government one of them being that he had married publicly with great pomp a woman of royalist tendencies quarrels were sure to arise between these two men of very different character at last the civil governor began to complain of his inactivity and to hint at treachery which he wrote would be not surprising in a man of such antecedents gaspar ruiz heard of it his rage flamed up and the woman ever by his side knew how to feed it with perfidious words i do not know whether really the supreme government ever didas he complained afterwardssend orders for his arrest it seems certain that the civil governor began to tamper with his officers and that gaspar ruiz discovered the fact  one evening when the governor was giving a tertullia gaspar ruiz followed by six men he could trust appeared riding through the town to the door of the government house and entered the sala armed his hat on his head as the governor displeased advanced to meet him he seized the wretched man round the body carried him off from the midst of the appalled guests as though he were a child and flung him down the outer steps into the street an angry hug from gaspar ruiz was enough to crush the life out of a giant but in addition gaspar ruiz horsemen fired their pistols at the body of the governor as it lay motionless at the bottom of the stairs   x   after thisas he called itact of justice ruiz crossed the rio blanco followed by the greater part of his band and entrenched himself upon a hill a company of regular troops sent out foolishly against him was surrounded and destroyed almost to a man other expeditions though better organized were equally unsuccessful  it was during these sanguinary skirmishes that his wife first began to appear on horseback at his right hand rendered proud and selfconfident by his successes ruiz no longer charged at the head of his partida but presumptuously like a general directing the movements of an army he remained in the rear well mounted and motionless on an eminence sending out his orders she was seen repeatedly at his side and for a long time was mistaken for a man there was much talk then of a mysterious whitefaced chief to whom the defeats of our troops were ascribed she rode like an indian woman astride wearing a broadrimmed mans hat and a dark poncho afterwards in the day of their greatest prosperity this poncho was embroidered in gold and she wore then also the sword of poor don antonio de leyva this veteran chilian officer having the misfortune to be surrounded with his small force and running short of ammunition found his death at the hands of the arauco indians the allies and auxiliaries of gaspar ruiz this was the fatal affair long remembered afterwards as the massacre of the island the sword of the unhappy officer was presented to her by peneleo the araucanian chief for these indians struck by her aspect the deathly pallor of her face which no exposure to the weather seemed to affect and her calm indifference under fire looked upon her as a supernatural being or at least as a witch by this superstition the prestige and authority of gaspar ruiz amongst these ignorant people were greatly augmented she must have savoured her vengeance to the full on that day when she buckled on the sword of don antonio de leyva it never left her side unless she put on her womans clothesnot that she would or could ever use it but she loved to feel it beating upon her thigh as a perpetual reminder and symbol of the dishonour to the arms of the republic she was insatiable moreover on the path she had led gaspar ruiz upon there is no stopping escaped prisonersand they were not manyused to relate how with a few whispered words she could change the expression of his face and revive his flagging animosity they told how after every skirmish after every raid after every successful action he would ride up to her and look into her face its haughty calm was never relaxed her embrace senores must have been as cold as the embrace of a statue he tried to melt her icy heart in a stream of warm blood some english naval officers who visited him at that time noticed the strange character of his infatuation  at the movement of surprise and curiosity in his audience general santierra paused for a moment  yesenglish naval officers he repeated ruiz had consented to receive them to arrange for the liberation of some prisoners of your nationality in the territory upon which he ranged from sea coast to the cordillera there was a bay where the ships of that time after rounding cape horn used to resort for wood and water there decoying the crew on shore he captured first the whaling brig hersalia and afterwards made himself master by surprise of two more ships one english and one american  it was rumoured at the time that he dreamed of setting up a navy of his own but that of course was impossible still manning the brig with part of her own crew and putting an officer and a good many men of his own on board he sent her off to the spanish governor of the island of chiloe with a report of his exploits and a demand for assistance in the war against the rebels the governor could not do much for him but he sent in return two light fieldpieces a letter of compliments with a colonels commission in the royal forces and a great spanish flag this standard with much ceremony was hoisted over his house in the heart of the arauco country surely on that day she may have smiled on her guasso husband with a less haughty reserve  the senior officer of the english squadron on our coast made representations to our government as to these captures but gaspar ruiz refused to treat with us then an english frigate proceeded to the bay and her captain doctor and two lieutenants travelled inland under a safeconduct they were well received and spent three days as guests of the partisan chief a sort of military barbaric state was kept up at the residence it was furnished with the loot of frontier towns when first admitted to the principal sala they saw his wife lying down she was not in good health then with gaspar ruiz sitting at the foot of the couch his hat was lying on the floor and his hands reposed on the hilt of his sword  during that first conversation he never removed his big hands from the swordhilt except once to arrange the coverings about her with gentle careful touches they noticed that whenever she spoke he would fix his eyes upon her in a kind of expectant breathless attention and seemingly forget the existence of the world and his own existence too in the course of the farewell banquet at which she was present reclining on her couch he burst forth into complaints of the treatment he had received after general san martins departure he had been beset by spies slandered by civil officials his services ignored his liberty and even his life threatened by the chilian government he got up from the table thundered execrations pacing the room wildly then sat down on the couch at his wifes feet his breast heaving his eyes fixed on the floor she reclined on her back her head on the cushions her eyes nearly closed  and now i am an honoured spanish officer he added in a calm voice  the captain of the english frigate then took the opportunity to inform him gently that lima had fallen and that by the terms of a convention the spaniards were withdrawing from the whole continent  gaspar ruiz raised his head and without hesitation speaking with suppressed vehemence declared that if not a single spanish soldier were left in the whole of south america he would persist in carrying on the contest against chile to the last drop of blood when he finished that mad tirade his wifes long white hand was raised and she just caressed his knee with the tips of her fingers for a fraction of a second  for the rest of the officers stay which did not extend for more than half an hour after the banquet that ferocious chieftain of a desperate partida overflowed with amiability and kindness he had been hospitable before but now it seemed as though he could not do enough for the comfort and safety of his visitors journey back to their ship  nothing i have been told could have presented a greater contrast to his late violence or the habitual taciturn reserve of his manner like a man elated beyond measure by an unexpected happiness he overflowed with goodwill amiability and attentions he embraced the officers like brothers almost with tears in his eyes the released prisoners were presented each with a piece of gold at the last moment suddenly he declared he could do no less than restore to the masters of the merchant vessels all their private property this unexpected generosity caused some delay in the departure of the party and their first march was very short  late in the evening gaspar ruiz rode up with an escort to their camp fires bringing along with him a mule loaded with cases of wine he had come he said to drink a stirrup cup with his english friends whom he would never see again he was mellow and joyous in his temper he told stories of his own exploits laughed like a boy borrowed a guitar from the englishmens chief muleteer and sitting crosslegged on his superfine poncho spread before the glow of the embers sang a guasso lovesong in a tender voice then his head dropped on his breast his hands fell to the ground the guitar rolled off his kneesand a great hush fell over the camp after the lovesong of the implacable partisan who had made so many of our people weep for destroyed homes and for loves cut short  before anybody could make a sound he sprang up from the ground and called for his horse  adios my friends he cried go with god i love you and tell them well in santiago that between gaspar ruiz colonel of the king of spain and the republican carrioncrows of chile there is war to the last breathwar war war  with a great yell of war war war which his escort took up they rode away and the sound of hoofs and of voices died out in the distance between the slopes of the hills  the two young english officers were convinced that ruiz was mad how do you say thattile looseeh but the doctor an observant scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his character told me that it was a very curious case of possession i met him many years afterwards but he remembered the experience very well he told me too that in his opinion that woman did not lead gaspar ruiz into the practice of sanguinary treachery by direct persuasion but by the subtle way of awakening and keeping alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an irreparable wrong maybe maybe but i would say that she poured half of her vengeful soul into the strong clay of that man as you may pour intoxication madness poison into an empty cup  if he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victorious army began to return from peru systematic operations were planned against this blot on the honour and prosperity of our hardly won independence general robles commanded with his wellknown ruthless severity savage reprisals were exercised on both sides and no quarter was given in the field having won my promotion in the peru campaign i was a captain on the staff gaspar ruiz found himself hard pressed at the same time we heard by means of a fugitive priest who had been carried off from his village presbytery and galloped eighty miles into the hills to perform the christening ceremony that a daughter was born to them to celebrate the event i suppose ruiz executed one or two brilliant forays clear away at the rear of our forces and defeated the detachments sent out to cut off his retreat general robles nearly had a stroke of apoplexy from rage he found another cause of insomnia than the bites of mosquitoes but against this one senores tumblers of raw brandy had no more effect than so much water he took to railing and storming at me about my strong man and from our impatience to end this inglorious campaign i am afraid that all we young officers became reckless and apt to take undue risks on service  nevertheless slowly inch by inch as it were our columns were closing upon gaspar ruiz though he had managed to raise all the araucanian nation of wild indians against us then a year or more later our government became aware through its agents and spies that he had actually entered into alliance with carreras the socalled dictator of the socalled republic of mendoza on the other side of the mountains whether gaspar ruiz had a deep political intention or whether he wished only to secure a safe retreat for his wife and child while he pursued remorselessly against us his war of surprises and massacres i cannot tell the alliance however was a fact defeated in his attempt to check our advance from the sea he retreated with his usual swiftness and preparing for another hard and hazardous tussle began by sending his wife with the little girl across the pequena range of mountains on the frontier of mendoza   xi   now carreras under the guise of politics and liberalism was a scoundrel of the deepest dye and the unhappy state of mendoza was the prey of thieves robbers traitors and murderers who formed his party he was under a noble exterior a man without heart pity honour or conscience he aspired to nothing but tyranny and though he would have made use of gaspar ruiz for his nefarious designs yet he soon became aware that to propitiate the chilian government would answer his purpose better i blush to say that he made proposals to our government to deliver up on certain conditions the wife and child of the man who had trusted to his honour and that this offer was accepted  while on her way to mendoza over the pequena pass she was betrayed by her escort of carreras men and given up to the officer in command of a chilian fort on the upland at the foot of the main cordillera range this atrocious transaction might have cost me dear for as a matter of fact i was a prisoner in gaspar ruiz camp when he received the news i had been captured during a reconnaissance my escort of a few troopers being speared by the indians of his bodyguard i was saved from the same fate because he recognized my features just in time no doubt my friends thought i was dead and i would not have given much for my life at any time but the strong man treated me very well because he said i had always believed in his innocence and had tried to serve him when he was a victim of injustice  and now was his speech to me you shall see that i always speak the truth you are safe  i did not think i was very safe when i was called up to go to him one night he paced up and down like a wild beast exclaiming betrayed betrayed  he walked up to me clenching his fists i could cut your throat  will that give your wife back to you i said as quietly as i could  and the child he yelled out as if mad he fell into a chair and laughed in a frightful boisterous manner oh no you are safe  i assured him that his wifes life was safe too but i did not say what i was convinced ofthat he would never see her again he wanted war to the death and the war could only end with his death  he gave me a strange inexplicable look and sat muttering blankly in their hands in their hands  i kept as still as a mouse before a cat  suddenly he jumped up what am i doing here he cried and opening the door he yelled out orders to saddle and mount what is it he stammered coming up to me the pequena fort a fort of palisades nothing i would get her back if she were hidden in the very heart of the mountain he amazed me by adding with an effort i carried her off in my two arms while the earth trembled and the child at least is mine she at least is mine  those were bizarre words but i had no time for wonder  you shall go with me he said violently i may want to parley and any other messenger from ruiz the outlaw would have his throat cut  this was true enough between him and the rest of incensed mankind there could be no communication according to the customs of honourable warfare  in less than half an hour we were in the saddle flying wildly through the night he had only an escort of twenty men at his quarters but would not wait for more he sent however messengers to peneleo the indian chief then ranging in the foothills directing him to bring his warriors to the uplands and meet him at the lake called the eye of water near whose shores the frontier fort of pequena was built  we crossed the lowlands with that untired rapidity of movement which had made gaspar ruiz raids so famous we followed the lower valleys up to their precipitous heads the ride was not without its dangers a cornice road on a perpendicular wall of basalt wound itself around a buttressing rock and at last we emerged from the gloom of a deep gorge upon the upland of pequena  it was a plain of green wiry grass and thin flowering bushes but high above our heads patches of snow hung in the folds and crevices of the great walls of rock the little lake was as round as a staring eye the garrison of the fort were just driving in their small herd of cattle when we appeared then the great wooden gates swung to and that foursquare enclosure of broad blackened stakes pointed at the top and barely hiding the grass roofs of the huts inside seemed deserted empty without a single soul  but when summoned to surrender by a man who at gaspar ruiz order rode fearlessly forward those inside answered by a volley which rolled him and his horse over i heard ruiz by my side grind his teeth it does not matter he said now you go  torn and faded as its rags were the vestiges of my uniform were recognized and i was allowed to approach within speaking distance and then i had to wait because a voice clamouring through a loophole with joy and astonishment would not allow me to place a word it was the voice of major pajol an old friend he like my other comrades had thought me killed a long time ago  put spurs to your horse man he yelled in the greatest excitement we will swing the gate open for you  i let the reins fall out of my hand and shook my head i am on my honour i cried  to him he shouted with infinite disgust  he promises you your life  our life is our own and do you santierra advise us to surrender to that rastrero  no i shouted but he wants his wife and child and he can cut you off from water  then she would be the first to suffer you may tell him that look herethis is all nonsense we shall dash out and capture you  you shall not catch me alive i said firmly  imbecile  for gods sake i continued hastily do not open the gate and i pointed at the multitude of peneleos indians who covered the shores of the lake  i had never seen so many of these savages together their lances seemed as numerous as stalks of grass their hoarse voices made a vast inarticulate sound like the murmur of the sea  my friend pajol was swearing to himself well thengo to the devil he shouted exasperated but as i swung round he repented for i heard him say hurriedly shoot the fools horse before he gets away  he had good marksmen two shots rang out and in the very act of turning my horse staggered fell and lay still as if struck by lightning i had my feet out of the stirrups and rolled clear of him but i did not attempt to rise neither dared they rush out to drag me in  the masses of indians had begun to move upon the fort they rode up in squadrons trailing their long chusos then dismounted out of musketshot and throwing off their fur mantles advanced naked to the attack stamping their feet and shouting in cadence a sheet of flame ran three times along the face of the fort without checking their steady march they crowded right up to the very stakes flourishing their broad knives but this palisade was not fastened together with hide lashings in the usual way but with long iron nails which they could not cut dismayed at the failure of their usual method of forcing an entrance the heathen who had marched so steadily against the musketry fire broke and fled under the volleys of the besieged  directly they had passed me on their advance i got up and rejoined gaspar ruiz on a low ridge which jutted out upon the plain the musketry of his own men had covered the attack but now at a sign from him a trumpet sounded the cease fire together we looked in silence at the hopeless rout of the savages  it must be a siege then he muttered and i detected him wringing his hands stealthily  but what sort of siege could it be without any need for me to repeat my friend pajols message he dared not cut the water off from the besieged they had plenty of meat and indeed if they had been short he would have been too anxious to send food into the stockade had he been able but as a matter of fact it was we on the plain who were beginning to feel the pinch of hunger  peneleo the indian chief sat by our fire folded in his ample mantle of guanaco skins he was an athletic savage with an enormous square shock head of hair resembling a straw beehive in shape and size and with grave surly muchlined features in his broken spanish he repeated growling like a badtempered wild beast that if an opening ever so small were made in the stockade his men would march in and get the senoranot otherwise  gaspar ruiz sitting opposite him kept his eyes fixed on the fort night and day as it were in awful silence and immobility meantime by runners from the lowlands that arrived nearly every day we heard of the defeat of one of his lieutenants in the maipu valley scouts sent afar brought news of a column of infantry advancing through distant passes to the relief of the fort they were slow but we could trace their toilful progress up the lower valleys i wondered why ruiz did not march to attack and destroy this threatening force in some wild gorge fit for an ambuscade in accordance with his genius for guerilla warfare but his genius seemed to have abandoned him to his despair  it was obvious to me that he could not tear himself away from the sight of the fort i protest to you senores that i was moved almost to pity by the sight of this powerless strong man sitting on the ridge indifferent to sun to rain to cold to wind with his hands clasped round his legs and his chin resting on his knees gazinggazinggazing  and the fort he kept his eyes fastened on was as still and silent as himself the garrison gave no sign of life they did not even answer the desultory fire directed at the loopholes  one night as i strolled past him he without changing his attitude spoke to me unexpectedly i have sent for a gun he said i shall have time to get her back and retreat before your robles manages to crawl up here  he had sent for a gun to the plains  it was long in coming but at last it came it was a sevenpounder field gun dismounted and lashed crosswise to two long poles it had been carried up the narrow paths between two mules with ease his wild cry of exultation at daybreak when he saw the gun escort emerge from the valley rings in my ears now  but senores i have no words to depict his amazement his fury his despair and distraction when he heard that the animal loaded with the guncarriage had during the last night march somehow or other tumbled down a precipice he broke into menaces of death and torture against the escort i kept out of his way all that day lying behind some bushes and wondering what he would do now retreat was left for him but he could not retreat  i saw below me his artillerist jorge an old spanish soldier building up a sort of structure with heapedup saddles the gun ready loaded was lifted on to that but in the act of firing the whole thing collapsed and the shot flew high above the stockade  nothing more was attempted one of the ammunition mules had been lost too and they had no more than six shots to fire ample enough to batter down the gate providing the gun was well laid this was impossible without it being properly mounted there was no time nor means to construct a carriage already every moment i expected to hear robles buglecalls echo amongst the crags  peneleo wandering about uneasily draped in his skins sat down for a moment near me growling his usual tale  make an entradaa hole if make a hole bueno if not make a hole then vamoswe must go away  after sunset i observed with surprise the indians making preparations as if for another assault their lines stood ranged in the shadows of the mountains on the plain in front of the fort gate i saw a group of men swaying about in the same place  i walked down the ridge disregarded the moonlight in the clear air of the uplands was bright as day but the intense shadows confused my sight and i could not make out what they were doing i heard the voice of jorge the artillerist say in a queer doubtful tone it is loaded senor  then another voice in that group pronounced firmly the words bring the riata here it was the voice of gaspar ruiz  a silence fell in which the popping shots of the besieged garrison rang out sharply they too had observed the group but the distance was too great and in the spatter of spent musketballs cutting up the ground the group opened closed swayed giving me a glimpse of busy stooping figures in its midst i drew nearer doubting whether this was a weird vision a suggestive and insensate dream  a strangely stifled voice commanded haul the hitches tighter  si senor several other voices answered in tones of awed alacrity  then the stifled voice said like this i must be free to breathe  then there was a concerned noise of many men together help him up hombres steady under the other arm  that deadened voice ordered bueno stand away from me men  i pushed my way through the recoiling circle and heard once more that same oppressed voice saying earnestly forget that i am a living man jorge forget me altogether and think of what you have to do  be without fear senor you are nothing to me but a guncarriage and i shall not waste a shot  i heard the spluttering of a portfire and smelt the saltpetre of the match i saw suddenly before me a nondescript shape on all fours like a beast but with a mans head drooping below a tubular projection over the nape of the neck and the gleam of a rounded mass of bronze on its back  in front of a silent semicircle of men it squatted alone with jorge behind it and a trumpeter motionless his trumpet in his hand by its side  jorge bent double muttered portfire in hand an inch to the left senor too much so now if you let yourself down a little by letting your elbows bend i will     he leaped aside lowering his portfire and a burst of flame darted out of the muzzle of the gun lashed on the mans back  then gaspar ruiz lowered himself slowly good shot he asked  full on senor  then load again  he lay there before me on his breast under the darkly glittering bronze of his monstrous burden such as no love or strength of man had ever had to bear in the lamentable history of the world his arms were spread out and he resembled a prostrate penitent on the moonlit ground  again i saw him raised to his hands and knees and the men stand away from him and old jorge stoop glancing along the gun  left a little right an inch por dios senor stop this trembling where is your strength  the old gunners voice was cracked with emotion he stepped aside and quick as lightning brought the spark to the touchhole  excellent he cried tearfully but gaspar ruiz lay for a long time silent flattened on the ground  i am tired he murmured at last will another shot do it  without doubt said jorge bending down to his ear  thenload i heard him utter distinctly trumpeter  i am here senor ready for your word  blow a blast at this word that shall be heard from one end of chile to the other he said in an extraordinarily strong voice and you others stand ready to cut this accursed riata for then will be the time for me to lead you in your rush now raise me up and you jorgebe quick with your aim  the rattle of musketry from the fort nearly drowned his voice the palisade was wreathed in smoke and flame  exert your force forward against the recoil mi amo said the old gunner shakily dig your fingers into the ground so now  a cry of exultation escaped him after the shot the trumpeter raised his trumpet nearly to his lips and waited but no word came from the prostrate man i fell on one knee and heard all he had to say then  something broken he whispered lifting his head a little and turning his eyes towards me in his hopelessly crushed attitude  the gate hangs only by the splinters yelled jorge  gaspar ruiz tried to speak but his voice died out in his throat and i helped to roll the gun off his broken back he was insensible  i kept my lips shut of course the signal for the indians to attack was never given instead the buglecalls of the relieving force for which my ears had thirsted so long burst out terrifying like the call of the last day to our surprised enemies  a tornado senores a real hurricane of stampeded men wild horses mounted indians swept over me as i cowered on the ground by the side of gaspar ruiz still stretched out on his face in the shape of a cross peneleo galloping for life jabbed at me with his long chuso in passingfor the sake of old acquaintance i suppose how i escaped the flying lead is more difficult to explain venturing to rise on my knees too soon some soldiers of the 17th taltal regiment in their hurry to get at something alive nearly bayoneted me on the spot they looked very disappointed too when some officers galloping up drove them away with the flat of their swords  it was general robles with his staff he wanted badly to make some prisoners he too seemed disappointed for a moment what is it you he cried but he dismounted at once to embrace me for he was an old friend of my family i pointed to the body at our feet and said only these two words  gaspar ruiz  he threw his arms up in astonishment  aha your strong man always to the last with your strong man no matter he saved our lives when the earth trembled enough to make the bravest faint with fear i was frightened out of my wits but heno que guape wheres the hero who got the best of him ha ha ha what killed him chico  his own strength general i answered   xii   but gaspar ruiz breathed yet i had him carried in his poncho under the shelter of some bushes on the very ridge from which he had been gazing so fixedly at the fort while unseen death was hovering already over his head  our troops had bivouacked round the fort towards daybreak i was not surprised to hear that i was designated to command the escort of a prisoner who was to be sent down at once to santiago of course the prisoner was gaspar ruiz wife  i have named you out of regard for your feelings general robles remarked though the woman really ought to be shot for all the harm she has done to the republic  and as i made a movement of shocked protest he continued  now he is as well as dead she is of no importance nobody will know what to do with her however the government wants her he shrugged his shoulders i suppose he must have buried large quantities of his loot in places that she alone knows of  at dawn i saw her coming up the ridge guarded by two soldiers and carrying her child on her arm  i walked to meet her  is he living yet she asked confronting me with that white impassive face he used to look at in an adoring way  i bent my head and led her round a clump of bushes without a word his eyes were open he breathed with difficulty and uttered her name with a great effort  erminia  she knelt at his head the little girl unconscious of him and with her big eyes looking about began to chatter suddenly in a joyous thin voice she pointed a tiny finger at the rosy glow of sunrise behind the black shapes of the peaks and while that childtalk incomprehensible and sweet to the ear lasted those two the dying man and the kneeling woman remained silent looking into each others eyes listening to the frail sound then the prattle stopped the child laid its head against its mothers breast and was still  it was for you he began forgive his voice failed him presently i heard a mutter and caught the pitiful words not strong enough  she looked at him with an extraordinary intensity he tried to smile and in a humble tone forgive me he repeated leaving you     she bent down dryeyed and in a steady voice on all the earth i have loved nothing but you gaspar she said  his head made a movement his eyes revived at last he sighed out then anxiously but is this true    is this true  as true as that there is no mercy and justice in this world she answered him passionately she stooped over his face he tried to raise his head but it fell back and when she kissed his lips he was already dead his glazed eyes stared at the sky on which pink clouds floated very high but i noticed the eyelids of the child pressed to its mothers breast droop and close slowly she had gone to sleep  the widow of gaspar ruiz the strong man allowed me to lead her away without shedding a tear  for travelling we had arranged for her a sidesaddle very much like a chair with a board swung beneath to rest her feet on and the first day she rode without uttering a word and hardly for one moment turning her eyes away from the little girl whom she held on her knees at our first camp i saw her during the night walking about rocking the child in her arms and gazing down at it by the light of the moon after we had started on our second days march she asked me how soon we should come to the first village of the inhabited country  i said we should be there about noon  and will there be women there she inquired  i told her that it was a large village there will be men and women there senora i said whose hearts shall be made glad by the news that all the unrest and war is over now  yes it is all over now she repeated then after a time senor officer what will your government do with me  i do not know senora i said they will treat you well no doubt we republicans are not savages and take no vengeance on women  she gave me a look at the word republicans which i imagined full of undying hate but an hour or so afterwards as we drew up to let the baggage mules go first along a narrow path skirting a precipice she looked at me with such a white troubled face that i felt a great pity for her  senor officer she said i am weak i tremble it is an insensate fear and indeed her lips did tremble while she tried to smile glancing at the beginning of the narrow path which was not so dangerous after all i am afraid i shall drop the child gaspar saved your life you remember    take her from me  i took the child out of her extended arms shut your eyes senora and trust to your mule i recommended  she did so and with her pallor and her wasted thin face she looked deathlike at a turn of the path where a great crag of purple porphyry closes the view of the lowlands i saw her open her eyes i rode just behind her holding the little girl with my right arm the child is all right i cried encouragingly  yes she answered faintly and then to my intense terror i saw her stand up on the footrest staring horribly and throw herself forward into the chasm on our right  i cannot describe to you the sudden and abject fear that came over me at that dreadful sight it was a dread of the abyss the dread of the crags which seemed to nod upon me my head swam i pressed the child to my side and sat my horse as still as a statue i was speechless and cold all over her mule staggered sidling close to the rock and then went on my horse only pricked up his ears with a slight snort my heart stood still and from the depths of the precipice the stones rattling in the bed of the furious stream made me almost insane with their sound  next moment we were round the turn and on a broad and grassy slope and then i yelled my men came running back to me in great alarm it seems that at first i did nothing but shout she has given the child into my hands she has given the child into my hands the escort thought i had gone mad  general santierra ceased and got up from the table and that is all senores he concluded with a courteous glance at his rising guests  but what became of the child general we asked  ah the child the child  he walked to one of the windows opening on his beautiful garden the refuge of his old days its fame was great in the land keeping us back with a raised arm he called out erminia erminia and waited then his cautioning arm dropped and we crowded to the windows  from a clump of trees a woman had come upon the broad walk bordered with flowers we could hear the rustle of her starched petticoats and observed the ample spread of her oldfashioned black silk skirt she looked up and seeing all these eyes staring at her stopped frowned smiled shook her finger at the general who was laughing boisterously and drawing the black lace on her head so as to partly conceal her haughty profile passed out of our sight walking with stiff dignity  you have beheld the guardian angel of the old manand her to whom you owe all that is seemly and comfortable in my hospitality somehow senores though the flame of love has been kindled early in my breast i have never married and because of that perhaps the sparks of the sacred fire are not yet extinct here he struck his broad chest still alive still alive he said with seriocomic emphasis but i shall not marry now she is general santierras adopted daughter and heiress  one of our fellowguests a young naval officer described her afterwards as a short stout old girl of forty or thereabouts we had all noticed that her hair was turning grey and that she had very fine black eyes  and general santierra continued neither would she ever hear of marrying any one a real calamity good patient devoted to the old man a simple soul but i would not advise any of you to ask for her hand for if she took yours into hers it would be only to crush your bones ah she does not jest on that subject and she is the own daughter of her father the strong man who perished through his own strength the strength of his body of his simplicityof his love     an ironic tale     the informer   mr x came to me preceded by a letter of introduction from a good friend of mine in paris specifically to see my collection of chinese bronzes and porcelain  my friend in paris is a collector too he collects neither porcelain nor bronzes nor pictures nor medals nor stamps nor anything that could be profitably dispersed under an auctioneers hammer he would reject with genuine surprise the name of a collector nevertheless thats what he is by temperament he collects acquaintances it is delicate work he brings to it the patience the passion the determination of a true collector of curiosities his collection does not contain any royal personages i dont think he considers them sufficiently rare and interesting but with that exception he has met with and talked to everyone worth knowing on any conceivable ground he observes them listens to them penetrates them measures them and puts the memory away in the galleries of his mind he has schemed plotted and travelled all over europe in order to add to his collection of distinguished personal acquaintances  as he is wealthy well connected and unprejudiced his collection is pretty complete including objects or should i say subjects whose value is unappreciated by the vulgar and often unknown to popular fame of trevolte of modern times the world knows him as a revolutionary writer whose savage irony has laid bare the rottenness of the most respectable institutions he has scalped every venerated head and has mangled at the stake of his wit every received opinion and every recognized principle of conduct and policy who does not remember his flaming red revolutionary pamphlets their sudden swarmings used to overwhelm the powers of every continental police like a plague of crimson gadflies but this extreme writer has been also the active inspirer of secret societies the mysterious unknown number one of desperate conspiracies suspected and unsuspected matured or baffled and the world at large has never had an inkling of that fact this accounts for him going about amongst us to this day a veteran of many subterranean campaigns standing aside now safe within his reputation of merely the greatest destructive publicist that ever lived  thus wrote my friend adding that mr x was an enlightened connoisseur of bronzes and china and asking me to show him my collection  x turned up in due course my treasures are disposed in three large rooms without carpets and curtains there is no other furniture than the etagres and the glass cases whose contents shall be worth a fortune to my heirs i allow no fires to be lighted for fear of accidents and a fireproof door separates them from the rest of the house  it was a bitter cold day we kept on our overcoats and hats middlesized and spare his eyes alert in a long romannosed countenance x walked on his neat little feet with short steps and looked at my collection intelligently i hope i looked at him intelligently too a snowwhite moustache and imperial made his nutbrown complexion appear darker than it really was in his fur coat and shiny tall hat that terrible man looked fashionable i believe he belonged to a noble family and could have called himself vicomte x de la z if he chose we talked nothing but bronzes and porcelain he was remarkably appreciative we parted on cordial terms  where he was staying i dont know i imagine he must have been a lonely man anarchists i suppose have no familiesnot at any rate as we understand that social relation organization into families may answer to a need of human nature but in the last instance it is based on law and therefore must be something odious and impossible to an anarchist but indeed i dont understand anarchists does a man of thatof thatpersuasion still remain an anarchist when alone quite alone and going to bed for instance does he lay his head on the pillow pull his bedclothes over him and go to sleep with the necessity of the chambardement general as the french slang has it of the general blowup always present to his mind and if so how can he i am sure that if such a faith or such a fanaticism once mastered my thoughts i would never be able to compose myself sufficiently to sleep or eat or perform any of the routine acts of daily life i would want no wife no children i could have no friends it seems to me and as to collecting bronzes or china that i should say would be quite out of the question but i dont know all i know is that mr x took his meals in a very good restaurant which i frequented also  with his head uncovered the silver topknot of his brushedup hair completed the character of his physiognomy all bony ridges and sunken hollows clothed in a perfect impassiveness of expression his meagre brown hands emerging from large white cuffs came and went breaking bread pouring wine and so on with quiet mechanical precision his head and body above the tablecloth had a rigid immobility this firebrand this great agitator exhibited the least possible amount of warmth and animation his voice was rasping cold and monotonous in a low key he could not be called a talkative personality but with his detached calm manner he appeared as ready to keep the conversation going as to drop it at any moment  and his conversation was by no means commonplace to me i own there was some excitement in talking quietly across a dinnertable with a man whose venomous penstabs had sapped the vitality of at least one monarchy that much was a matter of public knowledge but i knew more i knew of himfrom my friendas a certainty what the guardians of social order in europe had at most only suspected or dimly guessed at  he had had what i may call his underground life and as i sat evening after evening facing him at dinner a curiosity in that direction would naturally arise in my mind i am a quiet and peaceable product of civilization and know no passion other than the passion for collecting things which are rare and must remain exquisite even if approaching to the monstrous some chinese bronzes are monstrously precious and here out of my friends collection here i had before me a kind of rare monster it is true that this monster was polished and in a sense even exquisite his beautiful unruffled manner was that but then he was not of bronze he was not even chinese which would have enabled one to contemplate him calmly across the gulf of racial difference he was alive and european he had the manner of good society wore a coat and hat like mine and had pretty near the same taste in cooking it was too frightful to think of  one evening he remarked casually in the course of conversation theres no amendment to be got out of mankind except by terror and violence  you can imagine the effect of such a phrase out of such a mans mouth upon a person like myself whose whole scheme of life had been based upon a suave and delicate discrimination of social and artistic values just imagine upon me to whom all sorts and forms of violence appeared as unreal as the giants ogres and sevenheaded hydras whose activities affect fantastically the course of legends and fairytales  i seemed suddenly to hear above the festive bustle and clatter of the brilliant restaurant the mutter of a hungry and seditious multitude  i suppose i am impressionable and imaginative i had a disturbing vision of darkness full of lean jaws and wild eyes amongst the hundred electric lights of the place but somehow this vision made me angry too the sight of that man so calm breaking bits of white bread exasperated me and i had the audacity to ask him how it was that the starving proletariat of europe to whom he had been preaching revolt and violence had not been made indignant by his openly luxurious life at all this i said pointedly with a glance round the room and at the bottle of champagne we generally shared between us at dinner  he remained unmoved  do i feed on their toil and their hearts blood am i a speculator or a capitalist did i steal my fortune from a starving people no they know this very well and they envy me nothing the miserable mass of the people is generous to its leaders what i have acquired has come to me through my writings not from the millions of pamphlets distributed gratis to the hungry and the oppressed but from the hundreds of thousands of copies sold to the wellfed bourgeoisie you know that my writings were at one time the rage the fashionthe thing to read with wonder and horror to turn your eyes up at my pathos    or else to laugh in ecstasies at my wit  yes i admitted i remember of course and i confess frankly that i could never understand that infatuation  dont you know yet he said that an idle and selfish class loves to see mischief being made even if it is made at its own expense its own life being all a matter of pose and gesture it is unable to realize the power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham meaning it is all fun and sentiment it is sufficient for instance to point out the attitude of the old french aristocracy towards the philosophers whose words were preparing the great revolution even in england where you have some commonsense a demagogue has only to shout loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is shouting at you too like to see mischief being made the demagogue carries the amateurs of emotion with him amateurism in this that and the other thing is a delightfully easy way of killing time and feeding ones own vanitythe silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of the day after tomorrow just as good and otherwise harmless people will join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest notion in what its marvellousness really consists  i hung my head it was a crushing illustration of the sad truth he advanced the world is full of such people and that instance of the french aristocracy before the revolution was extremely telling too i could not traverse his statement though its cynicismalways a distasteful traittook off much of its value to my mind however i admit i was impressed i felt the need to say something which would not be in the nature of assent and yet would not invite discussion  you dont mean to say i observed airily that extreme revolutionists have ever been actively assisted by the infatuation of such people  i did not mean exactly that by what i said just now i generalized but since you ask me i may tell you that such help has been given to revolutionary activities more or less consciously in various countries and even in this country  impossible i protested with firmness we dont play with fire to that extent  and yet you can better afford it than others perhaps but let me observe that most women if not always ready to play with fire are generally eager to play with a loose spark or so  is this a joke i asked smiling  if it is i am not aware of it he said woodenly i was thinking of an instance oh mild enough in a way     i became all expectation at this i had tried many times to approach him on his underground side so to speak the very word had been pronounced between us but he had always met me with his impenetrable calm  and at the same time mr x continued it will give you a notion of the difficulties that may arise in what you are pleased to call underground work it is sometimes difficult to deal with them of course there is no hierarchy amongst the affiliated no rigid system  my surprise was great but shortlived clearly amongst extreme anarchists there could be no hierarchy nothing in the nature of a law of precedence the idea of anarchy ruling among anarchists was comforting too it could not possibly make for efficiency  mr x startled me by asking abruptly you know hermione street  i nodded doubtful assent hermione street has been within the last three years improved out of any mans knowledge the name exists still but not one brick or stone of the old hermione street is left now it was the old street he meant for he said  there was a row of twostoried brick houses on the left with their backs against the wing of a great public buildingyou remember would it surprise you very much to hear that one of these houses was for a time the centre of anarchist propaganda and of what you would call underground action  not at all i declared hermione street had never been particularly respectable as i remembered it  the house was the property of a distinguished government official he added sipping his champagne  oh indeed i said this time not believing a word of it  of course he was not living there mr x continued but from ten till four he sat next door to it the dear man in his wellappointed private room in the wing of the public building ive mentioned to be strictly accurate i must explain that the house in hermione street did not really belong to him it belonged to his grownup childrena daughter and a son the girl a fine figure was by no means vulgarly pretty to more personal charm than mere youth could account for she added the seductive appearance of enthusiasm of independence of courageous thought i suppose she put on these appearances as she put on her picturesque dresses and for the same reason to assert her individuality at any cost you know women would go to any length almost for such a purpose she went to a great length she had acquired all the appropriate gestures of revolutionary convictionsthe gestures of pity of anger of indignation against the antihumanitarian vices of the social class to which she belonged herself all this sat on her striking personality as well as her slightly original costumes very slightly original just enough to mark a protest against the philistinism of the overfed taskmasters of the poor just enough and no more it would not have done to go too far in that directionyou understand but she was of age and nothing stood in the way of her offering her house to the revolutionary workers  you dont mean it i cried  i assure you he affirmed that she made that very practical gesture how else could they have got hold of it the cause is not rich and moreover there would have been difficulties with any ordinary houseagent who would have wanted references and so on the group she came in contact with while exploring the poor quarters of the town you know the gesture of charity and personal service which was so fashionable some years ago accepted with gratitude the first advantage was that hermione street is as you know well away from the suspect part of the town specially watched by the police  the ground floor consisted of a little italian restaurant of the flyblown sort there was no difficulty in buying the proprietor out a woman and a man belonging to the group took it on the man had been a cook the comrades could get their meals there unnoticed amongst the other customers this was another advantage the first floor was occupied by a shabby variety artists agencyan agency for performers in inferior musichalls you know a fellow called bomm i remember he was not disturbed it was rather favourable than otherwise to have a lot of foreignlooking people jugglers acrobats singers of both sexes and so on going in and out all day long the police paid no attention to new faces you see the top floor happened most conveniently to stand empty then  x interrupted himself to attack impassively with measured movements a bombe glacee which the waiter had just set down on the table he swallowed carefully a few spoonfuls of the iced sweet and asked me did you ever hear of stones dried soup  hear of what  it was x pursued evenly a comestible article once rather prominently advertised in the dailies but which never somehow gained the favour of the public the enterprise fizzled out as you say here parcels of their stock could be picked up at auctions at considerably less than a penny a pound the group bought some of it and an agency for stones dried soup was started on the top floor a perfectly respectable business the stuff a yellow powder of extremely unappetizing aspect was put up in large square tins of which six went to a case if anybody ever came to give an order it was of course executed but the advantage of the powder was this that things could be concealed in it very conveniently now and then a special case got put on a van and sent off to be exported abroad under the very nose of the policeman on duty at the corner you understand  i think i do i said with an expressive nod at the remnants of the bombe melting slowly in the dish  exactly but the cases were useful in another way too in the basement or in the cellar at the back rather two printingpresses were established a lot of revolutionary literature of the most inflammatory kind was got away from the house in stones dried soup cases the brother of our anarchist young lady found some occupation there he wrote articles helped to set up type and pull off the sheets and generally assisted the man in charge a very able young fellow called sevrin  the guiding spirit of that group was a fanatic of social revolution he is dead now he was an engraver and etcher of genius you must have seen his work it is much sought after by certain amateurs now he began by being revolutionary in his art and ended by becoming a revolutionist after his wife and child had died in want and misery he used to say that the bourgeoisie the smug overfed lot had killed them that was his real belief he still worked at his art and led a double life he was tall gaunt and swarthy with a long brown beard and deepset eyes you must have seen him his name was horne  at this i was really startled of course years ago i used to meet horne about he looked like a powerful rough gipsy in an old top hat with a red muffler round his throat and buttoned up in a long shabby overcoat he talked of his art with exaltation and gave one the impression of being strung up to the verge of insanity a small group of connoisseurs appreciated his work who would have thought that this man    amazing and yet it was not after all so difficult to believe  as you see x went on this group was in a position to pursue its work of propaganda and the other kind of work too under very advantageous conditions they were all resolute experienced men of a superior stamp and yet we became struck at length by the fact that plans prepared in hermione street almost invariably failed  who were we i asked pointedly  some of us in brusselsat the centre he said hastily whatever vigorous action originated in hermione street seemed doomed to failure something always happened to baffle the best planned manifestations in every part of europe it was a time of general activity you must not imagine that all our failures are of a loud sort with arrests and trials that is not so often the police work quietly almost secretly defeating our combinations by clever counterplotting no arrests no noise no alarming of the public mind and inflaming the passions it is a wise procedure but at that time the police were too uniformly successful from the mediterranean to the baltic it was annoying and began to look dangerous at last we came to the conclusion that there must be some untrustworthy elements amongst the london groups and i came over to see what could be done quietly  my first step was to call upon our young lady amateur of anarchism at her private house she received me in a flattering way i judged that she knew nothing of the chemical and other operations going on at the top of the house in hermione street the printing of anarchist literature was the only activity she seemed to be aware of there she was displaying very strikingly the usual signs of severe enthusiasm and had already written many sentimental articles with ferocious conclusions i could see she was enjoying herself hugely with all the gestures and grimaces of deadly earnestness they suited her bigeyed broadbrowed face and the good carriage of her shapely head crowned by a magnificent lot of brown hair done in an unusual and becoming style her brother was in the room too a serious youth with arched eyebrows and wearing a red necktie who struck me as being absolutely in the dark about everything in the world including himself by and by a tall young man came in he was cleanshaved with a strong bluish jaw and something of the air of a taciturn actor or of a fanatical priest the type with thick black eyebrowsyou know but he was very presentable indeed he shook hands at once vigorously with each of us the young lady came up to me and murmured sweetly comrade sevrin  i had never seen him before he had little to say to us but sat down by the side of the girl and they fell at once into earnest conversation she leaned forward in her deep armchair and took her nicely rounded chin in her beautiful white hand he looked attentively into her eyes it was the attitude of lovemaking serious intense as if on the brink of the grave i suppose she felt it necessary to round and complete her assumption of advanced ideas of revolutionary lawlessness by making believe to be in love with an anarchist and this one i repeat was extremely presentable notwithstanding his fanatical blackbrowed aspect after a few stolen glances in their direction i had no doubt that he was in earnest as to the lady her gestures were unapproachable better than the very thing itself in the blended suggestion of dignity sweetness condescension fascination surrender and reserve she interpreted her conception of what that precise sort of lovemaking should be with consummate art and so far she too no doubt was in earnest gesturesbut so perfect  after i had been left alone with our lady amateur i informed her guardedly of the object of my visit i hinted at our suspicions i wanted to hear what she would have to say and half expected some perhaps unconscious revelation all she said was thats serious looking delightfully concerned and grave but there was a sparkle in her eyes which meant plainly how exciting after all she knew little of anything except of words still she undertook to put me in communication with horne who was not easy to find unless in hermione street where i did not wish to show myself just then  i met horne this was another kind of a fanatic altogether i exposed to him the conclusion we in brussels had arrived at and pointed out the significant series of failures to this he answered with irrelevant exaltation  i have something in hand that shall strike terror into the heart of these gorged brutes  and then i learned that by excavating in one of the cellars of the house he and some companions had made their way into the vaults under the great public building i have mentioned before the blowing up of a whole wing was a certainty as soon as the materials were ready  i was not so appalled at the stupidity of that move as i might have been had not the usefulness of our centre in hermione street become already very problematical in fact in my opinion it was much more of a police trap by this time than anything else  what was necessary now was to discover what or rather who was wrong and i managed at last to get that idea into hornes head he glared perplexed his nostrils working as if he were sniffing treachery in the air  and here comes a piece of work which will no doubt strike you as a sort of theatrical expedient and yet what else could have been done the problem was to find out the untrustworthy member of the group but no suspicion could be fastened on one more than another to set a watch upon them all was not very practicable besides that proceeding often fails in any case it takes time and the danger was pressing i felt certain that the premises in hermione street would be ultimately raided though the police had evidently such confidence in the informer that the house for the time being was not even watched horne was positive on that point under the circumstances it was an unfavourable symptom something had to be done quickly  i decided to organize a raid myself upon the group do you understand a raid of other trusty comrades personating the police a conspiracy within a conspiracy you see the object of it of course when apparently about to be arrested i hoped the informer would betray himself in some way or other either by some unguarded act or simply by his unconcerned demeanour for instance of coarse there was the risk of complete failure and the no lesser risk of some fatal accident in the course of resistance perhaps or in the efforts at escape for as you will easily see the hermione street group had to be actually and completely taken unawares as i was sure they would be by the real police before very long the informer was amongst them and horne alone could be let into the secret of my plan  i will not enter into the detail of my preparations it was not very easy to arrange but it was done very well with a really convincing effect the sham police invaded the restaurant whose shutters were immediately put up the surprise was perfect most of the hermione street party were found in the second cellar enlarging the hole communicating with the vaults of the great public building at the first alarm several comrades bolted through impulsively into the aforesaid vault where of course had this been a genuine raid they would have been hopelessly trapped we did not bother about them for the moment they were harmless enough the top floor caused considerable anxiety to horne and myself there surrounded by tins of stones dried soup a comrade nicknamed the professor he was an exscience student was engaged in perfecting some new detonators he was an abstracted selfconfident sallow little man armed with large round spectacles and we were afraid that under a mistaken impression he would blow himself up and wreck the house about our ears i rushed upstairs and found him already at the door on the alert listening as he said to suspicious noises down below before i had quite finished explaining to him what was going on he shrugged his shoulders disdainfully and turned away to his balances and testtubes his was the true spirit of an extreme revolutionist explosives were his faith his hope his weapon and his shield he perished a couple of years afterwards in a secret laboratory through the premature explosion of one of his improved detonators  hurrying down again i found an impressive scene in the gloom of the big cellar the man who personated the inspector he was no stranger to the part was speaking harshly and giving bogus orders to his bogus subordinates for the removal of his prisoners evidently nothing enlightening had happened so far horne saturnine and swarthy waited with folded arms and his patient moody expectation had an air of stoicism well in keeping with the situation i detected in the shadows one of the hermione street group surreptitiously chewing up and swallowing a small piece of paper some compromising scrap i suppose perhaps just a note of a few names and addresses he was a true and faithful companion but the fund of secret malice which lurks at the bottom of our sympathies caused me to feel amused at that perfectly uncalledfor performance  in every other respect the risky experiment the theatrical coup if you like to call it so seemed to have failed the deception could not be kept up much longer the explanation would bring about a very embarrassing and even grave situation the man who had eaten the paper would be furious the fellows who had bolted away would be angry too  to add to my vexation the door communicating with the other cellar where the printingpresses were flew open and our young lady revolutionist appeared a black silhouette in a closefitting dress and a large hat with the blaze of gas flaring in there at her back over her shoulder i perceived the arched eyebrows and the red necktie of her brother  the last people in the world i wanted to see then they had gone that evening to some amateur concert for the delectation of the poor people you know but she had insisted on leaving early on purpose to call in hermione street on the way home under the pretext of having some work to do her usual task was to correct the proofs of the italian and french editions of the alarm bell and the firebrand     heavens i murmured i had been shown once a few copies of these publications nothing in my opinion could have been less fit for the eyes of a young lady they were the most advanced things of the sort advanced i mean beyond all bounds of reason and decency one of them preached the dissolution of all social and domestic ties the other advocated systematic murder to think of a young girl calmly tracking printers errors all along the sort of abominable sentences i remembered was intolerable to my sentiment of womanhood mr x after giving me a glance pursued steadily  i think however that she came mostly to exercise her fascinations upon sevrin and to receive his homage in her queenly and condescending way she was aware of bothher power and his homageand enjoyed them with i dare say complete innocence we have no ground in expediency or morals to quarrel with her on that account charm in woman and exceptional intelligence in man are a law unto themselves is it not so  i refrained from expressing my abhorrence of that licentious doctrine because of my curiosity  but what happened then i hastened to ask  x went on crumbling slowly a small piece of bread with a careless left hand  what happened in effect he confessed is that she saved the situation  she gave you an opportunity to end your rather sinister farce i suggested  yes he said preserving his impassive bearing the farce was bound to end soon and it ended in a very few minutes and it ended well had she not come in it might have ended badly her brother of course did not count they had slipped into the house quietly some time before the printingcellar had an entrance of its own not finding any one there she sat down to her proofs expecting sevrin to return to his work at any moment he did not do so she grew impatient heard through the door the sounds of a disturbance in the other cellar and naturally came in to see what was the matter  sevrin had been with us at first he had seemed to me the most amazed of the whole raided lot he appeared for an instant as if paralyzed with astonishment he stood rooted to the spot he never moved a limb a solitary gasjet flared near his head all the other lights had been put out at the first alarm and presently from my dark corner i observed on his shaven actors face an expression of puzzled vexed watchfulness he knitted his heavy eyebrows the corners of his mouth dropped scornfully he was angry most likely he had seen through the game and i regretted i had not taken him from the first into my complete confidence  but with the appearance of the girl he became obviously alarmed it was plain i could see it grow the change of his expression was swift and startling and i did not know why the reason never occurred to me i was merely astonished at the extreme alteration of the mans face of course he had not been aware of her presence in the other cellar but that did not explain the shock her advent had given him for a moment he seemed to have been reduced to imbecility he opened his mouth as if to shout or perhaps only to gasp at any rate it was somebody else who shouted this somebody else was the heroic comrade whom i had detected swallowing a piece of paper with laudable presence of mind he let out a warning yell  its the police back back run back and bolt the door behind you  it was an excellent hint but instead of retreating the girl continued to advance followed by her longfaced brother in his knickerbocker suit in which he had been singing comic songs for the entertainment of a joyless proletariat she advanced not as if she had failed to understandthe word police has an unmistakable soundbut rather as if she could not help herself she did not advance with the free gait and expanding presence of a distinguished amateur anarchist amongst poor struggling professionals but with slightly raised shoulders and her elbows pressed close to her body as if trying to shrink within herself her eyes were fixed immovably upon sevrin sevrin the man i fancy not sevrin the anarchist but she advanced and that was natural for all their assumption of independence girls of that class are used to the feeling of being specially protected as in fact they are this feeling accounts for nine tenths of their audacious gestures her face had gone completely colourless ghastly fancy having it brought home to her so brutally that she was the sort of person who must run away from the police i believe she was pale with indignation mostly though there was of course also the concern for her intact personality a vague dread of some sort of rudeness and naturally she turned to a man to the man on whom she had a claim of fascination and homagethe man who could not conceivably fail her at any juncture  but i cried amazed at this analysis if it had been serious real i meanas she thought it waswhat could she expect him to do for her  x never moved a muscle of his face  goodness knows i imagine that this charming generous and independent creature had never known in her life a single genuine thought i mean a single thought detached from small human vanities or whose source was not in some conventional perception all i know is that after advancing a few steps she extended her hand towards the motionless sevrin and that at least was no gesture it was a natural movement as to what she expected him to do who can tell the impossible but whatever she expected it could not have come up i am safe to say to what he had made up his mind to do even before that entreating hand had appealed to him so directly it had not been necessary from the moment he had seen her enter that cellar he had made up his mind to sacrifice his future usefulness to throw off the impenetrable solidly fastened mask it had been his pride to wear  what do you mean i interrupted puzzled was it sevrin then who was  he was the most persistent the most dangerous the craftiest the most systematic of informers a genius amongst betrayers fortunately for us he was unique the man was a fanatic i have told you fortunately again for us he had fallen in love with the accomplished and innocent gestures of that girl an actor in desperate earnest himself he must have believed in the absolute value of conventional signs as to the grossness of the trap into which he fell the explanation must be that two sentiments of such absorbing magnitude cannot exist simultaneously in one heart the danger of that other and unconscious comedian robbed him of his vision of his perspicacity of his judgment indeed it did at first rob him of his selfpossession but he regained that through the necessityas it appeared to him imperiouslyto do something at once to do what why to get her out of the house as quickly as possible he was desperately anxious to do that i have told you he was terrified it could not be about himself he had been surprised and annoyed at a move quite unforeseen and premature i may even say he had been furious he was accustomed to arrange the last scene of his betrayals with a deep subtle art which left his revolutionist reputation untouched but it seems clear to me that at the same time he had resolved to make the best of it to keep his mask resolutely on it was only with the discovery of her being in the house that everythingthe forced calm the restraint of his fanaticism the maskall came off together in a kind of panic why panic do you ask the answer is very simple he rememberedor i dare say he had never forgottenthe professor alone at the top of the house pursuing his researches surrounded by tins upon tins of stones dried soup there was enough in some few of them to bury us all where we stood under a heap of bricks sevrin of course was aware of that and we must believe also that he knew the exact character of the man he had gauged so many such characters or perhaps he only gave the professor credit for what he himself was capable of but in any case the effect was produced and suddenly he raised his voice in authority  get the lady away at once  it turned out that he was as hoarse as a crow result no doubt of the intense emotion it passed off in a moment but these fateful words issued forth from his contracted throat in a discordant ridiculous croak they required no answer the thing was done however the man personating the inspector judged it expedient to say roughly  she shall go soon enough together with the rest of you  these were the last words belonging to the comedy part of this affair  oblivious of everything and everybody sevrin strode towards him and seized the lapels of his coat under his thin bluish cheeks one could see his jaws working with passion  you have men posted outside get the lady taken home at once do you hear now before you try to get hold of the man upstairs  oh there is a man upstairs scoffed the other openly well he shall be brought down in time to see the end of this  but sevrin beside himself took no heed of the tone  whos the imbecile meddler who sent you blundering here didnt you understand your instructions dont you know anything its incredible here  he dropped the lapels of the coat and plunging his hand into his breast jerked feverishly at something under his shirt at last he produced a small square pocket of soft leather which must have been hanging like a scapulary from his neck by the tape whose broken ends dangled from his fist  look inside he spluttered flinging it in the others face and instantly he turned round towards the girl she stood just behind him perfectly still and silent her set white face gave an illusion of placidity only her staring eyes seemed bigger and darker  he spoke rapidly with nervous assurance i heard him distinctly promise her to make everything as clear as daylight presently but that was all i caught he stood close to her never attempting to touch her even with the tip of his little fingerand she stared at him stupidly for a moment however her eyelids descended slowly pathetically and then with the long black eyelashes lying on her white cheeks she looked ready to fall down in a swoon but she never even swayed where she stood he urged her loudly to follow him at once and walked towards the door at the bottom of the cellar stairs without looking behind him and as a matter of fact she did move after him a pace or two but of course he was not allowed to reach the door there were angry exclamations a short fierce scuffle flung away violently he came flying backwards upon her and fell she threw out her arms in a gesture of dismay and stepped aside just clear of his head which struck the ground heavily near her shoe  he grunted with the shock by the time he had picked himself up slowly dazedly he was awake to the reality of things the man into whose hands he had thrust the leather case had extracted therefrom a narrow strip of bluish paper he held it up above his head and as after the scuffle an expectant uneasy stillness reigned once more he threw it down disdainfully with the words i think comrades that this proof was hardly necessary  quick as thought the girl stooped after the fluttering slip holding it spread out in both hands she looked at it then without raising her eyes opened her fingers slowly and let it fall  i examined that curious document afterwards it was signed by a very high personage and stamped and countersigned by other high officials in various countries of europe in his tradeor shall i say in his missionthat sort of talisman might have been necessary no doubt even to the police itselfall but the headshe had been known only as sevrin the noted anarchist  he hung his head biting his lower lip a change had come over him a sort of thoughtful absorbed calmness nevertheless he panted his sides worked visibly and his nostrils expanded and collapsed in weird contrast with his sombre aspect of a fanatical monk in a meditative attitude but with something too in his face of an actor intent upon the terrible exigencies of his part before him horne declaimed haggard and bearded like an inspired denunciatory prophet from a wilderness two fanatics they were made to understand each other does this surprise you i suppose you think that such people would be foaming at the mouth and snarling at each other  i protested hastily that i was not surprised in the least that i thought nothing of the kind that anarchists in general were simply inconceivable to me mentally morally logically sentimentally and even physically x received this declaration with his usual woodenness and went on  horne had burst out into eloquence while pouring out scornful invective he let tears escape from his eyes and roll down his black beard unheeded sevrin panted quicker and quicker when he opened his mouth to speak everyone hung on his words  dont be a fool horne he began you know very well that i have done this for none of the reasons you are throwing at me and in a moment he became outwardly as steady as a rock under the others lurid stare i have been thwarting deceiving and betraying youfrom conviction  he turned his back on horne and addressing the girl repeated the words from conviction  its extraordinary how cold she looked i suppose she could not think of any appropriate gesture there can have been few precedents indeed for such a situation  clear as daylight he added do you understand what that means from conviction  and still she did not stir she did not know what to do but the luckless wretch was about to give her the opportunity for a beautiful and correct gesture  i have felt in me the power to make you share this conviction he protested ardently he had forgotten himself he made a step towards herperhaps he stumbled to me he seemed to be stooping low as if to touch the hem of her garment and then the appropriate gesture came she snatched her skirt away from his polluting contact and averted her head with an upward tilt it was magnificently done this gesture of conventionally unstained honour of an unblemished highminded amateur  nothing could have been better and he seemed to think so too for once more he turned away but this time he faced no one he was again panting frightfully while he fumbled hurriedly in his waistcoat pocket and then raised his hand to his lips there was something furtive in this movement but directly afterwards his bearing changed his laboured breathing gave him a resemblance to a man who had just run a desperate race but a curious air of detachment of sudden and profound indifference replaced the strain of the striving effort the race was over i did not want to see what would happen next i was only too well aware i tucked the young ladys arm under mine without a word and made my way with her to the stairs  her brother walked behind us halfway up the short flight she seemed unable to lift her feet high enough for the steps and we had to pull and push to get her to the top in the passage she dragged herself along hanging on my arm helplessly bent like an old woman we issued into an empty street through a halfopen door staggering like besotted revellers at the corner we stopped a fourwheeler and the ancient driver looked round from his box with morose scorn at our efforts to get her in twice during the drive i felt her collapse on my shoulder in a half faint facing us the youth in knickerbockers remained as mute as a fish and till he jumped out with the latchkey sat more still than i would have believed it possible  at the door of their drawingroom she left my arm and walked in first catching at the chairs and tables she unpinned her hat then exhausted with the effort her cloak still hanging from her shoulders flung herself into a deep armchair sideways her face half buried in a cushion the good brother appeared silently before her with a glass of water she motioned it away he drank it himself and walked off to a distant cornerbehind the grand piano somewhere all was still in this room where i had seen for the first time sevrin the antianarchist captivated and spellbound by the consummate and hereditary grimaces that in a certain sphere of life take the place of feelings with an excellent effect i suppose her thoughts were busy with the same memory her shoulders shook violently a pure attack of nerves when it quieted down she affected firmness what is done to a man of that sort what will they do to him  nothing they can do nothing to him i assured her with perfect truth i was pretty certain he had died in less than twenty minutes from the moment his hand had gone to his lips for if his fanatical antianarchism went even as far as carrying poison in his pocket only to rob his adversaries of legitimate vengeance i knew he would take care to provide something that would not fail him when required  she drew an angry breath there were red spots on her cheeks and a feverish brilliance in her eyes  has ever any one been exposed to such a terrible experience to think that he had held my hand that man her face twitched she gulped down a pathetic sob if i ever felt sure of anything it was of sevrins highminded motives  then she began to weep quietly which was good for her then through her flood of tears half resentful what was it he said to mefrom conviction it seemed a vile mockery what could he mean by it  that my dear young lady i said gently is more than i or anybody else can ever explain to you  mr x flicked a crumb off the front of his coat  and that was strictly true as to her though horne for instance understood very well and so did i especially after we had been to sevrins lodging in a dismal back street of an intensely respectable quarter horne was known there as a friend and we had no difficulty in being admitted the slatternly maid merely remarking as she let us in that mr sevrin had not been home that night we forced open a couple of drawers in the way of duty and found a little useful information the most interesting part was his diary for this man engaged in such deadly work had the weakness to keep a record of the most damnatory kind there were his acts and also his thoughts laid bare to us but the dead dont mind that they dont mind anything  from conviction yes a vague but ardent humanitarianism had urged him in his first youth into the bitterest extremity of negation and revolt afterwards his optimism flinched he doubted and became lost you have heard of converted atheists these turn often into dangerous fanatics but the soul remains the same after he had got acquainted with the girl there are to be met in that diary of his very queer politicoamorous rhapsodies he took her sovereign grimaces with deadly seriousness he longed to convert her but all this cannot interest you for the rest i dont know if you rememberit is a good many years ago nowthe journalistic sensation of the hermione street mystery the finding of a mans body in the cellar of an empty house the inquest some arrests many surmisesthen silencethe usual end for many obscure martyrs and confessors the fact is he was not enough of an optimist you must be a savage tyrannical pitiless thickandthin optimist like horne for instance to make a good social rebel of the extreme type  he rose from the table a waiter hurried up with his overcoat another held his hat in readiness  but what became of the young lady i asked  do you really want to know he said buttoning himself in his fur coat carefully i confess to the small malice of sending her sevrins diary she went into retirement then she went to florence then she went into retreat in a convent i cant tell where she will go next what does it matter gestures gestures mere gestures of her class  he fitted on his glossy high hat with extreme precision and casting a rapid glance round the room full of welldressed people innocently dining muttered between his teeth  and nothing else that is why their kind is fated to perish  i never met mr x again after that evening i took to dining at my club on my next visit to paris i found my friend all impatience to hear of the effect produced on me by this rare item of his collection i told him all the story and he beamed on me with the pride of his distinguished specimen  isnt x well worth knowing he bubbled over in great delight hes unique amazing absolutely terrific  his enthusiasm grated upon my finer feelings i told him curtly that the mans cynicism was simply abominable  oh abominable abominable assented my friend effusively and then you know he likes to have his little joke sometimes he added in a confidential tone  i fail to understand the connection of this last remark i have been utterly unable to discover where in all this the joke comes in     an indignant tale   the brute   dodging in from the rainswept street i exchanged a smile and a glance with miss blank in the bar of the three crows this exchange was effected with extreme propriety it is a shock to think that if still alive miss blank must be something over sixty now how time passes  noticing my gaze directed inquiringly at the partition of glass and varnished wood miss blank was good enough to say encouragingly  only mr jermyn and mr stonor in the parlour with another gentleman ive never seen before  i moved towards the parlour door a voice discoursing on the other side it was but a matchboard partition rose so loudly that the concluding words became quite plain in all their atrocity  that fellow wilmot fairly dashed her brains out and a good job too  this inhuman sentiment since there was nothing profane or improper in it failed to do as much as to check the slight yawn miss blank was achieving behind her hand and she remained gazing fixedly at the windowpanes which streamed with rain  as i opened the parlour door the same voice went on in the same cruel strain  i was glad when i heard she got the knock from somebody at last sorry enough for poor wilmot though that man and i used to be chums at one time of course that was the end of him a clear case if there ever was one no way out of it none at all  the voice belonged to the gentleman miss blank had never seen before he straddled his long legs on the hearthrug jermyn leaning forward held his pockethandkerchief spread out before the grate he looked back dismally over his shoulder and as i slipped behind one of the little wooden tables i nodded to him on the other side of the fire imposingly calm and large sat mr stonor jammed tight into a capacious windsor armchair there was nothing small about him but his short white sidewhiskers yards and yards of extra superfine blue cloth made up into an overcoat reposed on a chair by his side and he must just have brought some liner from sea because another chair was smothered under his black waterproof ample as a pall and made of threefold oiled silk doublestitched throughout a mans handbag of the usual size looked like a childs toy on the floor near his feet  i did not nod to him he was too big to be nodded to in that parlour he was a senior trinity pilot and condescended to take his turn in the cutter only during the summer months he had been many times in charge of royal yachts in and out of port victoria besides its no use nodding to a monument and he was like one he didnt speak he didnt budge he just sat there holding his handsome old head up immovable and almost bigger than life it was extremely fine mr stonors presence reduced poor old jermyn to a mere shabby wisp of a man and made the talkative stranger in tweeds on the hearthrug look absurdly boyish the latter must have been a few years over thirty and was certainly not the sort of individual that gets abashed at the sound of his own voice because gathering me in as it were by a friendly glance he kept it going without a check  i was glad of it he repeated emphatically you may be surprised at it but then you havent gone through the experience ive had of her i can tell you it was something to remember of course i got off scot free myselfas you can see she did her best to break up my pluck for me tho she jolly near drove as fine a fellow as ever lived into a madhouse what do you say to thateh  not an eyelid twitched in mr stonors enormous face monumental the speaker looked straight into my eyes  it used to make me sick to think of her going about the world murdering people  jermyn approached the handkerchief a little nearer to the grate and groaned it was simply a habit he had  ive seen her once he declared with mournful indifference she had a house  the stranger in tweeds turned to stare down at him surprised  she had three houses he corrected authoritatively but jermyn was not to be contradicted  she had a house i say he repeated with dismal obstinacy a great big ugly white thing you could see it from miles awaysticking up  so you could assented the other readily it was old colchesters notion though he was always threatening to give her up he couldnt stand her racket any more he declared it was too much of a good thing for him he would wash his hands of her if he never got hold of anotherand so on i daresay he would have chucked her onlyit may surprise youhis missus wouldnt hear of it funny eh but with women you never know how they will take a thing and mrs colchester with her moustaches and big eyebrows set up for being as strongminded as they make them she used to walk about in a brown silk dress with a great gold cable flopping about her bosom you should have heard her snapping out rubbish or stuff and nonsense i daresay she knew when she was well off they had no children and had never set up a home anywhere when in england she just made shift to hang out anyhow in some cheap hotel or boardinghouse i daresay she liked to get back to the comforts she was used to she knew very well she couldnt gain by any change and moreover colchester though a firstrate man was not what you may call in his first youth and perhaps she may have thought that he wouldnt be able to get hold of another as he used to say so easily anyhow for one reason or another it was rubbish and stuff and nonsense for the good lady i overheard once young mr apse himself say to her confidentially i assure you mrs colchester i am beginning to feel quite unhappy about the name shes getting for herself oh says she with her deep little hoarse laugh if one took notice of all the silly talk and she showed apse all her ugly false teeth at once it would take more than that to make me lose my confidence in her i assure you says she  at this point without any change of facial expression mr stonor emitted a short sardonic laugh it was very impressive but i didnt see the fun i looked from one to another the stranger on the hearthrug had an ugly smile  and mr apse shook both mrs colchesters hands he was so pleased to hear a good word said for their favourite all these apses young and old you know were perfectly infatuated with that abominable dangerous  i beg your pardon i interrupted for he seemed to be addressing himself exclusively to me but who on earth are you talking about  i am talking of the apse family he answered courteously  i nearly let out a damn at this but just then the respected miss blank put her head in and said that the cab was at the door if mr stonor wanted to catch the eleven three up  at once the senior pilot arose in his mighty bulk and began to struggle into his coat with aweinspiring upheavals the stranger and i hurried impulsively to his assistance and directly we laid our hands on him he became perfectly quiescent we had to raise our arms very high and to make efforts it was like caparisoning a docile elephant with a thanks gentlemen he dived under and squeezed himself through the door in a great hurry  we smiled at each other in a friendly way  i wonder how he manages to hoist himself up a ships sideladder said the man in tweeds and poor jermyn who was a mere north sea pilot without official status or recognition of any sort pilot only by courtesy groaned  he makes eight hundred a year  are you a sailor i asked the stranger who had gone back to his position on the rug  i used to be till a couple of years ago when i got married answered this communicative individual i even went to sea first in that very ship we were speaking of when you came in  what ship i asked puzzled i never heard you mention a ship  ive just told you her name my dear sir he replied the apse family surely youve heard of the great firm of apse  sons shipowners they had a pretty big fleet there was the lucy apse and the harold apse and anne john malcolm clara juliet and so onno end of apses every brother sister aunt cousin wifeand grandmother too for all i knowof the firm had a ship named after them good solid oldfashioned craft they were too built to carry and to last none of your newfangled laboursaving appliances in them but plenty of men and plenty of good salt beef and hard tack put aboardand off you go to fight your way out and home again  the miserable jermyn made a sound of approval which sounded like a groan of pain those were the ships for him he pointed out in doleful tones that you couldnt say to laboursaving appliances jump lively now my hearties no laboursaving appliance would go aloft on a dirty night with the sands under your lee  no assented the stranger with a wink at me the apses didnt believe in them either apparently they treated their people wellas people dont get treated nowadays and they were awfully proud of their ships nothing ever happened to them this last one the apse family was to be like the others only she was to be still stronger still safer still more roomy and comfortable i believe they meant her to last for ever they had her built compositeiron teakwood and greenheart and her scantling was something fabulous if ever an order was given for a ship in a spirit of pride this one was everything of the best the commodore captain of the employ was to command her and they planned the accommodation for him like a house on shore under a big tall poop that went nearly to the mainmast no wonder mrs colchester wouldnt let the old man give her up why it was the best home she ever had in all her married days she had a nerve that woman  the fuss that was made while that ship was building lets have this a little stronger and that a little heavier and hadnt that other thing better be changed for something a little thicker the builders entered into the spirit of the game and there she was growing into the clumsiest heaviest ship of her size right before all their eyes without anybody becoming aware of it somehow she was to be 2000 tons register or a little over no less on any account but see what happens when they came to measure her she turned out 1999 tons and a fraction general consternation and they say old mr apse was so annoyed when they told him that he took to his bed and died the old gentleman had retired from the firm twentyfive years before and was ninetysix years old if a day so his death wasnt perhaps so surprising still mr lucian apse was convinced that his father would have lived to a hundred so we may put him at the head of the list next comes the poor devil of a shipwright that brute caught and squashed as she went off the ways they called it the launch of a ship but ive heard people say that from the wailing and yelling and scrambling out of the way it was more like letting a devil loose upon the river she snapped all her checks like packthread and went for the tugs in attendance like a fury before anybody could see what she was up to she sent one of them to the bottom and laid up another for three months repairs one of her cables parted and then suddenlyyou couldnt tell whyshe let herself be brought up with the other as quiet as a lamb  thats how she was you could never be sure what she would be up to next there are ships difficult to handle but generally you can depend on them behaving rationally with that ship whatever you did with her you never knew how it would end she was a wicked beast or perhaps she was only just insane  he uttered this supposition in so earnest a tone that i could not refrain from smiling he left off biting his lower lip to apostrophize me  eh why not why couldnt there be something in her build in her lines corresponding towhats madness only something just a tiny bit wrong in the make of your brain why shouldnt there be a mad shipi mean mad in a shiplike way so that under no circumstances could you be sure she would do what any other sensible ship would naturally do for you there are ships that steer wildly and ships that cant be quite trusted always to stay others want careful watching when running in a gale and again there may be a ship that will make heavy weather of it in every little blow but then you expect her to be always so you take it as part of her character as a ship just as you take account of a mans peculiarities of temper when you deal with him but with her you couldnt she was unaccountable if she wasnt mad then she was the most evilminded underhand savage brute that ever went afloat ive seen her run in a heavy gale beautifully for two days and on the third broach to twice in the same afternoon the first time she flung the helmsman clean over the wheel but as she didnt quite manage to kill him she had another try about three hours afterwards she swamped herself fore and aft burst all the canvas we had set scared all hands into a panic and even frightened mrs colchester down there in these beautiful stern cabins that she was so proud of when we mustered the crew there was one man missing swept overboard of course without being either seen or heard poor devil and i only wonder more of us didnt go  always something like that always i heard an old mate tell captain colchester once that it had come to this with him that he was afraid to open his mouth to give any sort of order she was as much of a terror in harbour as at sea you could never be certain what would hold her on the slightest provocation she would start snapping ropes cables wire hawsers like carrots she was heavy clumsy unhandybut that does not quite explain that power for mischief she had you know somehow when i think of her i cant help remembering what we hear of incurable lunatics breaking loose now and then  he looked at me inquisitively but of course i couldnt admit that a ship could be mad  in the ports where she was known he went on they dreaded the sight of her she thought nothing of knocking away twenty feet or so of solid stone facing off a quay or wiping off the end of a wooden wharf she must have lost miles of chain and hundreds of tons of anchors in her time when she fell aboard some poor unoffending ship it was the very devil of a job to haul her off again and she never got hurt herselfjust a few scratches or so perhaps they had wanted to have her strong and so she was strong enough to ram polar ice with and as she began so she went on from the day she was launched she never let a year pass without murdering somebody i think the owners got very worried about it but they were a stiffnecked generation all these apses they wouldnt admit there could be anything wrong with the apse family they wouldnt even change her name stuff and nonsense as mrs colchester used to say they ought at least to have shut her up for life in some dry dock or other away up the river and never let her smell salt water again i assure you my dear sir that she invariably did kill someone every voyage she made it was perfectly wellknown she got a name for it far and wide  i expressed my surprise that a ship with such a deadly reputation could ever get a crew  then you dont know what sailors are my dear sir let me just show you by an instance one day in dock at home while loafing on the forecastle head i noticed two respectable salts come along one a middleaged competent steady man evidently the other a smart youngish chap they read the name on the bows and stopped to look at her says the elder man apse family thats the sanguinary female dog im putting it in that way of a ship jack that kills a man every voyage i wouldnt sign in hernot for joe i wouldnt and the other says if she were mine id have her towed on the mud and set on fire blame if i wouldnt then the first man chimes in much do they care men are cheap god knows the younger one spat in the water alongside they wont have menot for double wages  they hung about for some time and then walked up the dock half an hour later i saw them both on our deck looking about for the mate and apparently very anxious to be taken on and they were  how do you account for this i asked  what would you say he retorted recklessness the vanity of boasting in the evening to all their chums weve just shipped in that there apse family blow her she aint going to scare us sheer sailorlike perversity a sort of curiosity wella little of all that no doubt i put the question to them in the course of the voyage the answer of the elderly chap was  a man can die but once the younger assured me in a mocking tone that he wanted to see how she would do it this time but i tell you what there was a sort of fascination about the brute  jermyn who seemed to have seen every ship in the world broke in sulkily  i saw her once out of this very window towing up the river a great black ugly thing going along like a big hearse  something sinister about her looks wasnt there said the man in tweeds looking down at old jermyn with a friendly eye i always had a sort of horror of her she gave me a beastly shock when i was no more than fourteen the very first daynay houri joined her father came up to see me off and was to go down to gravesend with us i was his second boy to go to sea my big brother was already an officer then we got on board about eleven in the morning and found the ship ready to drop out of the basin stern first she had not moved three times her own length when at a little pluck the tug gave her to enter the dock gates she made one of her rampaging starts and put such a weight on the check ropea new sixinch hawserthat forward there they had no chance to ease it round in time and it parted i saw the broken end fly up high in the air and the next moment that brute brought her quarter against the pierhead with a jar that staggered everybody about her decks she didnt hurt herself not she but one of the boys the mate had sent aloft on the mizzen to do something came down on the poopdeckthumpright in front of me he was not much older than myself we had been grinning at each other only a few minutes before he must have been handling himself carelessly not expecting to get such a jerk i heard his startled cryohin a high treble as he felt himself going and looked up in time to see him go limp all over as he fell ough poor father was remarkably white about the gills when we shook hands in gravesend are you all right he says looking hard at me yes father quite sure yes father well then goodbye my boy he told me afterwards that for half a word he would have carried me off home with him there and then i am the baby of the familyyou know added the man in tweeds stroking his moustache with an ingenuous smile  i acknowledged this interesting communication by a sympathetic murmur he waved his hand carelessly  this might have utterly spoiled a chaps nerve for going aloft you knowutterly he fell within two feet of me cracking his head on a mooringbitt never moved stone dead nice looking little fellow he was i had just been thinking we would be great chums however that wasnt yet the worst that brute of a ship could do i served in her three years of my time and then i got transferred to the lucy apse for a year the sailmaker we had in the apse family turned up there too and i remember him saying to me one evening after we had been a week at sea isnt she a meek little ship no wonder we thought the lucy apse a dear meek little ship after getting clear of that big rampaging savage brute it was like heaven her officers seemed to me the restfullest lot of men on earth to me who had known no ship but the apse family the lucy was like a sort of magic craft that did what you wanted her to do of her own accord one evening we got caught aback pretty sharply from right ahead in about ten minutes we had her full again sheets aft tacks down decks cleared and the officer of the watch leaning against the weather rail peacefully it seemed simply marvellous to me the other would have stuck for halfanhour in irons rolling her decks full of water knocking the men aboutspars cracking braces snapping yards taking charge and a confounded scare going on aft because of her beastly rudder which she had a way of flapping about fit to raise your hair on end i couldnt get over my wonder for days  well i finished my last year of apprenticeship in that jolly little shipshe wasnt so little either but after that other heavy devil she seemed but a plaything to handle i finished my time and passed and then just as i was thinking of having three weeks of real good time on shore i got at breakfast a letter asking me the earliest day i could be ready to join the apse family as third mate i gave my plate a shove that shot it into the middle of the table dad looked up over his paper mother raised her hands in astonishment and i went out bareheaded into our bit of garden where i walked round and round for an hour  when i came in again mother was out of the diningroom and dad had shifted berth into his big armchair the letter was lying on the mantelpiece  its very creditable to you to get the offer and very kind of them to make it he said and i see also that charles has been appointed chief mate of that ship for one voyage  there was over leaf a ps to that effect in mr apses own handwriting which i had overlooked charley was my big brother  i dont like very much to have two of my boys together in one ship father goes on in his deliberate solemn way and i may tell you that i would not mind writing mr apse a letter to that effect  dear old dad he was a wonderful father what would you have done the mere notion of going back and as an officer too to be worried and bothered and kept on the jump night and day by that brute made me feel sick but she wasnt a ship you could afford to fight shy of besides the most genuine excuse could not be given without mortally offending apse  sons the firm and i believe the whole family down to the old unmarried aunts in lancashire had grown desperately touchy about that accursed ships character this was the case for answering ready now from your very deathbed if you wished to die in their good graces and thats precisely what i did answerby wire to have it over and done with at once  the prospect of being shipmates with my big brother cheered me up considerably though it made me a bit anxious too ever since i remember myself as a little chap he had been very good to me and i looked upon him as the finest fellow in the world and so he was no better officer ever walked the deck of a merchant ship and thats a fact he was a fine strong upstanding suntanned young fellow with his brown hair curling a little and an eye like a hawk he was just splendid we hadnt seen each other for many years and even this time though he had been in england three weeks already he hadnt showed up at home yet but had spent his spare time in surrey somewhere making up to maggie colchester old captain colchesters niece her father a great friend of dads was in the sugarbroking business and charley made a sort of second home of their house i wondered what my big brother would think of me there was a sort of sternness about charleys face which never left it not even when he was larking in his rather wild fashion  he received me with a great shout of laughter he seemed to think my joining as an officer the greatest joke in the world there was a difference of ten years between us and i suppose he remembered me best in pinafores i was a kid of four when he first went to sea it surprised me to find how boisterous he could be  now we shall see what you are made of he cried and he held me off by the shoulders and punched my ribs and hustled me into his berth sit down ned i am glad of the chance of having you with me ill put the finishing touch to you my young officer providing youre worth the trouble and first of all get it well into your head that we are not going to let this brute kill anybody this voyage well stop her racket  i perceived he was in dead earnest about it he talked grimly of the ship and how we must be careful and never allow this ugly beast to catch us napping with any of her damned tricks  he gave me a regular lecture on special seamanship for the use of the apse family then changing his tone he began to talk at large rattling off the wildest funniest nonsense till my sides ached with laughing i could see very well he was a bit above himself with high spirits it couldnt be because of my coming not to that extent but of course i wouldnt have dreamt of asking what was the matter i had a proper respect for my big brother i can tell you but it was all made plain enough a day or two afterwards when i heard that miss maggie colchester was coming for the voyage uncle was giving her a seatrip for the benefit of her health  i dont know what could have been wrong with her health she had a beautiful colour and a deuce of a lot of fair hair she didnt care a rap for wind or rain or spray or sun or green seas or anything she was a blueeyed jolly girl of the very best sort but the way she cheeked my big brother used to frighten me i always expected it to end in an awful row however nothing decisive happened till after we had been in sydney for a week one day in the mens dinner hour charley sticks his head into my cabin i was stretched out on my back on the settee smoking in peace  come ashore with me ned he says in his curt way  i jumped up of course and away after him down the gangway and up george street he strode along like a giant and i at his elbow panting it was confoundedly hot where on earth are you rushing me to charley i made bold to ask  here he says  here was a jewellers shop i couldnt imagine what he could want there it seemed a sort of mad freak he thrusts under my nose three rings which looked very tiny on his big brown palm growling out  for maggie which  i got a kind of scare at this i couldnt make a sound but i pointed at the one that sparkled white and blue he put it in his waistcoat pocket paid for it with a lot of sovereigns and bolted out when we got on board i was quite out of breath shake hands old chap i gasped out he gave me a thump on the back give what orders you like to the boatswain when the hands turnto says he i am off duty this afternoon  then he vanished from the deck for a while but presently he came out of the cabin with maggie and these two went over the gangway publicly before all hands going for a walk together on that awful blazing hot day with clouds of dust flying about they came back after a few hours looking very staid but didnt seem to have the slightest idea where they had been anyway thats the answer they both made to mrs colchesters question at teatime  and didnt she turn on charley with her voice like an old night cabmans rubbish dont know where youve been stuff and nonsense youve walked the girl off her legs dont do it again  its surprising how meek charley could be with that old woman only on one occasion he whispered to me im jolly glad she isnt maggies aunt except by marriage thats no sort of relationship but i think he let maggie have too much of her own way she was hopping all over that ship in her yachting skirt and a red tam o shanter like a bright bird on a dead black tree the old salts used to grin to themselves when they saw her coming along and offered to teach her knots or splices i believe she liked the men for charleys sake i suppose  as you may imagine the fiendish propensities of that cursed ship were never spoken of on board not in the cabin at any rate only once on the homeward passage charley said incautiously something about bringing all her crew home this time captain colchester began to look uncomfortable at once and that silly hardbitten old woman flew out at charley as though he had said something indecent i was quite confounded myself as to maggie she sat completely mystified opening her blue eyes very wide of course before she was a day older she wormed it all out of me she was a very difficult person to lie to  how awful she said quite solemn so many poor fellows i am glad the voyage is nearly over i wont have a moments peace about charley now  i assured her charley was all right it took more than that ship knew to get over a seaman like charley and she agreed with me  next day we got the tug off dungeness and when the towrope was fast charley rubbed his hands and said to me in an undertone  weve baffled her ned  looks like it i said with a grin at him it was beautiful weather and the sea as smooth as a millpond we went up the river without a shadow of trouble except once when off hole haven the brute took a sudden sheer and nearly had a barge anchored just clear of the fairway but i was aft looking after the steering and she did not catch me napping that time charley came up on the poop looking very concerned close shave says he  never mind charley i answered cheerily youve tamed her  we were to tow right up to the dock the river pilot boarded us below gravesend and the first words i heard him say were you may just as well take your port anchor inboard at once mr mate  this had been done when i went forward i saw maggie on the forecastle head enjoying the bustle and i begged her to go aft but she took no notice of me of course then charley who was very busy with the head gear caught sight of her and shouted in his biggest voice get off the forecastle head maggie youre in the way here for all answer she made a funny face at him and i saw poor charley turn away hiding a smile she was flushed with the excitement of getting home again and her blue eyes seemed to snap electric sparks as she looked at the river a collier brig had gone round just ahead of us and our tug had to stop her engines in a hurry to avoid running into her  in a moment as is usually the case all the shipping in the reach seemed to get into a hopeless tangle a schooner and a ketch got up a small collision all to themselves right in the middle of the river it was exciting to watch and meantime our tug remained stopped any other ship than that brute could have been coaxed to keep straight for a couple of minutesbut not she her head fell off at once and she began to drift down taking her tug along with her i noticed a cluster of coasters at anchor within a quarter of a mile of us and i thought i had better speak to the pilot if you let her get amongst that lot i said quietly she will grind some of them to bits before we get her out again  dont i know her cries he stamping his foot in a perfect fury and he out with his whistle to make that bothered tug get the ships head up again as quick as possible he blew like mad waving his arm to port and presently we could see that the tugs engines had been set going ahead her paddles churned the water but it was as if she had been trying to tow a rockshe couldnt get an inch out of that ship again the pilot blew his whistle and waved his arm to port we could see the tugs paddles turning faster and faster away broad on our bow  for a moment tug and ship hung motionless in a crowd of moving shipping and then the terrific strain that evil stonyhearted brute would always put on everything tore the towingchock clean out the towrope surged over snapping the iron stanchions of the headrail one after another as if they had been sticks of sealingwax it was only then i noticed that in order to have a better view over our heads maggie had stepped upon the port anchor as it lay flat on the forecastle deck  it had been lowered properly into its hardwood beds but there had been no time to take a turn with it anyway it was quite secure as it was for going into dock but i could see directly that the towrope would sweep under the fluke in another second my heart flew up right into my throat but not before i had time to yell out jump clear of that anchor  but i hadnt time to shriek out her name i dont suppose she heard me at all the first touch of the hawser against the fluke threw her down she was up on her feet again quick as lightning but she was up on the wrong side i heard a horrid scraping sound and then that anchor tipping over rose up like something alive its great rough iron arm caught maggie round the waist seemed to clasp her close with a dreadful hug and flung itself with her over and down in a terrific clang of iron followed by heavy ringing blows that shook the ship from stem to sternbecause the ring stopper held  how horrible i exclaimed  i used to dream for years afterwards of anchors catching hold of girls said the man in tweeds a little wildly he shuddered with a most pitiful howl charley was over after her almost on the instant but lord he didnt see as much as a gleam of her red tam o shanter in the water nothing nothing whatever in a moment there were halfadozen boats around us and he got pulled into one i with the boatswain and the carpenter let go the other anchor in a hurry and brought the ship up somehow the pilot had gone silly he walked up and down the forecastle head wringing his hands and muttering to himself killing women now killing women now not another word could you get out of him  dusk fell then a night black as pitch and peering upon the river i heard a low mournful hail ship ahoy two gravesend watermen came alongside they had a lantern in their wherry and looked up the ships side holding on to the ladder without a word i saw in the patch of light a lot of loose fair hair down there  he shuddered again  after the tide turned poor maggies body had floated clear of one of them big mooring buoys he explained i crept aft feeling halfdead and managed to send a rocket upto let the other searchers know on the river and then i slunk away forward like a cur and spent the night sitting on the heel of the bowsprit so as to be as far as possible out of charleys way  poor fellow i murmured  yes poor fellow he repeated musingly that brute wouldnt let himnot even himcheat her of her prey but he made her fast in dock next morning he did we hadnt exchanged a wordnot a single look for that matter i didnt want to look at him when the last rope was fast he put his hands to his head and stood gazing down at his feet as if trying to remember something the men waited on the main deck for the words that end the voyage perhaps that is what he was trying to remember i spoke for him thatll do men  i never saw a crew leave a ship so quietly they sneaked over the rail one after another taking care not to bang their sea chests too heavily they looked our way but not one had the stomach to come up and offer to shake hands with the mate as is usual  i followed him all over the empty ship to and fro here and there with no living soul about but the two of us because the old shipkeeper had locked himself up in the galleyboth doors suddenly poor charley mutters in a crazy voice im done here and strides down the gangway with me at his heels up the dock out at the gate on towards tower hill he used to take rooms with a decent old landlady in america square to be near his work  all at once he stops short turns round and comes back straight at me ned says he i am going home i had the good luck to sight a fourwheeler and got him in just in time his legs were beginning to give way in our hall he fell down on a chair and ill never forget fathers and mothers amazed perfectly still faces as they stood over him they couldnt understand what had happened to him till i blubbered out maggie got drowned yesterday in the river  mother let out a little cry father looks from him to me and from me to him as if comparing our facesfor upon my soul charley did not resemble himself at all nobody moved and the poor fellow raises his big brown hands slowly to his throat and with one single tug rips everything opencollar shirt waistcoata perfect wreck and ruin of a man father and i got him upstairs somehow and mother pretty nearly killed herself nursing him through a brain fever  the man in tweeds nodded at me significantly  ah there was nothing that could be done with that brute she had a devil in her  wheres your brother i asked expecting to hear he was dead but he was commanding a smart steamer on the china coast and never came home now  jermyn fetched a heavy sigh and the handkerchief being now sufficiently dry put it up tenderly to his red and lamentable nose  she was a ravening beast the man in tweeds started again old colchester put his foot down and resigned and would you believe it apse  sons wrote to ask whether he wouldnt reconsider his decision anything to save the good name of the apse family old colchester went to the office then and said that he would take charge again but only to sail her out into the north sea and scuttle her there he was nearly off his chump he used to be darkish irongrey but his hair went snowwhite in a fortnight and mr lucian apse they had known each other as young men pretended not to notice it eh heres infatuation if you like heres pride for you  they jumped at the first man they could get to take her for fear of the scandal of the apse family not being able to find a skipper he was a festive soul i believe but he stuck to her grim and hard wilmot was his second mate a harumscarum fellow and pretending to a great scorn for all the girls the fact is he was really timid but let only one of them do as much as lift her little finger in encouragement and there was nothing that could hold the beggar as apprentice once he deserted abroad after a petticoat and would have gone to the dogs then if his skipper hadnt taken the trouble to find him and lug him by the ears out of some house of perdition or other  it was said that one of the firm had been heard once to express a hope that this brute of a ship would get lost soon i can hardly credit the tale unless it might have been mr alfred apse whom the family didnt think much of they had him in the office but he was considered a bad egg altogether always flying off to race meetings and coming home drunk you would have thought that a ship so full of deadly tricks would run herself ashore some day out of sheer cussedness but not she she was going to last for ever she had a nose to keep off the bottom  jermyn made a grunt of approval  a ship after a pilots own heart eh jeered the man in tweeds well wilmot managed it he was the man for it but even he perhaps couldnt have done the trick without the greeneyed governess or nurse or whatever she was to the children of mr and mrs pamphilius  those people were passengers in her from port adelaide to the cape well the ship went out and anchored outside for the day the skipperhospitable soulhad a lot of guests from town to a farewell lunchas usual with him it was five in the evening before the last shore boat left the side and the weather looked ugly and dark in the gulf there was no reason for him to get under way however as he had told everybody he was going that day he imagined it was proper to do so anyhow but as he had no mind after all these festivities to tackle the straits in the dark with a scant wind he gave orders to keep the ship under lower topsails and foresail as close as she would lie dodging along the land till the morning then he sought his virtuous couch the mate was on deck having his face washed very clean with hard rain squalls wilmot relieved him at midnight  the apse family had as you observed a house on her poop     a big ugly white thing sticking up jermyn murmured sadly at the fire  thats it a companion for the cabin stairs and a sort of chartroom combined the rain drove in gusts on the sleepy wilmot the ship was then surging slowly to the southward close hauled with the coast within three miles or so to windward there was nothing to look out for in that part of the gulf and wilmot went round to dodge the squalls under the lee of that chartroom whose door on that side was open the night was black like a barrel of coaltar and then he heard a womans voice whispering to him  that confounded greeneyed girl of the pamphilius people had put the kids to bed a long time ago of course but it seems couldnt get to sleep herself she heard eight bells struck and the chief mate come below to turn in she waited a bit then got into her dressinggown and stole across the empty saloon and up the stairs into the chartroom she sat down on the settee near the open door to cool herself i daresay  i suppose when she whispered to wilmot it was as if somebody had struck a match in the fellows brain i dont know how it was they had got so very thick i fancy he had met her ashore a few times before i couldnt make it out because when telling the story wilmot would break off to swear something awful at every second word we had met on the quay in sydney and he had an apron of sacking up to his chin a big whip in his hand a wagondriver glad to do anything not to starve thats what he had come down to  however there he was with his head inside the door on the girls shoulder as likely as notofficer of the watch the helmsman on giving his evidence afterwards said that he shouted several times that the binnacle lamp had gone out it didnt matter to him because his orders were to sail her close i thought it funny he said that the ship should keep on falling off in squalls but i luffed her up every time as close as i was able it was so dark i couldnt see my hand before my face and the rain came in bucketfuls on my head  the truth was that at every squall the wind hauled aft a little till gradually the ship came to be heading straight for the coast without a single soul in her being aware of it wilmot himself confessed that he had not been near the standard compass for an hour he might well have confessed the first thing he knew was the man on the lookout shouting blue murder forward there  he tore his neck free he says and yelled back at him what do you say  i think i hear breakers ahead sir howled the man and came rushing aft with the rest of the watch in the awfullest blinding deluge that ever fell from the sky wilmot says for a second or so he was so scared and bewildered that he could not remember on which side of the gulf the ship was he wasnt a good officer but he was a seaman all the same he pulled himself together in a second and the right orders sprang to his lips without thinking they were to hard up with the helm and shiver the main and mizzentopsails  it seems that the sails actually fluttered he couldnt see them but he heard them rattling and banging above his head no use she was too slow in going off he went on his dirty face twitching and the damnd carters whip shaking in his hand she seemed to stick fast and then the flutter of the canvas above his head ceased at this critical moment the wind hauled aft again with a gust filling the sails and sending the ship with a great way upon the rocks on her lee bow she had overreached herself in her last little game her time had comethe hour the man the black night the treacherous gust of windthe right woman to put an end to her the brute deserved nothing better strange are the instruments of providence theres a sort of poetical justice  the man in tweeds looked hard at me  the first ledge she went over stripped the false keel off her rip the skipper rushing out of his berth found a crazy woman in a red flannel dressinggown flying round and round the cuddy screeching like a cockatoo  the next bump knocked her clean under the cabin table it also started the sternpost and carried away the rudder and then that brute ran up a shelving rocky shore tearing her bottom out till she stopped short and the foremast dropped over the bows like a gangway  anybody lost i asked  no one unless that fellow wilmot answered the gentleman unknown to miss blank looking round for his cap and his case was worse than drowning for a man everybody got ashore all right gale didnt come on till next day dead from the west and broke up that brute in a surprisingly short time it was as though she had been rotten at heart    he changed his tone rain left off i must get my bike and rush home to dinner i live in herne baycame out for a spin this morning  he nodded at me in a friendly way and went out with a swagger  do you know who he is jermyn i asked  the north sea pilot shook his head dismally fancy losing a ship in that silly fashion oh dear oh dear he groaned in lugubrious tones spreading his damp handkerchief again like a curtain before the glowing grate  on going out i exchanged a glance and a smile strictly proper with the respectable miss blank barmaid of the three crows      a desperate tale    an anarchist  that year i spent the best two months of the dry season on one of the estatesin fact on the principal cattle estateof a famous meatextract manufacturing company  bos bos you have seen the three magic letters on the advertisement pages of magazines and newspapers in the windows of provision merchants and on calendars for next year you receive by post in the month of november they scatter pamphlets also written in a sickly enthusiastic style and in several languages giving statistics of slaughter and bloodshed enough to make a turk turn faint the art illustrating that literature represents in vivid and shining colours a large and enraged black bull stamping upon a yellow snake writhing in emeraldgreen grass with a cobaltblue sky for a background it is atrocious and it is an allegory the snake symbolizes disease weaknessperhaps mere hunger which last is the chronic disease of the majority of mankind of course everybody knows the b o s ltd with its unrivalled products vinobos jellybos and the latest unequalled perfection tribos whose nourishment is offered to you not only highly concentrated but already half digested such apparently is the love that limited company bears to its fellowmeneven as the love of the father and mother penguin for their hungry fledglings  of course the capital of a country must be productively employed i have nothing to say against the company but being myself animated by feelings of affection towards my fellowmen i am saddened by the modern system of advertising whatever evidence it offers of enterprise ingenuity impudence and resource in certain individuals it proves to my mind the wide prevalence of that form of mental degradation which is called gullibility  in various parts of the civilized and uncivilized world i have had to swallow b o s with more or less benefit to myself though without great pleasure prepared with hot water and abundantly peppered to bring out the taste this extract is not really unpalatable but i have never swallowed its advertisements perhaps they have not gone far enough as far as i can remember they make no promise of everlasting youth to the users of b o s nor yet have they claimed the power of raising the dead for their estimable products why this austere reserve i wonder but i dont think they would have had me even on these terms whatever form of mental degradation i may being but human be suffering from it is not the popular form i am not gullible  i have been at some pains to bring out distinctly this statement about myself in view of the story which follows i have checked the facts as far as possible i have turned up the files of french newspapers and i have also talked with the officer who commands the military guard on the ile royale when in the course of my travels i reached cayenne i believe the story to be in the main true it is the sort of story that no man i think would ever invent about himself for it is neither grandiose nor flattering nor yet funny enough to gratify a perverted vanity  it concerns the engineer of the steamlaunch belonging to the maranon cattle estate of the b o s co ltd this estate is also an islandan island as big as a small province lying in the estuary of a great south american river it is wild and not beautiful but the grass growing on its low plains seems to possess exceptionally nourishing and flavouring qualities it resounds with the lowing of innumerable herdsa deep and distressing sound under the open sky rising like a monstrous protest of prisoners condemned to death on the mainland across twenty miles of discoloured muddy water there stands a city whose name let us say is horta  but the most interesting characteristic of this island which seems like a sort of penal settlement for condemned cattle consists in its being the only known habitat of an extremely rare and gorgeous butterfly the species is even more rare than it is beautiful which is not saying little i have already alluded to my travels i travelled at that time but strictly for myself and with a moderation unknown in our days of roundtheworld tickets i even travelled with a purpose as a matter of fact i amha ha haa desperate butterflyslayer ha ha ha  this was the tone in which mr harry gee the manager of the cattle station alluded to my pursuits he seemed to consider me the greatest absurdity in the world on the other hand the b o s co ltd represented to him the acme of the nineteenth centurys achievement i believe that he slept in his leggings and spurs his days he spent in the saddle flying over the plains followed by a train of halfwild horsemen who called him don enrique and who had no definite idea of the b o s co ltd which paid their wages he was an excellent manager but i dont see why when we met at meals he should have thumped me on the back with loud derisive inquiries hows the deadly sport today butterflies going strong ha ha haespecially as he charged me two dollars per diem for the hospitality of the b o s co ltd capital l1500000 fully paid up in whose balancesheet for that year those monies are no doubt included i dont think i can make it anything less in justice to my company he had remarked with extreme gravity when i was arranging with him the terms of my stay on the island  his chaff would have been harmless enough if intimacy of intercourse in the absence of all friendly feeling were not a thing detestable in itself moreover his facetiousness was not very amusing it consisted in the wearisome repetition of descriptive phrases applied to people with a burst of laughter desperate butterflyslayer ha ha ha was one sample of his peculiar wit which he himself enjoyed so much and in the same vein of exquisite humour he called my attention to the engineer of the steamlaunch one day as we strolled on the path by the side of the creek  the mans head and shoulders emerged above the deck over which were scattered various tools of his trade and a few pieces of machinery he was doing some repairs to the engines at the sound of our footsteps he raised anxiously a grimy face with a pointed chin and a tiny fair moustache what could be seen of his delicate features under the black smudges appeared to me wasted and livid in the greenish shade of the enormous tree spreading its foliage over the launch moored close to the bank  to my great surprise harry gee addressed him as crocodile in that halfjeering halfbullying tone which is characteristic of selfsatisfaction in his delectable kind  how does the work get on crocodile  i should have said before that the amiable harry had picked up french of a sort somewherein some colony or otherand that he pronounced it with a disagreeable forced precision as though he meant to guy the language the man in the launch answered him quickly in a pleasant voice his eyes had a liquid softness and his teeth flashed dazzlingly white between his thin drooping lips the manager turned to me very cheerful and loud explaining  i call him crocodile because he lives half in half out of the creek amphibioussee theres nothing else amphibious living on the island except crocodiles so he must belong to the specieseh but in reality hes nothing less than un citoyen anarchiste de barcelone  a citizen anarchist from barcelona i repeated stupidly looking down at the man he had turned to his work in the enginewell of the launch and presented his bowed back to us in that attitude i heard him protest very audibly  i do not even know spanish  hey what you dare to deny you come from over there the accomplished manager was down on him truculently  at this the man straightened himself up dropping a spanner he had been using and faced us but he trembled in all his limbs  i deny nothing nothing nothing he said excitedly  he picked up the spanner and went to work again without paying any further attention to us after looking at him for a minute or so we went away  is he really an anarchist i asked when out of earshot  i dont care a hang what he is answered the humorous official of the b o s co i gave him the name because it suited me to label him in that way its good for the company  for the company i exclaimed stopping short  aha he triumphed tilting up his hairless pug face and straddling his thin long legs that surprises you i am bound to do my best for my company they have enormous expenses whyour agent in horta tells me they spend fifty thousand pounds every year in advertising all over the world one cant be too economical in working the show well just you listen when i took charge here the estate had no steamlaunch i asked for one and kept on asking by every mail till i got it but the man they sent out with it chucked his job at the end of two months leaving the launch moored at the pontoon in horta got a better screw at a sawmill up the riverblast him and ever since it has been the same thing any scotch or yankee vagabond that likes to call himself a mechanic out here gets eighteen pounds a month and the next you know hes cleared out after smashing something as likely as not i give you my word that some of the objects ive had for enginedrivers couldnt tell the boiler from the funnel but this fellow understands his trade and i dont mean him to clear out see  and he struck me lightly on the chest for emphasis disregarding his peculiarities of manner i wanted to know what all this had to do with the man being an anarchist  come jeered the manager if you saw suddenly a barefooted unkempt chap slinking amongst the bushes on the sea face of the island and at the same time observed less than a mile from the beach a small schooner full of niggers hauling off in a hurry you wouldnt think the man fell there from the sky would you and it could be nothing else but either that or cayenne ive got my wits about me directly i sighted this queer game i said to myselfescaped convict i was as certain of it as i am of seeing you standing here this minute so i spurred on straight at him he stood his ground for a bit on a sand hillock crying out monsieur monsieur arretez then at the last moment broke and ran for life says i to myself ill tame you before im done with you so without a single word i kept on heading him off here and there i rounded him up towards the shore and at last i had him corralled on a spit his heels in the water and nothing but sea and sky at his back with my horse pawing the sand and shaking his head within a yard of him  he folded his arms on his breast then and stuck his chin up in a sort of desperate way but i wasnt to be impressed by the beggars posturing  says i youre a runaway convict  when he heard french his chin went down and his face changed  i deny nothing says he panting yet for i had kept him skipping about in front of my horse pretty smartly i asked him what he was doing there he had got his breath by then and explained that he had meant to make his way to a farm which he understood from the schooners people i suppose was to be found in the neighbourhood at that i laughed aloud and he got uneasy had he been deceived was there no farm within walking distance  i laughed more and more he was on foot and of course the first bunch of cattle he came across would have stamped him to rags under their hoofs a dismounted man caught on the feedinggrounds hasnt got the ghost of a chance  my coming upon you like this has certainly saved your life i said he remarked that perhaps it was so but that for his part he had imagined i had wanted to kill him under the hoofs of my horse i assured him that nothing would have been easier had i meant it and then we came to a sort of dead stop for the life of me i didnt know what to do with this convict unless i chucked him into the sea it occurred to me to ask him what he had been transported for he hung his head  what is it says i theft murder rape or what i wanted to hear what he would have to say for himself though of course i expected it would be some sort of lie but all he said was  make it what you like i deny nothing it is no good denying anything  i looked him over carefully and a thought struck me  theyve got anarchists there too i said perhaps youre one of them  i deny nothing whatever monsieur he repeats  this answer made me think that perhaps he was not an anarchist i believe those damned lunatics are rather proud of themselves if he had been one he would have probably confessed straight out  what were you before you became a convict  ouvrier he says and a good workman too  at that i began to think he must be an anarchist after all thats the class they come mostly from isnt it i hate the cowardly bombthrowing brutes i almost made up my mind to turn my horse short round and leave him to starve or drown where he was whichever he liked best as to crossing the island to bother me again the cattle would see to that i dont know what induced me to ask  what sort of workman  i didnt care a hang whether he answered me or not but when he said at once mecanicien monsieur i nearly jumped out of the saddle with excitement the launch had been lying disabled and idle in the creek for three weeks my duty to the company was clear he noticed my start too and there we were for a minute or so staring at each other as if bewitched  get up on my horse behind me i told him you shall put my steamlaunch to rights   these are the words in which the worthy manager of the maranon estate related to me the coming of the supposed anarchist he meant to keep himout of a sense of duty to the companyand the name he had given him would prevent the fellow from obtaining employment anywhere in horta the vaqueros of the estate when they went on leave spread it all over the town they did not know what an anarchist was nor yet what barcelona meant they called him anarchisto de barcelona as if it were his christian name and surname but the people in town had been reading in their papers about the anarchists in europe and were very much impressed over the jocular addition of de barcelona mr harry gee chuckled with immense satisfaction that breed is particularly murderous isnt it it makes the sawmills crowd still more afraid of having anything to do with himsee he exulted candidly i hold him by that name better than if i had him chained up by the leg to the deck of the steamlaunch  and mark he added after a pause he does not deny it i am not wronging him in any way he is a convict of some sort anyhow  but i suppose you pay him some wages dont you i asked  wages what does he want with money here he gets his food from my kitchen and his clothing from the store of course ill give him something at the end of the year but you dont think id employ a convict and give him the same money i would give an honest man i am looking after the interests of my company first and last  i admitted that for a company spending fifty thousand pounds every year in advertising the strictest economy was obviously necessary the manager of the maranon estancia grunted approvingly  and ill tell you what he continued if i were certain hes an anarchist and he had the cheek to ask me for money i would give him the toe of my boot however let him have the benefit of the doubt i am perfectly willing to take it that he has done nothing worse than to stick a knife into somebodywith extenuating circumstancesfrench fashion dont you know but that subversive sanguinary rot of doing away with all law and order in the world makes my blood boil its simply cutting the ground from under the feet of every decent respectable hardworking person i tell you that the consciences of people who have them like you or i must be protected in some way or else the first low scoundrel that came along would in every respect be just as good as myself wouldnt he now and thats absurd  he glared at me i nodded slightly and murmured that doubtless there was much subtle truth in his view   the principal truth discoverable in the views of paul the engineer was that a little thing may bring about the undoing of a man  il ne faut pas beaucoup pour perdre un homme he said to me thoughtfully one evening  i report this reflection in french since the man was of paris not of barcelona at all at the maranon he lived apart from the station in a small shed with a metal roof and straw walls which he called mon atelier he had a workbench there they had given him several horseblankets and a saddlenot that he ever had occasion to ride but because no other bedding was used by the workinghands who were all vaqueroscattlemen and on this horsemans gear like a son of the plains he used to sleep amongst the tools of his trade in a litter of rusty scrapiron with a portable forge at his head under the workbench sustaining his grimy mosquitonet  now and then i would bring him a few candle ends saved from the scant supply of the managers house he was very thankful for these he did not like to lie awake in the dark he confessed he complained that sleep fled from him le sommeil me fuit he declared with his habitual air of subdued stoicism which made him sympathetic and touching i made it clear to him that i did not attach undue importance to the fact of his having been a convict  thus it came about that one evening he was led to talk about himself as one of the bits of candle on the edge of the bench burned down to the end he hastened to light another  he had done his military service in a provincial garrison and returned to paris to follow his trade it was a wellpaid one he told me with some pride that in a short time he was earning no less than ten francs a day he was thinking of setting up for himself by and by and of getting married  here he sighed deeply and paused then with a return to his stoical note  it seems i did not know enough about myself  on his twentyfifth birthday two of his friends in the repairing shop where he worked proposed to stand him a dinner he was immensely touched by this attention  i was a steady man he remarked but i am not less sociable than any other body  the entertainment came off in a little cafe on the boulevard de la chapelle at dinner they drank some special wine it was excellent everything was excellent and the worldin his own wordsseemed a very good place to live in he had good prospects some little money laid by and the affection of two excellent friends he offered to pay for all the drinks after dinner which was only proper on his part  they drank more wine they drank liqueurs cognac beer then more liqueurs and more cognac two strangers sitting at the next table looked at him he said with so much friendliness that he invited them to join the party  he had never drunk so much in his life his elation was extreme and so pleasurable that whenever it flagged he hastened to order more drinks  it seemed to me he said in his quiet tone and looking on the ground in the gloomy shed full of shadows that i was on the point of just attaining a great and wonderful felicity another drink i felt would do it the others were holding out well with me glass for glass  but an extraordinary thing happened at something the strangers said his elation fell gloomy ideasdes idees noiresrushed into his head all the world outside the cafe appeared to him as a dismal evil place where a multitude of poor wretches had to work and slave to the sole end that a few individuals should ride in carriages and live riotously in palaces he became ashamed of his happiness the pity of mankinds cruel lot wrung his heart in a voice choked with sorrow he tried to express these sentiments he thinks he wept and swore in turns  the two new acquaintances hastened to applaud his humane indignation yes the amount of injustice in the world was indeed scandalous there was only one way of dealing with the rotten state of society demolish the whole sacree boutique blow up the whole iniquitous show  their heads hovered over the table they whispered to him eloquently i dont think they quite expected the result he was extremely drunkmad drunk with a howl of rage he leaped suddenly upon the table kicking over the bottles and glasses he yelled vive lanarchie death to the capitalists he yelled this again and again all round him broken glass was falling chairs were being swung in the air people were taking each other by the throat the police dashed in he hit bit scratched and struggled till something crashed down upon his head     he came to himself in a police cell locked up on a charge of assault seditious cries and anarchist propaganda  he looked at me fixedly with his liquid shining eyes that seemed very big in the dim light  that was bad but even then i might have got off somehow perhaps he said slowly  i doubt it but whatever chance he had was done away with by a young socialist lawyer who volunteered to undertake his defence in vain he assured him that he was no anarchist that he was a quiet respectable mechanic only too anxious to work ten hours per day at his trade he was represented at the trial as the victim of society and his drunken shoutings as the expression of infinite suffering the young lawyer had his way to make and this case was just what he wanted for a start the speech for the defence was pronounced magnificent  the poor fellow paused swallowed and brought out the statement  i got the maximum penalty applicable to a first offence  i made an appropriate murmur he hung his head and folded his arms  when they let me out of prison he began gently i made tracks of course for my old workshop my patron had a particular liking for me before but when he saw me he turned green with fright and showed me the door with a shaking hand  while he stood in the street uneasy and disconcerted he was accosted by a middleaged man who introduced himself as an engineers fitter too i know who you are he said i have attended your trial you are a good comrade and your ideas are sound but the devil of it is that you wont be able to get work anywhere now these bourgeoisll conspire to starve you thats their way expect no mercy from the rich  to be spoken to so kindly in the street had comforted him very much his seemed to be the sort of nature needing support and sympathy the idea of not being able to find work had knocked him over completely if his patron who knew him so well for a quiet orderly competent workman would have nothing to do with him nowthen surely nobody else would that was clear the police keeping their eye on him would hasten to warn every employer inclined to give him a chance he felt suddenly very helpless alarmed and idle and he followed the middleaged man to the estaminet round the corner where he met some other good companions they assured him that he would not be allowed to starve work or no work they had drinks all round to the discomfiture of all employers of labour and to the destruction of society  he sat biting his lower lip  that is monsieur how i became a compagnon he said the hand he passed over his forehead was trembling all the same theres something wrong in a world where a man can get lost for a glass more or less  he never looked up though i could see he was getting excited under his dejection he slapped the bench with his open palm  no he cried it was an impossible existence watched by the police watched by the comrades i did not belong to myself any more why i could not even go to draw a few francs from my savingsbank without a comrade hanging about the door to see that i didnt bolt and most of them were neither more nor less than housebreakers the intelligent i mean they robbed the rich they were only getting back their own they said when i had had some drink i believed them there were also the fools and the mad des exaltesquoi when i was drunk i loved them when i got more drink i was angry with the world that was the best time i found refuge from misery in rage but one cant be always drunknestce pas monsieur and when i was sober i was afraid to break away they would have stuck me like a pig  he folded his arms again and raised his sharp chin with a bitter smile  by and by they told me it was time to go to work the work was to rob a bank afterwards a bomb would be thrown to wreck the place my beginners part would be to keep watch in a street at the back and to take care of a black bag with the bomb inside till it was wanted after the meeting at which the affair was arranged a trusty comrade did not leave me an inch i had not dared to protest i was afraid of being done away with quietly in that room only as we were walking together i wondered whether it would not be better for me to throw myself suddenly into the seine but while i was turning it over in my mind we had crossed the bridge and afterwards i had not the opportunity  in the light of the candle end with his sharp features fluffy little moustache and oval face he looked at times delicately and gaily young and then appeared quite old decrepit full of sorrow pressing his folded arms to his breast  as he remained silent i felt bound to ask  well and how did it end  deportation to cayenne he answered  he seemed to think that somebody had given the plot away as he was keeping watch in the back street bag in hand he was set upon by the police these imbeciles had knocked him down without noticing what he had in his hand he wondered how the bomb failed to explode as he fell but it didnt explode  i tried to tell my story in court he continued the president was amused there were in the audience some idiots who laughed  i expressed the hope that some of his companions had been caught too he shuddered slightly before he told me that there were twosimon called also biscuit the middleaged fitter who spoke to him in the street and a fellow of the name of mafile one of the sympathetic strangers who had applauded his sentiments and consoled his humanitarian sorrows when he got drunk in the cafe  yes he went on with an effort i had the advantage of their company over there on st josephs island amongst some eighty or ninety other convicts we were all classed as dangerous  st josephs island is the prettiest of the iles de salut it is rocky and green with shallow ravines bushes thickets groves of mangotrees and many feathery palms six warders armed with revolvers and carbines are in charge of the convicts kept there  an eightoared galley keeps up the communication in the daytime across a channel a quarter of a mile wide with the ile royale where there is a military post she makes the first trip at six in the morning at four in the afternoon her service is over and she is then hauled up into a little dock on the ile royale and a sentry put over her and a few smaller boats from that time till next morning the island of st joseph remains cut off from the rest of the world with the warders patrolling in turn the path from the warders house to the convict huts and a multitude of sharks patrolling the waters all round  under these circumstances the convicts planned a mutiny such a thing had never been known in the penitentiarys history before but their plan was not without some possibility of success the warders were to be taken by surprise and murdered during the night their arms would enable the convicts to shoot down the people in the galley as she came alongside in the morning the galley once in their possession other boats were to be captured and the whole company was to row away up the coast  at dusk the two warders on duty mustered the convicts as usual then they proceeded to inspect the huts to ascertain that everything was in order in the second they entered they were set upon and absolutely smothered under the numbers of their assailants the twilight faded rapidly it was a new moon and a heavy black squall gathering over the coast increased the profound darkness of the night the convicts assembled in the open space deliberating upon the next step to be taken argued amongst themselves in low voices  you took part in all this i asked  no i knew what was going to be done of course but why should i kill these warders i had nothing against them but i was afraid of the others whatever happened i could not escape from them i sat alone on the stump of a tree with my head in my hands sick at heart at the thought of a freedom that could be nothing but a mockery to me suddenly i was startled to perceive the shape of a man on the path near by he stood perfectly still then his form became effaced in the night it must have been the chief warder coming to see what had become of his two men no one noticed him the convicts kept on quarrelling over their plans the leaders could not get themselves obeyed the fierce whispering of that dark mass of men was very horrible  at last they divided into two parties and moved off when they had passed me i rose weary and hopeless the path to the warders house was dark and silent but on each side the bushes rustled slightly presently i saw a faint thread of light before me the chief warder followed by his three men was approaching cautiously but he had failed to close his dark lantern properly the convicts had seen that faint gleam too there was an awful savage yell a turmoil on the dark path shots fired blows groans and with the sound of smashed bushes the shouts of the pursuers and the screams of the pursued the manhunt the warderhunt passed by me into the interior of the island i was alone and i assure you monsieur i was indifferent to everything after standing still for a while i walked on along the path till i kicked something hard i stooped and picked up a warders revolver i felt with my fingers that it was loaded in five chambers in the gusts of wind i heard the convicts calling to each other far away and then a roll of thunder would cover the soughing and rustling of the trees suddenly a big light ran across my path very low along the ground and it showed a womans skirt with the edge of an apron  i knew that the person who carried it must be the wife of the head warder they had forgotten all about her it seems a shot rang out in the interior of the island and she cried out to herself as she ran she passed on i followed and presently i saw her again she was pulling at the cord of the big bell which hangs at the end of the landingpier with one hand and with the other she was swinging the heavy lantern to and fro this is the agreed signal for the ile royale should assistance be required at night the wind carried the sound away from our island and the light she swung was hidden on the shore side by the few trees that grow near the warders house  i came up quite close to her from behind she went on without stopping without looking aside as though she had been all alone on the island a brave woman monsieur i put the revolver inside the breast of my blue blouse and waited a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder destroyed both the sound and the light of the signal for an instant but she never faltered pulling at the cord and swinging the lantern as regularly as a machine she was a comely woman of thirtyno more i thought to myself all thats no good on a night like this and i made up my mind that if a body of my fellowconvicts came down to the pierwhich was sure to happen sooni would shoot her through the head before i shot myself i knew the comrades well this idea of mine gave me quite an interest in life monsieur and at once instead of remaining stupidly exposed on the pier i retreated a little way and crouched behind a bush i did not intend to let myself be pounced upon unawares and be prevented perhaps from rendering a supreme service to at least one human creature before i died myself  but we must believe the signal was seen for the galley from ile royale came over in an astonishingly short time the woman kept right on till the light of her lantern flashed upon the officer in command and the bayonets of the soldiers in the boat then she sat down and began to cry  she didnt need me any more i did not budge some soldiers were only in their shirtsleeves others without boots just as the call to arms had found them they passed by my bush at the double the galley had been sent away for more and the woman sat all alone crying at the end of the pier with the lantern standing on the ground near her  then suddenly i saw in the light at the end of the pier the red pantaloons of two more men i was overcome with astonishment they too started off at a run their tunics flapped unbuttoned and they were bareheaded one of them panted out to the other straight on straight on  where on earth did they spring from i wondered slowly i walked down the short pier i saw the womans form shaken by sobs and heard her moaning more and more distinctly oh my man my poor man my poor man i stole on quietly she could neither hear nor see anything she had thrown her apron over her head and was rocking herself to and fro in her grief but i remarked a small boat fastened to the end of the pier  those two menthey looked like sousofficiersmust have come in it after being too late i suppose for the galley it is incredible that they should have thus broken the regulations from a sense of duty and it was a stupid thing to do i could not believe my eyes in the very moment i was stepping into that boat  i pulled along the shore slowly a black cloud hung over the iles de salut i heard firing shouts another hunt had begunthe convicthunt the oars were too long to pull comfortably i managed them with difficulty though the boat herself was light but when i got round to the other side of the island the squall broke in rain and wind i was unable to make head against it i let the boat drift ashore and secured her  i knew the spot there was a tumbledown old hovel standing near the water cowering in there i heard through the noises of the wind and the falling downpour some people tearing through the bushes they came out on the strand soldiers perhaps a flash of lightning threw everything near me into violent relief two convicts  and directly an amazed voice exclaimed its a miracle it was the voice of simon otherwise biscuit  and another voice growled whats a miracle  why theres a boat lying here  you must be mad simon but there is after all    a boat  they seemed awed into complete silence the other man was mafile he spoke again cautiously  it is fastened up there must be somebody here  i spoke to them from within the hovel i am here  they came in then and soon gave me to understand that the boat was theirs not mine there are two of us said mafile against you alone  i got out into the open to keep clear of them for fear of getting a treacherous blow on the head i could have shot them both where they stood but i said nothing i kept down the laughter rising in my throat i made myself very humble and begged to be allowed to go they consulted in low tones about my fate while with my hand on the revolver in the bosom of my blouse i had their lives in my power i let them live i meant them to pull that boat i represented to them with abject humility that i understood the management of a boat and that being three to pull we could get a rest in turns that decided them at last it was time a little more and i would have gone into screaming fits at the drollness of it  at this point his excitement broke out he jumped off the bench and gesticulated the great shadows of his arms darting over roof and walls made the shed appear too small to contain his agitation  i deny nothing he burst out i was elated monsieur i tasted a sort of felicity but i kept very quiet i took my turns at pulling all through the night we made for the open sea putting our trust in a passing ship it was a foolhardy action i persuaded them to it when the sun rose the immensity of water was calm and the iles de salut appeared only like dark specks from the top of each swell i was steering then mafile who was pulling bow let out an oath and said we must rest  the time to laugh had come at last and i took my fill of it i can tell you i held my sides and rolled in my seat they had such startled faces whats got into him the animal cries mafile  and simon who was nearest to me says over his shoulder to him devil take me if i dont think hes gone mad  then i produced the revolver aha in a moment they both got the stoniest eyes you can imagine ha ha they were frightened but they pulled oh yes they pulled all day sometimes looking wild and sometimes looking faint i lost nothing of it because i had to keep my eyes on them all the time or elsecrackthey would have been on top of me in a second i rested my revolver hand on my knee all ready and steered with the other their faces began to blister sky and sea seemed on fire round us and the sea steamed in the sun the boat made a sizzling sound as she went through the water sometimes mafile foamed at the mouth and sometimes he groaned but he pulled he dared not stop his eyes became bloodshot all over and he had bitten his lower lip to pieces simon was as hoarse as a crow  comrade he begins  there are no comrades here i am your patron  patron then he says in the name of humanity let us rest  i let them there was a little rainwater washing about the bottom of the boat i permitted them to snatch some of it in the hollow of their palms but as i gave the command en route i caught them exchanging significant glances they thought i would have to go to sleep sometime aha but i did not want to go to sleep i was more awake than ever it is they who went to sleep as they pulled tumbling off the thwarts head over heels suddenly one after another i let them lie all the stars were out it was a quiet world the sun rose another day allez en route  they pulled badly their eyes rolled about and their tongues hung out in the middle of the forenoon mafile croaks out let us make a rush at him simon i would just as soon be shot at once as to die of thirst hunger and fatigue at the oar  but while he spoke he pulled and simon kept on pulling too it made me smile ah they loved their life these two in this evil world of theirs just as i used to love my life too before they spoiled it for me with their phrases i let them go on to the point of exhaustion and only then i pointed at the sails of a ship on the horizon  aha you should have seen them revive and buckle to their work for i kept them at it to pull right across that ships path they were changed the sort of pity i had felt for them left me they looked more like themselves every minute they looked at me with the glances i remembered so well they were happy they smiled  well says simon the energy of that youngster has saved our lives if he hadnt made us we could never have pulled so far out into the track of ships comrade i forgive you i admire you  and mafile growls from forward we owe you a famous debt of gratitude comrade you are cut out for a chief  comrade monsieur ah what a good word and they such men as these two had made it accursed i looked at them i remembered their lies their promises their menaces and all my days of misery why could they not have left me alone after i came out of prison i looked at them and thought that while they lived i could never be free never neither i nor others like me with warm hearts and weak heads for i know i have not a strong head monsieur a black rage came upon methe rage of extreme intoxicationbut not against the injustice of society oh no  i must be free i cried furiously  vive la liberte yells that ruffian mafile mort aux bourgeois who send us to cayenne they shall soon know that we are free  the sky the sea the whole horizon seemed to turn red blood red all round the boat my temples were beating so loud that i wondered they did not hear how is it that they did not how is it they did not understand  i heard simon ask have we not pulled far enough out now  yes far enough i said i was sorry for him it was the other i hated he hauled in his oar with a loud sigh and as he was raising his hand to wipe his forehead with the air of a man who has done his work i pulled the trigger of my revolver and shot him like this off the knee right through the heart  he tumbled down with his head hanging over the side of the boat i did not give him a second glance the other cried out piercingly only one shriek of horror then all was still  he slipped off the thwart on to his knees and raised his clasped hands before his face in an attitude of supplication mercy he whispered faintly mercy for mecomrade  ah comrade i said in a low tone yes comrade of course well then shout vive lanarchie  he flung up his arms his face up to the sky and his mouth wide open in a great yell of despair vive lanarchie vive  he collapsed all in a heap with a bullet through his head  i flung them both overboard i threw away the revolver too then i sat down quietly i was free at last at last i did not even look towards the ship i did not care indeed i think i must have gone to sleep because all of a sudden there were shouts and i found the ship almost on top of me they hauled me on board and secured the boat astern they were all blacks except the captain who was a mulatto he alone knew a few words of french i could not find out where they were going nor who they were they gave me something to eat every day but i did not like the way they used to discuss me in their language perhaps they were deliberating about throwing me overboard in order to keep possession of the boat how do i know as we were passing this island i asked whether it was inhabited i understood from the mulatto that there was a house on it a farm i fancied they meant so i asked them to put me ashore on the beach and keep the boat for their trouble this i imagine was just what they wanted the rest you know  after pronouncing these words he lost suddenly all control over himself he paced to and fro rapidly till at last he broke into a run his arms went like a windmill and his ejaculations became very much like raving the burden of them was that he denied nothing nothing i could only let him go on and sat out of his way repeating calmez vous calmez vous at intervals till his agitation exhausted itself  i must confess too that i remained there long after he had crawled under his mosquitonet he had entreated me not to leave him so as one sits up with a nervous child i sat up with himin the name of humanitytill he fell asleep  on the whole my idea is that he was much more of an anarchist than he confessed to me or to himself and that the special features of his case apart he was very much like many other anarchists warm heart and weak headthat is the word of the riddle and it is a fact that the bitterest contradictions and the deadliest conflicts of the world are carried on in every individual breast capable of feeling and passion  from personal inquiry i can vouch that the story of the convict mutiny was in every particular as stated by him  when i got back to horta from cayenne and saw the anarchist again he did not look well he was more worn still more frail and very livid indeed under the grimy smudges of his calling evidently the meat of the companys main herd in its unconcentrated form did not agree with him at all  it was on the pontoon in horta that we met and i tried to induce him to leave the launch moored where she was and follow me to europe there and then it would have been delightful to think of the excellent managers surprise and disgust at the poor fellows escape but he refused with unconquerable obstinacy  surely you dont mean to live always here i cried he shook his head  i shall die here he said then added moodily away from them  sometimes i think of him lying openeyed on his horsemans gear in the low shed full of tools and scraps of ironthe anarchist slave of the maranon estate waiting with resignation for that sleep which fled from him as he used to say in such an unaccountable manner     a military tale   the duel  i  napoleon i whose career had the quality of a duel against the whole of europe disliked duelling between the officers of his army the great military emperor was not a swashbuckler and had little respect for tradition  nevertheless a story of duelling which became a legend in the army runs through the epic of imperial wars to the surprise and admiration of their fellows two officers like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily pursued a private contest through the years of universal carnage they were officers of cavalry and their connection with the highspirited but fanciful animal which carries men into battle seems particularly appropriate it would be difficult to imagine for heroes of this legend two officers of infantry of the line for example whose fantasy is tamed by much walking exercise and whose valour necessarily must be of a more plodding kind as to gunners or engineers whose heads are kept cool on a diet of mathematics it is simply unthinkable  the names of the two officers were feraud and dhubert and they were both lieutenants in a regiment of hussars but not in the same regiment  feraud was doing regimental work but lieut dhubert had the good fortune to be attached to the person of the general commanding the division as officier dordonnance it was in strasbourg and in this agreeable and important garrison they were enjoying greatly a short interval of peace they were enjoying it though both intensely warlike because it was a swordsharpening firelockcleaning peace dear to a military heart and undamaging to military prestige inasmuch that no one believed in its sincerity or duration  under those historical circumstances so favourable to the proper appreciation of military leisure lieut dhubert one fine afternoon made his way along a quiet street of a cheerful suburb towards lieut ferauds quarters which were in a private house with a garden at the back belonging to an old maiden lady  his knock at the door was answered instantly by a young maid in alsatian costume her fresh complexion and her long eyelashes lowered demurely at the sight of the tall officer caused lieut dhubert who was accessible to esthetic impressions to relax the cold severe gravity of his face at the same time he observed that the girl had over her arm a pair of hussars breeches blue with a red stripe  lieut feraud in he inquired benevolently  oh no sir he went out at six this morning  the pretty maid tried to close the door lieut dhubert opposing this move with gentle firmness stepped into the anteroom jingling his spurs  come my dear you dont mean to say he has not been home since six oclock this morning  saying these words lieut dhubert opened without ceremony the door of a room so comfortably and neatly ordered that only from internal evidence in the shape of boots uniforms and military accoutrements did he acquire the conviction that it was lieut ferauds room and he saw also that lieut feraud was not at home the truthful maid had followed him and raised her candid eyes to his face  hm said lieut dhubert greatly disappointed for he had already visited all the haunts where a lieutenant of hussars could be found of a fine afternoon so hes out and do you happen to know my dear why he went out at six this morning  no she answered readily he came home late last night and snored i heard him when i got up at five then he dressed himself in his oldest uniform and went out service i suppose  service not a bit of it cried lieut dhubert learn my angel that he went out thus early to fight a duel with a civilian  she heard this news without a quiver of her dark eyelashes it was very obvious that the actions of lieut feraud were generally above criticism she only looked up for a moment in mute surprise and lieut dhubert concluded from this absence of emotion that she must have seen lieut feraud since the morning he looked around the room  come he insisted with confidential familiarity hes perhaps somewhere in the house now  she shook her head  so much the worse for him continued lieut dhubert in a tone of anxious conviction but he has been home this morning  this time the pretty maid nodded slightly  he has cried lieut dhubert and went out again what for couldnt he keep quietly indoors what a lunatic my dear girl  lieut dhuberts natural kindness of disposition and strong sense of comradeship helped his powers of observation he changed his tone to a most insinuating softness and gazing at the hussars breeches hanging over the arm of the girl he appealed to the interest she took in lieut ferauds comfort and happiness he was pressing and persuasive he used his eyes which were kind and fine with excellent effect his anxiety to get hold at once of lieut feraud for lieut ferauds own good seemed so genuine that at last it overcame the girls unwillingness to speak unluckily she had not much to tell lieut feraud had returned home shortly before ten had walked straight into his room and had thrown himself on his bed to resume his slumbers she had heard him snore rather louder than before far into the afternoon then he got up put on his best uniform and went out that was all she knew  she raised her eyes and lieut dhubert stared into them incredulously  its incredible gone parading the town in his best uniform my dear child dont you know he ran that civilian through this morning clean through as you spit a hare  the pretty maid heard the gruesome intelligence without any signs of distress but she pressed her lips together thoughtfully  he isnt parading the town she remarked in a low tone far from it  the civilians family is making an awful row continued lieut dhubert pursuing his train of thought and the general is very angry its one of the best families in the town feraud ought to have kept close at least  what will the general do to him inquired the girl anxiously  he wont have his head cut off to be sure grumbled lieut dhubert his conduct is positively indecent hes making no end of trouble for himself by this sort of bravado  but he isnt parading the town the maid insisted in a shy murmur  why yes now i think of it i havent seen him anywhere about what on earth has he done with himself  hes gone to pay a call suggested the maid after a moment of silence  lieut dhubert started  a call do you mean a call on a lady the cheek of the man and how do you know this my dear  without concealing her womans scorn for the denseness of the masculine mind the pretty maid reminded him that lieut feraud had arrayed himself in his best uniform before going out he had also put on his newest dolman she added in a tone as if this conversation were getting on her nerves and turned away brusquely  lieut dhubert without questioning the accuracy of the deduction did not see that it advanced him much on his official quest for his quest after lieut feraud had an official character he did not know any of the women this fellow who had run a man through in the morning was likely to visit in the afternoon the two young men knew each other but slightly he bit his gloved finger in perplexity  call he exclaimed call on the devil  the girl with her back to him and folding the hussars breeches on a chair protested with a vexed little laugh  oh dear no on madame de lionne  lieut dhubert whistled softly madame de lionne was the wife of a high official who had a wellknown salon and some pretensions to sensibility and elegance the husband was a civilian and old but the society of the salon was young and military lieut dhubert had whistled not because the idea of pursuing lieut feraud into that very salon was disagreeable to him but because having arrived in strasbourg only lately he had not had the time as yet to get an introduction to madame de lionne and what was that swashbuckler feraud doing there he wondered he did not seem the sort of man who  are you certain of what you say asked lieut dhubert  the girl was perfectly certain without turning round to look at him she explained that the coachman of their next door neighbours knew the maitredhotel of madame de lionne in this way she had her information and she was perfectly certain in giving this assurance she sighed lieut feraud called there nearly every afternoon she added  ah bah exclaimed dhubert ironically his opinion of madame de lionne went down several degrees lieut feraud did not seem to him specially worthy of attention on the part of a woman with a reputation for sensibility and elegance but there was no saying at bottom they were all alikevery practical rather than idealistic lieut dhubert however did not allow his mind to dwell on these considerations  by thunder he reflected aloud the general goes there sometimes if he happens to find the fellow making eyes at the lady there will be the devil to pay our general is not a very accommodating person i can tell you  go quickly then dont stand here now ive told you where he is cried the girl colouring to the eyes  thanks my dear i dont know what i would have done without you  after manifesting his gratitude in an aggressive way which at first was repulsed violently and then submitted to with a sudden and still more repellent indifference lieut dhubert took his departure  he clanked and jingled along the streets with a martial swagger to run a comrade to earth in a drawingroom where he was not known did not trouble him in the least a uniform is a passport his position as officier dordonnance of the general added to his assurance moreover now that he knew where to find lieut feraud he had no option it was a service matter  madame de lionnes house had an excellent appearance a man in livery opening the door of a large drawingroom with a waxed floor shouted his name and stood aside to let him pass it was a reception day the ladies wore big hats surcharged with a profusion of feathers their bodies sheathed in clinging white gowns from the armpits to the tips of the low satin shoes looked sylphlike and cool in a great display of bare necks and arms the men who talked with them on the contrary were arrayed heavily in multicoloured garments with collars up to their ears and thick sashes round their waists lieut dhubert made his unabashed way across the room and bowing low before a sylphlike form reclining on a couch offered his apologies for this intrusion which nothing could excuse but the extreme urgency of the service order he had to communicate to his comrade feraud he proposed to himself to return presently in a more regular manner and beg forgiveness for interrupting the interesting conversation     a bare arm was extended towards him with gracious nonchalance even before he had finished speaking he pressed the hand respectfully to his lips and made the mental remark that it was bony madame de lionne was a blonde with too fine a skin and a long face  cest ca she said with an ethereal smile disclosing a set of large teeth come this evening to plead for your forgiveness  i will not fail madame  meantime lieut feraud splendid in his new dolman and the extremely polished boots of his calling sat on a chair within a foot of the couch one hand resting on his thigh the other twirling his moustache to a point at a significant glance from dhubert he rose without alacrity and followed him into the recess of a window  what is it you want with me he asked with astonishing indifference lieut dhubert could not imagine that in the innocence of his heart and simplicity of his conscience lieut feraud took a view of his duel in which neither remorse nor yet a rational apprehension of consequences had any place though he had no clear recollection how the quarrel had originated it was begun in an establishment where beer and wine are drunk late at night he had not the slightest doubt of being himself the outraged party he had had two experienced friends for his seconds everything had been done according to the rules governing that sort of adventures and a duel is obviously fought for the purpose of someone being at least hurt if not killed outright the civilian got hurt that also was in order lieut feraud was perfectly tranquil but lieut dhubert took it for affectation and spoke with a certain vivacity  i am directed by the general to give you the order to go at once to your quarters and remain there under close arrest  it was now the turn of lieut feraud to be astonished what the devil are you telling me there he murmured faintly and fell into such profound wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of lieut dhubert the two officers one tall with an interesting face and a moustache the colour of ripe corn the other short and sturdy with a hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hair approached the mistress of the house to take their leave madame de lionne a woman of eclectic taste smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an equal share of interest madame de lionne took her delight in the infinite variety of the human species all the other eyes in the drawingroom followed the departing officers and when they had gone out one or two men who had already heard of the duel imparted the information to the sylphlike ladies who received it with faint shrieks of humane concern  meantime the two hussars walked side by side lieut feraud trying to master the hidden reason of things which in this instance eluded the grasp of his intellect lieut dhubert feeling annoyed at the part he had to play because the generals instructions were that he should see personally that lieut feraud carried out his orders to the letter and at once  the chief seems to know this animal he thought eyeing his companion whose round face the round eyes and even the twistedup jet black little moustache seemed animated by a mental exasperation against the incomprehensible and aloud he observed rather reproachfully the general is in a devilish fury with you  lieut feraud stopped short on the edge of the pavement and cried in accents of unmistakable sincerity what on earth for the innocence of the fiery gascon soul was depicted in the manner in which he seized his head in both hands as if to prevent it bursting with perplexity  for the duel said lieut dhubert curtly he was annoyed greatly by this sort of perverse fooling  the duel the      lieut feraud passed from one paroxysm of astonishment into another he dropped his hands and walked on slowly trying to reconcile this information with the state of his own feelings it was impossible he burst out indignantly was i to let that sauerkrauteating civilian wipe his boots on the uniform of the 7th hussars  lieut dhubert could not remain altogether unmoved by that simple sentiment this little fellow was a lunatic he thought to himself but there was something in what he said  of course i dont know how far you were justified he began soothingly and the general himself may not be exactly informed those people have been deafening him with their lamentations  ah the general is not exactly informed mumbled lieut feraud walking faster and faster as his choler at the injustice of his fate began to rise he is not exactly    and he orders me under close arrest with god knows what afterwards  dont excite yourself like this remonstrated the other your adversarys people are very influential you know and it looks bad enough on the face of it the general had to take notice of their complaint at once i dont think he means to be oversevere with you its the best thing for you to be kept out of sight for a while  i am very much obliged to the general muttered lieut feraud through his teeth and perhaps you would say i ought to be grateful to you too for the trouble you have taken to hunt me up in the drawingroom of a lady who  frankly interrupted lieut dhubert with an innocent laugh i think you ought to be i had no end of trouble to find out where you were it wasnt exactly the place for you to disport yourself in under the circumstances if the general had caught you there making eyes at the goddess of the temple    oh my word    he hates to be bothered with complaints against his officers you know and it looked uncommonly like sheer bravado  the two officers had arrived now at the street door of lieut ferauds lodgings the latter turned towards his companion lieut dhubert he said i have something to say to you which cant be said very well in the street you cant refuse to come up  the pretty maid had opened the door lieut feraud brushed past her brusquely and she raised her scared and questioning eyes to lieut dhubert who could do nothing but shrug his shoulders slightly as he followed with marked reluctance  in his room lieut feraud unhooked the clasp flung his new dolman on the bed and folding his arms across his chest turned to the other hussar  do you imagine i am a man to submit tamely to injustice he inquired in a boisterous voice  oh do be reasonable remonstrated lieut dhubert  i am reasonable i am perfectly reasonable retorted the other with ominous restraint i cant call the general to account for his behaviour but you are going to answer me for yours  i cant listen to this nonsense murmured lieut dhubert making a slightly contemptuous grimace  you call this nonsense it seems to me a perfectly plain statement unless you dont understand french  what on earth do you mean  i mean screamed suddenly lieut feraud to cut off your ears to teach you to disturb me with the generals orders when i am talking to a lady  a profound silence followed this mad declaration and through the open window lieut dhubert heard the little birds singing sanely in the garden he said preserving his calm why if you take that tone of course i shall hold myself at your disposition whenever you are at liberty to attend to this affair but i dont think you will cut my ears off  i am going to attend to it at once declared lieut feraud with extreme truculence if you are thinking of displaying your airs and graces tonight in madame de lionnes salon you are very much mistaken  really said lieut dhubert who was beginning to feel irritated you are an impracticable sort of fellow the generals orders to me were to put you under arrest not to carve you into small pieces goodmorning and turning his back on the little gascon who always sober in his potations was as though born intoxicated with the sunshine of his vineripening country the northman who could drink hard on occasion but was born sober under the watery skies of picardy made for the door hearing however the unmistakable sound behind his back of a sword drawn from the scabbard he had no option but to stop  devil take this mad southerner he thought spinning round and surveying with composure the warlike posture of lieut feraud with a bare sword in his hand  at onceat once stuttered feraud beside himself  you had my answer said the other keeping his temper very well  at first he had been only vexed and somewhat amused but now his face got clouded he was asking himself seriously how he could manage to get away it was impossible to run from a man with a sword and as to fighting him it seemed completely out of the question he waited awhile then said exactly what was in his heart  drop this i wont fight with you i wont be made ridiculous  ah you wont hissed the gascon i suppose you prefer to be made infamous do you hear what i say    infamous infamous infamous he shrieked rising and falling on his toes and getting very red in the face  lieut dhubert on the contrary became very pale at the sound of the unsavoury word for a moment then flushed pink to the roots of his fair hair but you cant go out to fight you are under arrest you lunatic he objected with angry scorn  theres the garden its big enough to lay out your long carcass in spluttered the other with such ardour that somehow the anger of the cooler man subsided  this is perfectly absurd he said glad enough to think he had found a way out of it for the moment we shall never get any of our comrades to serve as seconds its preposterous  seconds damn the seconds we dont want any seconds dont you worry about any seconds i shall send word to your friends to come and bury you when i am done and if you want any witnesses ill send word to the old girl to put her head out of a window at the back stay theres the gardener hell do hes as deaf as a post but he has two eyes in his head come along i will teach you my staff officer that the carrying about of a generals orders is not always childs play  while thus discoursing he had unbuckled his empty scabbard he sent it flying under the bed and lowering the point of the sword brushed past the perplexed lieut dhubert exclaiming follow me directly he had flung open the door a faint shriek was heard and the pretty maid who had been listening at the keyhole staggered away putting the backs of her hands over her eyes feraud did not seem to see her but she ran after him and seized his left arm he shook her off and then she rushed towards lieut dhubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform  wretched man she sobbed is this what you wanted to find him for  let me go entreated lieut dhubert trying to disengage himself gently its like being in a madhouse he protested with exasperation do let me go i wont do him any harm  a fiendish laugh from lieut feraud commented that assurance come along he shouted with a stamp of his foot  and lieut dhubert did follow he could do nothing else yet in vindication of his sanity it must be recorded that as he passed through the anteroom the notion of opening the street door and bolting out presented itself to this brave youth only of course to be instantly dismissed for he felt sure that the other would pursue him without shame or compunction and the prospect of an officer of hussars being chased along the street by another officer of hussars with a naked sword could not be for a moment entertained therefore he followed into the garden behind them the girl tottered out too with ashy lips and wild scared eyes she surrendered herself to a dreadful curiosity she had also the notion of rushing if need be between lieut feraud and death  the deaf gardener utterly unconscious of approaching footsteps went on watering his flowers till lieut feraud thumped him on the back beholding suddenly an enraged man flourishing a big sabre the old chap trembling in all his limbs dropped the wateringpot at once lieut feraud kicked it away with great animosity and seizing the gardener by the throat backed him against a tree he held him there shouting in his ear stay here and look on you understand youve got to look on dont dare budge from the spot  lieut dhubert came slowly down the walk unclasping his dolman with unconcealed disgust even then with his hand already on the hilt of his sword he hesitated to draw till a roar en garde fichtre what do you think you came here for and the rush of his adversary forced him to put himself as quickly as possible in a posture of defence  the clash of arms filled that prim garden which hitherto had known no more warlike sound than the click of clipping shears and presently the upper part of an old ladys body was projected out of a window upstairs she tossed her arms above her white cap scolding in a cracked voice the gardener remained glued to the tree his toothless mouth open in idiotic astonishment and a little farther up the path the pretty girl as if spellbound to a small grass plot ran a few steps this way and that wringing her hands and muttering crazily she did not rush between the combatants the onslaughts of lieut feraud were so fierce that her heart failed her lieut dhubert his faculties concentrated upon defence needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes of his adversary twice already he had to break ground it bothered him to feel his foothold made insecure by the round dry gravel of the path rolling under the hard soles of his boots this was most unsuitable ground he thought keeping a watchful narrowed gaze shaded by long eyelashes upon the fiery stare of his thickset adversary this absurd affair would ruin his reputation of a sensible wellbehaved promising young officer it would damage at any rate his immediate prospects and lose him the goodwill of his general these worldly preoccupations were no doubt misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment a duel whether regarded as a ceremony in the cult of honour or even when reduced in its moral essence to a form of manly sport demands a perfect singleness of intention a homicidal austerity of mood on the other hand this vivid concern for his future had not a bad effect inasmuch as it began to rouse the anger of lieut dhubert some seventy seconds had elapsed since they had crossed blades and lieut dhubert had to break ground again in order to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet of specimens the result was that misapprehending the motive lieut feraud with a triumphant sort of snarl pressed his attack  this enraged animal will have me against the wall directly thought lieut dhubert he imagined himself much closer to the house than he was and he dared not turn his head it seemed to him that he was keeping his adversary off with his eyes rather more than with his point lieut feraud crouched and bounded with a fierce tigerish agility fit to trouble the stoutest heart but what was more appalling than the fury of a wild beast accomplishing in all innocence of heart a natural function was the fixity of savage purpose man alone is capable of displaying lieut d hubert in the midst of his worldly preoccupations perceived it at last it was an absurd and damaging affair to be drawn into but whatever silly intention the fellow had started with it was clear enough that by this time he meant to killnothing less he meant it with an intensity of will utterly beyond the inferior faculties of a tiger  as is the case with constitutionally brave men the full view of the danger interested lieut dhubert and directly he got properly interested the length of his arm and the coolness of his head told in his favour it was the turn of lieut feraud to recoil with a bloodcurdling grunt of baffled rage he made a swift feint and then rushed straight forward  ah you would would you lieut dhubert exclaimed mentally the combat had lasted nearly two minutes time enough for any man to get embittered apart from the merits of the quarrel and all at once it was over trying to close breast to breast under his adversarys guard lieut feraud received a slash on his shortened arm he did not feel it in the least but it checked his rush and his feet slipping on the gravel he fell backwards with great violence the shock jarred his boiling brain into the perfect quietude of insensibility simultaneously with his fall the pretty servantgirl shrieked but the old maiden lady at the window ceased her scolding and began to cross herself piously  beholding his adversary stretched out perfectly still his face to the sky lieut dhubert thought he had killed him outright the impression of having slashed hard enough to cut his man clean in two abode with him for a while in an exaggerated memory of the right goodwill he had put into the blow he dropped on his knees hastily by the side of the prostrate body discovering that not even the arm was severed a slight sense of disappointment mingled with the feeling of relief the fellow deserved the worst but truly he did not want the death of that sinner the affair was ugly enough as it stood and lieut dhubert addressed himself at once to the task of stopping the bleeding in this task it was his fate to be ridiculously impeded by the pretty maid rending the air with screams of horror she attacked him from behind and twining her fingers in his hair tugged back at his head why she should choose to hinder him at this precise moment he could not in the least understand he did not try it was all like a very wicked and harassing dream twice to save himself from being pulled over he had to rise and fling her off he did this stoically without a word kneeling down again at once to go on with his work but the third time his work being done he seized her and held her arms pinned to her body her cap was half off her face was red her eyes blazed with crazy boldness he looked mildly into them while she called him a wretch a traitor and a murderer many times in succession this did not annoy him so much as the conviction that she had managed to scratch his face abundantly ridicule would be added to the scandal of the story he imagined the adorned tale making its way through the garrison of the town through the whole army on the frontier with every possible distortion of motive and sentiment and circumstance spreading a doubt upon the sanity of his conduct and the distinction of his taste even to the very ears of his honourable family it was all very well for that fellow feraud who had no connections no family to speak of and no quality but courage which anyhow was a matter of course and possessed by every single trooper in the whole mass of french cavalry still holding down the arms of the girl in a strong grip lieut dhubert glanced over his shoulder lieut feraud had opened his eyes he did not move like a man just waking from a deep sleep he stared without any expression at the evening sky  lieut dhuberts urgent shouts to the old gardener produced no effectnot so much as to make him shut his toothless mouth then he remembered that the man was stone deaf all that time the girl struggled not with maidenly coyness but like a pretty dumb fury kicking his shins now and then he continued to hold her as if in a vice his instinct telling him that were he to let her go she would fly at his eyes but he was greatly humiliated by his position at last she gave up she was more exhausted than appeased he feared nevertheless he attempted to get out of this wicked dream by way of negotiation  listen to me he said as calmly as he could will you promise to run for a surgeon if i let you go  with real affliction he heard her declare that she would do nothing of the kind on the contrary her sobbed out intention was to remain in the garden and fight tooth and nail for the protection of the vanquished man this was shocking  my dear child he cried in despair is it possible that you think me capable of murdering a wounded adversary is it    be quiet you little wild cat you  they struggled a thick drowsy voice said behind him what are you after with that girl  lieut feraud had raised himself on his good arm he was looking sleepily at his other arm at the mess of blood on his uniform at a small red pool on the ground at his sabre lying a foot away on the path then he laid himself down gently again to think it all out as far as a thundering headache would permit of mental operations  lieut dhubert released the girl who crouched at once by the side of the other lieutenant the shades of night were falling on the little trim garden with this touching group whence proceeded low murmurs of sorrow and compassion with other feeble sounds of a different character as if an imperfectly awake invalid were trying to swear lieut dhubert went away  he passed through the silent house and congratulated himself upon the dusk concealing his gory hands and scratched face from the passersby but this story could by no means be concealed he dreaded the discredit and ridicule above everything and was painfully aware of sneaking through the back streets in the manner of a murderer presently the sounds of a flute coming out of the open window of a lighted upstairs room in a modest house interrupted his dismal reflections it was being played with a persevering virtuosity and through the fioritures of the tune one could hear the regular thumping of the foot beating time on the floor  lieut dhubert shouted a name which was that of an army surgeon whom he knew fairly well the sounds of the flute ceased and the musician appeared at the window his instrument still in his hand peering into the street  who calls you dhubert what brings you this way  he did not like to be disturbed at the hour when he was playing the flute he was a man whose hair had turned grey already in the thankless task of tying up wounds on battlefields where others reaped advancement and glory  i want you to go at once and see feraud you know lieut feraud he lives down the second street its but a step from here  whats the matter with him  wounded  are you sure  sure cried dhubert i come from there  thats amusing said the elderly surgeon amusing was his favourite word but the expression of his face when he pronounced it never corresponded he was a stolid man come in he added ill get ready in a moment  thanks i will i want to wash my hands in your room  lieut dhubert found the surgeon occupied in unscrewing his flute and packing the pieces methodically in a case he turned his head  water therein the corner your hands do want washing  ive stopped the bleeding said lieut dhubert but you had better make haste its rather more than ten minutes ago you know  the surgeon did not hurry his movements  whats the matter dressing came off thats amusing ive been at work in the hospital all day but ive been told this morning by somebody that he had come off without a scratch  not the same duel probably growled moodily lieut dhubert wiping his hands on a coarse towel  not the same    what another it would take the very devil to make me go out twice in one day the surgeon looked narrowly at lieut dhubert how did you come by that scratched face both sides tooand symmetrical its amusing  very snarled lieut dhubert and you will find his slashed arm amusing too it will keep both of you amused for quite a long time  the doctor was mystified and impressed by the brusque bitterness of lieut dhuberts tone they left the house together and in the street he was still more mystified by his conduct  arent you coming with me he asked  no said lieut dhubert you can find the house by yourself the front door will be standing open very likely  all right wheres his room  ground floor but you had better go right through and look in the garden first  this astonishing piece of information made the surgeon go off without further parley lieut dhubert regained his quarters nursing a hot and uneasy indignation he dreaded the chaff of his comrades almost as much as the anger of his superiors the truth was confoundedly grotesque and embarrassing even putting aside the irregularity of the combat itself which made it come abominably near a criminal offence like all men without much imagination a faculty which helps the process of reflective thought lieut dhubert became frightfully harassed by the obvious aspects of his predicament he was certainly glad that he had not killed lieut feraud outside all rules and without the regular witnesses proper to such a transaction uncommonly glad at the same time he felt as though he would have liked to wring his neck for him without ceremony  he was still under the sway of these contradictory sentiments when the surgeon amateur of the flute came to see him more than three days had elapsed lieut dhubert was no longer officier dordonnance to the general commanding the division he had been sent back to his regiment and he was resuming his connection with the soldiers military family by being shut up in close confinement not at his own quarters in town but in a room in the barracks owing to the gravity of the incident he was forbidden to see any one he did not know what had happened what was being said or what was being thought the arrival of the surgeon was a most unexpected thing to the worried captive the amateur of the flute began by explaining that he was there only by a special favour of the colonel  i represented to him that it would be only fair to let you have some authentic news of your adversary he continued youll be glad to hear hes getting better fast  lieut dhuberts face exhibited no conventional signs of gladness he continued to walk the floor of the dusty bare room  take this chair doctor he mumbled  the doctor sat down  this affair is variously appreciatedin town and in the army in fact the diversity of opinions is amusing  is it mumbled lieut dhubert tramping steadily from wall to wall but within himself he marvelled that there could be two opinions on the matter the surgeon continued  of course as the real facts are not known  i should have thought interrupted dhubert that the fellow would have put you in possession of facts  he said something admitted the other the first time i saw him and by the by i did find him in the garden the thump on the back of his head had made him a little incoherent then afterwards he was rather reticent than otherwise  didnt think he would have the grace to be ashamed mumbled dhubert resuming his pacing while the doctor murmured its very amusing ashamed shame was not exactly his frame of mind however you may look at the matter otherwise  what are you talking about what matter asked dhubert with a sidelong look at the heavyfaced greyhaired figure seated on a wooden chair  whatever it is said the surgeon a little impatiently i dont want to pronounce any opinion on your conduct  by heavens you had better not burst out dhubert  therethere dont be so quick in flourishing the sword it doesnt pay in the long run understand once for all that i would not carve any of you youngsters except with the tools of my trade but my advice is good if you go on like this you will make for yourself an ugly reputation  go on like what demanded lieut dhubert stopping short quite startled iimake for myself a reputation    what do you imagine  i told you i dont wish to judge of the rights and wrongs of this incident its not my business nevertheless  what on earth has he been telling you interrupted lieut dhubert in a sort of awed scare  i told you already that at first when i picked him up in the garden he was incoherent afterwards he was naturally reticent but i gather at least that he could not help himself  he couldnt shouted lieut dhubert in a great voice then lowering his tone impressively and what about me could i help myself  the surgeon stood up his thoughts were running upon the flute his constant companion with a consoling voice in the vicinity of field ambulances after twentyfour hours hard work he had been known to trouble with its sweet sounds the horrible stillness of battlefields given over to silence and the dead the solacing hour of his daily life was approaching and in peace time he held on to the minutes as a miser to his hoard  of courseof course he said perfunctorily you would think so its amusing however being perfectly neutral and friendly to you both i have consented to deliver his message to you say that i am humouring an invalid if you like he wants you to know that this affair is by no means at an end he intends to send you his seconds directly he has regained his strengthproviding of course the army is not in the field at that time  he intends does he why certainly spluttered lieut dhubert in a passion  the secret of his exasperation was not apparent to the visitor but this passion confirmed the surgeon in the belief which was gaining ground outside that some very serious difference had arisen between these two young men something serious enough to wear an air of mystery some fact of the utmost gravity to settle their urgent difference about that fact those two young men had risked being broken and disgraced at the outset almost of their career the surgeon feared that the forthcoming inquiry would fail to satisfy the public curiosity they would not take the public into their confidence as to that something which had passed between them of a nature so outrageous as to make them face a charge of murderneither more nor less but what could it be  the surgeon was not very curious by temperament but that question haunting his mind caused him twice that evening to hold the instrument off his lips and sit silent for a whole minuteright in the middle of a tunetrying to form a plausible conjecture   ii   he succeeded in this object no better than the rest of the garrison and the whole of society the two young officers of no especial consequence till then became distinguished by the universal curiosity as to the origin of their quarrel madame de lionnes salon was the centre of ingenious surmises that lady herself was for a time assailed by inquiries as being the last person known to have spoken to these unhappy and reckless young men before they went out together from her house to a savage encounter with swords at dusk in a private garden she protested she had not observed anything unusual in their demeanour lieut feraud had been visibly annoyed at being called away that was natural enough no man likes to be disturbed in a conversation with a lady famed for her elegance and sensibility but in truth the subject bored madame de lionne since her personality could by no stretch of reckless gossip be connected with this affair and it irritated her to hear it advanced that there might have been some woman in the case this irritation arose not from her elegance or sensibility but from a more instinctive side of her nature it became so great at last that she peremptorily forbade the subject to be mentioned under her roof near her couch the prohibition was obeyed but farther off in the salon the pall of the imposed silence continued to be lifted more or less a personage with a long pale face resembling the countenance of a sheep opined shaking his head that it was a quarrel of long standing envenomed by time it was objected to him that the men themselves were too young for such a theory they belonged also to different and distant parts of france there were other physical impossibilities too a subcommissary of the intendence an agreeable and cultivated bachelor in kerseymere breeches hessian boots and a blue coat embroidered with silver lace who affected to believe in the transmigration of souls suggested that the two had met perhaps in some previous existence the feud was in the forgotten past it might have been something quite inconceivable in the present state of their being but their souls remembered the animosity and manifested an instinctive antagonism he developed this theme jocularly yet the affair was so absurd from the worldly the military the honourable or the prudential point of view that this weird explanation seemed rather more reasonable than any other  the two officers had confided nothing definite to any one humiliation at having been worsted arms in hand and an uneasy feeling of having been involved in a scrape by the injustice of fate kept lieut feraud savagely dumb he mistrusted the sympathy of mankind that would of course go to that dandified staff officer lying in bed he raved aloud to the pretty maid who administered to his needs with devotion and listened to his horrible imprecations with alarm that lieut dhubert should be made to pay for it seemed to her just and natural her principal care was that lieut feraud should not excite himself he appeared so wholly admirable and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern was to see him get well quickly even if it were only to resume his visits to madame de lionnes salon  lieut dhubert kept silent for the immediate reason that there was no one except a stupid young soldier servant to speak to further he was aware that the episode so grave professionally had its comic side when reflecting upon it he still felt that he would like to wring lieut ferauds neck for him but this formula was figurative rather than precise and expressed more a state of mind than an actual physical impulse at the same time there was in that young man a feeling of comradeship and kindness which made him unwilling to make the position of lieut feraud worse than it was he did not want to talk at large about this wretched affair at the inquiry he would have of course to speak the truth in selfdefence this prospect vexed him  but no inquiry took place the army took the field instead lieut dhubert liberated without remark took up his regimental duties and lieut feraud his arm just out of the sling rode unquestioned with his squadron to complete his convalescence in the smoke of battlefields and the fresh air of night bivouacs this bracing treatment suited him so well that at the first rumour of an armistice being signed he could turn without misgivings to the thoughts of his private warfare  this time it was to be regular warfare he sent two friends to lieut dhubert whose regiment was stationed only a few miles away those friends had asked no questions of their principal i owe him one that pretty staff officer he had said grimly and they went away quite contentedly on their mission lieut dhubert had no difficulty in finding two friends equally discreet and devoted to their principal theres a crazy fellow to whom i must give a lesson he had declared curtly and they asked for no better reasons  on these grounds an encounter with duellingswords was arranged one early morning in a convenient field at the third setto lieut dhubert found himself lying on his back on the dewy grass with a hole in his side a serene sun rising over a landscape of meadows and woods hung on his left a surgeonnot the flute player but anotherwas bending over him feeling around the wound  narrow squeak but it will be nothing he pronounced  lieut dhubert heard these words with pleasure one of his seconds sitting on the wet grass and sustaining his head on his lap said the fortune of war mon pauvre vieux what will you have you had better make it up like two good fellows do  you dont know what you ask murmured lieut dhubert in a feeble voice however if he     in another part of the meadow the seconds of lieut feraud were urging him to go over and shake hands with his adversary  you have paid him off nowque diable its the proper thing to do this dhubert is a decent fellow  i know the decency of these generals pets muttered lieut feraud through his teeth and the sombre expression of his face discouraged further efforts at reconciliation the seconds bowing from a distance took their men off the field in the afternoon lieut dhubert very popular as a good comrade uniting great bravery with a frank and equable temper had many visitors it was remarked that lieut feraud did not as is customary show himself much abroad to receive the felicitations of his friends they would not have failed him because he too was liked for the exuberance of his southern nature and the simplicity of his character in all the places where officers were in the habit of assembling at the end of the day the duel of the morning was talked over from every point of view though lieut dhubert had got worsted this time his sword play was commended no one could deny that it was very close very scientific it was even whispered that if he got touched it was because he wished to spare his adversary but by many the vigour and dash of lieut ferauds attack were pronounced irresistible  the merits of the two officers as combatants were frankly discussed but their attitude to each other after the duel was criticised lightly and with caution it was irreconcilable and that was to be regretted but after all they knew best what the care of their honour dictated it was not a matter for their comrades to pry into overmuch as to the origin of the quarrel the general impression was that it dated from the time they were holding garrison in strasbourg the musical surgeon shook his head at that it went much farther back he thought  why of course you must know the whole story cried several voices eager with curiosity what was it  he raised his eyes from his glass deliberately even if i knew ever so well you cant expect me to tell you since both the principals choose to say nothing  he got up and went out leaving the sense of mystery behind him he could not stay any longer because the witching hour of fluteplaying was drawing near  after he had gone a very young officer observed solemnly obviously his lips are sealed  nobody questioned the high correctness of that remark somehow it added to the impressiveness of the affair several older officers of both regiments prompted by nothing but sheer kindness and love of harmony proposed to form a court of honour to which the two young men would leave the task of their reconciliation unfortunately they began by approaching lieut feraud on the assumption that having just scored heavily he would be found placable and disposed to moderation  the reasoning was sound enough nevertheless the move turned out unfortunate in that relaxation of moral fibre which is brought about by the ease of soothed vanity lieut feraud had condescended in the secret of his heart to review the case and even had come to doubt not the justice of his cause but the absolute sagacity of his conduct this being so he was disinclined to talk about it the suggestion of the regimental wise men put him in a difficult position he was disgusted at it and this disgust by a paradoxical logic reawakened his animosity against lieut dhubert was he to be pestered with this fellow for everthe fellow who had an infernal knack of getting round people somehow and yet it was difficult to refuse point blank that mediation sanctioned by the code of honour  he met the difficulty by an attitude of grim reserve he twisted his moustache and used vague words his case was perfectly clear he was not ashamed to state it before a proper court of honour neither was he afraid to defend it on the ground he did not see any reason to jump at the suggestion before ascertaining how his adversary was likely to take it  later in the day his exasperation growing upon him he was heard in a public place saying sardonically that it would be the very luckiest thing for lieut dhubert because the next time of meeting he need not hope to get off with the mere trifle of three weeks in bed  this boastful phrase might have been prompted by the most profound machiavellism southern natures often hide under the outward impulsiveness of action and speech a certain amount of astuteness  lieut feraud mistrusting the justice of men by no means desired a court of honour and the above words according so well with his temperament had also the merit of serving his turn whether meant so or not they found their way in less than fourandtwenty hours into lieut dhuberts bedroom in consequence lieut dhubert sitting propped up with pillows received the overtures made to him next day by the statement that the affair was of a nature which could not bear discussion  the pale face of the wounded officer his weak voice which he had yet to use cautiously and the courteous dignity of his tone had a great effect on his hearers reported outside all this did more for deepening the mystery than the vapourings of lieut feraud this last was greatly relieved at the issue he began to enjoy the state of general wonder and was pleased to add to it by assuming an attitude of fierce discretion  the colonel of lieut dhuberts regiment was a greyhaired weatherbeaten warrior who took a simple view of his responsibilities i cant he said to himself let the best of my subalterns get damaged like this for nothing i must get to the bottom of this affair privately he must speak out if the devil were in it the colonel should be more than a father to these youngsters and indeed he loved all his men with as much affection as a father of a large family can feel for every individual member of it if human beings by an oversight of providence came into the world as mere civilians they were born again into a regiment as infants are born into a family and it was that military birth alone which counted  at the sight of lieut dhubert standing before him very bleached and holloweyed the heart of the old warrior felt a pang of genuine compassion all his affection for the regimentthat body of men which he held in his hand to launch forward and draw back who ministered to his pride and commanded all his thoughtsseemed centred for a moment on the person of the most promising subaltern he cleared his throat in a threatening manner and frowned terribly you must understand he began that i dont care a rap for the life of a single man in the regiment i would send the eight hundred and fortythree of you men and horses galloping into the pit of perdition with no more compunction than i would kill a fly  yes colonel you would be riding at our head said lieut dhubert with a wan smile  the colonel who felt the need of being very diplomatic fairly roared at this i want you to know lieut dhubert that i could stand aside and see you all riding to hades if need be i am a man to do even that if the good of the service and my duty to my country required it from me but thats unthinkable so dont you even hint at such a thing he glared awfully but his tone softened theres some milk yet about that moustache of yours my boy you dont know what a man like me is capable of i would hide behind a haystack if    dont grin at me sir how dare you if this were not a private conversation i would    look here i am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment do you understand that well then what the devil do you mean by letting yourself be spitted like this by that fellow of the 7th hussars its simply disgraceful  lieut dhubert felt vexed beyond measure his shoulders moved slightly he made no other answer he could not ignore his responsibility  the colonel veiled his glance and lowered his voice still more its deplorable he murmured and again he changed his tone come he went on persuasively but with that note of authority which dwells in the throat of a good leader of men this affair must be settled i desire to be told plainly what it is all about i demand as your best friend to know  the compelling power of authority the persuasive influence of kindness affected powerfully a man just risen from a bed of sickness lieut dhuberts hand which grasped the knob of a stick trembled slightly but his northern temperament sentimental yet cautious and clearsighted too in its idealistic way checked his impulse to make a clean breast of the whole deadly absurdity according to the precept of transcendental wisdom he turned his tongue seven times in his mouth before he spoke he made then only a speech of thanks  the colonel listened interested at first then looked mystified at last he frowned you hesitatemille tonnerres havent i told you that i will condescend to argue with youas a friend  yes colonel answered lieut dhubert gently but i am afraid that after you have heard me out as a friend you will take action as my superior officer  the attentive colonel snapped his jaws well what of that he said frankly is it so damnably disgraceful  it is not negatived lieut dhubert in a faint but firm voice  of course i shall act for the good of the service nothing can prevent me doing that what do you think i want to be told for  i know it is not from idle curiosity protested lieut dhubert i know you will act wisely but what about the good fame of the regiment  it cannot be affected by any youthful folly of a lieutenant said the colonel severely  no it cannot be but it can be by evil tongues it will be said that a lieutenant of the 4th hussars afraid of meeting his adversary is hiding behind his colonel and that would be worse than hiding behind a haystackfor the good of the service i cannot afford to do that colonel  nobody would dare to say anything of the kind began the colonel very fiercely but ended the phrase on an uncertain note the bravery of lieut dhubert was well known but the colonel was well aware that the duelling courage the single combat courage is rightly or wrongly supposed to be courage of a special sort and it was eminently necessary that an officer of his regiment should possess every kind of courageand prove it too the colonel stuck out his lower lip and looked far away with a peculiar glazed stare this was the expression of his perplexityan expression practically unknown to his regiment for perplexity is a sentiment which is incompatible with the rank of colonel of cavalry the colonel himself was overcome by the unpleasant novelty of the sensation as he was not accustomed to think except on professional matters connected with the welfare of men and horses and the proper use thereof on the field of glory his intellectual efforts degenerated into mere mental repetitions of profane language mille tonnerres    sacre nom de nom    he thought  lieut dhubert coughed painfully and added in a weary voice there will be plenty of evil tongues to say that ive been cowed and i am sure you will not expect me to pass that over i may find myself suddenly with a dozen duels on my hands instead of this one affair  the direct simplicity of this argument came home to the colonels understanding he looked at his subordinate fixedly sit down lieutenant he said gruffly this is the very devil of a    sit down  mon colonel dhubert began again i am not afraid of evil tongues theres a way of silencing them but theres my peace of mind too i wouldnt be able to shake off the notion that ive ruined a brother officer whatever action you take it is bound to go farther the inquiry has been droppedlet it rest now it would have been absolutely fatal to feraud  hey what did he behave so badly  yes it was pretty bad muttered lieut dhubert being still very weak he felt a disposition to cry  as the other man did not belong to his own regiment the colonel had no difficulty in believing this he began to pace up and down the room he was a good chief a man capable of discreet sympathy but he was human in other ways too and this became apparent because he was not capable of artifice  the very devil lieutenant he blurted out in the innocence of his heart is that i have declared my intention to get to the bottom of this affair and when a colonel says something    you see     lieut dhubert broke in earnestly let me entreat you colonel to be satisfied with taking my word of honour that i was put into a damnable position where i had no option i had no choice whatever consistent with my dignity as a man and an officer    after all colonel this fact is the very bottom of this affair here youve got it the rest is mere detail     the colonel stopped short the reputation of lieut dhubert for good sense and good temper weighed in the balance a cool head a warm heart open as the day always correct in his behaviour one had to trust him the colonel repressed manfully an immense curiosity hm you affirm that as a man and an officer    no option eh  as an officeran officer of the 4th hussars too insisted lieut dhubert i had not and that is the bottom of the affair colonel  yes but still i dont see why to ones colonel    a colonel is a fatherque diable  lieut dhubert ought not to have been allowed out as yet he was becoming aware of his physical insufficiency with humiliation and despair but the morbid obstinacy of an invalid possessed him and at the same time he felt with dismay his eyes filling with water this trouble seemed too big to handle a tear fell down the thin pale cheek of lieut dhubert  the colonel turned his back on him hastily you could have heard a pin drop this is some silly woman storyis it not  saying these words the chief spun round to seize the truth which is not a beautiful shape living in a well but a shy bird best caught by stratagem this was the last move of the colonels diplomacy he saw the truth shining unmistakably in the gesture of lieut dhubert raising his weak arms and his eyes to heaven in supreme protest  not a woman affaireh growled the colonel staring hard i dont ask you who or where all i want to know is whether there is a woman in it  lieut dhuberts arms dropped and his weak voice was pathetically broken  nothing of the kind mon colonel  on your honour insisted the old warrior  on my honour  very well said the colonel thoughtfully and bit his lip the arguments of lieut dhubert helped by his liking for the man had convinced him on the other hand it was highly improper that his intervention of which he had made no secret should produce no visible effect he kept lieut dhubert a few minutes longer and dismissed him kindly  take a few days more in bed lieutenant what the devil does the surgeon mean by reporting you fit for duty  on coming out of the colonels quarters lieut dhubert said nothing to the friend who was waiting outside to take him home he said nothing to anybody lieut dhubert made no confidences but on the evening of that day the colonel strolling under the elms growing near his quarters in the company of his second in command opened his lips  ive got to the bottom of this affair he remarked the lieutcolonel a dry brown chip of a man with short sidewhiskers pricked up his ears at that without letting a sign of curiosity escape him  its no trifle added the colonel oracularly the other waited for a long while before he murmured  indeed sir  no trifle repeated the colonel looking straight before him ive however forbidden dhubert either to send to or receive a challenge from feraud for the next twelve months  he had imagined this prohibition to save the prestige a colonel should have the result of it was to give an official seal to the mystery surrounding this deadly quarrel lieut dhubert repelled by an impassive silence all attempts to worm the truth out of him lieut feraud secretly uneasy at first regained his assurance as time went on he disguised his ignorance of the meaning of the imposed truce by slight sardonic laughs as though he were amused by what he intended to keep to himself but what will you do his chums used to ask him he contented himself by replying qui vivra verra with a little truculent air and everybody admired his discretion  before the end of the truce lieut dhubert got his troop the promotion was well earned but somehow no one seemed to expect the event when lieut feraud heard of it at a gathering of officers he muttered through his teeth is that so at once he unhooked his sabre from a peg near the door buckled it on carefully and left the company without another word he walked home with measured steps struck a light with his flint and steel and lit his tallow candle then snatching an unlucky glass tumbler off the mantelpiece he dashed it violently on the floor  now that dhubert was an officer of superior rank there could be no question of a duel neither of them could send or receive a challenge without rendering himself amenable to a courtmartial it was not to be thought of lieut feraud who for many days now had experienced no real desire to meet lieut dhubert arms in hand chafed again at the systematic injustice of fate does he think he will escape me in that way he thought indignantly he saw in this promotion an intrigue a conspiracy a cowardly manoeuvre that colonel knew what he was doing he had hastened to recommend his favourite for a step it was outrageous that a man should be able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark and tortuous manner  of a happygolucky disposition of a temperament more pugnacious than military lieut feraud had been content to give and receive blows for sheer love of armed strife and without much thought of advancement but now an urgent desire to get on sprang up in his breast this fighter by vocation resolved in his mind to seize showy occasions and to court the favourable opinion of his chiefs like a mere worldling he knew he was as brave as any one and never doubted his personal charm nevertheless neither the bravery nor the charm seemed to work very swiftly lieut ferauds engaging careless truculence of a beau sabreur underwent a change he began to make bitter allusions to clever fellows who stick at nothing to get on the army was full of them he would say you had only to look round but all the time he had in view one person only his adversary dhubert once he confided to an appreciative friend you see i dont know how to fawn on the right sort of people it isnt in my character  he did not get his step till a week after austerlitz the light cavalry of the grand army had its hands very full of interesting work for a little while directly the pressure of professional occupation had been eased captain feraud took measures to arrange a meeting without loss of time i know my bird he observed grimly if i dont look sharp he will take care to get himself promoted over the heads of a dozen better men than himself hes got the knack for that sort of thing  this duel was fought in silesia if not fought to a finish it was at any rate fought to a standstill the weapon was the cavalry sabre and the skill the science the vigour and the determination displayed by the adversaries compelled the admiration of the beholders it became the subject of talk on both shores of the danube and as far as the garrisons of gratz and laybach they crossed blades seven times both had many cuts which bled profusely both refused to have the combat stopped time after time with what appeared the most deadly animosity this appearance was caused on the part of captain dhubert by a rational desire to be done once for all with this worry on the part of captain feraud by a tremendous exaltation of his pugnacious instincts and the incitement of wounded vanity at last dishevelled their shirts in rags covered with gore and hardly able to stand they were led away forcibly by their marvelling and horrified seconds later on besieged by comrades avid of details these gentlemen declared that they could not have allowed that sort of hacking to go on indefinitely asked whether the quarrel was settled this time they gave it out as their conviction that it was a difference which could only be settled by one of the parties remaining lifeless on the ground the sensation spread from army corps to army corps and penetrated at last to the smallest detachments of the troops cantoned between the rhine and the save in the cafes in vienna it was generally estimated from details to hand that the adversaries would be able to meet again in three weeks time on the outside something really transcendent in the way of duelling was expected  these expectations were brought to naught by the necessities of the service which separated the two officers no official notice had been taken of their quarrel it was now the property of the army and not to be meddled with lightly but the story of the duel or rather their duelling propensities must have stood somewhat in the way of their advancement because they were still captains when they came together again during the war with prussia detached north after jena with the army commanded by marshal bernadotte prince of ponte corvo they entered lubeck together  it was only after the occupation of that town that captain feraud found leisure to consider his future conduct in view of the fact that captain dhubert had been given the position of third aidedecamp to the marshal he considered it a great part of a night and in the morning summoned two sympathetic friends  ive been thinking it over calmly he said gazing at them with bloodshot tired eyes i see that i must get rid of that intriguing personage here hes managed to sneak on to the personal staff of the marshal its a direct provocation to me i cant tolerate a situation in which i am exposed any day to receive an order through him and god knows what order too that sort of thing has happened once beforeand thats once too often he understands this perfectly never fear i cant tell you any more now you know what it is you have to do  this encounter took place outside the town of lubeck on very open ground selected with special care in deference to the general sentiment of the cavalry division belonging to the army corps that this time the two officers should meet on horseback after all this duel was a cavalry affair and to persist in fighting on foot would look like a slight on ones own arm of the service the seconds startled by the unusual nature of the suggestion hastened to refer to their principals captain feraud jumped at it with alacrity for some obscure reason depending no doubt on his psychology he imagined himself invincible on horseback all alone within the four walls of his room he rubbed his hands and muttered triumphantly aha my pretty staff officer ive got you now  captain dhubert on his side after staring hard for a considerable time at his friends shrugged his shoulders slightly this affair had hopelessly and unreasonably complicated his existence for him one absurdity more or less in the development did not matterall absurdity was distasteful to him but urbane as ever he produced a faintly ironical smile and said in his calm voice it certainly will do away to some extent with the monotony of the thing  when left alone he sat down at a table and took his head into his hands he had not spared himself of late and the marshal had been working all his aidesdecamp particularly hard the last three weeks of campaigning in horrible weather had affected his health when overtired he suffered from a stitch in his wounded side and that uncomfortable sensation always depressed him its that brutes doing too he thought bitterly  the day before he had received a letter from home announcing that his only sister was going to be married he reflected that from the time she was nineteen and he twentysix when he went away to garrison life in strasbourg he had had but two short glimpses of her they had been great friends and confidants and now she was going to be given away to a man whom he did not knowa very worthy fellow no doubt but not half good enough for her he would never see his old leonie again she had a capable little head and plenty of tact she would know how to manage the fellow to be sure he was easy in his mind about her happiness but he felt ousted from the first place in her thoughts which had been his ever since the girl could speak a melancholy regret of the days of his childhood settled upon captain dhubert third aidedecamp to the prince of ponte corvo  he threw aside the letter of congratulation he had begun to write as in duty bound but without enthusiasm he took a fresh piece of paper and traced on it the words this is my last will and testament looking at these words he gave himself up to unpleasant reflection a presentiment that he would never see the scenes of his childhood weighed down the equable spirits of captain dhubert he jumped up pushing his chair back yawned elaborately in sign that he didnt care anything for presentiments and throwing himself on the bed went to sleep during the night he shivered from time to time without waking up in the morning he rode out of town between his two seconds talking of indifferent things and looking right and left with apparent detachment into the heavy morning mists shrouding the flat green fields bordered by hedges he leaped a ditch and saw the forms of many mounted men moving in the fog we are to fight before a gallery it seems he muttered to himself bitterly  his seconds were rather concerned at the state of the atmosphere but presently a pale sickly sun struggled out of the low vapours and captain dhubert made out in the distance three horsemen riding a little apart from the others it was captain feraud and his seconds he drew his sabre and assured himself that it was properly fastened to his wrist and now the seconds who had been standing in close group with the heads of their horses together separated at an easy canter leaving a large clear field between him and his adversary captain dhubert looked at the pale sun at the dismal fields and the imbecility of the impending fight filled him with desolation from a distant part of the field a stentorian voice shouted commands at proper intervals au pasau trotcharrrgez    presentiments of death dont come to a man for nothing he thought at the very moment he put spurs to his horse  and therefore he was more than surprised when at the very first setto captain feraud laid himself open to a cut over the forehead which blinding him with blood ended the combat almost before it had fairly begun it was impossible to go on captain dhubert leaving his enemy swearing horribly and reeling in the saddle between his two appalled friends leaped the ditch again into the road and trotted home with his two seconds who seemed rather awestruck at the speedy issue of that encounter in the evening captain dhubert finished the congratulatory letter on his sisters marriage  he finished it late it was a long letter captain dhubert gave reins to his fancy he told his sister that he would feel rather lonely after this great change in her life but then the day would come for him too to get married in fact he was thinking already of the time when there would be no one left to fight with in europe and the epoch of wars would be over i expect then he wrote to be within measurable distance of a marshals baton and you will be an experienced married woman you shall look out a wife for me i will be probably bald by then and a little blase i shall require a young girl pretty of course and with a large fortune which should help me to close my glorious career in the splendour befitting my exalted rank he ended with the information that he had just given a lesson to a worrying quarrelsome fellow who imagined he had a grievance against him but if you in the depths of your province he continued ever hear it said that your brother is of a quarrelsome disposition dont you believe it on any account there is no saying what gossip from the army may reach your innocent ears whatever you hear you may rest assured that your everloving brother is not a duellist then captain dhubert crumpled up the blank sheet of paper headed with the words this is my last will and testament and threw it in the fire with a great laugh at himself he didnt care a snap for what that lunatic could do he had suddenly acquired the conviction that his adversary was utterly powerless to affect his life in any sort of way except perhaps in the way of putting a special excitement into the delightful gay intervals between the campaigns  from this on there were however to be no peaceful intervals in the career of captain dhubert he saw the fields of eylau and friedland marched and countermarched in the snow in the mud in the dust of polish plains picking up distinction and advancement on all the roads of northeastern europe meantime captain feraud despatched southwards with his regiment made unsatisfactory war in spain it was only when the preparations for the russian campaign began that he was ordered north again he left the country of mantillas and oranges without regret  the first signs of a not unbecoming baldness added to the lofty aspect of colonel dhuberts forehead this feature was no longer white and smooth as in the days of his youth the kindly open glance of his blue eyes had grown a little hard as if from much peering through the smoke of battles the ebony crop on colonel ferauds head coarse and crinkly like a cap of horsehair showed many silver threads about the temples a detestable warfare of ambushes and inglorious surprises had not improved his temper the beaklike curve of his nose was unpleasantly set off by a deep fold on each side of his mouth the round orbits of his eyes radiated wrinkles more than ever he recalled an irritable and staring birdsomething like a cross between a parrot and an owl he was still extremely outspoken in his dislike of intriguing fellows he seized every opportunity to state that he did not pick up his rank in the anterooms of marshals the unlucky persons civil or military who with an intention of being pleasant begged colonel feraud to tell them how he came by that very apparent scar on the forehead were astonished to find themselves snubbed in various ways some of which were simply rude and others mysteriously sardonic young officers were warned kindly by their more experienced comrades not to stare openly at the colonels scar but indeed an officer need have been very young in his profession not to have heard the legendary tale of that duel originating in a mysterious unforgivable offence   iii   the retreat from moscow submerged all private feelings in a sea of disaster and misery colonels without regiments dhubert and feraud carried the musket in the ranks of the socalled sacred battaliona battalion recruited from officers of all arms who had no longer any troops to lead  in that battalion promoted colonels did duty as sergeants the generals captained the companies a marshal of france prince of the empire commanded the whole all had provided themselves with muskets picked up on the road and with cartridges taken from the dead in the general destruction of the bonds of discipline and duty holding together the companies the battalions the regiments the brigades and divisions of an armed host this body of men put its pride in preserving some semblance of order and formation the only stragglers were those who fell out to give up to the frost their exhausted souls they plodded on and their passage did not disturb the mortal silence of the plains shining with the livid light of snows under a sky the colour of ashes whirlwinds ran along the fields broke against the dark column enveloped it in a turmoil of flying icicles and subsided disclosing it creeping on its tragic way without the swing and rhythm of the military pace it struggled onwards the men exchanging neither words nor looks whole ranks marched touching elbow day after day and never raising their eyes from the ground as if lost in despairing reflections in the dumb black forests of pines the cracking of overloaded branches was the only sound they heard often from daybreak to dusk no one spoke in the whole column it was like a macabre march of struggling corpses towards a distant grave only an alarm of cossacks could restore to their eyes a semblance of martial resolution the battalion faced about and deployed or formed square under the endless fluttering of snowflakes a cloud of horsemen with fur caps on their heads levelled long lances and yelled hurrah hurrah around their menacing immobility whence with muffled detonations hundreds of dark red flames darted through the air thick with falling snow in a very few moments the horsemen would disappear as if carried off yelling in the gale and the sacred battalion standing still alone in the blizzard heard only the howling of the wind whose blasts searched their very hearts then with a cry or two of vive lempereur it would resume its march leaving behind a few lifeless bodies lying huddled up tiny black specks on the white immensity of the snows  though often marching in the ranks or skirmishing in the woods side by side the two officers ignored each other this not so much from inimical intention as from a very real indifference all their store of moral energy was expended in resisting the terrific enmity of nature and the crushing sense of irretrievable disaster to the last they counted among the most active the least demoralized of the battalion their vigorous vitality invested them both with the appearance of an heroic pair in the eyes of their comrades and they never exchanged more than a casual word or two except one day when skirmishing in front of the battalion against a worrying attack of cavalry they found themselves cut off in the woods by a small party of cossacks a score of furcapped hairy horsemen rode to and fro brandishing their lances in ominous silence but the two officers had no mind to lay down their arms and colonel feraud suddenly spoke up in a hoarse growling voice bringing his firelock to the shoulder you take the nearest brute colonel dhubert ill settle the next one i am a better shot than you are  colonel dhubert nodded over his levelled musket their shoulders were pressed against the trunk of a large tree on their front enormous snowdrifts protected them from a direct charge two carefully aimed shots rang out in the frosty air two cossacks reeled in their saddles the rest not thinking the game good enough closed round their wounded comrades and galloped away out of range the two officers managed to rejoin their battalion halted for the night during that afternoon they had leaned upon each other more than once and towards the end colonel dhubert whose long legs gave him an advantage in walking through soft snow peremptorily took the musket of colonel feraud from him and carried it on his shoulder using his own as a staff  on the outskirts of a village half buried in the snow an old wooden barn burned with a clear and an immense flame the sacred battalion of skeletons muffled in rags crowded greedily the windward side stretching hundreds of numbed bony hands to the blaze nobody had noted their approach before entering the circle of light playing on the sunken glassyeyed starved faces colonel dhubert spoke in his turn  heres your musket colonel feraud i can walk better than you  colonel feraud nodded and pushed on towards the warmth of the fierce flames colonel dhubert was more deliberate but not the less bent on getting a place in the front rank those they shouldered aside tried to greet with a faint cheer the reappearance of the two indomitable companions in activity and endurance those manly qualities had never perhaps received a higher tribute than this feeble acclamation  this is the faithful record of speeches exchanged during the retreat from moscow by colonels feraud and dhubert colonel ferauds taciturnity was the outcome of concentrated rage short hairy black faced with layers of grime and the thick sprouting of a wiry beard a frostbitten hand wrapped up in filthy rags carried in a sling he accused fate of unparalleled perfidy towards the sublime man of destiny colonel dhubert his long moustaches pendent in icicles on each side of his cracked blue lips his eyelids inflamed with the glare of snows the principal part of his costume consisting of a sheepskin coat looted with difficulty from the frozen corpse of a camp follower found in an abandoned cart took a more thoughtful view of events his regularly handsome features now reduced to mere bony lines and fleshless hollows looked out of a womans black velvet hood over which was rammed forcibly a cocked hat picked up under the wheels of an empty army fourgon which must have contained at one time some general officers luggage the sheepskin coat being short for a man of his inches ended very high up and the skin of his legs blue with the cold showed through the tatters of his nether garments this under the circumstances provoked neither jeers nor pity no one cared how the next man felt or looked colonel dhubert himself hardened to exposure suffered mainly in his selfrespect from the lamentable indecency of his costume a thoughtless person may think that with a whole host of inanimate bodies bestrewing the path of retreat there could not have been much difficulty in supplying the deficiency but to loot a pair of breeches from a frozen corpse is not so easy as it may appear to a mere theorist it requires time and labour you must remain behind while your companions march on colonel dhubert had his scruples as to falling out once he had stepped aside he could not be sure of ever rejoining his battalion and the ghastly intimacy of a wrestling match with the frozen dead opposing the unyielding rigidity of iron to your violence was repugnant to the delicacy of his feelings luckily one day grubbing in a mound of snow between the huts of a village in the hope of finding there a frozen potato or some vegetable garbage he could put between his long and shaky teeth colonel dhubert uncovered a couple of mats of the sort russian peasants use to line the sides of their carts with these beaten free of frozen snow bent about his elegant person and fastened solidly round his waist made a bellshaped nether garment a sort of stiff petticoat which rendered colonel dhubert a perfectly decent but a much more noticeable figure than before  thus accoutred he continued to retreat never doubting of his personal escape but full of other misgivings the early buoyancy of his belief in the future was destroyed if the road of glory led through such unforeseen passages he asked himselffor he was reflectivewhether the guide was altogether trustworthy it was a patriotic sadness not unmingled with some personal concern and quite unlike the unreasoning indignation against men and things nursed by colonel feraud recruiting his strength in a little german town for three weeks colonel dhubert was surprised to discover within himself a love of repose his returning vigour was strangely pacific in its aspirations he meditated silently upon this bizarre change of mood no doubt many of his brother officers of field rank went through the same moral experience but these were not the times to talk of it in one of his letters home colonel dhubert wrote all your plans my dear leonie for marrying me to the charming girl you have discovered in your neighbourhood seem farther off than ever peace is not yet europe wants another lesson it will be a hard task for us but it shall be done because the emperor is invincible  thus wrote colonel d hubert from pomerania to his married sister leonie settled in the south of france and so far the sentiments expressed would not have been disowned by colonel feraud who wrote no letters to anybody whose father had been in life an illiterate blacksmith who had no sister or brother and whom no one desired ardently to pair off for a life of peace with a charming young girl but colonel d huberts letter contained also some philosophical generalities upon the uncertainty of all personal hopes when bound up entirely with the prestigious fortune of one incomparably great it is true yet still remaining but a man in his greatness this view would have appeared rank heresy to colonel feraud some melancholy forebodings of a military kind expressed cautiously would have been pronounced as nothing short of high treason by colonel feraud but leonie the sister of colonel dhubert read them with profound satisfaction and folding the letter thoughtfully remarked to herself that armand was likely to prove eventually a sensible fellow since her marriage into a southern family she had become a convinced believer in the return of the legitimate king hopeful and anxious she offered prayers night and morning and burnt candles in churches for the safety and prosperity of her brother  she had every reason to suppose that her prayers were heard colonel dhubert passed through lutzen bautzen and leipsic losing no limb and acquiring additional reputation adapting his conduct to the needs of that desperate time he had never voiced his misgivings he concealed them under a cheerful courtesy of such pleasant character that people were inclined to ask themselves with wonder whether colonel dhubert was aware of any disasters not only his manners but even his glances remained untroubled the steady amenity of his blue eyes disconcerted all grumblers and made despair itself pause  this bearing was remarked favourably by the emperor himself for colonel dhubert attached now to the majorgenerals staff came on several occasions under the imperial eye but it exasperated the higher strung nature of colonel feraud passing through magdeburg on service this last allowed himself while seated gloomily at dinner with the commandant de place to say of his lifelong adversary this man does not love the emperor and his words were received by the other guests in profound silence colonel feraud troubled in his conscience at the atrocity of the aspersion felt the need to back it up by a good argument i ought to know him he cried adding some oaths one studies ones adversary i have met him on the ground half a dozen times as all the army knows what more do you want if that isnt opportunity enough for any fool to size up his man may the devil take me if i can tell what is and he looked around the table obstinate and sombre  later on in paris while extremely busy reorganizing his regiment colonel feraud learned that colonel dhubert had been made a general he glared at his informant incredulously then folded his arms and turned away muttering nothing surprises me on the part of that man  and aloud he added speaking over his shoulder you would oblige me greatly by telling general dhubert at the first opportunity that his advancement saves him for a time from a pretty hot encounter i was only waiting for him to turn up here  the other officer remonstrated  could you think of it colonel feraud at this time when every life should be consecrated to the glory and safety of france  but the strain of unhappiness caused by military reverses had spoiled colonel ferauds character like many other men he was rendered wicked by misfortune  i cannot consider general dhuberts existence of any account either for the glory or safety of france he snapped viciously you dont pretend perhaps to know him better than i doi who have met him half a dozen times on the grounddo you  his interlocutor a young man was silenced colonel feraud walked up and down the room  this is not the time to mince matters he said i cant believe that that man ever loved the emperor he picked up his generals stars under the boots of marshal berthier very well ill get mine in another fashion and then we shall settle this business which has been dragging on too long  general dhubert informed indirectly of colonel ferauds attitude made a gesture as if to put aside an importunate person his thoughts were solicited by graver cares he had had no time to go and see his family his sister whose royalist hopes were rising higher every day though proud of her brother regretted his recent advancement in a measure because it put on him a prominent mark of the usurpers favour which later on could have an adverse influence upon his career he wrote to her that no one but an inveterate enemy could say he had got his promotion by favour as to his career he assured her that he looked no farther forward into the future than the next battlefield  beginning the campaign of france in this dogged spirit general dhubert was wounded on the second day of the battle under laon while being carried off the field he heard that colonel feraud promoted this moment to general had been sent to replace him at the head of his brigade he cursed his luck impulsively not being able at the first glance to discern all the advantages of a nasty wound and yet it was by this heroic method that providence was shaping his future travelling slowly south to his sisters country home under the care of a trusty old servant general dhubert was spared the humiliating contacts and the perplexities of conduct which assailed the men of napoleonic empire at the moment of its downfall lying in his bed with the windows of his room open wide to the sunshine of provence he perceived the undisguised aspect of the blessing conveyed by that jagged fragment of a prussian shell which killing his horse and ripping open his thigh saved him from an active conflict with his conscience after the last fourteen years spent sword in hand in the saddle and with the sense of his duty done to the very end general dhubert found resignation an easy virtue his sister was delighted with his reasonableness i leave myself altogether in your hands my dear leonie he had said to her  he was still laid up when the credit of his brotherinlaws family being exerted on his behalf he received from the royal government not only the confirmation of his rank but the assurance of being retained on the active list to this was added an unlimited convalescent leave the unfavourable opinion entertained of him in bonapartist circles though it rested on nothing more solid than the unsupported pronouncement of general feraud was directly responsible for general dhuberts retention on the active list as to general feraud his rank was confirmed too it was more than he dared to expect but marshal soult then minister of war to the restored king was partial to officers who had served in spain only not even the marshals protection could secure for him active employment he remained irreconcilable idle and sinister he sought in obscure restaurants the company of other halfpay officers who cherished dingy but glorious old tricolour cockades in their breastpockets and buttoned with the forbidden eagle buttons their shabby uniforms declaring themselves too poor to afford the expense of the prescribed change  the triumphant return from elba an historical fact as marvellous and incredible as the exploits of some mythological demigod found general dhubert still quite unable to sit a horse neither could he walk very well these disabilities which madame leonie accounted most lucky helped to keep her brother out of all possible mischief his frame of mind at that time she noted with dismay became very far from reasonable this general officer still menaced by the loss of a limb was discovered one night in the stables of the chateau by a groom who seeing a light raised an alarm of thieves his crutch was lying halfburied in the straw of the litter and the general was hopping on one leg in a loose box around a snorting horse he was trying to saddle such were the effects of imperial magic upon a calm temperament and a pondered mind beset in the light of stable lanterns by the tears entreaties indignation remonstrances and reproaches of his family he got out of the difficult situation by fainting away there and then in the arms of his nearest relatives and was carried off to bed before he got out of it again the second reign of napoleon the hundred days of feverish agitation and supreme effort passed away like a terrifying dream the tragic year 1815 begun in the trouble and unrest of consciences was ending in vengeful proscriptions  how general feraud escaped the clutches of the special commission and the last offices of a firing squad he never knew himself it was partly due to the subordinate position he was assigned during the hundred days the emperor had never given him active command but had kept him busy at the cavalry depot in paris mounting and despatching hastily drilled troopers into the field considering this task as unworthy of his abilities he had discharged it with no offensively noticeable zeal but for the greater part he was saved from the excesses of royalist reaction by the interference of general dhubert  this last still on convalescent leave but able now to travel had been despatched by his sister to paris to present himself to his legitimate sovereign as no one in the capital could possibly know anything of the episode in the stable he was received there with distinction military to the very bottom of his soul the prospect of rising in his profession consoled him from finding himself the butt of bonapartist malevolence which pursued him with a persistence he could not account for all the rancour of that embittered and persecuted party pointed to him as the man who had never loved the emperora sort of monster essentially worse than a mere betrayer  general dhubert shrugged his shoulders without anger at this ferocious prejudice rejected by his old friends and mistrusting profoundly the advances of royalist society the young and handsome general he was barely forty adopted a manner of cold punctilious courtesy which at the merest shadow of an intended slight passed easily into harsh haughtiness thus prepared general dhubert went about his affairs in paris feeling inwardly very happy with the peculiar uplifting happiness of a man very much in love the charming girl looked out by his sister had come upon the scene and had conquered him in the thorough manner in which a young girl by merely existing in his sight can make a man of forty her own they were going to be married as soon as general dhubert had obtained his official nomination to a promised command  one afternoon sitting on the terrasse of the cafe tortoni general dhubert learned from the conversation of two strangers occupying a table near his own that general feraud included in the batch of superior officers arrested after the second return of the king was in danger of passing before the special commission living all his spare moments as is frequently the case with expectant lovers a day in advance of reality and in a state of bestarred hallucination it required nothing less than the name of his perpetual antagonist pronounced in a loud voice to call the youngest of napoleons generals away from the mental contemplation of his betrothed he looked round the strangers wore civilian clothes lean and weatherbeaten lolling back in their chairs they scowled at people with moody and defiant abstraction from under their hats pulled low over their eyes it was not difficult to recognize them for two of the compulsorily retired officers of the old guard as from bravado or carelessness they chose to speak in loud tones general dhubert who saw no reason why he should change his seat heard every word they did not seem to be the personal friends of general feraud his name came up amongst others hearing it repeated general dhuberts tender anticipations of a domestic future adorned with a womans grace were traversed by the harsh regret of his warlike past of that one long intoxicating clash of arms unique in the magnitude of its glory and disasterthe marvellous work and the special possession of his own generation he felt an irrational tenderness towards his old adversary and appreciated emotionally the murderous absurdity their encounter had introduced into his life it was like an additional pinch of spice in a hot dish he remembered the flavour with sudden melancholy he would never taste it again it was all over i fancy it was being left lying in the garden that had exasperated him so against me from the first he thought indulgently   the two strangers at the next table had fallen silent after the third mention of general ferauds name presently the elder of the two speaking again in a bitter tone affirmed that general ferauds account was settled and why simply because he was not like some bigwigs who loved only themselves the royalists knew they could never make anything of him he loved the other too well  the other was the man of st helena the two officers nodded and touched glasses before they drank to an impossible return then the same who had spoken before remarked with a sardonic laugh his adversary showed more cleverness  what adversary asked the younger as if puzzled  dont you know they were two hussars at each promotion they fought a duel havent you heard of the duel going on ever since 1801  the other had heard of the duel of course now he understood the allusion general baron dhubert would be able now to enjoy his fat kings favour in peace  much good may it do to him mumbled the elder they were both brave men i never saw this dhuberta sort of intriguing dandy i am told but i can well believe what ive heard feraud say of himthat he never loved the emperor  they rose and went away  general dhubert experienced the horror of a somnambulist who wakes up from a complacent dream of activity to find himself walking on a quagmire a profound disgust of the ground on which he was making his way overcame him even the image of the charming girl was swept from his view in the flood of moral distress everything he had ever been or hoped to be would taste of bitter ignominy unless he could manage to save general feraud from the fate which threatened so many braves under the impulse of this almost morbid need to attend to the safety of his adversary general dhubert worked so well with hands and feet as the french saying is that in less than twentyfour hours he found means of obtaining an extraordinary private audience from the minister of police  general baron dhubert was shown in suddenly without preliminaries in the dusk of the ministers cabinet behind the forms of writingdesk chairs and tables between two bunches of wax candles blazing in sconces he beheld a figure in a gorgeous coat posturing before a tall mirror the old conventionnel fouche senator of the empire traitor to every man to every principle and motive of human conduct duke of otranto and the wily artizan of the second restoration was trying the fit of a court suit in which his young and accomplished fiancee had declared her intention to have his portrait painted on porcelain it was a caprice a charming fancy which the first minister of police of the second restoration was anxious to gratify for that man often compared in wiliness of conduct to a fox but whose ethical side could be worthily symbolized by nothing less emphatic than a skunk was as much possessed by his love as general dhubert himself  startled to be discovered thus by the blunder of a servant he met this little vexation with the characteristic impudence which had served his turn so well in the endless intrigues of his selfseeking career without altering his attitude a hairsbreadth one leg in a silk stocking advanced his head twisted over his left shoulder he called out calmly this way general pray approach well i am all attention  while general dhubert ill at ease as if one of his own little weaknesses had been exposed presented his request as shortly as possible the duke of otranto went on feeling the fit of his collar settling the lapels before the glass and buckling his back in an effort to behold the set of the gold embroidered coatskirts behind his still face his attentive eyes could not have expressed a more complete interest in those matters if he had been alone  exclude from the operations of the special court a certain feraud gabriel florian general of brigade of the promotion of 1814 he repeated in a slightly wondering tone and then turned away from the glass why exclude him precisely   i am surprised that your excellency so competent in the evaluation of men of his time should have thought worth while to have that name put down on the list  a rabid bonapartist  so is every grenadier and every trooper of the army as your excellency well knows and the individuality of general feraud can have no more weight than that of any casual grenadier he is a man of no mental grasp of no capacity whatever it is inconceivable that he should ever have any influence  he has a wellhung tongue though interjected fouche  noisy i admit but not dangerous  i will not dispute with you i know next to nothing of him hardly his name in fact  and yet your excellency has the presidency of the commission charged by the king to point out those who were to be tried said general dhubert with an emphasis which did not miss the ministers ear  yes general he said walking away into the dark part of the vast room and throwing himself into a deep armchair that swallowed him up all but the soft gleam of gold embroideries and the pallid patch of the faceyes general take this chair there  general dhubert sat down  yes general continued the archmaster in the arts of intrigue and betrayals whose duplicity as if at times intolerable to his selfknowledge found relief in bursts of cynical openness i did hurry on the formation of the proscribing commission and i took its presidency and do you know why simply from fear that if i did not take it quickly into my hands my own name would head the list of the proscribed such are the times in which we live but i am minister of the king yet and i ask you plainly why i should take the name of this obscure feraud off the list you wonder how his name got there is it possible that you should know men so little my dear general at the very first sitting of the commission names poured on us like rain off the roof of the tuileries names we had our choice of thousands how do you know that the name of this feraud whose life or death dont matter to france does not keep out some other name  the voice out of the armchair stopped opposite general dhubert sat still shadowy and silent only his sabre clinked slightly the voice in the armchair began again and we must try to satisfy the exigencies of the allied sovereigns too the prince de talleyrand told me only yesterday that nesselrode had informed him officially of his majesty the emperor alexanders dissatisfaction at the small number of examples the government of the king intends to makeespecially amongst military men i tell you this confidentially  upon my word broke out general dhubert speaking through his teeth if your excellency deigns to favour me with any more confidential information i dont know what i will do its enough to break ones sword over ones knee and fling the pieces     what government you imagined yourself to be serving interrupted the minister sharply  after a short pause the crestfallen voice of general dhubert answered the government of france  thats paying your conscience off with mere words general the truth is that you are serving a government of returned exiles of men who have been without country for twenty years of men also who have just got over a very bad and humiliating fright    have no illusions on that score  the duke of otranto ceased he had relieved himself and had attained his object of stripping some selfrespect off that man who had inconveniently discovered him posturing in a goldembroidered court costume before a mirror but they were a hotheaded lot in the army it occurred to him that it would be inconvenient if a welldisposed general officer received in audience on the recommendation of one of the princes were to do something rashly scandalous directly after a private interview with the minister in a changed tone he put a question to the point your relationthis feraud  no no relation at all  intimate friend  intimate    yes there is between us an intimate connection of a nature which makes it a point of honour with me to try     the minister rang a bell without waiting for the end of the phrase when the servant had gone out after bringing in a pair of heavy silver candelabra for the writingdesk the duke of otranto rose his breast glistening all over with gold in the strong light and taking a piece of paper out of a drawer held it in his hand ostentatiously while he said with persuasive gentleness you must not speak of breaking your sword across your knee general perhaps you would never get another the emperor will not return this time    diable dhomme there was just a moment here in paris soon after waterloo when he frightened me it looked as though he were ready to begin all over again luckily one never does begin all over again really you must not think of breaking your sword general  general dhubert looking on the ground moved slightly his hand in a hopeless gesture of renunciation the minister of police turned his eyes away from him and scanned deliberately the paper he had been holding up all the time  there are only twenty general officers selected to be made an example of twenty a round number and lets see feraud    ah hes there gabriel florian parfaitement thats your man well there will be only nineteen examples made now  general dhubert stood up feeling as though he had gone through an infectious illness i must beg your excellency to keep my interference a profound secret i attach the greatest importance to his never learning     who is going to inform him i should like to know said fouche raising his eyes curiously to general dhuberts tense set face take one of these pens and run it through the name yourself this is the only list in existence if you are careful to take up enough ink no one will be able to tell what was the name struck out but par exemple i am not responsible for what clarke will do with him afterwards if he persists in being rabid he will be ordered by the minister of war to reside in some provincial town under the supervision of the police  a few days later general dhubert was saying to his sister after the first greetings had been got over ah my dear leonie it seemed to me i couldnt get away from paris quick enough  effect of love she suggested with a malicious smile  and horror added general dhubert with profound seriousness i have nearly died there of    of nausea  his face was contracted with disgust and as his sister looked at him attentively he continued i have had to see fouche i have had an audience i have been in his cabinet there remains with one who had the misfortune to breathe the air of the same room with that man a sense of diminished dignity an uneasy feeling of being not so clean after all as one hoped one was    but you cant understand  she nodded quickly several times she understood very well on the contrary she knew her brother thoroughly and liked him as he was moreover the scorn and loathing of mankind were the lot of the jacobin fouche who exploiting for his own advantage every weakness every virtue every generous illusion of mankind made dupes of his whole generation and died obscurely as duke of otranto  my dear armand she said compassionately what could you want from that man  nothing less than a life answered general dhubert and ive got it it had to be done but i feel yet as if i could never forgive the necessity to the man i had to save  general feraud totally unable as is the case with most of us to comprehend what was happening to him received the minister of wars order to proceed at once to a small town of central france with feelings whose natural expression consisted in a fierce rolling of the eye and savage grinding of the teeth the passing away of the state of war the only condition of society he had ever known the horrible view of a world at peace frightened him he went away to his little town firmly convinced that this could not last there he was informed of his retirement from the army and that his pension calculated on the scale of a colonels rank was made dependent on the correctness of his conduct and on the good reports of the police no longer in the army he felt suddenly strange to the earth like a disembodied spirit it was impossible to exist but at first he reacted from sheer incredulity this could not be he waited for thunder earthquakes natural cataclysms but nothing happened the leaden weight of an irremediable idleness descended upon general feraud who having no resources within himself sank into a state of aweinspiring hebetude he haunted the streets of the little town gazing before him with lacklustre eyes disregarding the hats raised on his passage and people nudging each other as he went by whispered thats poor general feraud his heart is broken behold how he loved the emperor  the other living wreckage of napoleonic tempest clustered round general feraud with infinite respect he himself imagined his soul to be crushed by grief he suffered from quickly succeeding impulses to weep to howl to bite his fists till blood came to spend days on his bed with his head thrust under the pillow but these arose from sheer ennui from the anguish of an immense indescribable inconceivable boredom his mental inability to grasp the hopeless nature of his case as a whole saved him from suicide he never even thought of it once he thought of nothing but his appetite abandoned him and the difficulty he experienced to express the overwhelming nature of his feelings the most furious swearing could do no justice to it induced gradually a habit of silencea sort of death to a southern temperament  great therefore was the sensation amongst the anciens militaires frequenting a certain little cafe full of flies when one stuffy afternoon that poor general feraud let out suddenly a volley of formidable curses  he had been sitting quietly in his own privileged corner looking through the paris gazettes with just as much interest as a condemned man on the eve of execution could be expected to show in the news of the day ill find out presently that i am alive yet he declared in a dogmatic tone however this is a private affair an old affair of honour bah our honour does not matter here we are driven off with a split ear like a lot of cast troop horsesgood only for a knackers yard but it would be like striking a blow for the emperor    messieurs i shall require the assistance of two of you  every man moved forward general feraud deeply touched by this demonstration called with visible emotion upon the oneeyed veteran cuirassier and the officer of the chasseurs a cheval who had left the tip of his nose in russia he excused his choice to the others  a cavalry affair thisyou know  he was answered with a varied chorus of parfaitement mon general     cest juste    parbleu cest connu    everybody was satisfied the three left the cafe together followed by cries of bonne chance  outside they linked arms the general in the middle the three rusty cocked hats worn en bataille with a sinister forward slant barred the narrow street nearly right across the overheated little town of grey stones and red tiles was drowsing away its provincial afternoon under a blue sky the loud blows of a cooper hooping a cask reverberated regularly between the houses the general dragged his left foot a little in the shade of the walls  this damned winter of 1813 has got into my bones for good never mind we must take pistols thats all a little lumbago we must have pistols hes game for my bag my eyes are as keen as ever you should have seen me in russia picking off the dodging cossacks with a beastly old infantry musket i have a natural gift for firearms  in this strain general feraud ran on holding up his head with owlish eyes and rapacious beak a mere fighter all his life a cavalry man a sabreur he conceived war with the utmost simplicity as in the main a massed lot of personal contests a sort of gregarious duelling and here he had in hand a war of his own he revived the shadow of peace passed away from him like the shadow of death it was the marvellous resurrection of the named feraud gabriel florian engage volontaire of 1793 general of 1814 buried without ceremony by means of a service order signed by the war minister of the second restoration   iv   no man succeeds in everything he undertakes in that sense we are all failures the great point is not to fail in ordering and sustaining the effort of our life in this matter vanity is what leads us astray it hurries us into situations from which we must come out damaged whereas pride is our safeguard by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our endeavour as much as by the virtue of its sustaining power  general dhubert was proud and reserved he had not been damaged by his casual love affairs successful or otherwise in his warscarred body his heart at forty remained unscratched entering with reserve into his sisters matrimonial plans he had felt himself falling irremediably in love as one falls off a roof he was too proud to be frightened indeed the sensation was too delightful to be alarming  the inexperience of a man of forty is a much more serious thing than the inexperience of a youth of twenty for it is not helped out by the rashness of hot blood the girl was mysterious as young girls are by the mere effect of their guarded ingenuity and to him the mysteriousness of that young girl appeared exceptional and fascinating but there was nothing mysterious about the arrangements of the match which madame leonie had promoted there was nothing peculiar either it was a very appropriate match commending itself extremely to the young ladys mother the father was dead and tolerable to the young ladys unclean old emigre lately returned from germany and pervading cane in hand a lean ghost of the ancien regime the garden walks of the young ladys ancestral home  general dhubert was not the man to be satisfied merely with the woman and the fortunewhen it came to the point his pride and pride aims always at true success would be satisfied with nothing short of love but as true pride excludes vanity he could not imagine any reason why this mysterious creature with deep and brilliant eyes of a violet colour should have any feeling for him warmer than indifference the young lady her name was adele baffled every attempt at a clear understanding on that point it is true that the attempts were clumsy and made timidly because by then general dhubert had become acutely aware of the number of his years of his wounds of his many moral imperfections of his secret unworthinessand had incidentally learned by experience the meaning of the word funk as far as he could make out she seemed to imply that with an unbounded confidence in her mothers affection and sagacity she felt no unsurmountable dislike for the person of general dhubert and that this was quite sufficient for a wellbroughtup young lady to begin married life upon this view hurt and tormented the pride of general dhubert and yet he asked himself with a sort of sweet despair what more could he expect she had a quiet and luminous forehead her violet eyes laughed while the lines of her lips and chin remained composed in admirable gravity all this was set off by such a glorious mass of fair hair by a complexion so marvellous by such a grace of expression that general dhubert really never found the opportunity to examine with sufficient detachment the lofty exigencies of his pride in fact he became shy of that line of inquiry since it had led once or twice to a crisis of solitary passion in which it was borne upon him that he loved her enough to kill her rather than lose her from such passages not unknown to men of forty he would come out broken exhausted remorseful a little dismayed he derived however considerable comfort from the quietist practice of sitting now and then half the night by an open window and meditating upon the wonder of her existence like a believer lost in the mystic contemplation of his faith  it must not be supposed that all these variations of his inward state were made manifest to the world general d hubert found no difficulty in appearing wreathed in smiles because in fact he was very happy he followed the established rules of his condition sending over flowers from his sisters garden and hothouses early every morning and a little later following himself to lunch with his intended her mother and her emigre uncle the middle of the day was spent in strolling or sitting in the shade a watchful deference trembling on the verge of tenderness was the note of their intercourse on his sidewith a playful turn of the phrase concealing the profound trouble of his whole being caused by her inaccessible nearness late in the afternoon general d hubert walked home between the fields of vines sometimes intensely miserable sometimes supremely happy sometimes pensively sad but always feeling a special intensity of existence that elation common to artists poets and loversto men haunted by a great passion a noble thought or a new vision of plastic beauty  the outward world at that time did not exist with any special distinctness for general dhubert one evening however crossing a ridge from which he could see both houses general dhubert became aware of two figures far down the road the day had been divine the festal decoration of the inflamed sky lent a gentle glow to the sober tints of the southern land the grey rocks the brown fields the purple undulating distances harmonized in luminous accord exhaled already the scents of the evening the two figures down the road presented themselves like two rigid and wooden silhouettes all black on the ribbon of white dust general dhubert made out the long straight military capotes buttoned closely right up to the black stocks the cocked hats the lean carven brown countenancesold soldiersvieilles moustaches the taller of the two had a black patch over one eye the others hard dry countenance presented some bizarre disquieting peculiarity which on nearer approach proved to be the absence of the tip of the nose lifting their hands with one movement to salute the slightly lame civilian walking with a thick stick they inquired for the house where the general baron dhubert lived and what was the best way to get speech with him quietly  if you think this quiet enough said general dhubert looking round at the vinefields framed in purple lines and dominated by the nest of grey and drab walls of a village clustering around the top of a conical hill so that the blunt church tower seemed but the shape of a crowning rockif you think this spot quiet enough you can speak to him at once and i beg you comrades to speak openly with perfect confidence  they stepped back at this and raised again their hands to their hats with marked ceremoniousness then the one with the chipped nose speaking for both remarked that the matter was confidential enough and to be arranged discreetly their general quarters were established in that village over there where the infernal clodhoppersdamn their false royalist heartslooked remarkably crosseyed at three unassuming military men for the present he should only ask for the name of general dhuberts friends  what friends said the astonished general dhubert completely off the track i am staying with my brotherinlaw over there  well he will do for one said the chipped veteran  were the friends of general feraud interjected the other who had kept silent till then only glowering with his one eye at the man who had never loved the emperor that was something to look at for even the goldlaced judases who had sold him to the english the marshals and princes had loved him at some time or other but this man had never loved the emperor general feraud had said so distinctly  general dhubert felt an inward blow in his chest for an infinitesimal fraction of a second it was as if the spinning of the earth had become perceptible with an awful slight rustle in the eternal stillness of space but this noise of blood in his ears passed off at once involuntarily he murmured feraud i had forgotten his existence  hes existing at present very uncomfortably it is true in the infamous inn of that nest of savages up there said the oneeyed cuirassier drily we arrived in your parts an hour ago on post horses hes awaiting our return with impatience there is hurry you know the general has broken the ministerial order to obtain from you the satisfaction hes entitled to by the laws of honour and naturally hes anxious to have it all over before the gendarmerie gets on his scent  the other elucidated the idea a little further get back on the quietyou understand phitt no one the wiser we have broken out too your friend the king would be glad to cut off our scurvy pittances at the first chance its a risk but honour before everything  general dhubert had recovered his powers of speech so you come here like this along the road to invite me to a throatcutting match with thatthat    a laughing sort of rage took possession of him ha ha ha ha  his fists on his hips he roared without restraint while they stood before him lank and straight as though they had been shot up with a snap through a trap door in the ground only fourandtwenty months ago the masters of europe they had already the air of antique ghosts they seemed less substantial in their faded coats than their own narrow shadows falling so black across the white road the military and grotesque shadows of twenty years of war and conquests they had an outlandish appearance of two imperturbable bonzes of the religion of the sword and general dhubert also one of the exmasters of europe laughed at these serious phantoms standing in his way  said one indicating the laughing general with a jerk of the head a merry companion that  there are some of us that havent smiled from the day the other went away remarked his comrade  a violent impulse to set upon and beat those unsubstantial wraiths to the ground frightened general dhubert he ceased laughing suddenly his desire now was to get rid of them to get them away from his sight quickly before he lost control of himself he wondered at the fury he felt rising in his breast but he had no time to look into that peculiarity just then  i understand your wish to be done with me as quickly as possible dont let us waste time in empty ceremonies do you see that wood there at the foot of that slope yes the wood of pines let us meet there tomorrow at sunrise i will bring with me my sword or my pistols or both if you like  the seconds of general feraud looked at each other  pistols general said the cuirassier  so be it au revoirtomorrow morning till then let me advise you to keep close if you dont want the gendarmerie making inquiries about you before it gets dark strangers are rare in this part of the country  they saluted in silence general dhubert turning his back on their retreating forms stood still in the middle of the road for a long time biting his lower lip and looking on the ground then he began to walk straight before him thus retracing his steps till he found himself before the park gate of his intendeds house dusk had fallen motionless he stared through the bars at the front of the house gleaming clear beyond the thickets and trees footsteps scrunched on the gravel and presently a tall stooping shape emerged from the lateral alley following the inner side of the park wall  le chevalier de valmassigue uncle of the adorable adele exbrigadier in the army of the princes bookbinder in altona afterwards shoemaker with a great reputation for elegance in the fit of ladies shoes in another small german town wore silk stockings on his lean shanks low shoes with silver buckles a brocaded waistcoat a longskirted coat a la francaise covered loosely his thin bowed back a small threecornered hat rested on a lot of powdered hair tied in a queue  monsieur le chevalier called general dhubert softly  what you here again mon ami have you forgotten something  by heavens thats just it i have forgotten something i am come to tell you of it nooutside behind this wall its too ghastly a thing to be let in at all where she lives  the chevalier came out at once with that benevolent resignation some old people display towards the fugue of youth older by a quarter of a century than general dhubert he looked upon him in the secret of his heart as a rather troublesome youngster in love he had heard his enigmatical words very well but attached no undue importance to what a mere man of forty so hard hit was likely to do or say the turn of mind of the generation of frenchmen grown up during the years of his exile was almost unintelligible to him their sentiments appeared to him unduly violent lacking fineness and measure their language needlessly exaggerated he joined calmly the general on the road and they made a few steps in silence the general trying to master his agitation and get proper control of his voice  it is perfectly true i forgot something i forgot till half an hour ago that i had an urgent affair of honour on my hands its incredible but it is so  all was still for a moment then in the profound evening silence of the countryside the clear aged voice of the chevalier was heard trembling slightly monsieur thats an indignity  it was his first thought the girl born during his exile the posthumous daughter of his poor brother murdered by a band of jacobins had grown since his return very dear to his old heart which had been starving on mere memories of affection for so many years it is an inconceivable thing i say a man settles such affairs before he thinks of asking for a young girls hand why if you had forgotten for ten days longer you would have been married before your memory returned to you in my time men did not forget such thingsnor yet what is due to the feelings of an innocent young woman if i did not respect them myself i would qualify your conduct in a way which you would not like  general dhubert relieved himself frankly by a groan dont let that consideration prevent you you run no risk of offending her mortally  but the old man paid no attention to this lovers nonsense its doubtful whether he even heard what is it he asked whats the nature of     call it a youthful folly monsieur le chevalier an inconceivable incredible result of    he stopped short he will never believe the story he thought he will only think i am taking him for a fool and get offended general dhubert spoke up again yes originating in youthful folly it has become     the chevalier interrupted well then it must be arranged  arranged  yes no matter at what cost to your amour propre you should have remembered you were engaged you forgot that too i suppose and then you go and forget your quarrel its the most hopeless exhibition of levity i ever heard of  good heavens monsieur you dont imagine i have been picking up this quarrel last time i was in paris or anything of the sort do you  eh what matters the precise date of your insane conduct exclaimed the chevalier testily the principal thing is to arrange it  noticing general dhubert getting restive and trying to place a word the old emigre raised his hand and added with dignity ive been a soldier too i would never dare suggest a doubtful step to the man whose name my niece is to bear i tell you that entre galants hommes an affair can always be arranged  but saperiotte monsieur le chevalier its fifteen or sixteen years ago i was a lieutenant of hussars then  the old chevalier seemed confounded by the vehemently despairing tone of this information you were a lieutenant of hussars sixteen years ago he mumbled in a dazed manner  why yes you did not suppose i was made a general in my cradle like a royal prince  in the deepening purple twilight of the fields spread with vine leaves backed by a low band of sombre crimson in the west the voice of the old exofficer in the army of the princes sounded collected punctiliously civil  do i dream is this a pleasantry or am i to understand that you have been hatching an affair of honour for sixteen years  it has clung to me for that length of time that is my precise meaning the quarrel itself is not to be explained easily we met on the ground several times during that time of course  what manners what horrible perversion of manliness nothing can account for such inhumanity but the sanguinary madness of the revolution which has tainted a whole generation mused the returned emigre in a low tone whos your adversary he asked a little louder  my adversary his name is feraud  shadowy in his tricorne and oldfashioned clothes like a bowed thin ghost of the ancien regime the chevalier voiced a ghostly memory i can remember the feud about little sophie derval between monsieur de brissac captain in the bodyguards and danjorrant not the pockmarked one the otherthe beau danjorrant as they called him they met three times in eighteen months in a most gallant manner it was the fault of that little sophie too who would keep on playing     this is nothing of the kind interrupted general dhubert he laughed a little sardonically not at all so simple he added nor yet half so reasonable he finished inaudibly between his teeth and ground them with rage  after this sound nothing troubled the silence for a long time till the chevalier asked without animation what is hethis feraud  lieutenant of hussars tooi mean hes a general a gascon son of a blacksmith i believe  there i thought so that bonaparte had a special predilection for the canaille i dont mean this for you dhubert you are one of us though you have served this usurper who     lets leave him out of this broke in general dhubert  the chevalier shrugged his peaked shoulders feraud of sorts offspring of a blacksmith and some village troll see what comes of mixing yourself up with that sort of people  you have made shoes yourself chevalier  yes but i am not the son of a shoemaker neither are you monsieur dhubert you and i have something that your bonapartes princes dukes and marshals have not because theres no power on earth that could give it to them retorted the emigre with the rising animation of a man who has got hold of a hopeful argument those people dont existall these ferauds feraud what is feraud a vanupieds disguised into a general by a corsican adventurer masquerading as an emperor there is no earthly reason for a dhubert to sencanailler by a duel with a person of that sort you can make your excuses to him perfectly well and if the manant takes into his head to decline them you may simply refuse to meet him  you say i may do that  i do with the clearest conscience  monsieur le chevalier to what do you think you have returned from your emigration  this was said in such a startling tone that the old man raised sharply his bowed head glimmering silvery white under the points of the little tricorne for a time he made no sound  god knows he said at last pointing with a slow and grave gesture at a tall roadside cross mounted on a block of stone and stretching its arms of forged iron all black against the darkening red band in the skygod knows if it were not for this emblem which i remember seeing on this spot as a child i would wonder to what we who remained faithful to god and our king have returned the very voices of the people have changed  yes it is a changed france said general dhubert he seemed to have regained his calm his tone was slightly ironic therefore i cannot take your advice besides how is one to refuse to be bitten by a dog that means to bite its impracticable take my word for itferaud isnt a man to be stayed by apologies or refusals but there are other ways i could for instance send a messenger with a word to the brigadier of the gendarmerie in senlac he and his two friends are liable to arrest on my simple order it would make some talk in the army both the organized and the disbandedespecially the disbanded all canaille all once upon a time the companions in arms of armand dhubert but what need a dhubert care what people that dont exist may think or better still i might get my brotherinlaw to send for the mayor of the village and give him a hint no more would be needed to get the three brigands set upon with flails and pitchforks and hunted into some nice deep wet ditchand nobody the wiser it has been done only ten miles from here to three poor devils of the disbanded red lancers of the guard going to their homes what says your conscience chevalier can a dhubert do that thing to three men who do not exist  a few stars had come out on the blue obscurity clear as crystal of the sky the dry thin voice of the chevalier spoke harshly why are you telling me all this  the general seized the withered old hand with a strong grip because i owe you my fullest confidence who could tell adele but you you understand why i dare not trust my brotherinlaw nor yet my own sister chevalier i have been so near doing these things that i tremble yet you dont know how terrible this duel appears to me and theres no escape from it  he murmured after a pause its a fatality dropped the chevaliers passive hand and said in his ordinary conversational voice i shall have to go without seconds if it is my lot to remain on the ground you at least will know all that can be made known of this affair  the shadowy ghost of the ancien regime seemed to have become more bowed during the conversation how am i to keep an indifferent face this evening before these two women he groaned general i find it very difficult to forgive you  general d hubert made no answer  is your cause good at least  i am innocent  this time he seized the chevaliers ghostly arm above the elbow and gave it a mighty squeeze i must kill him he hissed and opening his hand strode away down the road  the delicate attentions of his adoring sister had secured for the general perfect liberty of movement in the house where he was a guest he had even his own entrance through a small door in one corner of the orangery thus he was not exposed that evening to the necessity of dissembling his agitation before the calm ignorance of the other inmates he was glad of it it seemed to him that if he had to open his lips he would break out into horrible and aimless imprecations start breaking furniture smashing china and glass from the moment he opened the private door and while ascending the twentyeight steps of a winding staircase giving access to the corridor on which his room opened he went through a horrible and humiliating scene in which an infuriated madman with bloodshot eyes and a foaming mouth played inconceivable havoc with everything inanimate that may be found in a wellappointed diningroom when he opened the door of his apartment the fit was over and his bodily fatigue was so great that he had to catch at the backs of the chairs while crossing the room to reach a low and broad divan on which he let himself fall heavily his moral prostration was still greater that brutality of feeling which he had known only when charging the enemy sabre in hand amazed this man of forty who did not recognize in it the instinctive fury of his menaced passion but in his mental and bodily exhaustion this passion got cleared distilled refined into a sentiment of melancholy despair at having perhaps to die before he had taught this beautiful girl to love him  that night general dhubert stretched out on his back with his hands over his eyes or lying on his breast with his face buried in a cushion made the full pilgrimage of emotions nauseating disgust at the absurdity of the situation doubt of his own fitness to conduct his existence and mistrust of his best sentiments for what the devil did he want to go to fouche forhe knew them all in turn i am an idiot neither more nor less he thoughta sensitive idiot because i overheard two men talking in a cafe    i am an idiot afraid of lieswhereas in life it is only truth that matters  several times he got up and walking in his socks in order not to be heard by anybody downstairs drank all the water he could find in the dark and he tasted the torments of jealousy too she would marry somebody else his very soul writhed the tenacity of that feraud the awful persistence of that imbecile brute came to him with the tremendous force of a relentless destiny general dhubert trembled as he put down the empty water ewer he will have me he thought general dhubert was tasting every emotion that life has to give he had in his dry mouth the faint sickly flavour of fear not the excusable fear before a young girls candid and amused glance but the fear of death and the honourable mans fear of cowardice  but if true courage consists in going out to meet an odious danger from which our body soul and heart recoil together general dhubert had the opportunity to practise it for the first time in his life he had charged exultingly at batteries and at infantry squares and ridden with messages through a hail of bullets without thinking anything about it his business now was to sneak out unheard at break of day to an obscure and revolting death general dhubert never hesitated he carried two pistols in a leather bag which he slung over his shoulder before he had crossed the garden his mouth was dry again he picked two oranges it was only after shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness  he staggered on disregarding it and after going a few yards regained the command of his legs in the colourless and pellucid dawn the wood of pines detached its columns of trunks and its dark green canopy very clearly against the rocks of the grey hillside he kept his eyes fixed on it steadily and sucked at an orange as he walked that temperamental goodhumoured coolness in the face of danger which had made him an officer liked by his men and appreciated by his superiors was gradually asserting itself it was like going into battle arriving at the edge of the wood he sat down on a boulder holding the other orange in his hand and reproached himself for coming so ridiculously early on the ground before very long however he heard the swishing of bushes footsteps on the hard ground and the sounds of a disjointed loud conversation a voice somewhere behind him said boastfully hes game for my bag  he thought to himself here they are whats this about game are they talking of me and becoming aware of the other orange in his hand he thought further these are very good oranges leonies own tree i may just as well eat this orange now instead of flinging it away  emerging from a wilderness of rocks and bushes general feraud and his seconds discovered general dhubert engaged in peeling the orange they stood still waiting till he looked up then the seconds raised their hats while general feraud putting his hands behind his back walked aside a little way  i am compelled to ask one of you messieurs to act for me i have brought no friends will you  the oneeyed cuirassier said judicially that cannot be refused  the other veteran remarked its awkward all the same  owing to the state of the peoples minds in this part of the country there was no one i could trust safely with the object of your presence here explained general dhubert urbanely  they saluted looked round and remarked both together  poor ground  its unfit  why bother about ground measurements and so on let us simplify matters load the two pairs of pistols i will take those of general feraud and let him take mine or better still let us take a mixed pair one of each pair then let us go into the wood and shoot at sight while you remain outside we did not come here for ceremonies but for warwar to the death any ground is good enough for that if i fall you must leave me where i lie and clear out it wouldnt be healthy for you to be found hanging about here after that  it appeared after a short parley that general feraud was willing to accept these conditions while the seconds were loading the pistols he could be heard whistling and was seen to rub his hands with perfect contentment he flung off his coat briskly and general d hubert took off his own and folded it carefully on a stone  suppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood and let him enter exactly in ten minutes from now suggested general dhubert calmly but feeling as if he were giving directions for his own execution this however was his last moment of weakness wait let us compare watches first  he pulled out his own the officer with the chipped nose went over to borrow the watch of general feraud they bent their heads over them for a time  thats it at four minutes to six by yours seven to by mine  it was the cuirassier who remained by the side of general dhubert keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch he held in the palm of his hand he opened his mouth waiting for the beat of the last second long before he snapped out the word avancez  general dhubert moved on passing from the glaring sunshine of the provencal morning into the cool and aromatic shade of the pines the ground was clear between the reddish trunks whose multitude leaning at slightly different angles confused his eye at first it was like going into battle the commanding quality of confidence in himself woke up in his breast he was all to his affair the problem was how to kill the adversary nothing short of that would free him from this imbecile nightmare its no use wounding that brute thought general dhubert he was known as a resourceful officer his comrades years ago used also to call him the strategist and it was a fact that he could think in the presence of the enemy whereas feraud had been always a mere fighterbut a dead shot unluckily  i must draw his fire at the greatest possible range said general dhubert to himself  at that moment he saw something white moving far off between the treesthe shirt of his adversary he stepped out at once between the trunks exposing himself freely then quick as lightning leaped back it had been a risky move but it succeeded in its object almost simultaneously with the pop of a shot a small piece of bark chipped off by the bullet stung his ear painfully  general feraud with one shot expended was getting cautious peeping round the tree general dhubert could not see him at all this ignorance of the foes whereabouts carried with it a sense of insecurity general dhubert felt himself abominably exposed on his flank and rear again something white fluttered in his sight ha the enemy was still on his front then he had feared a turning movement but apparently general feraud was not thinking of it general dhubert saw him pass without special haste from one tree to another in the straight line of approach with great firmness of mind general dhubert stayed his hand too far yet he knew he was no marksman his must be a waiting gameto kill  wishing to take advantage of the greater thickness of the trunk he sank down to the ground extended at full length head on to his enemy he had his person completely protected exposing himself would not do now because the other was too near by this time a conviction that feraud would presently do something rash was like balm to general dhuberts soul but to keep his chin raised off the ground was irksome and not much use either he peeped round exposing a fraction of his head with dread but really with little risk his enemy as a matter of fact did not expect to see anything of him so far down as that general dhubert caught a fleeting view of general feraud shifting trees again with deliberate caution he despises my shooting he thought displaying that insight into the mind of his antagonist which is of such great help in winning battles he was confirmed in his tactics of immobility if i could only watch my rear as well as my front he thought anxiously longing for the impossible  it required some force of character to lay his pistols down but on a sudden impulse general dhubert did this very gentlyone on each side of him in the army he had been looked upon as a bit of a dandy because he used to shave and put on a clean shirt on the days of battle as a matter of fact he had always been very careful of his personal appearance in a man of nearly forty in love with a young and charming girl this praiseworthy selfrespect may run to such little weaknesses as for instance being provided with an elegant little leather foldingcase containing a small ivory comb and fitted with a piece of lookingglass on the outside general dhubert his hands being free felt in his breeches pockets for that implement of innocent vanity excusable in the possessor of long silky moustaches he drew it out and then with the utmost coolness and promptitude turned himself over on his back in this new attitude his head a little raised holding the little lookingglass just clear of his tree he squinted into it with his left eye while the right kept a direct watch on the rear of his position thus was proved napoleons saying that for a french soldier the word impossible does not exist he had the right tree nearly filling the field of his little mirror  if he moves from behind it he reflected with satisfaction i am bound to see his legs but in any case he cant come upon me unawares  and sure enough he saw the boots of general feraud flash in and out eclipsing for an instant everything else reflected in the little mirror he shifted its position accordingly but having to form his judgment of the change from that indirect view he did not realize that now his feet and a portion of his legs were in plain sight of general feraud  general feraud had been getting gradually impressed by the amazing cleverness with which his enemy was keeping cover he had spotted the right tree with bloodthirsty precision he was absolutely certain of it and yet he had not been able to glimpse as much as the tip of an ear as he had been looking for it at the height of about five feet ten inches from the ground it was no great wonderbut it seemed very wonderful to general feraud  the first view of these feet and legs determined a rush of blood to his head he literally staggered behind his tree and had to steady himself against it with his hand the other was lying on the ground then on the ground perfectly still too exposed what could it mean    the notion that he had knocked over his adversary at the first shot entered then general ferauds head once there it grew with every second of attentive gazing overshadowing every other suppositionirresistible triumphant ferocious  what an ass i was to think i could have missed him he muttered to himself he was exposed en pleinthe foolfor quite a couple of seconds  general feraud gazed at the motionless limbs the last vestiges of surprise fading before an unbounded admiration of his own deadly skill with the pistol  turned up his toes by the god of war that was a shot he exulted mentally got it through the head no doubt just where i aimed staggered behind that tree rolled over on his back and died  and he stared he stared forgetting to move almost awed almost sorry but for nothing in the world would he have had it undone such a shotsuch a shot rolled over on his back and died  for it was this helpless position lying on the back that shouted its direct evidence at general feraud it never occurred to him that it might have been deliberately assumed by a living man it was inconceivable it was beyond the range of sane supposition there was no possibility to guess the reason for it and it must be said too that general dhuberts turnedup feet looked thoroughly dead general feraud expanded his lungs for a stentorian shout to his seconds but from what he felt to be an excessive scrupulousness refrained for a while  i will just go and see first whether he breathes yet he mumbled to himself leaving carelessly the shelter of his tree this move was immediately perceived by the resourceful general dhubert he concluded it to be another shift but when he lost the boots out of the field of the mirror he became uneasy general feraud had only stepped a little out of the line but his adversary could not possibly have supposed him walking up with perfect unconcern general dhubert beginning to wonder at what had become of the other was taken unawares so completely that the first warning of danger consisted in the long earlymorning shadow of his enemy falling aslant on his outstretched legs he had not even heard a footfall on the soft ground between the trees  it was too much even for his coolness he jumped up thoughtlessly leaving the pistols on the ground the irresistible instinct of an average man unless totally paralyzed by discomfiture would have been to stoop for his weapons exposing himself to the risk of being shot down in that position instinct of course is irreflective it is its very definition but it may be an inquiry worth pursuing whether in reflective mankind the mechanical promptings of instinct are not affected by the customary mode of thought in his young days armand dhubert the reflective promising officer had emitted the opinion that in warfare one should never cast back on the lines of a mistake this idea defended and developed in many discussions had settled into one of the stock notions of his brain had become a part of his mental individuality whether it had gone so inconceivably deep as to affect the dictates of his instinct or simply because as he himself declared afterwards he was too scared to remember the confounded pistols the fact is that general dhubert never attempted to stoop for them instead of going back on his mistake he seized the rough trunk with both hands and swung himself behind it with such impetuosity that going right round in the very flash and report of the pistolshot he reappeared on the other side of the tree face to face with general feraud this last completely unstrung by such a show of agility on the part of a dead man was trembling yet a very faint mist of smoke hung before his face which had an extraordinary aspect as if the lower jaw had come unhinged  not missed he croaked hoarsely from the depths of a dry throat  this sinister sound loosened the spell that had fallen on general dhuberts senses yes misseda bout portant he heard himself saying almost before he had recovered the full command of his faculties the revulsion of feeling was accompanied by a gust of homicidal fury resuming in its violence the accumulated resentment of a lifetime for years general d hubert had been exasperated and humiliated by an atrocious absurdity imposed upon him by this mans savage caprice besides general dhubert had been in this last instance too unwilling to confront death for the reaction of his anguish not to take the shape of a desire to kill and i have my two shots to fire yet he added pitilessly  general feraud snappedto his teeth and his face assumed an irate undaunted expression go on he said grimly  these would have been his last words if general dhubert had been holding the pistols in his hands but the pistols were lying on the ground at the foot of a pine general dhubert had the second of leisure necessary to remember that he had dreaded death not as a man but as a lover not as a danger but as a rival not as a foe to life but as an obstacle to marriage and behold there was the rival defeatedutterly defeated crushed done for  he picked up the weapons mechanically and instead of firing them into general ferauds breast he gave expression to the thoughts uppermost in his mind you will fight no more duels now  his tone of leisurely ineffable satisfaction was too much for general ferauds stoicism dont dawdle then damn you for a coldblooded staffcoxcomb he roared out suddenly out of an impassive face held erect on a rigidly still body  general dhubert uncocked the pistols carefully this proceeding was observed with mixed feelings by the other general you missed me twice the victor said coolly shifting both pistols to one hand the last time within a foot or so by every rule of single combat your life belongs to me that does not mean that i want to take it now  i have no use for your forbearance muttered general feraud gloomily  allow me to point out that this is no concern of mine said general dhubert whose every word was dictated by a consummate delicacy of feeling in anger he could have killed that man but in cold blood he recoiled from humiliating by a show of generosity this unreasonable beinga fellowsoldier of the grande armee a companion in the wonders and terrors of the great military epic you dont set up the pretension of dictating to me what i am to do with whats my own  general feraud looked startled and the other continued youve forced me on a point of honour to keep my life at your disposal as it were for fifteen years very well now that the matter is decided to my advantage i am going to do what i like with your life on the same principle you shall keep it at my disposal as long as i choose neither more nor less you are on your honour till i say the word  i am but sacrebleu this is an absurd position for a general of the empire to be placed in cried general feraud in accents of profound and dismayed conviction it amounts to sitting all the rest of my life with a loaded pistol in a drawer waiting for your word itsits idiotic i shall be an object ofofderision  absurdidiotic do you think so queried general dhubert with sly gravity perhaps but i dont see how that can be helped however i am not likely to talk at large of this adventure nobody need ever know anything about it just as no one to this day i believe knows the origin of our quarrel    not a word more he added hastily i cant really discuss this question with a man who as far as i am concerned does not exist  when the two duellists came out into the open general feraud walking a little behind and rather with the air of walking in a trance the two seconds hurried towards them each from his station at the edge of the wood general dhubert addressed them speaking loud and distinctly messieurs i make it a point of declaring to you solemnly in the presence of general feraud that our difference is at last settled for good you may inform all the world of that fact  a reconciliation after all they exclaimed together  reconciliation not that exactly it is something much more binding is it not so general  general feraud only lowered his head in sign of assent the two veterans looked at each other later in the day when they found themselves alone out of their moody friends earshot the cuirassier remarked suddenly generally speaking i can see with my one eye as far as most people but this beats me he wont say anything  in this affair of honour i understand there has been from first to last always something that no one in the army could quite make out declared the chasseur with the imperfect nose in mystery it began in mystery it went on in mystery it is to end apparently  general dhubert walked home with long hasty strides by no means uplifted by a sense of triumph he had conquered yet it did not seem to him that he had gained very much by his conquest the night before he had grudged the risk of his life which appeared to him magnificent worthy of preservation as an opportunity to win a girls love he had known moments when by a marvellous illusion this love seemed to be already his and his threatened life a still more magnificent opportunity of devotion now that his life was safe it had suddenly lost its special magnificence it had acquired instead a specially alarming aspect as a snare for the exposure of unworthiness as to the marvellous illusion of conquered love that had visited him for a moment in the agitated watches of the night which might have been his last on earth he comprehended now its true nature it had been merely a paroxysm of delirious conceit thus to this man sobered by the victorious issue of a duel life appeared robbed of its charm simply because it was no longer menaced  approaching the house from the back through the orchard and the kitchen garden he could not notice the agitation which reigned in front he never met a single soul only while walking softly along the corridor he became aware that the house was awake and more noisy than usual names of servants were being called out down below in a confused noise of coming and going with some concern he noticed that the door of his own room stood ajar though the shutters had not been opened yet he had hoped that his early excursion would have passed unperceived he expected to find some servant just gone in but the sunshine filtering through the usual cracks enabled him to see lying on the low divan something bulky which had the appearance of two women clasped in each others arms tearful and desolate murmurs issued mysteriously from that appearance general dhubert pulled open the nearest pair of shutters violently one of the women then jumped up it was his sister she stood for a moment with her hair hanging down and her arms raised straight up above her head and then flung herself with a stifled cry into his arms he returned her embrace trying at the same time to disengage himself from it the other woman had not risen she seemed on the contrary to cling closer to the divan hiding her face in the cushions her hair was also loose it was admirably fair general dhubert recognized it with staggering emotion mademoiselle de valmassigue adele in distress  he became greatly alarmed and got rid of his sisters hug definitely madame leonie then extended her shapely bare arm out of her peignoir pointing dramatically at the divan this poor terrified child has rushed here from home on foot two milesrunning all the way  what on earth has happened asked general dhubert in a low agitated voice  but madame leonie was speaking loudly she rang the great bell at the gate and roused all the householdwe were all asleep yet you may imagine what a terrible shock    adele my dear child sit up  general dhuberts expression was not that of a man who imagines with facility he did however fish out of the chaos of surmises the notion that his prospective motherinlaw had died suddenly but only to dismiss it at once he could not conceive the nature of the event or the catastrophe which would induce mademoiselle de valmassigue living in a house full of servants to bring the news over the fields herself two miles running all the way  but why are you in this room he whispered full of awe  of course i ran up to see and this child    i did not notice it    she followed me its that absurd chevalier went on madame leonie looking towards the divan    her hair is all come down you may imagine she did not stop to call her maid to dress it before she started   adele my dear sit up    he blurted it all out to her at halfpast five in the morning she woke up early and opened her shutters to breathe the fresh air and saw him sitting collapsed on a garden bench at the end of the great alley at that houryou may imagine and the evening before he had declared himself indisposed she hurried on some clothes and flew down to him one would be anxious for less he loves her but not very intelligently he had been up all night fully dressed the poor old man perfectly exhausted he wasnt in a state to invent a plausible story    what a confidant you chose there my husband was furious he said we cant interfere now so we sat down to wait it was awful and this poor child running with her hair loose over here publicly she has been seen by some people in the fields she has roused the whole household too its awkward for her luckily you are to be married next week    adele sit up he has come home on his own legs    we expected to see you coming on a stretcher perhapswhat do i know go and see if the carriage is ready i must take this child home at once it isnt proper for her to stay here a minute longer  general dhubert did not move it was as though he had heard nothing madame leonie changed her mind i will go and see myself she cried i want also my cloakadele she began but did not add sit up she went out saying in a very loud and cheerful tone i leave the door open  general dhubert made a movement towards the divan but then adele sat up and that checked him dead he thought i havent washed this morning i must look like an old tramp theres earth on the back of my coat and pineneedles in my hair it occurred to him that the situation required a good deal of circumspection on his part  i am greatly concerned mademoiselle he began vaguely and abandoned that line she was sitting up on the divan with her cheeks unusually pink and her hair brilliantly fair falling all over her shoulderswhich was a very novel sight to the general he walked away up the room and looking out of the window for safety said i fear you must think i behaved like a madman in accents of sincere despair then he spun round and noticed that she had followed him with her eyes they were not cast down on meeting his glance and the expression of her face was novel to him also it was one might have said reversed those eyes looked at him with grave thoughtfulness while the exquisite lines of her mouth seemed to suggest a restrained smile this change made her transcendental beauty much less mysterious much more accessible to a mans comprehension an amazing ease of mind came to the generaland even some ease of manner he walked down the room with as much pleasurable excitement as he would have found in walking up to a battery vomiting death fire and smoke then stood looking down with smiling eyes at the girl whose marriage with him next week had been so carefully arranged by the wise the good the admirable leonie  ah mademoiselle he said in a tone of courtly regret if only i could be certain that you did not come here this morning two miles running all the way merely from affection for your mother  he waited for an answer imperturbable but inwardly elated it came in a demure murmur eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect you must not be mechant as well as mad  and then general dhubert made an aggressive movement towards the divan which nothing could check that piece of furniture was not exactly in the line of the open door but madame leonie coming back wrapped up in a light cloak and carrying a lace shawl on her arm for adele to hide her incriminating hair under had a swift impression of her brother getting up from his knees  come along my dear child she cried from the doorway  the general now himself again in the fullest sense showed the readiness of a resourceful cavalry officer and the peremptoriness of a leader of men you dont expect her to walk to the carriage he said indignantly she isnt fit i shall carry her downstairs  this he did slowly followed by his awed and respectful sister but he rushed back like a whirlwind to wash off all the signs of the night of anguish and the morning of war and to put on the festive garments of a conqueror before hurrying over to the other house had it not been for that general d hubert felt capable of mounting a horse and pursuing his late adversary in order simply to embrace him from excess of happiness i owe it all to this stupid brute he thought he has made plain in a morning what might have taken me years to find outfor i am a timid fool no selfconfidence whatever perfect coward and the chevalier delightful old man general dhubert longed to embrace him also  the chevalier was in bed for several days he was very unwell the men of the empire and the postrevolution young ladies were too much for him he got up the day before the wedding and being curious by nature took his niece aside for a quiet talk he advised her to find out from her husband the true story of the affair of honour whose claim so imperative and so persistent had led her to within an ace of tragedy it is right that his wife should be told and next month or so will be your time to learn from him anything you want to know my dear child  later on when the married couple came on a visit to the mother of the bride madame la generale dhubert communicated to her beloved old uncle the true story she had obtained without any difficulty from her husband  the chevalier listened with deep attention to the end took a pinch of snuff flicked the grains of tobacco from the frilled front of his shirt and asked calmly and thats all it was  yes uncle replied madame la generale opening her pretty eyes very wide isnt it funny cest insenseto think what men are capable of  hm commented the old emigre it depends what sort of men that bonapartes soldiers were savages it is insense as a wife my dear you must believe implicitly what your husband says  but to leonies husband the chevalier confided his true opinion if thats the tale the fellow made up for his wife and during the honeymoon too you may depend on it that no one will ever know now the secret of this affair  considerably later still general dhubert judged the time come and the opportunity propitious to write a letter to general feraud this letter began by disclaiming all animosity ive never wrote the general baron dhubert wished for your death during all the time of our deplorable quarrel allow me he continued to give you back in all form your forfeited life it is proper that we two who have been partners in so much military glory should be friendly to each other publicly  the same letter contained also an item of domestic information it was in reference to this last that general feraud answered from a little village on the banks of the garonne in the following words  if one of your boys names had been napoleonor josephor even joachim i could congratulate you on the event with a better heart as you have thought proper to give him the names of charles henri armand i am confirmed in my conviction that you never loved the emperor the thought of that sublime hero chained to a rock in the middle of a savage ocean makes life of so little value that i would receive with positive joy your instructions to blow my brains out from suicide i consider myself in honour debarred but i keep a loaded pistol in my drawer  madame la generale dhubert lifted up her hands in despair after perusing that answer  you see he wont be reconciled said her husband he must never by any chance be allowed to guess where the money comes from it wouldnt do he couldnt bear it  you are a brave homme armand said madame la generale appreciatively  my dear i had the right to blow his brains out but as i didnt we cant let him starve he has lost his pension and he is utterly incapable of doing anything in the world for himself we must take care of him secretly to the end of his days dont i owe him the most ecstatic moment of my life    ha ha ha over the fields two miles running all the way i couldnt believe my ears    but for his stupid ferocity it would have taken me years to find you out its extraordinary how in one way or another this man has managed to fasten himself on my deeper feelings     a pathetic tale   il conde  vedi napoli e poi mori   the first time we got into conversation was in the national museum in naples in the rooms on the ground floor containing the famous collection of bronzes from herculaneum and pompeii that marvellous legacy of antique art whose delicate perfection has been preserved for us by the catastrophic fury of a volcano  he addressed me first over the celebrated resting hermes which we had been looking at side by side he said the right things about that wholly admirable piece nothing profound his taste was natural rather than cultivated he had obviously seen many fine things in his life and appreciated them but he had no jargon of a dilettante or the connoisseur a hateful tribe he spoke like a fairly intelligent man of the world a perfectly unaffected gentleman  we had known each other by sight for some few days past staying in the same hotelgood but not extravagantly up to datei had noticed him in the vestibule going in and out i judged he was an old and valued client the bow of the hotelkeeper was cordial in its deference and he acknowledged it with familiar courtesy for the servants he was il conde there was some squabble over a mans parasolyellow silk with white lining sort of thingthe waiters had discovered abandoned outside the diningroom door our goldlaced doorkeeper recognized it and i heard him directing one of the lift boys to run after il conde with it perhaps he was the only count staying in the hotel or perhaps he had the distinction of being the count par excellence conferred upon him because of his tried fidelity to the house  having conversed at the museoand by the by he had expressed his dislike of the busts and statues of roman emperors in the gallery of marbles their faces were too vigorous too pronounced for himhaving conversed already in the morning i did not think i was intruding when in the evening finding the diningroom very full i proposed to share his little table judging by the quiet urbanity of his consent he did not think so either his smile was very attractive  he dined in an evening waistcoat and a smoking he called it so with a black tie all this of very good cut not newjust as these things should be he was morning or evening very correct in his dress i have no doubt that his whole existence had been correct well ordered and conventional undisturbed by startling events his white hair brushed upwards off a lofty forehead gave him the air of an idealist of an imaginative man his white moustache heavy but carefully trimmed and arranged was not unpleasantly tinted a golden yellow in the middle the faint scent of some very good perfume and of good cigars that last an odour quite remarkable to come upon in italy reached me across the table it was in his eyes that his age showed most they were a little weary with creased eyelids he must have been sixty or a couple of years more and he was communicative i would not go so far as to call it garrulousbut distinctly communicative  he had tried various climates of abbazia of the riviera of other places too he told me but the only one which suited him was the climate of the gulf of naples the ancient romans who he pointed out to me were men expert in the art of living knew very well what they were doing when they built their villas on these shores in baiae in vico in capri they came down to this seaside in search of health bringing with them their trains of mimes and fluteplayers to amuse their leisure he thought it extremely probable that the romans of the higher classes were specially predisposed to painful rheumatic affections  this was the only personal opinion i heard him express it was based on no special erudition he knew no more of the romans than an average informed man of the world is expected to know he argued from personal experience he had suffered himself from a painful and dangerous rheumatic affection till he found relief in this particular spot of southern europe  this was three years ago and ever since he had taken up his quarters on the shores of the gulf either in one of the hotels in sorrento or hiring a small villa in capri he had a piano a few books picked up transient acquaintances of a day week or month in the stream of travellers from all europe one can imagine him going out for his walks in the streets and lanes becoming known to beggars shopkeepers children country people talking amiably over the walls to the contadiniand coming back to his rooms or his villa to sit before the piano with his white hair brushed up and his thick orderly moustache to make a little music for myself and of course for a change there was naples near bylife movement animation opera a little amusement as he said is necessary for health mimes and fluteplayers in fact only unlike the magnates of ancient rome he had no affairs of the city to call him away from these moderate delights he had no affairs at all probably he had never had any grave affairs to attend to in his life it was a kindly existence with its joys and sorrows regulated by the course of naturemarriages births deathsruled by the prescribed usages of good society and protected by the state  he was a widower but in the months of july and august he ventured to cross the alps for six weeks on a visit to his married daughter he told me her name it was that of a very aristocratic family she had a castlein bohemia i think this is as near as i ever came to ascertaining his nationality his own name strangely enough he never mentioned perhaps he thought i had seen it on the published list truth to say i never looked at any rate he was a good europeanhe spoke four languages to my certain knowledgeand a man of fortune not of great fortune evidently and appropriately i imagine that to be extremely rich would have appeared to him improper outretoo blatant altogether and obviously too the fortune was not of his making the making of a fortune cannot be achieved without some roughness it is a matter of temperament his nature was too kindly for strife in the course of conversation he mentioned his estate quite by the way in reference to that painful and alarming rheumatic affection one year staying incautiously beyond the alps as late as the middle of september he had been laid up for three months in that lonely country house with no one but his valet and the caretaking couple to attend to him because as he expressed it he kept no establishment there he had only gone for a couple of days to confer with his land agent he promised himself never to be so imprudent in the future the first weeks of september would find him on the shores of his beloved gulf  sometimes in travelling one comes upon such lonely men whose only business is to wait for the unavoidable deaths and marriages have made a solitude round them and one really cannot blame their endeavours to make the waiting as easy as possible as he remarked to me at my time of life freedom from physical pain is a very important matter  it must not be imagined that he was a wearisome hypochondriac he was really much too wellbred to be a nuisance he had an eye for the small weaknesses of humanity but it was a goodnatured eye he made a restful easy pleasant companion for the hours between dinner and bedtime we spent three evenings together and then i had to leave naples in a hurry to look after a friend who had fallen seriously ill in taormina having nothing to do il conde came to see me off at the station i was somewhat upset and his idleness was always ready to take a kindly form he was by no means an indolent man  he went along the train peering into the carriages for a good seat for me and then remained talking cheerily from below he declared he would miss me that evening very much and announced his intention of going after dinner to listen to the band in the public garden the villa nazionale he would amuse himself by hearing excellent music and looking at the best society there would be a lot of people as usual  i seem to see him yethis raised face with a friendly smile under the thick moustaches and his kind fatigued eyes as the train began to move he addressed me in two languages first in french saying bon voyage then in his very good somewhat emphatic english encouragingly because he could see my concern all willbewellyet  my friends illness having taken a decidedly favourable turn i returned to naples on the tenth day i cannot say i had given much thought to il conde during my absence but entering the diningroom i looked for him in his habitual place i had an idea he might have gone back to sorrento to his piano and his books and his fishing he was great friends with all the boatmen and fished a good deal with lines from a boat but i made out his white head in the crowd of heads and even from a distance noticed something unusual in his attitude instead of sitting erect gazing all round with alert urbanity he drooped over his plate i stood opposite him for some time before he looked up a little wildly if such a strong word can be used in connection with his correct appearance  ah my dear sir is it you he greeted me i hope all is well  he was very nice about my friend indeed he was always nice with the niceness of people whose hearts are genuinely humane but this time it cost him an effort his attempts at general conversation broke down into dullness it occurred to me he might have been indisposed but before i could frame the inquiry he muttered  you find me here very sad  i am sorry for that i said you havent had bad news i hope  it was very kind of me to take an interest no it was not that no bad news thank god and he became very still as if holding his breath then leaning forward a little and in an odd tone of awed embarrassment he took me into his confidence  the truth is that i have had a verya veryhow shall i sayabominable adventure happen to me  the energy of the epithet was sufficiently startling in that man of moderate feelings and toneddown vocabulary the word unpleasant i should have thought would have fitted amply the worst experience likely to befall a man of his stamp and an adventure too incredible but it is in human nature to believe the worst and i confess i eyed him stealthily wondering what he had been up to in a moment however my unworthy suspicions vanished there was a fundamental refinement of nature about the man which made me dismiss all idea of some more or less disreputable scrape  it is very serious very serious he went on nervously i will tell you after dinner if you will allow me  i expressed my perfect acquiescence by a little bow nothing more i wished him to understand that i was not likely to hold him to that offer if he thought better of it later on we talked of indifferent things but with a sense of difficulty quite unlike our former easy gossipy intercourse the hand raising a piece of bread to his lips i noticed trembled slightly this symptom in regard to my reading of the man was no less than startling  in the smokingroom he did not hang back at all directly we had taken our usual seats he leaned sideways over the arm of his chair and looked straight into my eyes earnestly  you remember he began that day you went away i told you then i would go to the villa nazionale to hear some music in the evening  i remembered his handsome old face so fresh for his age unmarked by any trying experience appeared haggard for an instant it was like the passing of a shadow returning his steadfast gaze i took a sip of my black coffee he was systematically minute in his narrative simply in order i think not to let his excitement get the better of him  after leaving the railway station he had an ice and read the paper in a cafe then he went back to the hotel dressed for dinner and dined with a good appetite after dinner he lingered in the hall there were chairs and tables there smoking his cigar talked to the little girl of the primo tenore of the san carlo theatre and exchanged a few words with that amiable lady the wife of the primo tenore there was no performance that evening and these people were going to the villa also they went out of the hotel very well  at the moment of following their exampleit was halfpast nine alreadyhe remembered he had a rather large sum of money in his pocketbook he entered therefore the office and deposited the greater part of it with the bookkeeper of the hotel this done he took a carozella and drove to the seashore he got out of the cab and entered the villa on foot from the largo di vittoria end  he stared at me very hard and i understood then how really impressionable he was every small fact and event of that evening stood out in his memory as if endowed with mystic significance if he did not mention to me the colour of the pony which drew the carozella and the aspect of the man who drove it was a mere oversight arising from his agitation which he repressed manfully  he had then entered the villa nazionale from the largo di vittoria end the villa nazionale is a public pleasureground laid out in grass plots bushes and flowerbeds between the houses of the riviera di chiaja and the waters of the bay alleys of trees more or less parallel stretch its whole lengthwhich is considerable on the riviera di chiaja side the electric tramcars run close to the railings between the garden and the sea is the fashionable drive a broad road bordered by a low wall beyond which the mediterranean splashes with gentle murmurs when the weather is fine  as life goes on late at night in naples the broad drive was all astir with a brilliant swarm of carriage lamps moving in pairs some creeping slowly others running rapidly under the thin motionless line of electric lamps defining the shore and a brilliant swarm of stars hung above the land humming with voices piled up with houses glittering with lightsand over the silent flat shadows of the sea  the gardens themselves are not very well lit our friend went forward in the warm gloom his eyes fixed upon a distant luminous region extending nearly across the whole width of the villa as if the air had glowed there with its own cold bluish and dazzling light this magic spot behind the black trunks of trees and masses of inky foliage breathed out sweet sounds mingled with bursts of brassy roar sudden clashes of metal and grave vibrating thuds  as he walked on all these noises combined together into a piece of elaborate music whose harmonious phrases came persuasively through a great disorderly murmur of voices and shuffling of feet on the gravel of that open space an enormous crowd immersed in the electric light as if in a bath of some radiant and tenuous fluid shed upon their heads by luminous globes drifted in its hundreds round the band hundreds more sat on chairs in more or less concentric circles receiving unflinchingly the great waves of sonority that ebbed out into the darkness the count penetrated the throng drifted with it in tranquil enjoyment listening and looking at the faces all people of good society mothers with their daughters parents and children young men and young women all talking smiling nodding to each other very many pretty faces and very many pretty toilettes there was of course a quantity of diverse types showy old fellows with white moustaches fat men thin men officers in uniform but what predominated he told me was the south italian type of young man with a colourless clear complexion red lips jetblack little moustache and liquid black eyes so wonderfully effective in leering or scowling  withdrawing from the throng the count shared a little table in front of the cafe with a young man of just such a type our friend had some lemonade the young man was sitting moodily before an empty glass he looked up once and then looked down again he also tilted his hat forward like this  the count made the gesture of a man pulling his hat down over his brow and went on  i think to myself he is sad something is wrong with him young men have their troubles i take no notice of him of course i pay for my lemonade and go away  strolling about in the neighbourhood of the band the count thinks he saw twice that young man wandering alone in the crowd once their eyes met it must have been the same young man but there were so many there of that type that he could not be certain moreover he was not very much concerned except in so far that he had been struck by the marked peevish discontent of that face  presently tired of the feeling of confinement one experiences in a crowd the count edged away from the band an alley very sombre by contrast presented itself invitingly with its promise of solitude and coolness he entered it walking slowly on till the sound of the orchestra became distinctly deadened then he walked back and turned about once more he did this several times before he noticed that there was somebody occupying one of the benches  the spot being midway between two lampposts the light was faint  the man lolled back in the corner of the seat his legs stretched out his arms folded and his head drooping on his breast he never stirred as though he had fallen asleep there but when the count passed by next time he had changed his attitude he sat leaning forward his elbows were propped on his knees and his hands were rolling a cigarette he never looked up from that occupation  the count continued his stroll away from the band he returned slowly he said i can imagine him enjoying to the full but with his usual tranquillity the balminess of this southern night and the sounds of music softened delightfully by the distance  presently he approached for the third time the man on the garden seat still leaning forward with his elbows on his knees it was a dejected pose in the semiobscurity of the alley his high shirt collar and his cuffs made small patches of vivid whiteness the count said that he had noticed him getting up brusquely as if to walk away but almost before he was aware of it the man stood before him asking in a low gentle tone whether the signore would have the kindness to oblige him with a light  the count answered this request by a polite certainly and dropped his hands with the intention of exploring both pockets of his trousers for the matches  i dropped my hands he said but i never put them in my pockets i felt a pressure there  he put the tip of his finger on a spot close under his breastbone the very spot of the human body where a japanese gentleman begins the operations of the harakiri which is a form of suicide following upon dishonour upon an intolerable outrage to the delicacy of ones feelings  i glance down the count continued in an awestruck voice and what do i see a knife a long knife  you dont mean to say i exclaimed amazed that you have been held up like this in the villa at halfpast ten oclock within a stones throw of a thousand people  he nodded several times staring at me with all his might  the clarionet he declared solemnly was finishing his solo and i assure you i could hear every note then the band crashed fortissimo and that creature rolled its eyes and gnashed its teeth hissing at me with the greatest ferocity be silent no noise or  i could not get over my astonishment  what sort of knife was it i asked stupidly  a long blade a stilettoperhaps a kitchen knife a long narrow blade it gleamed and his eyes gleamed his white teeth too i could see them he was very ferocious i thought to myself if i hit him he will kill me how could i fight with him he had the knife and i had nothing i am nearly seventy you know and that was a young man i seemed even to recognize him the moody young man of the cafe the young man i met in the crowd but i could not tell there are so many like him in this country  the distress of that moment was reflected in his face i should think that physically he must have been paralyzed by surprise his thoughts however remained extremely active they ranged over every alarming possibility the idea of setting up a vigorous shouting for help occurred to him too but he did nothing of the kind and the reason why he refrained gave me a good opinion of his mental selfpossession he saw in a flash that nothing prevented the other from shouting too  that young man might in an instant have thrown away his knife and pretended i was the aggressor why not he might have said i attacked him why not it was one incredible story against another he might have said anythingbring some dishonouring charge against mewhat do i know by his dress he was no common robber he seemed to belong to the better classes what could i say he was an italiani am a foreigner of course i have my passport and there is our consulbut to be arrested dragged at night to the police office like a criminal  he shuddered it was in his character to shrink from scandal much more than from mere death and certainly for many people this would have always remainedconsidering certain peculiarities of neapolitan mannersa deucedly queer story the count was no fool his belief in the respectable placidity of life having received this rude shock he thought that now anything might happen but also a notion came into his head that this young man was perhaps merely an infuriated lunatic  this was for me the first hint of his attitude towards this adventure in his exaggerated delicacy of sentiment he felt that nobodys selfesteem need be affected by what a madman may choose to do to one it became apparent however that the count was to be denied that consolation he enlarged upon the abominably savage way in which that young man rolled his glistening eyes and gnashed his white teeth the band was going now through a slow movement of solemn braying by all the trombones with deliberately repeated bangs of the big drum  but what did you do i asked greatly excited  nothing answered the count i let my hands hang down very still i told him quietly i did not intend making a noise he snarled like a dog then said in an ordinary voice  vostro portofolio  so i naturally continued the countand from this point acted the whole thing in pantomime holding me with his eyes he went through all the motions of reaching into his inside breast pocket taking out a pocketbook and handing it over but that young man still bearing steadily on the knife refused to touch it  he directed the count to take the money out himself received it into his left hand motioned the pocketbook to be returned to the pocket all this being done to the sweet thrilling of flutes and clarionets sustained by the emotional drone of the hautboys and the young man as the count called him said this seems very little  it was indeed only 340 or 360 lire the count pursued i had left my money in the hotel as you know i told him this was all i had on me he shook his head impatiently and said  vostro orologio  the count gave me the dumb show of pulling out his watch detaching it but as it happened the valuable gold halfchronometer he possessed had been left at a watchmakers for cleaning he wore that evening on a leather guard the waterbury fiftyfranc thing he used to take with him on his fishing expeditions perceiving the nature of this booty the welldressed robber made a contemptuous clicking sound with his tongue like this tseah and waved it away hastily then as the count was returning the disdained object to his pocket he demanded with a threateningly increased pressure of the knife on the epigastrium by way of reminder  vostri anelli  one of the rings went on the count was given me many years ago by my wife the other is the signet ring of my father i said no that you shall not have  here the count reproduced the gesture corresponding to that declaration by clapping one hand upon the other and pressing both thus against his chest it was touching in its resignation that you shall not have he repeated firmly and closed his eyes fully expectingi dont know whether i am right in recording that such an unpleasant word had passed his lipsfully expecting to feel himself beingi really hesitate to saybeing disembowelled by the push of the long sharp blade resting murderously against the pit of his stomachthe very seat in all human beings of anguishing sensations  great waves of harmony went on flowing from the band  suddenly the count felt the nightmarish pressure removed from the sensitive spot he opened his eyes he was alone he had heard nothing it is probable that the young man had departed with light steps some time before but the sense of the horrid pressure had lingered even after the knife had gone a feeling of weakness came over him he had just time to stagger to the garden seat he felt as though he had held his breath for a long time he sat all in a heap panting with the shock of the reaction  the band was executing with immense bravura the complicated finale it ended with a tremendous crash he heard it unreal and remote as if his ears had been stopped and then the hard clapping of a thousand more or less pairs of hands like a sudden hailshower passing away the profound silence which succeeded recalled him to himself  a tramcar resembling a long glass box wherein people sat with their heads strongly lighted ran along swiftly within sixty yards of the spot where he had been robbed then another rustled by and yet another going the other way the audience about the band had broken up and were entering the alley in small conversing groups the count sat up straight and tried to think calmly of what had happened to him the vileness of it took his breath away again as far as i can make it out he was disgusted with himself i do not mean to say with his behaviour indeed if his pantomimic rendering of it for my information was to be trusted it was simply perfect no it was not that he was not ashamed he was shocked at being the selected victim not of robbery so much as of contempt his tranquillity had been wantonly desecrated his lifelong kindly nicety of outlook had been defaced  nevertheless at that stage before the iron had time to sink deep he was able to argue himself into comparative equanimity as his agitation calmed down somewhat he became aware that he was frightfully hungry yes hungry the sheer emotion had made him simply ravenous he left the seat and after walking for some time found himself outside the gardens and before an arrested tramcar without knowing very well how he came there he got in as if in a dream by a sort of instinct fortunately he found in his trouser pocket a copper to satisfy the conductor then the car stopped and as everybody was getting out he got out too he recognized the piazza san ferdinando but apparently it did not occur to him to take a cab and drive to the hotel he remained in distress on the piazza like a lost dog thinking vaguely of the best way of getting something to eat at once  suddenly he remembered his twentyfranc piece he explained to me that he had that piece of french gold for something like three years he used to carry it about with him as a sort of reserve in case of accident anybody is liable to have his pocket pickeda quite different thing from a brazen and insulting robbery  the monumental arch of the galleria umberto faced him at the top of a noble flight of stairs he climbed these without loss of time and directed his steps towards the cafe umberto all the tables outside were occupied by a lot of people who were drinking but as he wanted something to eat he went inside into the cafe which is divided into aisles by square pillars set all round with long lookingglasses the count sat down on a red plush bench against one of these pillars waiting for his risotto and his mind reverted to his abominable adventure  he thought of the moody welldressed young man with whom he had exchanged glances in the crowd around the bandstand and who he felt confident was the robber would he recognize him again doubtless but he did not want ever to see him again the best thing was to forget this humiliating episode  the count looked round anxiously for the coming of his risotto and behold to the left against the wallthere sat the young man he was alone at a table with a bottle of some sort of wine or syrup and a carafe of iced water before him the smooth olive cheeks the red lips the little jetblack moustache turned up gallantly the fine black eyes a little heavy and shaded by long eyelashes that peculiar expression of cruel discontent to be seen only in the busts of some roman emperorsit was he no doubt at all but that was a type the count looked away hastily the young officer over there reading a paper was like that too same type two young men farther away playing draughts also resembled  the count lowered his head with the fear in his heart of being everlastingly haunted by the vision of that young man he began to eat his risotto presently he heard the young man on his left call the waiter in a badtempered tone  at the call not only his own waiter but two other idle waiters belonging to a quite different row of tables rushed towards him with obsequious alacrity which is not the general characteristic of the waiters in the cafe umberto the young man muttered something and one of the waiters walking rapidly to the nearest door called out into the galleria pasquale o pasquale  everybody knows pasquale the shabby old fellow who shuffling between the tables offers for sale cigars cigarettes picture postcards and matches to the clients of the cafe he is in many respects an engaging scoundrel the count saw the greyhaired unshaven ruffian enter the cafe the glass case hanging from his neck by a leather strap and at a word from the waiter make his shuffling way with a sudden spurt to the young mans table the young man was in need of a cigar with which pasquale served him fawningly the old pedlar was going out when the count on a sudden impulse beckoned to him  pasquale approached the smile of deferential recognition combining oddly with the cynical searching expression of his eyes leaning his case on the table he lifted the glass lid without a word the count took a box of cigarettes and urged by a fearful curiosity asked as casually as he could  tell me pasquale who is that young signore sitting over there  the other bent over his box confidentially  that signor conde he said beginning to rearrange his wares busily and without looking up that is a young cavaliere of a very good family from bari he studies in the university here and is the chief capo of an association of young menof very nice young men  he paused and then with mingled discretion and pride of knowledge murmured the explanatory word camorra and shut down the lid a very powerful camorra he breathed out the professors themselves respect it greatly    una lira e cinquanti centesimi signor conde  our friend paid with the gold piece while pasquale was making up the change he observed that the young man of whom he had heard so much in a few words was watching the transaction covertly after the old vagabond had withdrawn with a bow the count settled with the waiter and sat still a numbness he told me had come over him  the young man paid too got up and crossed over apparently for the purpose of looking at himself in the mirror set in the pillar nearest to the counts seat he was dressed all in black with a dark green bow tie the count looked round and was startled by meeting a vicious glance out of the corners of the others eyes the young cavaliere from bari according to pasquale but pasquale is of course an accomplished liar went on arranging his tie settling his hat before the glass and meantime he spoke just loud enough to be heard by the count he spoke through his teeth with the most insulting venom of contempt and gazing straight into the mirror  ah so you had some gold on youyou old liaryou old birbayou furfante but you are not done with me yet  the fiendishness of his expression vanished like lightning and he lounged out of the cafe with a moody impassive face  the poor count after telling me this last episode fell back trembling in his chair his forehead broke into perspiration there was a wanton insolence in the spirit of this outrage which appalled even me what it was to the counts delicacy i wont attempt to guess i am sure that if he had been not too refined to do such a blatantly vulgar thing as dying from apoplexy in a cafe he would have had a fatal stroke there and then all irony apart my difficulty was to keep him from seeing the full extent of my commiseration he shrank from every excessive sentiment and my commiseration was practically unbounded it did not surprise me to hear that he had been in bed a week he had got up to make his arrangements for leaving southern italy for good and all  and the man was convinced that he could not live through a whole year in any other climate  no argument of mine had any effect it was not timidity though he did say to me once you do not know what a camorra is my dear sir i am a marked man he was not afraid of what could be done to him his delicate conception of his dignity was defiled by a degrading experience he couldnt stand that no japanese gentleman outraged in his exaggerated sense of honour could have gone about his preparations for harakiri with greater resolution to go home really amounted to suicide for the poor count  there is a saying of neapolitan patriotism intended for the information of foreigners i presume see naples and then die vedi napoli e poi mori it is a saying of excessive vanity and everything excessive was abhorrent to the nice moderation of the poor count yet as i was seeing him off at the railway station i thought he was behaving with singular fidelity to its conceited spirit vedi napoli    he had seen it he had seen it with startling thoroughnessand now he was going to his grave he was going to it by the train de luxe of the international sleeping car company via trieste and vienna as the four long sombre coaches pulled out of the station i raised my hat with the solemn feeling of paying the last tribute of respect to a funeral cortege il condes profile much aged already glided away from me in stony immobility behind the lighted pane of glassvedi napoli e poi mori
