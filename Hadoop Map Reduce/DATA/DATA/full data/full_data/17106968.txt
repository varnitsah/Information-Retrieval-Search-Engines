17106968	the philanderer  act i   a lady and gentleman are making love to one another in the drawingroom of a flat in ashly gardens in the victoria district of london it is past ten at night the walls are hung with theatrical engravings and photographskemble as hamlet mrs siddons as queen katharine pleading in court macready as werner after maclise sir henry irving as richard iii after long miss ellen terry mrs kendal miss ada rehan madame sarah bernhardt mr henry arthur jones mr a w pinero mr sydney grundy and so on but not the signora duse or anyone connected with ibsen the room is not a perfect square the right hand corner at the back being cut off diagonally by the doorway and the opposite corner rounded by a turret window filled up with a stand of flowers surrounding a statue of shakespear the fireplace is on the right with an armchair near it a small round table further forward on the same side with a chair beside it has a yellowbacked french novel lying open on it the piano a grand is on the left open with the keyboard in full view at right angles to the wall the piece of music on the desk is when other lips incandescent lights well shaded are on the piano and mantelpiece near the piano is a sofa on which the lady and gentleman are seated affectionately side by side in one anothers arms  the lady grace tranfield is about 32 slight of build delicate of feature and sensitive in expression she is just now given up to the emotion of the moment but her well closed mouth proudly set brows firm chin and elegant carriage show plenty of determination and self respect she is in evening dress  the gentleman leonard charteris a few years older is unconventionally but smartly dressed in a velvet jacket and cashmere trousers his collar dyed wotan blue is part of his shirt and turns over a garnet coloured scarf of indian silk secured by a turquoise ring he wears blue socks and leather sandals the arrangement of his tawny hair and of his moustaches and short beard is apparently left to nature but he has taken care that nature shall do him the fullest justice his amative enthusiasm at which he is himself laughing and his clever imaginative humorous ways contrast strongly with the sincere tenderness and dignified quietness of the woman    charteris impulsively clasping grace my dearest love  grace responding affectionately my darling are you happy  charteris in heaven  grace my own  charteris my hearts love he sighs happily and takes her hands in his looking quaintly at her that must positively be my last kiss grace or i shall become downright silly let us talk releases her and sits a little apart from her grace is this your first love affair  grace have you forgotten that i am a widow do you think i married tranfield for money  charteris how do i know besides you might have married him not because you loved him but because you didnt love anybody else when one is young one marries out of mere curiosity just to see what its like  grace well since you ask me i never was in love with tranfield though i only found that out when i fell in love with you but i used to like him for being in love with me it brought out all the good in him so much that i have wanted to be in love with some one ever since i hope now that i am in love with you you will like me for it just as i liked tranfield  charteris my dear it is because i like you that i want to marry you i could love anybodyany pretty woman that is  grace do you really mean that leonard  charteris of course why not  grace reflecting never mind why now tell me is this your first love affair  charteris amazed at the simplicity of the question no bless my soul nonor my second nor my third  grace but i mean your first serious one  charteris with a certain hesitation yes there is a pause she is not convinced he adds with a very perceptible load on his conscience it is the first in which i have been serious  grace searchingly i see the other parties were always serious  charteris no not alwaysheaven forbid  grace how often  charteris well once  grace julia craven  charteris recoiling who told you that she shakes her head mysteriously and he turns away from her moodily and adds you had much better not have asked  grace gently im sorry dear she puts out her hand and pulls softly at him to bring him near her again  charteris yielding mechanically to the pull and allowing her hand to rest on his arm but sitting squarely without the least attempt to return the caress do i feel harder to the touch than i did five minutes ago  grace what nonsense  charteris i feel as if my body had turned into the toughest of hickory that is what comes of reminding me of julia craven brooding with his chin on his right hand and his elbow on his knee i have sat alone with her just as i am sitting with you  grace shrinking from him just  charteris sitting upright and facing her steadily just exactly she has put her hands in mine and laid her cheek against mine and listened to me saying all sorts of silly things grace chilled to the soul rises from the sofa and sits down on the piano stool with her back to the keyboard ah you dont want to hear any more of the story so much the better  grace deeply hurt but controlling herself when did you break it off  charteris guiltily break it off  grace firmly yes break it off  charteris well let me see when did i fall in love with you  grace did you break it off then  charteris mischievously making it plainer and plainer that it has not been broken off it was clear then of course that it must be broken off  grace and did you break it off  charteris oh yes i broke it off  grace but did she break it off  charteris rising as a favour to me dearest change the subject come away from the piano i want you to sit here with me takes a step towards her  grace no i also have grown hard to the touchmuch harder than hickory for the present did she break it off  charteris my dear be reasonable it was fully explained to her that it was to be broken off  grace did she accept the explanation  charteris she did what a woman like julia always does when i explained personally she said it was not not my better self that was speaking and that she knew i still really loved her when i wrote it to her with brutal explicitness she read the letter carefully and then sent it back to me with a note to say that she had not had the courage to open it and that i ought to be ashamed of having written it comes beside grace and puts his left hand caressingly round her neck you see dearie she wont look the situation in the face  grace shaking off his hand and turning a little away on the stool i am afraid from the light way in which you speak of it you did not sound the right chord  charteris my dear when you are doing what a woman calls breaking her heart you may sound the very prettiest chords you can find on the piano but to her ears it is just like thissits down on the bass end of the keyboard grace puts her fingers in her ears he rises and moves away from the piano saying no my dear ive been kind ive been frank ive been everything that a goodnatured man could be she only takes it as the making up of a lovers quarrel grace winces frankness and kindness one is as the otherespecially frankness ive tried both he crosses to the fireplace and stands facing the fire looking at the ornaments on the mantelpiece and warming his hands  grace her voice a little strained what are you going to try now  charteris on the hearthrug turning to face her action my dear marriage in that she must believe she wont be convinced by anything short of it because you see i have had some tremendous philanderings before and have gone back to her after them  grace and so that is why you want to marry me  charteris i cannot deny it my love yes it is your mission to rescue me from julia  grace rising then if you please i decline to be made use of for any such purpose i will not steal you from another woman she begins to walk up and down the room with ominous disquiet  charteris steal me comes towards her grace i have a question to put to you as an advanced woman mind as an advanced woman does julia belong to me am i her ownerher master  grace certainly not no woman is the property of a man a woman belongs to herself and to nobody else  charteris quite right ibsen for ever thats exactly my opinion now tell me do i belong to julia or have i a right to belong to myself  grace puzzled of course you have but  charteris interrupting her triumphantly then how can you steal me from julia if i dont belong to her catching her by the shoulders and holding her out at arms length in front of him eh little philosopher no my dear if ibsen sauce is good for the goose its good for the gander as well besides coaxing her it was nothing but a philander with julianothing else in the world i assure you  grace breaking away from him so much the worse i hate your philanderings they make me ashamed of you and of myself goes to the sofa and sits in the right hand corner of it leaning gloomily on her elbow with her face averted  charteris grace you utterly misunderstand the origin of my philanderings sits down beside her listen to me am i a particularly handsome man  grace turning to him as if astonished at his conceit no  charteris triumphantly you admit it am i a well dressed man  grace not particularly  charteris of course not have i a romantic mysterious charm about medo i look as if a secret sorrow preyed on meam i gallant to women  grace not in the least  charteris certainly not no one can accuse me of it then whose fault is it that half the women i speak to fall in love with me not mine i hate it it bores me to distraction at first it flattered medelighted methat was how julia got me because she was the first woman who had the pluck to make me a declaration but i soon had enough of it and at no time have i taken the initiative and persecuted women with my advances as women have persecuted me never except of course in your case  grace oh you need not make any exception i had a good deal of trouble to induce you to come and see us you were very coy  charteris fondly taking her hand with you dearest the coyness was sheer coquetry i loved you from the first and fled only that you might pursue but come let us talk about something really interesting takes her in his arms do you love me better than anyone else in the world  grace i dont think you like to be loved too much  charteris that depends on who the person is you pressing her to his heart cannot love me too much you cannot love me half enough i reproach you every day for your coldnessyour violent double knock heard without they start and listen still in one anothers arms hardly daring to breathe who the deuce is calling at this hour  grace i cant imagine they listen guiltily the door of the flat is opened without they hastily get away from one another  a womans voice outside is mr charteris here  charteris springing up julia the devil stands at the left of the sofa with his hands on it bending forward with his eyes fixed on the door  grace rising also what can she want  the voice never mind i will announce myself a beautiful dark tragic looking woman in mantle and bonnet appears at the door raging furiously oh this is charming i have interrupted a pretty teteatete oh you villain she comes straight at grace charteris runs across behind the sofa and stops her she struggles furiously with him grace preserves her self possession but retreats quietly to the piano julia finding charteris too strong for her gives up her attempt to get at grace but strikes him in the face as she frees herself  charteris shocked oh julia julia this is too bad  julia is it indeed too bad what are you doing up here with that woman you scoundrel but now listen to me leonard you have driven me to desperation and i dont care what i do or who hears me ill not bear it she shall not have my place with you  charteris shsh  julia no no i dont care i will expose her true character before everybody you belong to me you have no right to be here and she knows it  charteris i think you had better let me take you home julia  julia i will not i am not going home i am going to stay herehereuntil i have made you give her up  charteris my dear you must be reasonable you really cannot stay in mrs tranfields house if she objects she can ring the bell and have us both put out  julia let her do it then let her ring the bell if she dares let us see how this pure virtuous creature will face the scandal of what i will declare about her let us see how you will face it i have nothing to lose everybody knows how you have treated me you have boasted of your conquests you poor pitiful vain creaturei am the common talk of your acquaintances and hers oh i have calculated my advantage tearing off her mantle i am a most unhappy and injured woman but i am not the fool you take me to be i am going to staysee she flings the mantle on the round table puts her bonnet on it and sits down now mrs tranfield there is the bell pointing to the button beside the fireplace why dont you ring grace looking attentively at charteris does not move ha ha i thought so  charteris quietly without relaxing his watch on julia mrs tranfield i think you had better go into another room grace makes a movement towards the door but stops and looks inquiringly at charteris as julia springs up he advances a step so as to prevent her from getting to the door  julia she shall not she shall stay here she shall know what you are and how you have been in love with mehow it is not two days since you kissed me and told me that the future would be as happy as the past screaming at him you did deny it if you dare  charteris to grace in a low voice go  grace with nonchalant disgustgoing get her away as soon as you can leonard  julia with a stifled cry of rage rushes at grace who is crossing behind the sofa towards door charteris seizes her and prevents her from getting past the sofa grace goes out charteris holding julia fast looks around to the door to see whether grace is safely out of the room  julia suddenly ceasing to struggle and speaking with the most pathetic dignity oh there is no need to be violent he passes her across to the left end of the sofa and leans against the right end panting and mopping his forehead that is worthy of youto use brute forceto humiliate me before her she breaks down and bursts into tears  charteris to himself with melancholy conviction this is going to be a cheerful evening now patience patience patience sits on a chair near the round table  julia in anguish leonard have you no feeling for me  charteris only an intense desire to get you safely out of this  julia fiercely i am not going to stir  charteris wearily well well heaves a long sigh they sit silent for awhile julia struggling not to regain her self control but to maintain her rage at boiling point  julia rising suddenly i am going to speak to that woman  charteris jumping up no no hang it julia dont lets have another wrestling match i have the strength but not the wind youre too young for me sit down or else let me take you home suppose her father comes in  julia i dont care it rests with you i am ready to go if she will give you up until then i stay those are my terms you owe me that she sits down determinedly charteris looks at her for a moment then making up his mind goes resolutely to the couch sits down near the right hand end of it she being at the left and says with biting emphasis  charteris i owe you just exactly nothing  julia reproachfully nothing you can look me in the face and say that oh leonard  charteris let me remind you julia that when first we became acquainted the position you took up was that of a woman of advanced views  julia that should have made you respect me the more  charteris placably so it did my dear but that is not the point as a woman of advanced views you were determined to be free you regarded marriage as a degrading bargain by which a woman sold herself to a man for the social status of a wife and the right to be supported and pensioned in old age out of his income thats the advanced viewour view besides if you had married me i might have turned out a drunkard a criminal an imbecile a horror to you and you couldnt have released yourself too big a risk you see thats the rational viewour view accordingly you reserved the right to leave me at any time if you found our companionship incompatible withwhat was the expression you usedwith your full development as a human being i think that was how you put the ibsenist viewour view so i had to be content with a charming philander which taught me a great deal and brought me some hours of exquisite happiness  julia leonard you confess then that you owe me something  charteris haughtily no what i received i paid did you learn nothing from mewas there no delight for you in our friendship  julia vehemently and movingly for she is now sincere no you made me pay dearly for every moment of happiness you revenged yourself on me for the humiliation of being the slave of your passion for me i was never sure of you for a moment i trembled whenever a letter came from you lest it should contain some stab for me i dreaded your visits almost as much as i longed for them i was your plaything not your companion she rises exclaiming oh there was such suffering in my happiness that i hardly knew joy from pain she sinks on the piano stool and adds as she buries her face in her hands and turns away from him better for me if i had never met you  charteris rising indignantly you ungenerous wretch is this your gratitude for the way i have just been flattering you what have i not endured from youendured with angelic patience did i not find out before our friendship was a fortnight old that all your advanced views were merely a fashion picked up and followed like any other fashion without understanding or meaning a word of them did you not in spite of your care for your own liberty set up claims on me compared to which the claims of the most jealous wife would have been trifles have i a single woman friend whom you have not abused as old ugly vicious  julia quickly looking up so they are  charteris well then ill come to grievances that even you can understand i accuse you of habitual and intolerable jealousy and ill temper of insulting me on imaginary provocation of positively beating me of stealing letters of mine  julia rising yes nice letters  charteris of breaking your solemn promises not to do it again of spending hoursaye days piecing together the contents of my waste paper basket in your search for more letters and then representing yourself as an ill used saint and martyr wantonly betrayed and deserted by a selfish monster of a man  julia i was justified in reading your letters our perfect confidence in one another gave me the right to do it  charteris thank you then i hasten to break off a confidence which gives such rights sits down sulkily on sofa  julia with her right hand on the back of the sofa bending over him threateningly you have no right to break it off  charteris i have you refused to marry me because  julia i did not you never asked me if we were married you would never dare treat me as you are doing now  charteris laboriously going back to his argument it was understood between us as people of advanced views that we were not to marry because as the law stands i might have become a drunkard a  julia a criminal an imbecile or a horror you said that before sits down beside him with a fling  charteris politely i beg your pardon my dear i know i have a habit of repeating myself the point is that you reserved your freedom to give me up when you pleased  julia well what of that i do not please to give you up and i will not you have not become a drunkard or a criminal  charteris you dont see the point yet julia you seem to forget that in reserving your freedom to leave me in case i should turn out badly you also reserved my freedom to leave you in case you should turn out badly  julia very ingenious and pray have i become a drunkard or a criminal or an imbecile  charteris rising you have become what is infinitely worse than all three togethera jealous termagant  julia shaking her head bitterly yes abuse mecall me names  charteris i now assert the right i reservedthe right of breaking with you when i please advanced views julia involve advanced duties you cannot be an advanced woman when you want to bring a man to your feet and a conventional woman when you want to hold him there against his will advanced people form charming friendships conventional people marry marriage suits a good deal of people and its first duty is fidelity friendship suits some people and its first duty is unhesitating uncomplaining acceptance of a notice of a change of feeling from either side you chose friendship instead of marriage now do your duty and accept your notice  julia never we are engaged in the eye ofthe eye of  charteris sitting down quickly beside her yes julia cant you get it out in the eye of something that advanced women dont believe in en  julia throwing herself at his feet o leonard dont be cruel i am too miserable to argueto think i only know i love you you reproach me with not wanting to marry you i would have married you at any time after i came to love you if you had asked me i will marry you now if you will  charteris i wont my dear thats flat were intellectually incompatible  julia but why we could be so happy you love mei know you love mei feel it you say my dear to me you have said it several times this evening i know i have been wicked odious bad i say nothing in defence of myself but dont be hard on me i was distracted by the thought of losing you i cant face life without you leonard i was happy when i met you i had never loved anyone and if you had only let me alone i could have gone on contentedly by myself but i cant now i must have you with me dont cast me off without a thought of all i have at stake i could be a friend to you if you would only let meif you would only tell me your plansgive me a share in your worktreat me as something more than the amusement of an idle hour oh leonard leonard youve never given me a chance indeed you havent ill take pains ill read ill try to think ill conquer my jealousy ill she breaks down rocking her head desperately on his knee and writhing oh im mad im mad youll kill me if you desert me  charteris petting her my dear love dont crydont go on in this way you know i cant help it  julia sobbing as he rises and coaxingly lifts her with him oh you can you can one word from you will make us happy for ever  charteris diplomatically come my dear we really must go we cant stay until cuthbertson comes releases her gently and takes her mantle from the table here is your mantle put it on and be good you have given me a terrible evening you must have some consideration for me  julia dangerous again then i am to be cast off  charteris coaxingly you are to put on your bonnet dearest he puts the mantle on her shoulders  julia with a bitter half laugh half sob well i suppose i must do what i am told she goes to the table and looks for her bonnet she sees the yellowbacked french novel ah look at that holds it out to him looklook at what the creature readsfilthy vile french stuff that no decent woman would touch and youyou have been reading it with her  charteris you recommended that book to me yourself  julia faugh dashes it on the floor  charteris running anxiously to the book dont damage property julia he picks it up and dusts it making scenes is an affair of sentiment damaging property is serious replaces it on the table and now do pray come along  julia implacably you can go there is nothing to prevent you i will not stir she sits down stubbornly on the sofa  charteris losing patience oh come i am not going to begin all this over again there are limits even to my forbearance come on  julia i will not i tell you  charteris then good night he makes resolutely for the door with a rush she gets there before him and bars his way i thought you wanted me to go  julia at the door you shall not leave me here alone  charteris then come with me  julia not until you have sworn to me to give up that woman  charteris my dear i will swear anything if you will only come away and put an end to this  julia perplexeddoubting him you will swear  charteris solemnly propose the oath i have been on the point of swearing for the last half hour  julia despairingly you are only making fun of me i want no oaths i want your promiseyour sacred word of honour  charteris certainlyanything you demand on condition that you come away immediately on my sacred word of honour as a gentlemanas an englishmanas anything you likei will never see her again never speak to her never think of her now come  julia but are you in earnest will you keep your word  charteris smiling subtly now you are getting unreasonable do come along without any more nonsense at any rate i am going i am not strong enough to carry you home but i am strong enough to make my way through that door in spite of you you will then have a new grievance against me for my brutal violence he takes a step towards the door  julia solemnly if you do i swear i will throw myself from that window leonard as you pass out  charteris unimpressed that window is at the back of the building i shall pass out at the front so you will not hurt me good night he approaches the door  julia leonard have you no pity  charteris not in the least when you condescend to these antics you force me to despise you how can a woman who behaves like a spoiled child and talks like a sentimental novel have the audacity to dream of being a companion for a man of any sort of sense or character she gives an inarticulate cry and throws herself sobbing on his breast come dont cry my dear julia you dont look half so beautiful as when youre happy and it takes all the starch out of my shirt front come along  julia affectionately ill come dear if you wish it give me one kiss  charteris exasperated this is too much no im dashed if i will here let me go julia she clings to him will you come without another word if i give you a kiss  julia i will do anything you wish darling  charteris well here he takes her in his arms and gives her an unceremonious kiss now remember your promise come along  julia that was not a nice kiss dearest i want one of our old real kisses  charteris furious oh go to the deuce he disengages himself impulsively and she as if he had flung her down falls pathetically with a stifled moan with an angry look at her he strides out and slams the door she raises herself on one hand listening to his retreating footsteps they stop her face lights up with eager triumphant cunning the steps return hastily she throws herself down again as before charteris reappears in the utmost dismay exclaiming julia were done cuthbertsons coming upstairs with your fathershe sits up quickly do you hearthe two fathers  julia sitting on the floor impossible they dont know one another  charteris desperately i tell you they are coming up together like brothers what on earth are we to do  julia scrambling up with the help of his hand quick the lift we can go down in that she rushes to the table for her bonnet  charteris no the mans gone home and the lifts locked  julia putting on bonnet at express speed lets go up to the next floor  charteris theres no next floor were at the top of the house no no you must invent some thumping lie i cant think of one you can julia exercise all your genius ill back you up  julia but  charteris shsh here they are sit down and look at home julia tears off her bonnet and mantle throws them on the table and darts to the piano at which she seats herself  julia come and sing she plays the symphony to when other lips he stands at the piano as if about to sing two elderly gentlemen enter julia stops playing  the elder of the two gentlemen colonel daniel craven affects the bluff simple veteran and carries it off pleasantly and well having a fine upright figure and being in fact a goodnaturedly impulsive credulous person who after an entirely thoughtless career as an officer and a gentleman is now being startled into some sort of selfeducation by the surprising proceedings of his children  his companion mr joseph cuthbertson graces father has none of the colonels boyishness he is a man of fervent idealistic sentiment so frequently outraged by the facts of life that he has acquired an habitually indignant manner which unexpectedly becomes enthusiastic or affectionate when he speaks  the two men differ greatly in expression the colonels face is lined with weather with age with eating and drinking and with the cumulative effects of many petty vexations but not with thought he is still fresh and he has by no means full expectations of pleasure and novelty cuthbertson has the lines of sedentary london brain work with its chronic fatigue and longing for rest and recreative emotion and its disillusioned indifference to adventure and enjoyment except as a means of recuperation  they are both in evening dress and cuthbertson wears his fur collared overcoat which with his vigilant irascible eye piled up hair and the honorable earnestness with which he takes himself gives him an air of considerable consequence  cuthbertson with a hospitable show of delight at finding visitors dont stop miss craven go on charteris he comes down behind the sofa and hangs his overcoat on it after taking an opera glass and a theatre programme from the pockets and putting them down on the piano craven meanwhile goes to the fireplace and stands on the hearthrug  charteris no thank you miss craven has just been taking me through an old song and ive had enough of it he takes the song off the piano desk and lays it aside then closes the lid over the keyboard  julia passing between the sofa and piano to shake hands with cuthbertson why youve brought daddy what a surprise looking across to craven so glad youve come dad she takes a chair near the window and sits there  cuthbertson craven let me introduce you to mr leonard charteris the famous ibsenist philosopher  craven oh we know one another already charteris is quite at home at our house jo  cuthbertson i beg both your pardons charteris sits down on the piano stool hes quite at home here too by the bye wheres grace  julia and charteris er they stop and look at one another  julia politely i beg your pardon mr charteris i interrupted you  charteris not at all miss craven an awkward pause  cuthbertson to help them out you were going to tell about grace charteris  charteris i was only going to say that i didnt know that you and craven were acquainted  craven why i didnt know it until tonight its a most extraordinary thing we met by chance at the theatre and he turns out to be my oldest friend  cuthbertson energetically yes craven and do you see how this proves what i was saying to you about the breaking up of family life here are all our young peoplegrace and miss julia and the restbosom friends inseparables and yet we two who knew each other before they were born might never have met again if you hadnt popped into the stall next to mine tonight by pure chance come sit down bustling over to him affectionately and pushing him into the arm chair above the fire theres your place by my fireside whenever you choose to fill it he posts himself at the right end of the sofa leaning against it and admiring craven just imagine your being dan craven  craven just imagine your being jo cuthbertson though thats a far more extraordinary coincidence because id got it into my head that your name was tranfield  cuthbertson oh thats my daughters name shes a widow you know how uncommonly well you look dan the years havent hurt you much  craven suddenly becoming unnaturally gloomy i look well i even feel well but my days are numbered  cuthbertson alarmed oh dont say that my dear fellow i hope not  julia with anguish in her voice daddy cuthbertson looks inquiringly around at her  craven there there my dear i was wrong to talk of it its a sad subject but its better that cuthbertson should know we used to be very close friends and are so still i hope cuthbertson goes to craven and presses his hand silently then returns to sofa and sits pulling out his handkerchief and displaying some emotion   charteris a little impatiently the fact is cuthbertson cravens a devout believer in the department of witchcraft called medical science hes celebrated in all the medical schools as an example of the newest sort of liver complaint the doctors say he cant last another year and he has fully made up his mind not to survive next easter just to oblige them  craven with military affectation its very kind of you to try to keep up my spirits by making light of it charteris but i shall be ready when my time comes im a soldier a sob from julia dont cry julia  cuthbertson huskily i hope you may long be spared dan  craven to oblige me jo change the subject he gets up and again posts himself on the hearthrug with his back to the fire  charteris try and persuade him to join our club cuthbertson he mopes  julia its no use sylvia and i are always at him to join but he wont  craven my child i have my own club  charteris contemptuously yes the junior army and navy do you call that a club why they darent let a woman cross the doorstep  craven a little ruffled clubs are a matter of taste charteris you like a cock and hen club i dont its bad enough to have julia and her sistera girl under twentyspending half their time at such a place besides now really such a name for a club the ibsen club i should be laughed out of london the ibsen club come cuthbertson back me up im sure you agree with me  charteris cuthbertsons a member  craven amazed no why hes been talking to me all the evening about the way in which everything is going to the dogs through advanced ideas in the younger generation  charteris of course hes been studying it in the club hes always there  cuthbertson warmly not always dont exaggerate charteris you know very well that though i joined the club on graces account thinking that her fathers presence there would be a protection and aa sort of sanction as it werei never approved of it  craven tactlessly harping on cuthbertsons inconsistency well you know this is unexpected now its really very unexpected i should never have thought it from hearing you talk jo why you said the whole modern movement was abhorrent to you because your life had been passed in witnessing scenes of suffering nobly endured and sacrifice willingly rendered by womanly women and manly men and deuce knows what else is it at the ibsen club that you see all this manliness and womanliness  charteris certainly not the rules of the club forbid anything of that sort every candidate for membership must be nominated by a man and a woman who both guarantee that the candidate if female is not womanly and if male is not manly  craven chuckling cunningly and stooping to press his heated trousers against his legs which are chilly wont do charteris cant take me in with so thin a story as that  cuthbertson vehemently its true its monstrous but its true  craven with rising indignation as he begins to draw the inevitable inferences do you mean to say that somebody had the audacity to guarantee that my julia is not a womanly woman  charteris darkly it sounds incredible but a man was found ready to take that inconceivable lie on his conscience  julia firing up if he has nothing worse than that on his conscience he may sleep pretty well in what way am i more womanly than any of the rest of them i should like to know they are always saying things like that behind my backi hear of them from sylvia only the other day a member of the committee said i ought never to have been electedthat you to charteris had smuggled me in i should like to see her say it to my face thats all  craven but my precious i most sincerely hope she was right she paid you the highest compliment why the place must be a den of infamy  cuthbertson emphatically so it is craven so it is  charteris exactly thats what keeps it so select nobody but people whose reputations are above suspicion dare belong to it if we once got a good name we should become a mere whitewashing shop for all the shady characters in london better join us craven let me put you up  craven what join a club where theres some scoundrel who guaranteed my daughter to be an unwomanly woman if i werent an invalid id kick him  charteris oh dont say that it was i who did it  craven reproachfully you now upon my soul charteris this is very vexing now how could you bring yourself to do such a thing  charteris she made me why i had to guarantee cuthbertson as unmanly and hes the leading representative of manly sentiment in london  craven that didnt do jo any harm but it took away my julias character  julia outraged daddy  charteris not at the ibsen club quite the contrary after all what can we do you know what breaks up most clubs for men and women theres a quarrela scandalcherchez la femmealways a woman at the bottom of it well we knew this when we founded the club but we noticed that the woman at the bottom of it was always a womanly woman the unwomanly women who work for their living and know how to take care of themselves never give any trouble so we simply said we wouldnt have any womanly women and when one gets smuggled in she has to take care not to behave in a womanly way we get on all right he rises come to lunch with me there tomorrow and see the place  cuthbertson rising no hes engaged to me but you can join us  charteris what hour  cuthbertson any time after twelve to craven its at 90 cork street at the other end of the burlington arcade  craven making a note 90 you say after twelve he suddenly relapses into gloom by the bye dont order anything special for me im not allowed wineonly apollinaris no meat eitheronly a scrap of fish occasionally im to have a short life but not a merry one sighing well well bracing himself up now julia its time for us to be off julia rises  cuthbertson but where on earth is grace i must go and look for her he turns to the door  julia stopping him oh pray dont disturb her mr cuthbertson shes so tired  cuthbertson but just for a moment to say good night julia and charteris look at one another in dismay cuthbertson looks quickly at them perceiving that something is wrong  charteris we must make a clean breast of it i see  cuthbertson clean breast  charteris the truth is cuthbertson mrs tranfield who is as you know the most thoughtful of women took it into her head that iwell that i particularly wanted to speak to miss craven alone so she said she was tired and wanted to go to bed  craven scandalized tut tut  cuthbertson oho is that it then its all right she never goes to bed as early as this ill fetch her in a moment he goes out confidently leaving charteris aghast  julia now youve done it she rushes to the round table and snatches up her mantle and bonnet im off she makes for the door  craven horrified what are you doing julia you cant go until youve said good night to mrs tranfield it would be horribly rude  julia you can stay if you like daddy i cant ill wait for you in the hall she hurries out  craven following her but what on earth am i to say stopping as she disappears and turning to charteris grumbling now really you know charteris this is devilish awkward upon my life it is that was a most indelicate thing of you to say plump out before us allthat about you and julia  charteris ill explain it all tomorrow just at present wed really better follow julias example and bolt he starts for the door  craven intercepting him stop dont leave me like this i shall look like a fool now i shall really take it in bad part if you run away charteris  charteris resignedly all right ill stay lifts himself on to the shoulder of the grand piano and sits there swinging his legs and contemplating craven resignedly  craven pacing up and down im excessively vexed about julias conduct i am indeed she cant bear to be crossed in the slightest thing poor child ill have to apologize for her you know her going away is a downright slap in the face for these people here cuthbertson may be offended already for all i know  charteris oh never mind about him mrs tranfield bosses this establishment  craven cunningly ah thats it is it hes just the sort of fellow that would have no control over his daughter he goes back to his former place on the hearthrug with his back to the fire by the bye what the dickens did he mean by all that about passing his life amidwhat was it scenes of suffering nobly endured and sacrifice willingly rendered by womanly women and manly men and a lot more of the same sort i suppose hes something in a hospital  charteris hospital nonsense hes a dramatic critic didnt you hear me say that he was the leading representative of manly sentiment in london  craven you dont say so now really whod have thought it how jolly it must be to be able to go to the theatre for nothing i must ask him to get me a few tickets occasionally but isnt it ridiculous for a man to talk like that im hanged if he dont take what he sees on the stage quite seriously  charteris of course thats why hes a good critic besides if you take people seriously off the stage why shouldnt you take them seriously on it where theyre under some sort of decent restraint he jumps down off piano and goes up to the window cuthbertson comes back  cuthbertson to craven rather sheepishly the fact is grace has gone to bed i must apologize to you and miss he turns to julias seat and stops on seeing it vacant  craven embarrassed it is i who have to apologize for julia jo she  charteris interrupting she said she was quite sure that if we didnt go youd persuade mrs tranfield to get up to say good night for the sake of politeness so she went straight off  cuthbertson very kind of her indeed im really ashamed  craven dont mention it jo dont mention it shes waiting for me below going good night good night charteris  charteris good night  cuthbertson seeing craven out goodnight say good night and thanks to miss craven for me tomorrow any time after twelve remember they go out and charteris with a long sigh crosses to the fireplace thoroughly tired out  craven outside all right  cuthbertson outside take care of the stairs theyre rather steep good night the outside door shuts and cuthbertson returns instead of entering he stands in the doorway with one hand in the breast of his waistcoat eyeing charteris sternly  charteris whats the matter  cuthbertson sternly charteris whats been going on here i insist on knowing grace has not gone to bed i have seen and spoken with her what is it all about  charteris ask your theatrical experience cuthbertson a man of course  cuthbertson coming forward and confronting him dont play the fool with me charteris im too old a hand to be amused by it i ask you seriously whats the matter  charteris i tell you seriously im the matter julia wants to marry me i want to marry grace i came here tonight to sweetheart grace enter julia alarums and excursions exit grace enter you and craven subterfuges and excuses exeunt craven and julia and here we are thats the whole story sleep over it good night he leaves  cuthbertson staring after him well ill be the act drop descends  end of act i      act ii  next day at noon in the library of the ibsen club a spacious room with glass doors right and left at the back in the middle is the fireplace surmounted by a handsome mantelpiece with a bust of ibsen and decorated inscriptions of the titles of his plays there are circular recesses at each side of fireplace with divan seats running round them and windows at the top the space between the divan and the window sills being lined with books a long settee is placed before the fire along the back of the settee and touching it is a green table littered with journals a revolving bookcase stands in the foreground a little to the left with an easy chair close to it on the right between the door and the recess is a light library stepladder placards inscribed silence are conspicuously exhibited here and there  cuthbertson is seated in the easy chair at the revolving bookstand reading the daily graphic dr paramore is on the divan in the right hand recess reading the british medical journal he is young as age is counted in the professionsbarely forty his hair is wearing bald on his forehead and his dark arched eyebrows coming rather close together give him a conscientiously sinister appearance he wears the frock coat and cultivates the bedside manner of the fashionable physician with scrupulous conventionality not at all a happy or frank man but not consciously unhappy nor intentionally insincere and highly self satisfied intellectually  sylvia craven is sitting in the middle of the settee before the fire only the back of her head being visible she is reading a volume of ibsen she is a girl of eighteen small and trim wearing a smart tailormade dress rather short and a newmarket jacket showing a white blouse with a light silk sash and a mans collar and watch chain so arranged as to look as like a mans waistcoat and shirtfront as possible without spoiling the prettiness of the effect a page boys voice monotonously calling for dr paramore is heard approaching outside on the right  page outside dr paramore dr paramore dr paramore he enters carrying a salver with a card on it dr par  paramore sharply sitting up here boy the boy presents the salver paramore takes the card and looks at it all right ill come down to him the boy goes paramore rises and comes from the recess throwing his paper on the table good morning mr cuthbertson stopping to pull out his cuffs and shake his coat straight mrs tranfield quite well i hope  sylvia turning her head indignantly shshsh paramore turns surprised cuthbertson rises energetically and looks across the bookstand to see who is the author of this impertinence  paramore to sylviastiffly i beg your pardon miss craven i did not mean to disturb you  sylvia flustered and self assertive you may talk as much as you like if you will only have the common consideration to first ask whether the other people object what i protest against is your assumption that my presence doesnt matter because im only a female member thats all now go on pray you dont disturb me in the least she turns to the fire and again buries herself in ibsen  cuthbertson with emphatic dignity no gentleman would have dreamt of objecting to our exchanging a few words madam she takes no notice he resumes angrily as a matter of fact i was about to say to dr paramore that if he would care to bring his visitor up here i should not object the impudence dashes his paper down on the chair  paramore oh many thanks but its only an instrument maker  cuthbertson any new medical discoveries doctor  paramore well since you ask me yesperhaps a most important one i have discovered something that has hitherto been overlookeda minute duct in the liver of the guinea pig miss craven will forgive my mentioning it when i say that it may throw an important light on her fathers case the first thing of course is to find out what the duct is there for  cuthbertson reverentlyfeeling that he is in the presence of science indeed how will you do that  paramore oh easily enough by simply cutting the duct and seeing what will happen to the guinea pig sylvia rises horrified i shall require a knife specially made to get at it the man who is waiting for me downstairs has brought me a few handles to try before fitting it and sending it to the laboratory i am afraid it would not do to bring such weapons up here  sylvia if you attempt such a thing dr paramore i will complain to the committee the majority of the committee are antivivisectionists you ought to be ashamed of yourself she flounces out at the right hand door  paramore with patient contempt thats the sort of thing we scientific men have to put up with nowadays mr cuthbertson ignorance superstition sentimentality they are all one a guinea pigs convenience is set above the health and lives of the entire human race  cuthbertson vehemently its not ignorance or superstition paramore its sheer downright ibsenism thats what it is ive been wanting to sit comfortably at the fire the whole morning but ive never had a chance with that girl there i couldnt go and plump myself down on a seat beside her goodness knows what shed think i wanted thats one of the delights of having women in the club when they come in here they all want to sit at the fire and adore that bust i sometimes feel that i should like to take the poker and fetch it a wipe across the noseugh  paramore i must say i prefer the elder miss craven to her sister  cuthbertson his eyes lighting up ah julia i believe you a splendid fine creatureevery inch a woman no ibsenism about her  paramore i quite agree with you there mr cuthbertson erby the way do you think is miss craven attached to charteris at all  cuthbertson what that fellow not he he hangs about after her but hes not man enough for her a woman of that sort likes a strong manly deepthroated broadchested man  paramore anxiously hm a sort of sporting character you think  cuthbertson oh no no a scientific man perhaps like yourself but you know what i meana man strikes himself a sounding blow on the chest  paramore of course but charteris is a man  cuthbertson pah you dont see what i mean the page boy returns with his salver  page boy calling monotonously as before mr cuthbertson mr cuthbertson mr cuth  cuthbertson here boy he takes a card from the salver bring the gentleman up here the boy goes out its craven hes coming to lunch with me and charteris you might join us if youve nothing better to do when youve finished with the instrument man if julia turns up ill ask her too  paramore flushing with pleasure i shall be very happy thank you he is going out at the right hand door when craven enters good morning colonel craven  craven at the door good morningglad to see you im looking for cuthbertson  paramore smiling there he is he goes out  cuthbertson greeting craven effusively delighted to see you now will you come to the smoking room or will you sit down here and have a chat while were waiting for charteris if you like company the smoking room is always full of women here we shall have it pretty well all to ourselves until about three oclock  craven i dont like to see women smoking ill make myself comfortable here sits in an easy chair on the right  cuthbertson taking a chair beside him on his left neither do i theres not a room in this club where i can enjoy a pipe quietly without a woman coming in and beginning to roll a cigarette its a disgusting habit in a woman its not natural to her sex  craven sighing ah jo times have changed since we both courted molly ebden all those years ago i took my defeat well old chap didnt i  cuthbertson with earnest approval you did dan the thought of it has often helped me to behave well myself it has on my honour  craven yes you always believe in hearth and home join a true english wife and a happy wholesome fireside how did molly turn out  cuthbertson trying to be fair to molly well not bad she might have been worse you see i couldnt stand her relations all the men were roaring cads and she couldnt get on with my mother and then she hated being in town and of course i couldnt live in the country on account of my work but we hit it off as well as most people until we separated  craven taken aback separated he is irresistibly amused oh that was the end of the hearth and home jo was it  cuthbertson warmly it was not my fault dan sentimentally some day the world will know how i loved that woman but she was incapable of valuing a true mans affection do you know she often said she wished shed married you instead  craven sobered by the suggestion dear me dear me well perhaps it was better as it was you heard about my marriage i suppose  cuthbertson oh yes we all heard of it  craven well jo i may as well make a clean breast of iteverybody knew it i married for money  cuthbertson encouragingly and why not dan why not we cant get on without it you know  craven with sincere feeling i got to be very fond of her jo i had a home until she died now everythings changed julias always here sylvias of a different nature but shes always here too  cuthbertson sympathetically i know its the same with grace shes always here  craven and now they want me to be always here theyre at me every day to join the clubto stop my grumbling i suppose thats what i want to consult you about do you think i ought to join  cuthbertson well if you have no conscientious objection  craven testily interrupting him i object to the existence of the place on principle but whats the use of that here it is in spite of my objection and i may as well have the benefit of any good that may be in it  cuthbertson soothing him of course thats the only reasonable view of the matter well the fact is its not so inconvenient as you might think when youre at home you have the house more to yourself and when you want to have your family about you you can dine with them at the club  craven not much attracted by this true  cuthbertson besides if you dont want to dine with them you neednt  craven convinced true very true but dont they carry on here rather  cuthbertson oh no they dont exactly carry on of course the usual tone of the club is low because the women smoke and earn their own living and all that but still theres nothing actually to complain of and its convenient certainly charteris comes in looking round for them  craven rising do you know ive a great mind to join just to see what its like would you mind putting me up  cuthbertson delighted dan delighted he grasps cravens hand  charteris putting one hand on cravens shoulder and the other on cuthbertsons bless you my children cuthbertson a little wounded in his dignity moves away the colonel takes the jest in the utmost good humor  craven cordially hallo  charteris to craven hope i havent disturbed your chat by coming too soon  craven not at all welcome dear boy shakes his hand  charteris thats right im earlier than i intended the fact is i have something rather pressing to say to cuthbertson  craven private  charteris not particularly to cuthbertson only what we were speaking of last night  cuthbertson well charteris i think that is private or ought to be  craven going up towards the table ill just take a look at the times  charteris stopping him oh its no secret everybody in the club guesses it to cuthbertson has grace never mentioned to you that she wants to marry me  cuthbertson indignantly she has mentioned that you want to marry her  charteris ah but then its not what i want but what grace wants that will weigh with you  craven a little shocked excuse me charteris this is private ill leave you to yourselves again moves towards the table  charteris wait a bit craven youre concerned in this julia wants to marry me too  craven in a tone of the strongest remonstrance now really now upon my life and soul  charteris its a fact i assure you didnt it strike you as rather odd our being up there last night and mrs tranfield not with us  craven well yes it did but you explained it and now really charteris i must say your explanation was in shocking bad taste before julia  charteris never mind it was a good fat healthy bouncing lie  craven and cuthbertson lie  charteris didnt you suspect that  craven certainly not did you jo  cuthbertson no most emphatically  craven whats more i dont believe you im sorry to have to say such a thing but you forget that julia was present and didnt contradict you  charteris she didnt want to  craven do you mean to say that my daughter deceived me  charteris delicacy towards me compelled her to craven  craven taking a very serious tone now look here charteris have you any proper sense of the fact that youre standing between two fathers  cuthbertson quite right dan quite right i repeat the question on my own account  charteris well im a little dazed still by standing for so long between two daughters but i think i grasp the situation cuthbertson flings away with an exclamation of disgust  craven then im sorry for your manners charteris thats all he turns away sulkily then suddenly fires up and turns on charteris how dare you tell me my daughter wants to marry you who are you pray that she should have any such ambition  charteris just so she couldnt have made a worse choice but she wont listen to reason ive talked to her like a father myselfi assure you my dear craven ive said everything that you could have said but its no use she wont give me up and if she wont listen to me what likelihood is there of her listening to you  craven in angry bewilderment cuthbertson did you ever hear anything like this  cuthbertson never never  charteris oh bother come dont behave like a couple of conventional old fathers this is a serious affair look at these letters producing a letter and a lettercard this showing the card is from graceby the way cuthbertson i wish youd ask her not to write on lettercards the blue colour makes it so easy for julia to pick the bits out of my waste paper basket and piece them together now listen my dear leonard nothing could make it worth my while to be exposed to such scenes as last nights you had much better go back to julia and forget me yours sincerely grace tranfield  cuthbertson infuriated damnation  charteris turning to craven and preparing to read the letter now for julia the colonel turns away to hide his face from charteris anticipating a shock and puts his hand on a chair to steady himself my dearest boy nothing will make me believe that this odious woman can take my place in your heart i send some of the letters you wrote me when we first met and i ask you to read them they will recall what you felt when you wrote them you cannot have changed so much as to be indifferent to me whoever may have struck your fancy for the moment your heart is still mineand so on you know the sort of thingever and always your loving julia the colonel sinks on the chair and covers his face with his hand you dont suppose shes serious do you thats the sort of thing she writes me three times a day to cuthbertson grace is in earnest though confound it he holds out graces letter a blue card as usual this time i shall not trust the waste paper basket he goes to the fire and throws the letters into it  cuthbertson facing him with folded arms as he comes down again may i ask mr charteris is this the new humour  charteris still too preoccupied with his own difficulty to have any sense of the effect he is producing on the others oh stuff do you suppose its a joke to be situated as i am youve got your head so stuffed with the new humour and the new woman and the new this that and the other all mixed up with your own old adam that youve lost your senses  cuthbertson strenuously do you see that old man grown grey in the honoured service of his country whose last days you have blighted  charteris surprised looking at craven and realizing his distress with genuine concern im very sorry come craven dont take it to heart craven shakes his head i assure you it means nothing it happens to me constantly  cuthbertson there is only one excuse for you you are not fully responsible for your actions like all advanced people you have got neurasthenia  charteris appalled great heavens whats that  cuthbertson i decline to explain you know as well as i do i am going downstairs now to order lunch i shall order it for three but the third place is for paramore whom i have invited not for you he goes out through the left hand door  charteris putting his hand on cravens shoulder come craven advise me youve been in this sort of fix yourself probably  craven charteris no woman writes such letters to a man unless he has made advances to her  charteris mournfully how little you know the world colonel the new woman is not like that  craven i can only give you very old fashioned advice my boy and that is that its well to be off with the old woman before youre on with the new im sorry you told me you might have waited for my death its not far off now his head droops again julia and paramore enter on the right julia stops as she catches sight of charteris her face clouding and her breast heaving paramore seeing the colonel apparently ill hurries down to him with the bedside manner in full play  charteris seeing julia oh lord he retreats under the lee of the revolving bookstand  paramore sympathetically to the colonel allow me takes his wrist and begins to count his pulse  craven looking up eh withdraws his hand and rises rather crossly no paramore its not my liver now its private business a chase now begins between julia and charteris all the more exciting to them because the huntress and her prey must alike conceal the real object of their movements from the others charteris first makes for the right hand door julia immediately moves back to it barring his path he doubles back round the bookstand setting it whirling as he makes for the left door julia crossing in pursuit of him he is about to escape when he is cut off by the return of cuthbertson he turns back and sees julia close upon him there being nothing else for it he bolts up into the recess to the left of the fireplace  cuthbertson good morning miss craven they shake hands wont you join us at lunch paramores coming too  julia thanks i shall be very pleased she goes up with affected purposelessness towards the recess charteris almost trapped in it crosses to the right hand recess by way of the fender knocking down the fire irons with a crash as he does so  craven who has crossed to the whirling bookcase and stopped it what the dickens are you doing there charteris  charteris nothing its such a confounded room to get about in  julia maliciously yes isnt it she is moving back to guard the right hand door when cuthbertson appears at it  cuthbertson may i take you down he offers her his arm  julia no really you know its against the rules of the club to coddle women in any way whoever is nearest to the door goes first  cuthbertson oh well if you insist come gentlemen let us go to lunch in the ibsen fashionthe unsexed fashion he goes out on the left followed by paramore laughing craven goes last he turns at the door to see whether julia is coming and stops when he sees she is not  craven come julia  julia with patronising affection yes daddy dear presently charteris is meanwhile stealing to the right hand door dont wait for me ill come in a moment the colonel hesitates its all right daddy  craven very gravely dont be long my dear he goes out  charteris im off makes a dash for the right hand door  julia darting at him and seizing his wrist arent you coming  charteris no unhand me julia he tries to get away she holds him if you dont let me go ill scream for help  julia reproachfully leonard he breaks away from her oh how can you be so rough with me dear did you get my letter  charteris burnt itshe turns away struck to the heart and buries her face in her handsalong with hers  julia quickly turning again hers has she written to you  charteris yes to break off with me on your account  julia her eyes gleaming ah  charteris you are pleased wretch now you have lost the last scrap of my regard he turns to go but is stopped by the return of sylvia julia turns away and stands pretending to read a paper which she picks up from the table  sylvia offhandedly hallo charteris how are you getting on she takes his arm familiarly and walks down the room with him have you seen grace tranfield this morning julia drops the paper and comes a step nearer to listen you generally know where she is to be found  charteris i shall never know any more sylvia shes quarrelled with me  sylvia sylvia how often am i to tell you that i am not sylvia at the club  charteris i forgot i beg your pardon craven old chap slaps her on the shoulder  sylvia thats bettera little overdone but better  julia dont be a fool silly  sylvia remember julia if you please that here we are members of the club not sisters i dont take liberties with you here on family grounds dont you take any with me she goes to the settee and resumes her former place  charteris quite right craven down with the tyranny of the elder sister  julia you ought to know better than to encourage a child to make herself ridiculous leonard even at my expense  charteris seating himself on the edge of the table your lunch will be cold julia julia is about to retort furiously when she is checked by the reappearance of cuthbertson at the left hand door  cuthbertson what has become of you miss craven your father is getting quite uneasy were all waiting for you  julia so i have just been reminded thank you she goes out angrily past him sylvia looking round to see  cuthbertson looking first after her then at charteris more neurasthenia he follows her  sylvia jumping up on her knees on the settee and speaking over the back of it whats up charteris julia been making love to you  charteris speaking to her over his shoulder no blowing me up for making love to grace  sylvia serve you right you are an awful devil for philandering  charteris calmly do you consider it good club form to talk that way to a man who might nearly be your father  sylvia knowingly oh i know you my lad  charteris then you know that i never pay any special attention to any woman  sylvia thoughtfully do you know leonard i really believe you i dont think you care a bit more for one woman than for another  charteris you mean i dont care a bit less for one woman than another  sylvia that makes it worse but what i mean is that you never bother about their being only women you talk to them just as you do to me or any other fellow thats the secret of your success you cant think how sick they get of being treated with the respect due to their sex  charteris ah if julia only had your wisdom craven he gets off the table with a sigh and perches himself reflectively on the stepladder  sylvia she cant take things easy can she old man but dont you be afraid of breaking her heart she gets over her little tragedies we found that out at home when our great sorrow came  charteris what was that  sylvia i mean when we learned that poor papa had paramores disease but it was too late to inoculate papa all they could do was to prolong his life for two years more by putting him on a strict diet poor old boy they cut off his liquor and hes not allowed to eat meat  charteris your father appears to me to be uncommonly well  sylvia yes you would think he was a great deal better but the microbes are at work slowly but surely in another year it will be all over poor old dad its unfeeling to talk about him in this attitude i must sit down properly she comes down from the settee and takes the chair near the bookstand i should like papa to live for ever just to take the conceit out of paramore i believe hes in love with julia  charteris starting up excitedly in love with julia a ray of hope on the horizon do you really mean it  sylvia i should think i do why do you suppose hes hanging about the club today in a beautiful new coat and tie instead of attending to his patients that lunch with julia will finish him hell ask daddys consent before they come backill bet you three to one he will in anything you please  charteris gloves  sylvia no cigarettes  charteris done but what does she think about it does she give him any encouragement  sylvia oh the usual thing enough to keep any other woman from getting him  charteris just so i understand now listen to me i am going to speak as a philosopher julia is jealous of everybodyeverybody if she saw you flirting with paramore shed begin to value him directly you might play up a little craven for my sakeeh  sylvia rising youre too awful leonard for shame however anything to oblige a fellow ibsenite ill bear your affair in mind but i think it would be more effective if you got grace to do it  charteris think so hm perhaps youre right  page boy outside as before dr paramore dr paramore dr paramore  sylvia they ought to get that boys voice properly cultivated its a disgrace to the club she goes into the recess on ibsens left the page enters carrying the british medical journal  charteris calling to the page dr paramore is in the dining room  page boy thank you sir he is about to go into the dining room when sylvia swoops on him  sylvia here where are you taking that paper it belongs to this room  page boy its dr paramores particular orders miss the british medical journal has always to be brought to him dreckly it comes  sylvia what cheek charteris oughtnt we to stop this on principle  charteris certainly not principles the poorest reason i know for making yourself nasty  sylvia bosh ibsen  charteris to the page off with you my boy dr paramores waiting breathless with expectation  page boy seriously indeed sir he hurries off  charteris that boy will make his way in this country he has no sense of humour grace comes in her dress very convenient and businesslike is made to please herself and serve her own purposes without the slightest regard to fashion though by no means without a careful concern for her personal elegance she enters briskly like an habitually busy woman  sylvia running to her here you are at last tranfield old girl ive been waiting for you this last hour im starving  grace all right dear to charteris did you get my letter  charteris yes i wish you wouldnt write on those confounded blue letter cards  sylvia to grace shall i go down first and secure a table  charteris taking the reply out of graces mouth do old boy  sylvia dont be too long she goes into the dining room  grace well  charteris im afraid to face you after last night can you imagine a more horrible scene dont you hate the very sight of me after it  grace oh no  charteris then you ought to ugh it was hideousan insultan outrage a nice end to all my plans for making you happyfor making you an exception to all the women who swear i have made them miserable  grace sitting down placidly i am not at all miserable im sorry but i shant break my heart  charteris no yours is a thoroughbred heart you dont scream and cry every time its pinched thats why you are the only possible woman for me  grace shaking her head not now never any more  charteris never what do you mean  grace what i say leonard  charteris jilted again the fickleness of women i love is only equaled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me well well i see how it is grace you cant get over that horrible scene last night imagine her saying i had kissed her within the last two days  grace rising eagerly was that not true  charteris true no a thumping lie  grace oh im so glad that was the only thing that really hurt me  charteris just why she said it how adorable of you to care my darling he seizes her hands and presses them to his breast  grace remember its all broken off  charteris ah yes you have my heart in your hands break it throw my happiness out of the window  grace oh leonard does your happiness really depend on me  charteris tenderly absolutely she beams with delight a sudden revulsion comes to him at the sight he recoils dropping her hands and crying ah no why should i lie to you he folds his arms and adds firmly my happiness depends on nobody but myself i can do without you  grace nerving herself so you shall thank you for the truth now i will tell you the truth  charteris unfolding his arms and again recoiling no please dont as a philosopher its my business to tell other people the truth but its not their business to tell it to me i dont like it it hurts  grace quietly its only that i love you  charteris ah thats not a philosophic truth you may tell me that as often as you like he takes her in his arms  grace yes leonard but im an advanced woman he checks himself and looks at her in some consternation im what my father calls a new woman he lets her go and stares at her i quite agree with all your ideas  charteris scandalized thats a nice thing for a respectable woman to say you ought to be ashamed of yourself  grace i am quite in earnest about them too though you are not and i will never marry a man i love too much it would give him a terrible advantage over me i should be utterly in his power thats what the new woman is like isnt she right mr philosopher  charteris the struggle between the philosopher and the man is fearful grace but the philosopher says you are right  grace i know i am right and so we must part  charteris not at all you must marry some one else and then ill come and philander with you sylvia comes back  sylvia holding the door open oh i say come along im starving  charteris so am i ill lunch with you if i may  sylvia i thought you would ive ordered soup for three grace passes out sylvia continues to charteris you can watch paramore from our table hes pretending to read the british medical journal but he must be making up his mind for the plunge he looks green with nervousness  charteris good luck to him he goes out followed by sylvia   end of act ii      act iii   still the library ten minutes later julia angry and miserable comes in from the dining room followed by craven she crosses the room tormentedly and throws herself into a chair  craven impatiently what is the matter has everyone gone mad today what do you mean by suddenly getting up from the table and tearing away like that what does paramore mean by reading his paper and not answering when hes spoken to julia writhes impatiently come come tenderly wont my pet tell her own father what irritably what the devil is wrong with everybody do pull yourself straight julia before cuthbertson comes hes only paying the bill hell be here in a moment  julia i couldnt bear it any longer oh to see them sitting there at lunch together laughing chatting making game of me i should have screamed out in another momenti should have taken a knife and killed heri should havecuthbertson appears with the luncheon bill in his hand he stuffs it into his waistcoat pocket as he comes to them he begins speaking the moment he enters  cuthbertson im afraid youve had a very poor lunch dan its disheartening to see you picking at a few beans and drinking soda water i wonder how you live  julia thats all he ever takes mr cuthbertson i assure you he hates to be bothered about it  craven wheres paramore   cuthbertson reading his paper i asked him wasnt he coming but he didnt hear me its amazing how anything scientific absorbs him clever man monstrously clever man  craven pettishly oh yes thats all very well jo but its not good manners at table he should shut up the shop sometimes heaven knows i am only too anxious to forget his science since it has pronounced my doom he sits down with a melancholy air  cuthbertson compassionately you mustnt think about that craven perhaps he was mistaken he sighs deeply and sits down but he is certainly a very clever fellow he thinks twice before he commits himself they sit in silence full of the gloomiest thoughts suddenly paramore enters pale and in the utmost disorder with the british medical journal in his clenched hand they rise in alarm he tries to speak but chokes clutches at his throat and staggers cuthbertson quickly takes his chair and places it behind paramore who sinks into it as they crowd about him craven at his right shoulder cuthbertson on his left and julia behind craven  craven whats the matter paramore  julia are you ill  cuthbertson no bad news i hope  paramore despairingly the worst of news terrible news fatal news my disease  craven quickly do you mean my disease  paramore fiercely i mean my diseaseparamores diseasethe disease i discoveredthe work of my life look here pointing to the b m j with a ghastly expression of horror if this is true it was all a mistake there is no such disease cuthbertson and julia look at one another hardly daring to believe the good news  craven in strong remonstrance and you call this bad news now really paramore  paramore cutting him short hoarsely its natural for you to think only of yourself i dont blame you all invalids are selfish only a scientific man can feel what i feel now writhing under a sense of intolerable injustice its the fault of the wickedly sentimental laws of this country i was not able to make experiments enoughonly three dogs and a monkey think of that with all europe full of my professional rivalsmen burning to prove me wrong there is freedom in franceenlightened republican france one frenchman experiments on two hundred monkeys to disprove my theory another sacrifices 36 poundsthree hundred dogs at three francs apieceto upset the monkey experiments a third proves them to be both wrong by a single experiment in which he gets the temperature of a camels liver 60 degrees below zero and now comes this cursed italian who has ruined me he has a government grant to buy animals with besides the run of the largest hospital in italy with desperate resolution but i wont be beaten by any italian ill go to italy myself ill rediscover my disease i know it exists i feel it and ill prove it if i have to experiment on every mortal animal thats got a liver at all he folds his arms and breathes hard at them  craven his sense of injury growing upon him am i to understand paramore that you took it on yourself to pass sentence of deathyes of deathon me on the strength of three dogs and an infernal monkey  paramore utterly contemptuous of cravens narrow personal view of the matter yes that was all i could get a license for  craven now upon my soul paramore im vexed at this i dont wish to be unfriendly but im extremely vexed really why confound it do you realize what youve done youve cut off my meat and drink for a yearmade me an object of public scorna miserable vegetarian and a teetotaller  paramore rising well you can make up for lost time now bitterly shewing craven the journal there you can read for yourself the camel was fed on beef dissolved in alcohol and he gained weight under it eat and drink as much as you please still unable to stand without support he makes his way past cuthbertson to the revolving bookcase and stands there with his back to them leaning on it with his head on his hand  craven grumbling oh yes its very easy for you to talk paramore but what am i to say to the humanitarian societies and the vegetarian societies that have made me a vice president  cuthbertson chuckling aha you made a virtue of it did you dan  craven warmly i made a virtue of necessity jo no one can blame me  julia soothing him well never mind daddy come back to the dining room and have a good beefsteak  craven shuddering ugh plaintively no ive lost my old manly taste for it my very natures been corrupted by living on pap to paramore thats what comes of all this vivisection you go experimenting on horses and of course the result is that you try to get me into condition by feeding me on beans  paramore curtly without changing his position well if theyve done you good so much the better for you  craven querulously thats all very well but its very vexing you dont half see how serious it is to make a man believe that he has only another year to live you really dont paramore i cant help saying it ive made my will which was altogether unnecessary and ive been reconciled to a lot of people id quarrelled withpeople i cant stand under ordinary circumstances then ive let the girls get round me at home to an extent i should never have done if id had my life before me ive done a lot of serious thinking and reading and extra church going and now it turns out simple waste of time on my soul its too disgusting id far rather die like a man when i said i would  paramore as before perhaps you may your hearts shaky if thats any satisfaction to you  craven offended you must excuse me paramore if i say that i no longer feel any confidence in your opinion as a medical man paramores eye flashes he straightens himself and listens i paid you a pretty stiff fee for that consultation when you condemned me and i cant say i think you gave me value for it  paramore turning and facing craven with dignity thats unanswerable colonel craven i shall return the fee  craven oh its not the money but i think you ought to realize your position paramore turns stiffly away craven follows him impulsively exclaiming remorsefully well perhaps it was a nasty thing of me to allude to it he offers paramore his hand  paramore conscientiously taking it not at all you are quite in the right colonel craven my diagnosis was wrong and i must take the consequences  craven holding his hand no dont say that it was natural enough my liver is enough to set any mans diagnosis wrong a long handshake very trying to paramores nerves paramore then retires to the recess on ibsens left and throws himself on the divan with a half suppressed sob bending over the british medical journal with his head on his hands and his elbows on his knees  cuthbertson who has been rejoicing with julia at the other side of the room well lets say no more about it i congratulate you craven and hope you may long be spared craven offers his hand no dan your daughter first he takes julias hand gently and hands her across to craven into whose arms she flies with a gush of feeling  julia dear old daddy  craven ah is julia glad that the old dad is let off for a few years more  julia almost crying oh so glad so glad cuthbertson sobs audibly the colonel is affected sylvia entering from the dining room stops abruptly at the door on seeing the three paramore in the recess escapes her notice  sylvia hallo  craven tell her the news julia it would sound ridiculous from me he goes to the weeping cuthbertson and pats him consolingly on the shoulder  julia silly only think dads not ill at all it was only a mistake of dr paramores oh dear she catches cravens left hand and stoops to kiss it his right hand being still on cuthbertsons shoulder  sylvia contemptuously i knew it of course it was nothing but eating too much i always said paramore was an ass sensation cuthbertson craven and julia turn in consternation  paramore without malice never mind miss craven that is what is being said all over europe now never mind  sylvia a little abashed im so sorry dr paramore you must excuse a daughters feelings  craven huffed it evidently doesnt make much difference to you sylvia  sylvia im not going to be sentimental over it dad you may bet coming to craven besides i knew it was nonsense all along petting him poor dear old dad why should your days be numbered any more than any one elses he pats her cheek mollified julia impatiently turns away from them come to the smoking room and lets see what you can do after teetotalling for a year  craven playfully vulgar little girl he pinches her ear shall we come jo youll be the better for a pickmeup after all this emotion  cuthbertson im not ashamed of it dan it has done me good he goes up to the table and shakes his fist at the bust over the mantelpiece it would do you good too if you had eyes and ears to take it in  craven astonished who  sylvia why good old henrik of course  craven puzzled henrik  cuthbertson impatiently ibsen man ibsen he goes out by the staircase door followed by sylvia who kisses her hand to the bust as she passes craven stares blankly after her and then up at the bust giving the problem up as insoluble he shakes his head and follows them near the door he checks himself and comes back  craven softly by the way paramore  paramore rousing himself with an effort yes  craven you werent in earnest that time about my heart were you  paramore oh nothing nothing theres a slight murmurmitral valves a little worn perhaps but theyll last your time if youre careful dont smoke too much  craven what more privations now really paramore really  paramore rising distractedly excuse me i cant pursue the subject ii  julia dont worry him now daddy  craven well well i wont he comes to paramore who is pacing restlessly up and down the middle of the room come paramore im not selfish believe me i can feel for your disappointment but you must face it like a man and after all now really doesnt this shew that theres a lot of rot about modern science between ourselves you know its horribly cruel you must admit that its a deuced nasty thing to go ripping up and crucifying camels and monkeys it must blunt all the finer feelings sooner or later  paramore turning on him how many camels and horses and men were ripped up in that soudan campaign where you won your victoria cross colonel craven  craven firing up that was fair fightinga very different thing paramore  paramore yes martinis and machine guns against naked spearmen  craven hotly i took my chance with the rest dr paramore i risked my own life dont forget that  paramore with equal spirit and i have risked mine as all doctors do oftener than any soldier  craven thats true i didnt think of that i beg your pardon paramore ill never say another word against your profession but i hope youll let me stick to the good oldfashioned shaking up treatment for my livera clinking run across country with the hounds  paramore with bitter irony isnt that rather cruela pack of dogs ripping up a fox  julia coming coaxingly between them oh please dont begin arguing again do go to the smoking room daddy mr cuthbertson will wonder what has become of you  craven very well very well ill go but youre really not reasonable today paramore to talk that way of fair sport  julia shsh coaxing him toward the door  craven well well im off he goes goodhumoredly pushed out by julia  julia turning at the door with her utmost witchery of manner dont look so disappointed dr paramore cheer up youve been most kind to us and youve done papa a lot of good  paramore delighted rushing over to her how beautiful it is of you to say that to me miss craven  julia i hate to see any one unhappy i cant bear unhappiness she runs out casting a parthian glance at him as she flies paramore stands enraptured gazing after her through the glass door whilst he is thus absorbed charteris comes in from the dining room and touches him on the arm  paramore starting eh whats the matter  charteris significantly charming woman isnt she paramore looking admiringly at him how have you managed to fascinate her  paramore i do you really mean he looks at him then recovers himself and adds coldly excuse me this is a subject i do not care to jest about he walks away from charteris down the side of the room and sits down in an easy chair reading his journal to intimate that he does not wish to pursue the conversation  charteris ignoring the hint and coolly taking a chair beside him why dont you get married paramore you know its a scandalous thing for a man in your profession to be single  paramore shortly still pretending to read thats my own business not yours  charteris not at all its preeminently a social question youre going to get married arent you  paramore not that i am aware of  charteris alarmed no dont say that why  paramore rising angrily and rapping one of the silence placards allow me to call your attention to that he crosses to the easy chair near the revolving bookstand and flings himself into it with determined hostility  charteris following him too deeply concerned to mind the rebuff paramore you alarm me more than i can say youve been and muffed this business somehow i know perfectly well what youve been up to and i fully expected to find you a joyful accepted suitor  paramore angrily yes you have been watching me because you admire miss craven yourself well you may go in and win now you will be pleased to hear that i am a ruined man  charteris you ruined how the turf  paramore contemptuously the turf certainly not  charteris paramore if the loan of all i possess will help you over this difficulty youre welcome to it  paramore rising in surprise charteris i suspiciously are you joking  charteris why on earth do you always suspect me of joking i never was more serious in my life  paramore shamed by charteriss generosity then i beg your pardon i thought the news would please you  charteris deprecating this injustice to his good feeling my dear fellow  paramore i see i was wrong i am really very sorry they shake hands and now you may as well learn the truth i had rather you heard it from me than from the gossip of the club my liver discovery has beenererhe cannot bring himself to say it  charteris helping him out confirmed sadly i see the poor colonels doomed  paramore no on the contrary it has beenercalled in question the colonel now believes himself to be in perfectly good health and my friendly relations with the cravens are entirely spoiled  charteris who told him about it  paramore i did of course the moment i read the news in this he shews the journal and puts it down on the bookstand  charteris why man youve been a messenger of glad tidings didnt you congratulate him  paramore scandalised congratulate him congratulate a man on the worst blow pathological science has received for the last three hundred years  charteris no no no congratulate him on having his life saved congratulate julia on having her father spared swear that your discovery and your reputation are as nothing to you compared with the pleasure of restoring happiness to the household in which the best hopes of your life are centred confound it man youll never get married if you cant turn things to account with a woman in these little ways  paramore gravely excuse me but my selfrespect is dearer to me even than miss craven i cannot trifle with scientific questions for the sake of a personal advantage he turns away coldly and goes toward the table  charteris well this beats me the nonconformist conscience is bad enough but the scientific conscience is the very devil he follows paramore and puts his arm familiarly round his shoulder bringing him back again whilst he speaks now look here paramore ive got no conscience in that sense at all i loathe it as i loathe all the snares of idealism but i have some common humanity and common sense he replaces him in the easy chair and sits down opposite him come what is a really scientific theorya true theory isnt it  paramore no doubt  charteris for instance you have a theory about cravens liver eh  paramore i still believe that to be a true theory though it has been upset for the moment  charteris and you have a theory that it would be pleasant to be married to julia  paramore i suppose soin a sense  charteris that theory also will be upset probably before youre a year older  paramore always cynical charteris  charteris never mind that now its a perfectly damnable thing for you to hope that your liver theory is true because it amounts to hoping that craven will die an agonizing death this strikes paramore as paradoxical but it startles him but its amiable and human to hope that your theory about julia is right because it amounts to hoping that she may live happily ever after  paramore i do hope that with all my soulcorrecting himself i mean with all my function of hoping  charteris then since both theories are equally scientific why not devote yourself as a humane man to proving the amiable theory rather than the damnable one  paramore but how  charteris ill tell you you think im fond of julia myself so i am but then im fond of everybody so i dont count besides if you try the scientific experiment of asking her whether she loves me shell tell you that she hates and despises me so im out of the running nevertheless like you i hope that she may be happy with all mywhat did you call your soul  paramore impatiently oh go on go on finish what you were going to say  charteris suddenly affecting complete indifference and rising carelessly i dont know that i have anything more to say if i were you i should invite the cravens to tea in honor of the colonels escape from a horrible doom by the way if youve done with that british medical journal i should like to see how theyve smashed your theory up  paramore wincing as he also rises oh certainly if you wish it i have no objection he takes the journal from the bookstand i admit that the italian experiments apparently upset my theory but please remember that it is doubtfulextremely doubtfulwhether anything can be proved by experiments on animals he hands charteris the journal  charteris taking it it doesnt matter i dont intend to make any he retires to the recess on ibsens right picking up the step ladder as he passes and placing it so that he is able to use it for a leg rest as he settles himself to read on the divan with his back to the corner of the mantelpiece paramore goes to the left hand door and is about to leave the library when he meets grace entering  grace how do you do dr paramore so glad to see you they shake hands  paramore thanks quite well i hope  grace quite thank you youre looking overworked we must take more care of you doctor  paramore you are very kind  grace it is you who are too kindto your patients you sacrifice yourself have a little rest come and talk to metell me all about the latest scientific discoveries and what i ought to read to keep myself up to date but perhaps youre busy  paramore no not at all only too delighted they go into the recess on ibsens left and sit there chatting in whispers very confidentially  charteris how they all love a doctor they can say what they like to him julia returns he takes his feet down from the ladder and sits up whew julia wanders down his side of the room apparently looking for someone charteris steals after her  charteris in a low voice looking for me julia  julia starting violently oh how you startled me  charteris sh i want to shew you something look he points to the pair in the recess  julia jealously that woman  charteris my young woman carrying off your young man  julia what do you mean do you dare insinuate  charteris shshsh dont disturb them paramore rises takes down a book and sits on a footstool at graces feet  julia why are they whispering like that  charteris because they dont want anyone to hear what they are saying to one another paramore shews grace a picture in the book they both laugh heartily over it  julia what is he shewing her  charteris probably a diagram of the liver julia with an exclamation of disgust makes for the recess charteris catches her sleeve stop be careful julia she frees herself by giving him a push which upsets him into the easy chair then crosses to the recess and stands looking down at grace and paramore from the corner next the fireplace  julia with suppressed fury you seem to have found a very interesting book dr paramore they look up astonished may i ask what it is she stoops swiftly snatches the book from paramore and comes down to the table quickly to look at it whilst they rise in amazement good words she flings it on the table and sweeps back past charteris exclaiming contemptuously you fool paramore and grace meanwhile come from the recess paramore bewildered grace very determined  charteris aside to julia as he gets out of the easy chair idiot shell have you turned out of the club for this  julia terrified she cantcan she  paramore what is the matter miss craven  charteris hastily nothingmy faulta stupid practical joke i beg your pardon and mrs tranfields  grace firmly it is not your fault in the least mr charteris dr paramore will you oblige me by finding sylvia craven for me if you can  paramore hesitating but  grace i want you to go now if you please  paramore succumbing certainly he bows and goes out by the staircase door  grace you are going with him charteris  julia you will not leave me here to be insulted by this woman mr charteris she takes his arm as if to go with him  grace when two ladies quarrel in this club it is against the rules to settle it when there are gentlemen presentespecially the gentleman they are quarrelling about i presume you do not wish to break that rule miss craven julia sullenly drops charteriss arm grace turns to charteris and adds now trot off  charteris certainly certainly he follows paramore ignominiously  grace to julia with quiet peremptoriness now what have you to say to me  julia suddenly throwing herself tragically on her knees at graces feet dont take him from me oh dontdont be so cruel give him back to me you dont know what youre doingwhat our past has beenhow i love him you dont know  grace get up and dont be a fool suppose anyone comes in and sees you in that ridiculous attitude  julia i hardly know what im doing i dont care what im doing im too miserable oh wont you listen to me  grace do you suppose i am a man to be imposed on by this sort of rubbish  julia getting up and looking darkly at her you intend to take him from me then  grace do you expect me to help you to keep him after the way you have behaved  julia trying her theatrical method in a milder formreasonable and impulsively goodnatured instead of tragic i know i was wrong to act as i did last night i beg your pardon i am sorry i was mad  grace not a bit mad you calculated to an inch how far you could go when he is present to stand between us and play out the scene with you i count for nothing when we are alone you fall back on your natural way of getting anything you wantcrying for it like a baby until it is given to you  julia with unconcealed hatred you learnt this from him  grace i learnt it from yourself last night and now how i hate to be a woman when i see by you what wretched childish creatures we are those two men would cut you dead and have you turned out of the club if you were a man and had behaved in such a way before them but because you are only a woman they are forbearing sympathetic gallantoh if you had a scrap of selfrespect their indulgence would make you creep all over i understand now why charteris has no respect for women  julia how dare you say that  grace dare i love him and i have refused his offer to marry me  julia incredulous but hopeful you have refused  grace yes because i will not give myself to any man who has learnt how to treat women from you and your like i can do without his love but not without his respect and it is your fault that i cannot have both take his love then and much good may it do you run to him and beg him to have mercy on you and take you back  julia oh what a liar you are he loved me before he ever saw youbefore he ever dreamt of you you pitiful thing do you think i need go down on my knees to men to make them come to me that may be your experience you creature with no figure it is not mine there are dozens of men who would give their souls for a look from me i have only to lift my finger  grace lift it then and see whether he will come  julia how i should like to kill you i dont know why i dont  grace yes you like to get out of your difficulties cheaplyat other peoples expense it is something to boast of isnt it that dozens of men would make love to you if you invited them  julia sullenly i suppose its better to be like you with a cold heart and a serpents tongue thank heaven i have a heart that is why you can hurt me as i cannot hurt you and you are a coward you are giving him up to me without a struggle  grace yes it is for you to struggle i wish you success she turns away contemptuously and is going to the diningroom door when sylvia enters on the opposite side followed by cuthbertson and craven who come to julia whilst sylvia crosses to grace  sylvia here i am sent by the faithful paramore he hinted that id better bring the elder members of the family too here they are whats the row  grace quietly nothing dear theres no row  julia hysterically tottering and stretching out her arms to craven daddy  craven taking her in his arms my precious whats the matter  julia through her tears shes going to have me expelled from the club and we shall all be disgraced can she do it daddy  craven well really the rules of this club are so extraordinary that i dont know to grace may i ask mrs tranfield whether you have any complaint to make of my daughters conduct  grace yes colonel craven i am going to complain to the committee  sylvia i knew youd overdo it some day julia craven at a loss looks at cuthbertson  cuthbertson dont look at me dan within these walls a fathers influence counts for nothing  craven may i ask the ground of complaint mrs tranfield  grace simply that miss craven is essentially a womanly woman and as such not eligible for membership  julia its false im not a womanly woman i was guaranteed when i joined just as you were  grace by mr charteris i think at your own request i shall call him as a witness to your thoroughly womanly conduct just now in his presence and dr paramores  craven cuthbertson are they joking or am i dreaming  cuthbertson grimly its real dan youre awake  sylvia taking cravens left arm and hugging it affectionately dear old rip van winkle  craven well mrs tranfield all i can say is that i hope you will succeed in establishing your complaint and that julia may soon see the last of this most outrageous institution sylvia still caressing his arm laughs at him charteris returns  charteris at the door may i come in  sylvia releasing the colonel yes youre wanted here as a witness charteris comes in its a bad case of womanliness  grace half aside to him significantly you understand julia watching them jealously leaves her father and gets close to charteris grace adds aloud i shall expect your support before the committee  julia if you have a scrap of manhood you will take my part  charteris but then i shall be expelled for being a manly man besides im on the committee myself i cant act as judge and witness too you must apply to paramore he saw it all  grace where is dr paramore  charteris just gone home  julia with sudden resolution what is dr paramores number in savile row  charteris seventynine julia goes out quickly by the staircase door to their astonishment charteris follows her to the door which swings back in his face leaving him staring after her through the glass sylvia runs to grace  sylvia grace go after her dont let her get beforehand with paramore shell tell him the most heartbreaking stories about how shes been treated and get him round completely  craven floundering sylvia is that the way to speak of your sister miss grace squeezes sylvias hand to console her and sits down calmly sylvia posts herself behind graces chair leaning over the back to watch the ensuing colloquy between the three men i assure you mrs tranfield dr paramore has just invited us all to take afternoon tea with him and if my daughter has gone to his house she is simply taking advantage of his invitation to extricate herself from a very embarrassing scene here were all going there come sylvia he turns to go followed by cuthbertson  charteris in consternation stop he gets between craven and cuthbertson what hurry is there cant you give the man time  craven time what for  charteris talking foolishly in his agitation well to get a little rest you knowa busy professional man like that hes not had a moment to himself all day  craven but julias with him  charteris well no matter shes only one person and she ought to have an opportunity of laying her case before him as a member of the committee i think thats only just be reasonable craven give him half an hour  cuthbertson sternly what do you mean by this charteris  charteris nothing i assure you only common consideration for poor paramore  cuthbertson youve some motive craven i strongly advise that we go at once he grasps the door handle  charteris coaxingly no no he puts his hand persuasively on cravens arm adding its not good for your liver craven to rush about immediately after lunch  cuthbertson his livers cured come on craven he opens the door  charteris catching cuthbertson by the sleeve cuthbertson youre mad paramores going to propose to julia we must give him time hes not the man to come to the point in three minutes as you or i would turning to craven dont you seethat will get me out of the difficulty we were speaking of this morningyou and i and cuthbertson you remember  craven now is this a thing to say plump out before everybody charteris confound it have you no decency  cuthbertson severely none whatever  charteris turning to cuthbertson nodont be unkind cuthbertson back me up my future her future mrs tranfields future cravens future everybodys future depends on our finding julia paramores affianced bride when we go over to savile row hes certain to propose if youll only give him time you know youre a kindly and sensible man as well as a deucedly clever one cuthbertson in spite of all your nonsense say a word for me  craven im quite willing to leave the decision to cuthbertson and i have no doubt whatever as to what that decision will be cuthbertson carefully shuts the door and comes back into the room with an air of weighty reflection  cuthbertson i am now going to speak as a man of the world that is without moral responsibility  craven quite so jo of course  cuthbertson therefore though i have no sympathy whatever with charteriss views i think we can do no harm by waitingsay ten minutes or so he sits down  charteris delighted ah theres nobody like you after all cuthbertson when theres a difficult situation to be judged  craven deeply disappointed oh well jo if that is your decision i must keep my word and abide by it better sit down and make ourselves comfortable i suppose he sits also under protest  charteris fidgeting about i cant sit down im too restless the fact is julia has made me so nervous that i cant answer for myself until i know her decision mrs tranfield will tell you what a time ive had lately julias really a most determined woman you know  craven starting up well upon my life upon my honor and conscience now really i shall go this instant come on sylvia cuthbertson i hope youll mark your sense of this sort of thing by coming on to paramores with us at once he marches to the door  charteris desperately craven youre trifling with your daughters happiness i only ask five minutes more  craven not five seconds sir fie for shame charteris he goes out  cuthbertson to charteris as he passes him on his way to the door bungler he follows craven  sylvia serve you right you duffer she follows cuthbertson  charteris oh these headstrong old men to grace nothing to be done now but go with them and delay the colonel as much as possible so im afraid i must leave you  grace rising not at all paramore invited me too when we were talking over there  charteris aghast you dont mean to say youre coming  grace most certainly do you suppose i will let that woman think i am afraid to meet her charteris sinks on a chair with a prolonged groan come dont be silly youll not overtake the colonel if you delay any longer  charteris why was i ever born child of misfortune that i am he rises despairingly well if you must come you must he offers his arm which she takes by the way what happened after i left you  grace i gave her a lecture on her behavior which she will remember to the last day of her life  charteris approvingly that was right darling he slips his arm round her waist just one kissto soothe me  grace complacently offering her cheek foolish boy he kisses her now come along they go out together   end of act iii      act iv  sittingroom in paramores apartments in savile row the darkly respectable furniture is so to speak en suite with paramores frock coat and cuffs viewing the room from the front windows the door is seen in the opposite wall near the left hand corner another door a light noiseless partition one covered with a green baize is in the right hand wall toward the back leading to paramores consulting room the fireplace is on the left at the nearest corner of it a couch is placed at right angles to the wall settlewise on the right the wall is occupied by a bookcase further forward than the green baize door beyond the door is a cabinet of anatomical preparations with a framed photograph of rembrandts school of anatomy hanging on the wall above it in front a little to the right a teatable  paramore is seated in a roundbacked chair on castors pouring out tea julia sits opposite him with her back to the fire he is in high spirits she very downcast  paramore handing her the cup he has just filled there making tea is one of the few things i consider myself able to do thoroughly well cake  julia no thank you i dont like sweet things she sets down the cup untasted  paramore anything wrong with the tea  julia no its very nice  paramore im afraid im a very bad entertainer the fact is im too professional i only shine in consultation i almost wish you had something the matter with you so that you might call out my knowledge and sympathy as it is i can only admire you and feel how pleasant it is to have you here  julia bitterly and pet me and say pretty things to me i wonder you dont offer me a saucer of milk at once  paramore astonished why  julia because you seem to regard me very much as if i were a persian cat  paramore in strong remonstrance miss cra  julia cutting him short oh you neednt protest im used to it its the only sort of attachment i seem always to inspire ironically you cant think how flattering it is  paramore my dear miss craven what a cynical thing to say you who are loved at first sight by the people in the street as you pass why in the club i can tell by the faces of the men whether you have been lately in the room or not  julia shrinking fiercely oh i hate that look in their faces do you know that i have never had one human being care for me since i was born  paramore thats not true miss craven even if it were true of your father and of charteris who loves you madly in spite of your dislike for him it is not true of me  julia startled who told you that about charteris  paramore why he himself  julia with deep poignant conviction he cares for only one person in the world and that is himself there is not in his whole nature one unselfish spot he would not spend one hour of his real life with a sob chokes her she rises passionately crying you are all alike every one of you even my father only makes a pet of me she goes away to the fireplace and stands with her back to him  paramore following her humbly i dont deserve this from you indeed i do not  julia rating him then why do you talk about me with charteris behind my back  paramore we said nothing disparaging of you nobody shall ever do that in my presence we spoke of the subject nearest our hearts  julia his heart oh god his heart she sits down on the couch and hides her face  paramore sadly i am afraid you love him for all that miss craven  julia raising her head instantly if he says that he lies if ever you hear it said that i cared for him contradict it it is false  paramore quickly advancing to her miss craven is the way clear for me then  julia pettishlylosing interest in the conversation and looking crossly into the fire what do you mean  paramore impetuously you must see what i mean contradict the rumour of your attachment to charteris not by wordsit has gone too far for thatbut by becoming my wife earnestly believe me it is not merely your beauty that attracts me julia interested looks up at him quickly i know other beautiful women it is your heart your sincerity your sterling reality julia rises and gazes at him breathless with a new hope your great gifts of character that are only half developed because you have never been understood by those about you  julia looking intently at him and yet beginning to be derisively sceptical in spite of herself have you really seen all that in me  paramore i have felt it i have been alone in the world and i need you julia that is how i have divined that you also are alone in the world  julia with theatrical pathos you are right there i am indeed alone in the world  paramore timidly approaching her with you i should not be alone and youwith me  julia you she gets quickly out of his reach taking refuge at the teatable no no i cant bring myself she breaks off perplexed and looks uneasily about her oh i dont know what to do you will expect too much from me she sits down  paramore i have more faith in you than you have in yourself your nature is richer than you think  julia doubtfully do you really believe that i am not the shallow jealous devilish tempered creature they all pretend i am  paramore i am ready to place my happiness in your hands does that prove what i think of you  julia yes i believe you really care for me he approaches her eagerly she has a violent revulsion and rises with her hand raised as if to beat him off crying no no no no i cannot its impossible she goes towards the door  paramore looking wistfully after her is it charteris  julia stopping and turning ah you think that she comes back listen to me if i say yes will you promise not to touch meto give me time to accustom myself to the idea of our new relations  paramore i promise most faithfully i would not press you for the world  julia thenthenyes i promise he is about to utter his rapture she will not have it now not another word of it let us forget it she resumes her seat at the table give me some more tea he hastens to his former seat as he passes she puts her left hand on his arm and says be good to me percy i need it sorely  paramore transported you have called me percy hurrah charteris and craven come in paramore hastens to meet them beaming delighted to see you here with me colonel craven and you too charteris sit down the colonel sits down on the end of the couch where are the others  charteris sylvia has dragged cuthbertson off into the burlington arcade to buy some caramels he likes to encourage her in eating caramels he thinks its a womanly taste besides he likes them himself theyll be here presently he strolls across to the cabinet and pretends to study the rembrandt photograph so as to be as far out of julias reach as possible  craven yes and charteris has been trying to persuade me that theres a short cut between cork street and savile row somewhere in conduit street now did you ever hear such nonsense then he said my coat was getting shabby and wanted me to go into pooles and order a new one paramore is my coat shabby  paramore not that i can see  craven i should think not then he wanted to draw me into a dispute about the egyptian war we should have been here quarter of an hour ago only for his nonsense  charteris still contemplating rembrandt i did my best to keep him from disturbing you paramore  paramore gratefully you have come in the nick of time colonel craven i have something very particular to say to you  craven springing up in alarm in private paramore now really it must be in private  paramore surprised of course i was about to suggest my consulting room theres nobody there miss craven will you excuse me charteris will entertain you until i return he leads the way to the green baize door  charteris aghast oh i say hadnt you better wait until the others come  paramore exultant no need for further delay now my best friend he wrings charteriss hand will you come colonel  craven at your service paramore at your service craven and paramore go into the consulting room julia turns her head and stares insolently at charteris his nerves play him false he is completely out of countenance in a moment she rises suddenly he starts and comes hastily forward between the table and the bookcase she crosses to that side behind the table and he immediately crosses to the opposite side in front of it dodging her  charteris nervously dont julia now dont abuse your advantage youve got me here at your mercy be good for once and dont make a scene  julia contemptuously do you suppose i am going to touch you  charteris no of course not she comes forward on her side of the table he retreats on his side of it she looks at him with utter scorn sweeps across to the couch and sits down imperially with a great sigh of relief he drops into paramores chair  julia come here i have something to say to you  charteris yes he rolls the chair a few inches towards her  julia come here i say i am not going to shout across the room at you are you afraid of me  charteris horribly he moves the chair slowly with great misgiving to the end of the couch  julia with studied insolence has that woman told you that she has given you up to me without an attempt to defend her conquest  charteris whispering persuasively shew that you are capable of the same sacrifice give me up too  julia sacrifice and so you think im dying to marry you do you  charteris i am afraid your intentions have been honourable julia  julia you cad  charteris with a sigh i confess i am something either more or less than a gentleman julia you once gave me the benefit of the doubt  julia indeed i never told you so if you cannot behave like a gentleman you had better go back to the society of the woman who has given you upif such a coldblooded cowardly creature can be called a woman she rises majestically he makes his chair fly back to the table i know you now leonard charteris through and through in all your falseness your petty spite your cruelty and your vanity the place you coveted has been won by a man more worthy of it  charteris springing up and coming close to her gasping with eagerness what do you mean out with it have you accep  julia i am engaged to dr paramore  charteris enraptured my own julia he attempts to embrace her  julia recoilinghe catching her hands and holding them how dare you are you mad do you wish me to call dr paramore  charteris call everybody my darlingeverybody in london now i shall no longer have to be brutalto defend myselfto go in fear of you how i have looked forward to this day you know now that i dont want you to marry me or to love me paramore can have all that i only want to look on and rejoice disinterestedly in the happiness of kissing her hand my dear julia kissing the other my beautiful julia she tears her hands away and raises them as if to strike him as she did the night before at cuthbertsons no use to threaten me now i am not afraid of those handsthe loveliest hands in the world  julia how have you the face to turn round like this after insulting and torturing me  charteris never mind dearest you never did understand me and you never will our vivisecting friend has made a successful experiment at last  julia earnestly it is you who are the vivisectora far crueller more wanton vivisector than he  charteris yes but then i learn so much more from my experiments than he does and the victims learn as much as i do thats where my moral superiority comes in  julia sitting down again on the couch with rueful humour well you shall not experiment on me any more go to your grace if you want a victim shell be a tough one  charteris reproachfully sitting down beside her and you drove me to propose to her to escape from you suppose she had accepted me where should i be now  julia where i am i suppose now that i have accepted paramore  charteris but i should have made grace unhappy julia sneers however now i come to think of it youll make paramore unhappy and yet if you refused him he would be in despair poor devil  julia her temper flashing up for a moment again he is a better man than you  charteris humbly i grant you that my dear  julia impetuously dont call me your dear and what do you mean by saying that i shall make him unhappy am i not good enough for him  charteris dubiously well that depends on what you mean by good enough  julia earnestly you might have made me good if you had chosen to you had a great power over me i was like a child in your hands and you knew it  charteris with comic acquiescence yes my dear that means that whenever you got jealous and flew into a violent rage i could always depend on its ending happily if i only waited long enough and petted you very hard all the time when you had had your fling and called the object of your jealousy every name you could lay your tongue to and abused me to your hearts content for a couple of hours then the reaction would come and you would at last subside into a soothing rapture of affection which gave you a sensation of being angelically good and forgiving oh i know that sort of goodness you may have thought on these occasions that i was bringing out your latent amiability but i thought you were bringing out mine and using up rather more than your fair share of it  julia according to you then i have no good in me i am an utterly vile worthless woman is that it  charteris yes if you are to be judged as you judge others from the conventional point of view theres nothing to be said for you julianothing thats why i have to find some other point of view to save my selfrespect when i remember how i have loved you oh what i have learnt from youfrom you who could learn nothing from me i made a fool of you and you brought me wisdom i broke your heart and you brought me joy i made you curse your womanhood and you revealed my manhood to me blessings forever and ever on my julias name with genuine emotion he takes her hand to kiss it again  julia snatching her hand away in disgust oh stop talking that nasty sneering stuff  charteris laughingly appealing to the heavens she calls it nasty sneering stuff well well ill never talk like that to you again dearest it only means that you are a beautiful woman and that we all love you  julia dont say that i hate it it sounds as if i were a mere animal  charteris hm a fine animal is a very wonderful thing dont let us disparage animals julia  julia that is what you really think me  charteris come julia you dont expect me to admire you for your moral qualities do you she turns and looks hard at him he starts up apprehensively and backs away from her she rises and follows him up slowly and intently  julia deliberately i have seen you very much infatuated with this depraved creature who has no moral qualities  charteris retreating keep off julia remember your new obligations to paramore  julia overtaking him in the middle of the room never mind paramore that is my business she grasps the lappels of his coat in her hands and looks fixedly at him oh if the people you talk so cleverly to could only know you as i know you sometimes i wonder at myself for ever caring for you  charteris beaming at her only sometimes  julia you fraud you humbug you miserable little plaster saint he looks delighted oh in a paroxysm half of rage half of tenderness she shakes him growling over him like a tigress over her cub paramore and craven at this moment return from the consulting room and are thunderstruck at the spectacle  craven shouting utterly scandalized julia julia releases charteris but stands her ground disdainfully as they come forward craven on her left paramore on her right  paramore whats the matter  charteris nothing nothing youll soon get used to this paramore  craven now really julia this is a very extraordinary way to behave its not fair to paramore  julia coldly if dr paramore objects he can break off our engagement to paramore pray dont hesitate  paramore looking doubtfully and anxiously at her do you wish me to break it off  charteris alarmed nonsense dont act so hastily it was my fault i annoyed miss craveninsulted her hang it all dont go and spoil everything like this  craven this is most infernally perplexing i cant believe that you insulted julia charteris ive no doubt you annoyed heryoud annoy anybody upon my soul you wouldbut insultnow what do you mean by that  paramore very earnestly miss craven delicacy and sincerity i ask you to be frank with me what are the relations between you and charteris  julia ask him she goes to the fireplace her back on them  charteris certainly ill confess im in love with miss cravenalways have been and ive persecuted her with my addresses ever since i knew her its been no use she utterly despises me a moment ago the spectacle of a rivals happiness stung me to make a nasty sneering speech and shewell she just shook me a little as you saw  paramore chivalrously i shall never forget that you helped me to win her charteris julia quickly a spasm of fury in her face  charteris sh for heavens sake dont mention it  craven this is a very different story to the one you told cuthbertson and myself this morning youll excuse my saying that it sounds much more like the the truth come you were humbugging us werent you  charteris ask julia paramore and craven turn to julia charteris remains doggedly looking straight before him  julia its quite true he has been in love with me he has persecuted me and i utterly despise him  graven dont rub it in julia its not kind no man is quite himself when hes crossed in love to charteris now listen to me charteris when i was a young fellow cuthbertson and i fell in love with the same woman she preferred cuthbertson i was taken aback i wont deny it but i knew my duty and i did it i gave her up and wished cuthbertson joy he told me this morning when we met after many years that he has respected and liked me ever since for it and i believe him and feel the better for it impressively now charteris paramore and you stand today where cuthbertson and i stood on a certain july evening thirtyfive years ago how are you going to take it  julia indignantly how is he going to take it indeed really papa this is too much if mrs cuthbertson wouldnt have you it may have been very noble of you to make a virtue of giving her up just as you made a virtue of being a teetotaller when percy cut off your wine but he shant be virtuous over me i have refused him and if he doesnt like it he canhe can  charteris i can lump it precisely craven you can depend on me ill lump it he moves off nonchalantly and leans against the bookcase with his hands in his pockets  craven hurt julia you dont treat me respectfully i dont wish to complain but that was not a becoming speech  julia bursting into tears and throwing herself into the large chair is there anyone in the world who has any feeling for mewho does not think me utterly vile craven and paramore hurry to her in the greatest consternation  craven remorsefully my pet i didnt for a moment mean  julia must i stand to be bargained for by two menpassed from one to the other like a slave in the market and not say a word in my own defence  craven but my love  julia oh go away all of you leave me ioh she gives way to a passion of tears  paramore reproachfully to craven youve wounded her cruelly colonel cravencruelly  craven but i didnt mean to i said nothing charteris was i harsh  charteris you forget the revolt of the daughters craven and you certainly wouldnt have gone on like that to any grown up woman who was not your daughter  craven do you mean to say that i am expected to treat my daughter the same as i would any other girl  paramore i should say certainly colonel craven  craven well dash me if i will there  paramore if you take that tone i have nothing more to say he crosses the room with offended dignity and posts himself with his back to the bookcase beside charteris  julia with a sob daddy  craven turning solicitously to her yes my love  julia looking up at him tearfully and kissing his hand dont mind them you didnt mean it daddy did you  craven no no my precious come dont cry  paramore to charteris looking at julia with delight how beautiful she is  charteris throwing up his hands oh lord help you paramore he leaves the bookcase and sits at the end of the couch farthest from the fire meanwhile sylvia arrives  sylvia contemplating julia crying again well you are a womanly one  craven dont worry your sister sylvia you know she cant bear it  sylvia i speak for her good dad all the world cant be expected to know that shes the family baby  julia you will get your ears boxed presently silly  craven now now now my dear children really now come julia put up your handkerchief before mrs tranfield sees you shes coming along with jo  julia rising that woman again  sylvia another row go it julia  craven hold your tongue sylvia he turns commandingly to julia now look here julia  charteris hallo a revolt of the fathers  craven silence charteris to julia unanswerably the test of a man or womans breeding is how they behave in a quarrel anybody can behave well when things are going smoothly now you said today at that iniquitous club that you were not a womanly woman very well i dont mind but if you are not going to behave like a lady when mrs tranfield comes into this room youve got to behave like a gentleman or fond as i am of you ill cut you dead exactly as i would if you were my son  paramore remonstrating colonel craven  craven cutting him short dont be a fool paramore  julia tearfully excusing herself im sure daddy  craven stop snivelling im not speaking as your daddy now im speaking as your commanding officer  sylvia good old victoria cross craven turns sharply on her and she darts away behind charteris and presently seats herself on the couch so that she and charteris are shoulder to shoulder facing opposite ways cuthbertson arrives with grace who remains near the door whilst her father joins the others  craven ah jo here you are now paramore tell em the news  paramore mrs tranfieldcuthbertsonallow me to introduce you to my future wife  cuthbertson coming forward to shake hands with paramore my heartiest congratulations paramore goes to shake hands with grace miss craven you will accept graces congratulations as well as mine i hope  craven she will jo in a tone of command now julia julia slowly rises  cuthbertson now grace he conducts her to julias right then posts himself on the hearthrug with his back to the fire watching them the colonel keeps guard on the other side  grace speaking in a low voice to julia alone so you have shewn him that you can do without him now i take back everything i said will you shake hands with me julia gives her hand painfully with her face averted they think this a happy ending juliathese menour lords and masters the two stand silent hand in hand  sylvia leaning back across the couch aside to charteris has she really chucked you he nods assent she looks at him dubiously and adds i expect you chucked her  cuthbertson and now paramore mind you dont stand any chaff from charteris about this hes in the same predicament himself hes engaged to grace  julia dropping graces hand and speaking with breathless anguish but not violently again  charteris rising hastily dont be alarmed its all off  sylvia rising indignantly what youve chucked grace too what a shame she goes to the other side of the room fuming  charteris following her and putting his hand soothingly on her shoulder she wont have me old chapthat is turning to the others unless mrs tranfield has changed her mind again  grace no we shall remain very good friends i hope but nothing would induce me to marry you she goes to chair above the fireplace and sits down with perfect composure  julia ah she sits down with a great sigh of relief  sylvia consoling charteris poor old leonard  charteris yes this is the doom of the philanderer i shall have to go on philandering now all my life no domesticity no fireside no little ones nothing at all in cuthbertsons line nobody will marry meunless you sylviaeh  sylvia not if i know it charteris  charteris to them all you see  craven coming between charteris and sylvia now you really shouldnt make a jest of these things upon my life and soul you shouldnt charteris  cuthbertson on the hearthrug the only use he can find for sacred things is to make a jest of them thats the new order thank heaven we belong to the old order dan  charteris cuthbertson dont be symbolic  cuthbertson outraged symbolic that is an accusation of ibsenism what do you mean  charteris symbolic of the old order dont persuade yourself that you represent the old order there never was any old order  craven there i flatly contradict you and stand up for jo id no more have behaved as you do when i was a young man than id have cheated at cards i belong to the old order  charteris youre getting old craven and you want to make a merit of it as usual  craven come now charteris youre not offended i hope with a conciliatory outburst well perhaps i shouldnt have said that about cheating at cards i withdraw it offering his hand  charteris taking cravens hand no offence my dear craven none in the world i didnt mean to shew any temper but aside after looking round to see whether the others are listening only just considerthe spectacle of a rivals happiness  craven aloud decisively charteris now youve got to behave like a man your dutys plain before you to cuthbertson am i right jo  cuthbertson firmly you are dan  craven to charteris go straight up and congratulate julia and do it like a gentleman smiling  charteris colonel i will not a muscle shall betray the conflict within  craven julia charteris has not congratulated you yet hes coming to do it julia rises and fixes a dangerous look on charteris  sylvia whispering quickly behind charteris as he is about to advance take care shes going to hit you i know her charteris stops and looks cautiously at julia measuring the situation they regard one another steadfastly for a moment grace softly rises and gets close to julia  charteris whispering over his shoulder to sylvia ill chance it he walks confidently up to julia julia he proffers his hand  julia exhausted allowing herself to take it you are right i am a worthless woman  charteris triumphant and gaily remonstrating oh why  julia because i am not brave enough to kill you  grace taking her in her arms as she sinks almost fainting away from him oh no never make a hero of a philanderer charteris amused and untouched shakes his head laughingly the rest look at julia with concern and even a little awe feeling for the first time the presence of a keen sorrow    curtain
