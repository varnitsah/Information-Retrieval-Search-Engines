that name the first robert browning a man of energy and ability held an important post in the bank of england his wife margaret tittle was a creole from the west indies and at the time of her marriage her property was still in the estates owned by her father near st kitts when their son the second robert was seven years of age his mother died and his father afterwards married again the second wifes ascendency over her husband was unfortunately exerted against the best interests of the son his desire to become an artist his wish for a university training were disregarded and he was sent instead to st kitts where he was given employment on his mothers sugar plantations the breach between robert and his father became absolute when the boy defied local prejudice by teaching a negro to read and when because of what his father considered a sentimental objection to slavery he finally refused to remain in the west indies the young man returned to england and at twentytwo started on an independent career as a clerk in the bank of england in 1811 he married sarah anne wiedemann they settled in camberwell london where robert the poet was born may 7 1812 and his sister sarianna in 1814  brownings father was a competent official in the bank and a successful business man but his tastes were æsthetic and literary and his leisure time was accordingly devoted to such pursuits as the collection of old books and manuscripts he also read widely in both classic and modern literatures the first book of the iliad he knew by heart and all the odes of horace and he was accustomed to soothe his child to sleep by humming to him snatches of anacreon to the tune of a cottage in the wood mr browning had also considerable skill in two realms of art for he drew vigorous portraits and caricatures and he had even according to his sons mature judgment extraordinary force and facility in versemaking in character he was serene lovable gentle tenderhearted to a fault so instinctively chivalrous was he that there was no service which the ugliest oldest crossest woman in the world might not have exacted of him he was a man of great physical vigor dying at the age of eightyfour without ever having been ill  brownings mother was the daughter of william wiedemann a german who had settled in dundee and married a scotch wife mrs browning impressed all who knew her by her sweetness and goodness carlyle spoke of her as the true type of a scottish gentlewoman her sons friend mr kenyon said that such as she had no need to go to heaven because they made it wherever they were and her son called her a divine woman she had deep religious instincts and concerned herself particularly with her sons moral and spiritual development the bond between them was always very strong and when she died in 1849 his wife wrote he has loved his mother as such passionate natures can love and i never saw a man so bowed down in an extremity of sorrownever  robert brownings childhood was passed in an unusually serene and happy home in development he tells how at five years of age he was made to understand the main facts of the trojan war by his fathers clever use of the cat the dogs the pony in the stable and the pageboy to impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict latin declensions were taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memoryeasing devices stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by colored maps and comic drawings until the boy was fourteen his schooling was of the most casual sort his only formal training being such as he received in the comparatively unimportant three or four years he spent after he was ten at mr readys private school his real education came through all his early life from his home what would now be called naturestudy he pursued ardently and on his own initiative in the home garden and neighboring fields his love for animals was inherited from his mother and fostered by her he used to keep says mrs orr in her account of his life owls and monkeys magpies and hedgehogs an eagle and even a couple of large snakes constantly bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring them to his mother for immediate care browning says that his faculty of observation at this time would not have disgraced a seminole indian in the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and guidance but was on the whole allowed unusual freedom of choice he afterwards told mrs orr that milton quarles voltaire mandeville and horace walpole were the authors in whom as a boy he particularly delighted his love for art was established and developed by visits to the dulwich picture gallery of which he afterwards wrote to miss barrett with love and gratitude because he had been allowed to go there before the age prescribed by the rules and had thus learned to know a wonderful rembrandt a watteau three triumphant murillos a giorgione music lesson and various poussins his marked early susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by mr sharp one afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself she was startled to hear a sound behind her glancing round she beheld a little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase and could just discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her the next moment the child had sprung into her arms sobbing passionately at he knew not what but as his paroxysm subsided whispering with shy urgency play play  in various ways the boy robert was noticeably precocious he could not remember a time he said when he did not rhyme and his sister records that as a very little boy he used to walk around the table spanning out on the smooth mahogany the scansion of verses he had composed some of these early lines he could recall and he could recall too the prodigious satisfaction with which he uttered them especially the sentence he put into the mouth of a man who had just committed murdernow my soul is satisfied at twelve he had a volume named incondita ready for publication to discerning eyes the little volume was a production of great promise dominated though it was by the influence of his fathers idol pope and of his own temporary ruling deity byron but a publisher was not found and in later years at brownings request the two extant manuscript copies of incondita were destroyed along with many others of his youthful poems that had been preserved by his father  brownings early tastes in the realm of poetry were on the whole romantic now here is the truth he wrote to miss barrett the first book i ever bought in my life was ossianand years before that the first composition i ever was guilty of was something in imitation of ossian whom i had not read but conceived through two or three scraps in other books but the decisive literary influence was yet to come when he was fourteen he happened to see on a bookstall a volume marked mr shelleys atheistical poem very scarce and he at once wished to know more of this mr shelley after a perplexing search his mother found the desired poems most of them in first editions at the olliers vere street london she took home also three volumes by another poet john keats who she was told was the subject of an elegy by shelley browning never forgot the may evening when he first read these new books to the accompaniment he said of two nightingales one in a copperbeech one in a laburnum each striving to outdo the other in melody a new imaginative world was opened to the boy in memorabilia he afterwards recorded the strong intellectual and emotional excitement the thrill and ecstasy of this poetical experience to shelley especially did he give immediate and fervid personal loyalty even to the extent of endeavoring to follow him in atheism and vegetarianism  when at fourteen the boy left mr readys school it was decided that his further education should be carried on at home under private tutors he studied music under able masters one in thoroughbass and one in execution he played and sang and he composed spirited settings for songs he read voraciously he took lessons in dancing riding boxing and fencing and is said to have shown himself exceptionally active and vigorous he kept up his interest in art and he practiced drawing from casts he found time also for various friendships for miss eliza and miss sarah flower two sisters nine and seven years his senior he had a deep affection both young ladies were gifted in music and this was one source of their attractions for the musicloving boy miss sarah flower wrote sacred hymns the best known of which is nearer my god to thee and her sister composed music which browning even in his mature years ranked as of especial significance other friends of this period were joseph arnold afterwards chief justice of bombay and a man of great ability alfred domett a striking and interesting personality described by browning in a poem beginning whats become of waring and referred to in the guardian angel and the three silverthorne boys his cousins the death of one of whom was the occasion of the poem may and death  in spite of friends a beautiful home and congenial work this period of home tutelage does not seem to have been altogether happy his sister in commenting on this period said the fact was poor boy he had outgrown his social surroundings they were absolutely good but they were narrow it could not be otherwise he chafed under them furthermore the youth before he had found his real work as a poet was restless irritable and opinionated and an everpresent cause of friction was the fact that there were few subjects of taste on which he and his father did not disagree their poetic tastes were especially at variance the father counted pope supreme in poetry and it was many years before he could take pleasure in the form in which his sons genius expressed itself all the more noteworthy then is the generosity with which mr browning looked after his sons interests through the unprofitable early years of his poetic career a generosity never lost sight of by the son mr sharp in his life of browning records some words uttered by mr browning a week or two before his death which show how permanent was his sense of indebtedness to his father it would have been quite unpardonable in my case he said not to have done my best my dear father put me in a condition most favorable for the best work i was capable of when i think of the many authors who have had to fight their way through all sorts of difficulties i have no reason to be proud of my achievements he secured for me all the care and comfort that a literary man needs to do good work it would have been shameful if i had not done my best to realize his expectations of me  after it was determined that robert should commence poet he and his father came to the conclusion that a university training had many elements foreign to the aim the youth had set before him and that a richer and more directly available preparation could be gained from sedulous cultivation of the powers of his mind at home and from seeing life in the best sense at home and abroad mrs orr tells us that the first qualifying step of the zealous young poet was to read and digest the whole of dr johnsons dictionary  brownings first published poem pauline appeared anonymously in january 1833 when he was twenty years old this poem is of especial autobiographical interest its enthusiastic praise of shelley recalls his early devotion to that poet and in many scattered passages we find references to his own personality or experiences the following lines show with what intensity he recreated the lives and scenes in the books he read     and i myself went with the talea god    wandering after beauty or a giant    standing vast in the sunsetan old hunter    talking with gods or a highcrested chief    sailing with troops of friends to tenedos    i tell you naught has ever been so clear    as the place the time the fashion of those lives    i had not seen a work of lofty art    nor womans beauty nor sweet natures face    yet i say never morn broke clear as those    on the dim clustered isles in the blue sea    the deep groves and white temples and wet caves    and nothing ever will surprise me now    who stood beside the naked swiftfooted    who bound my forehead with proserpines hair  there is true and powerful selfanalysis in the lines beginning     i am made up of an intensest life  and the invocation in lines 811854 reveals the passionately religious nature of the young poet in the early writings of robert browning1 mr gosse gives an account of the impression made by this poem upon men so diverse as the rev william johnson fox john stuart mill and dante gabriel rossetti to all of whom in spite of its crudities and very evident immaturity it seemed a production of exceptional promise  after an interval of two years browning published this time under his own name a second long poem the subject paracelsus had been suggested by the friend amédeé de ripertmonclar to whom the poem is dedicated in pursuance of his purposed rehabilitation of a vanished age browning made extensive researches in the british museum into the history of paracelsus the great leader in sixteenth century medical science but in the poem the facts are subordinated to a minute analysis of the spiritual history of paracelsus the poem was too abstruse in subject and style to bring browning popularity but his genius was recognized by important critics and though he was but twentythree he was admitted into the foremost literary circles of london one of his most distinguished new friends was mr macready the great actor it was at his house that browning first met mr forster who had already written favorable critiques of paracelsus one for the examiner and one for the new monthly magazine other literary associates of this period were leigh hunt barry cornwall sergeant talfourd dickens and walter savage landor there were not infrequent dinners and suppers to which the young poet was welcomed he is described as being at this period singularly handsome he looks and acts said mr macready more like a youthful poet than any man i ever saw he had sculpturesque masses of dark wavy hair a skin like delicate ivory deepset expressive eyes and a sensitive mouth he was slender graceful and most attractive in manner and he was something of a dandy in his attention to dress he is said to have made an especially good impression on one occasion when the circumstances must have been as trying as they were exhilarating in may 1836 a group of poets had assembled at mr talfourds to celebrate macreadys successful production of talfourds ion browning sat opposite macready who was between wordsworth and landor when talfourd proposed a toast the poets of england he spoke in complimentary terms of wordsworth and landor but called for a response from the youngest of the poets of england the author of paracelsus landor raised his cup to the young man and wordsworth shook hands with him across the table saying i am proud to know you mr browning  brownings third literary venture was a tragedy strafford dedicated to macready at whose request it was written the drama presents the impeachment condemnation and execution of the earl of strafford a statesman who according to the play loved the unworthy king charles the first and sacrificed everything even to life itself in his blind loyalty to a master who treacherously deserted him in the hour of need it was a topic to which browning had already given much thought for he had the preceding year completed from materials supplied by mr john forster a life of strafford begun by forster for lardners eminent british statesmen2 the question of the historic truthfulness of the drama is discussed by the historian gardiner in the introduction to miss emily h hickeys edition of strafford he shows that the play is in its details and even in the very roots of the situation untrue to fact and yet he maintains that in the chief characters there is essential truth of conception every time that i read the play says gardiner i feel more certain that browning has seized the real strafford  charles too with his faults perhaps exaggerated is nevertheless the real charles the play was produced at covent garden theater in may 1837 with macready as strafford and miss helen faucit as lady carlisle and was successful in spite of poor scenery and costuming and poor acting in some of the parts but owing to the financial condition of the theater and the consequent withdrawal of one of the important actors after the fifth night the play had but a brief run it was presented again in 1886 under the auspices of the browning society and its power as an acting play surprised and impressed the audience  before the composition of strafford browning had begun a long poem sordello which he completed after his first visit to italy in 1838 and published in 1840 no one of his poems is more difficult to read and many are the stories told of the dismay occasioned by its various perplexities the effect of this poem on brownings fame was disastrous in fact after sordello there began a period twenty years long of almost complete indifference in england to brownings work the enthusiasm over the promise of his early poems died quite away late in life mr browning commented on this period of his literary career as a time of prolonged desolateness yet the years 18411846 are the years in which he attained his poetic maturity and years in which he did some of his best work during this period he brought out the series somewhat fancifully called bells and pomegranates the phrase itself comes from exodus xxviii 33 34 as a title browning explained it to mean something like a mixture of music with discoursing sound with sense poetry with thought this cheap serial edition the separate numbers of which sold at first at sixpence and later at half a crown included pippa passes king victor and king charles dramatic lyrics the return of the druses a blot in the scutcheon colombes birthday dramatic romances and lyrics luria and a souls tragedy  all of brownings plays except strafford and in a balcony came out of this series the most beautiful of them all pippa passes appeared in 1841 it is hardly a drama at all in the conventional sense though it has one scene that between ottima and sebald of the highest dramatic power but it has always been a favorite with readers when it was published miss barrett wrote to mr browning that she found it in her heart to covet the authorship of this poem more than any other of his works and he said in answer that he too liked pippa better than anything else he had yet done mr sharp while emphasizing the undramatic quality of the play counts it the most imperishable because the most nearly immaculate of brownings dramatic poems it seems to me he adds like all simple and beautiful things profound enough for the sinking plummet of the most curious explorer of the depths of life it can be read reread learned by heart and the more it is known the wider and more alluring are the avenues of imaginative thought which it discloses it has more than any other long composition by its author that quality of symmetry that symmetria prisca recorded of leonardo da vinci in the latin epitaph of platino piatto and as might be expected its mental basis what rossetti called fundamental brain work is as luminous depth within depth as the morning air everyone who knows browning at all knows pippa passes  of the seven dramas published in bells and pomegranates there is comparatively little stage history to record in spite of occasional fairly successful productions it must be admitted that brownings plays have never achieved probably never will achieve popularity in the shape of long runs in many cities3 they are too subjective too analytic too psychological for quick or easy understanding but to the reader they offer many delights the stories are clear coherent interesting the characters strongly individualized the crises of experience stimulating the interaction of personalities subtly analyzed the poetry noble and beautiful  the two nondramatic numbers of bells and pomegranates were dramatic lyrics no 3 1842 and dramatic romances and lyrics no 7 1845 the first included such poems as cavalier tunes in a gondola porphyria and the pied piper of hamelin the second included how they brought the good news from ghent to aix the lost leader the tomb at st praxeds the flight of the duchess the boy and the angel and the first part of saul these poems together with the dramas make a remarkably rich body of poetry to be produced in the short space of five years and the character of the work its variety and beauty and strength and originality were such that its meager and grudging acceptance seems now inexplicable  the most important event in the life of browning during this period was his acquaintance with miss elizabeth barrett in 1844 she brought out a new volume of poems which he saw and greatly admired he wrote to her expressing delight in her work and asking permission to call but miss barrett owing to longcontinued invalidism had lived in almost entire seclusion and she was not at first willing to receive mr browning this was in january 1845 and many letters passed between them before the first interview in the following may mr brownings love for miss barrett found almost immediate expression and she was soon conscious of an equally strong love for him but for a considerable time she persistently refused to marry him to her mind the obstacles were almost insurmountable of these her illhealth was chief she could not consent she said to dim the prosperities of his career by a union with her future which she characterized as a precarious thing a thing for making burdens out ofbut not for his carrying in exchange for the noble extravagancies of his love she could bring him only anxiety and more sadness than he was born to this obstacle of illhealth was unexpectedly modified by a very mild winter and by the new physical vigor brought in the train of new happiness from this point of view the marriage though hazardous was practicable by the end of the summer of 1846 a second obstacle lay in the nature and opinions of miss barretts father who governed even his grownup children by an incredible system of patriarchal absolutism by what was variously termed an obliquity of the will an eccentricity a monomania he had decided that none of his children should marry and on this point he demanded passive obedience it was perfectly clear that miss barrett could not gain his consent to her marriage and so after long hesitation and much unhappiness she decided to marry mr browning without that consent in order to save her family and close friends from the blame sure to fall upon them for the remotest sanction of her marriage her plans were kept an absolute secret she met mr browning at marylebone church on september 12 1846 and they were married there mrs browning returning at once to her own home where she remained till a week later when she started for italy with her husband the wedding was then announced throughout her fathers life mrs browning endeavored to placate him for she devotedly loved him and she had been his favorite child but in vain he would never see her again he returned her letters unopened and he would not allow her to be spoken of in his presence  after resting a week in paris mr and mrs browning went on to pisa where they remained nearly seven months the miracle of the pisa life was mrs brownings gain in health you are not improved you are transformed was mrs jamesons exclamation it was at pisa that mr browning came to know of the sonnets his wife had written during the progress of their courtship and engagement in critical kitkats 1896 mr gosse tells the story as mr browning gave it to him one day early in 1847 their breakfast being over mrs browning went upstairs while her husband stood at the window watching the street till the table could be cleared he was presently aware of someone behind him although the servant had gone it was mrs browning who held him by the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her and at the same time pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat she told him to read that and to tear it up if he did not like it and then she fled again to her room mr browning felt at once that he had no right to keep such poetry as a private possession i dared not he said reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since shakespeares they were accordingly published in 1850 under the intentionally mystifying title sonnets from the portuguese  the brownings reached florence april 20 1847 after several changes they were in may 1848 established in the home in which they remained during mrs brownings life it was a suite of rooms on the second floor of the palazzo guidi of the practical side of this early florentine life mrs browning wrote my dear brothers have the illusion that nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year good heavens how preposterous it does seem to me we scarcely spend three hundred and i have every luxury i ever had and which it would be so easy to give up at need and robert wouldnt sleep i think if an unpaid bill dragged itself by any chance into another week he says that when people get into pecuniary difficulties his sympathies always go with the butchers and the bakers in accordance with this horror of owing five shillings five days the furnishings of the new home the rococo chairs spring sofas carved bookcases satin from cardinals beds and the rest were accumulated at a pace dictated by the bank account but for all that it was not long before the rooms began to take on an aspect as beautiful as it was homelike  by preference the brownings lived very quietly at the end of fifteen months mrs browning wrote robert has not been out an evening of the fifteen months but what with music and books and writing and talking we scarcely know how the days go its such a gallop on the grass march 9 1849 was born wiedemann later known as penini or pen browning coincident with this joy was the grief caused by the death of brownings mother a sorrow from which he rallied but slowly the florentine life was occasionally varied by summers at bagni di lucca winters in paris or rome and several visits to england there was also an increasing social life americans were especially welcome to the brownings because while england was still indifferent to brownings work america had given it an appreciative welcome in march 1861 mrs browning wrote i dont complain for myself of an unappreciative public i have no reason but just for that reason i complain more about robert in america he is a power a writer a poethe is read he lives in the hearts of the people4  among the americans associated with the brownings for longer or shorter periods during their life in florence were two distinguished women margaret fuller ossoli and harriet beecher stowe in 1847 george william curtis spent two days with the brownings at vallombrosa a visit later described in his easy chair mr field who had brought out the american reprint of the twovolume edition of brownings poems in 1849 was a guest at casa guidi in 1852 charles sumner writes of delicious tuscan evenings with the brownings and the storys in 1859 mr brownings interests in art led to friendships with american artists among whom were mr page who painted a successful portrait of browning miss harriet hosmer to whom mr and mrs browning finally consented to sit for the clasped hands and hiram powers the dearest american friends were however mr and mrs hawthorne and mr and mrs story  music and art were among brownings chief delights in florence george william curtis in describing the trip to vallombrosa says that it was part of their pleasure to sit in the dusky convent chapel while browning at the organ chased a fugue of master hughes of saxe gotha or dreamed out upon twilight keys a faint throbbing toccata of galuppis modeling in clay was even more satisfying as a personal resource in the autumn of 1860 mrs browning wrote robert has taken to modeling under mr story at his studio and is making extraordinary progress turning to account his studies in anatomy he has copied already two busts the young augustus and the psyche and is engaged on another enchanted with his new trade working six hours a day some months later she added the modeling combines bodywork and soulwork and the more tired he has been and the more his back ached poor fellow the more he has exulted and been happyno nothing ever made him so happy before he found also an unfailing pleasure in the study of great pictures and he was a buyer of pictures with a collectors delight in hunting out the work of the unappreciated early tuscan artists mrs orr says that he owned at least one picture by each of the obscure artists mentioned in old pictures in florence  mrs browning sometimes expressed regret that browning should give himself so unreservedly in so many directions because she felt that he had thus too little time and energy left for poetry her fear was not without justification for after the richly productive period from 1841 to 1846 we come upon a space of nine years the only publications of which are in 1850 christmas eve and easter day a long poem in two parts giving the arguments in favor of christianity and in 1852 an introduction to a collection of letters then supposed to be by shelley but since found to be spurious the essay is nevertheless of importance as an exposition of brownings theory of poetry and as an interesting study of shelley  in 1855 at the close of this period of nine years there appeared a collection of fiftyone poems entitled men and women in fundamental brain power insight beauty and mastery of style these poems show browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement it is in these remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he practically invented the dramatic monologue a form in which there is but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect the dramatic quality arises partly from the implied presence of listeners whose expressions of assent or dissent determine the progress or the abrupt changes of direction of the speakers words in andrea del sarto for example lucrezias smiles and frowns and gestures of impatience are a constant influence and the poem presents as vivid an interplay of personalities as any scene in a drama but the implied listener is hardly more than a secondary dramatic element the chief one being that the speaker talks as do the characters in a play out of the demands of the immediate experience gradually and casually disclosing all the tangled web of influence all the clashes of will with destiny of desire with convention that have led to the crisis depicted fra lippo lippi gives no consecutive history of his life only such snatches of it as partially account for his present mad freak but the strife between his own nature and instinct on the one hand and the conventions and traditions of religious art on the other could hardly be more vividly presented in a balcony the one drama in men and women has but a fragment of a plot but in intensity reality and passion it excels most of brownings dramas and in spite of its long speeches has proved effective on the stage5 in variety of theme subjectmatter and verseform the poems of men and women defy classification whatever page one turns there is something novel stimulating captivating all of brownings florentine interests are represented herehis love of old pictures and littleknown music his delight in florence venice rome in all italy her skies and her landscapes the vagrants of her streets her religious ceremonies her church dignitaries her scholars then there are lovepoems in all tones and tempers the noblest of them all one word more being brownings most direct and personal tribute to his wife and we see in its keenest form his intellectual delight in subtle disquisition the doctrine of immortality as it appeals to the mind of the cultured dissatisfied pagan cleon the miracle of lazarus as it is brooded over by the arab physician karshish the balancing of faith and doubt in the clever casuistry of bishop blougramthese are topics to brownings taste and are treated with skill and mastery taken all in all these poems give to the reader a full impression of brownings characteristic force the darting penetrating power of his phrase the rush and energy and leap of his thought it is by men and women the somewhat similar dramatis personæ and the earlier dramatic lyrics and dramatic romances that browning is most widely and most favorably known  during the first ten years that the brownings were in florence mrs brownings health was so good that she was able to enjoy social and outdoor pleasures to a degree that would have been thought impossible before her marriage she had also kept up her literary work a new edition of her poems appeared in 1849 in 1851 she published casa guidi windows poems illustrative of her ardent interest in all that pertained to the fight for italian freedom and in 1856 her longplanned verse novel aurora leigh was completed and published but soon after this her strength began insensibly to fail and during the last three years of her life she suffered much from repeated bronchial attacks however her death in june 1861 was entirely unexpected the florentines had loved her deeply and had appreciated her utterances in behalf of a free italy she was accordingly buried in florence with extraordinary demonstrations of respect and the house where she had lived was marked by the municipality with a commemorative tablet  brownings wish was to leave florence at once and to make the new life as unlike the old as possible he went to london and after some delay established himself in a house at warwick crescent where he lived till 1887 the first portion of his life in england was one of unbearable loneliness he took care of his son busied himself with a new edition of his wifes poems read and studied and wrote with feverish intensity and avoided people but with the spring of 1863 says mr gosse a great change came over brownings habits he had shunned all invitations into society but  it suddenly occurred to him that this mode of life was morbid and unworthy and thereupon he entered into the social literary musical and artistic life of london  the nine years following 1855 were again a period of small productivity dramatis personæ was a slender volume to represent so many years even though it contained such great poems as rabbi ben ezra a death in the desert and abt vogler but during this period a long poem the ring and the book had been maturing in 1860 while still at casa guidi browning had found at a bookstall the now famous square old yellow book containing the legal record of a famous roman murder case he read the account on the way home and before night had so mastered the details that as he paced up and down on the terrace in the darkness he saw the tragedy unfold before him in picture after picture it was not however till 1864 that he definitely set to work on the composition of the poem it was published in four volumes of three parts each in the winter and spring of 18689 the poem has a novel structure the story is retold ten times by different persons and with such variations of fact and opinions and style as are dictated by the knowledge and the character of the speaker the monologues of count guido who murdered his wife of pompilia the young wife of caponsacchi the soldier saint who endeavored to save her and of the old pope are by far the most interesting portions of the poem but the whole of it is remarkable and it justly takes rank as one of englands greatest poems with the appearance of this book brownings genius received adequate recognition in high places the athenæum called it the opus magnum of the generation not merely beyond all parallel the supremest poetic achievement of the time but the most precious and profound spiritual treasure that england has possessed since the days of shakespeare  the last ten or twelve years of brownings life were so crowded with interests occupations publications friends honors that not even a summary of them can be undertaken here mr sharp says of this period  everybody wished him to come and dine and he did his best to gratify everybody he saw everything read all the notable books kept himself acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines conducted a large correspondence read new french german and italian books of mark read and translated euripides and Æschylus knew all the gossip of the literary clubs the salons and the studios was a frequenter of afternoon tea parties and then over and above it he was browningthe most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since shakespeare  mr henry james in commenting on brownings rich and ample london period with its felicities and prosperities of every sort says that in contemplating the wonderful browning  the accomplished saturated sane sound man of the london world and the world of culture it was impossible not to believe that he had arrived somehow for his own deep purposes at the enjoyment of a double identity so dissociated were the poet and the member of society phillips brooks who met browning in england in 18656 was impressed by his fullness of life and said he was very like some of the best of thackerays london men in public and on ordinary social occasions browning is said to have been frank charming friendlymore agreeable mary anderson said than distinguished with intimate friends however the poet had quite another sort of charm to a single listener says mr gosse with whom he was on familiar terms the browning of his own study was to the browning of a dinner party as a tiger cat is to a domestic cat in such conversation his natural strength came out his talk assumed the volume and the tumult of a cascade his voice rose to a shout sank to a whisper ran up and down the gamut of conversational melody those whom he was expecting will never forget his welcome the loud trumpetnote from the other end of the passage the talk already in full flood at a distance of twenty feet then in his own study or drawingroom what he loved was to capture his visitor in a low armchairs sofalap of leather and from a most unfair vantage of height to tyrannize to walk around the victim in front behind on this side on that weaving magic circles now with gesticulating arms thrown high now groveling on the floor to find some reference in a folio talking all the while a redundant turmoil of thoughts fancies and reminiscences flowing from those generous lips  elsewhere mr gosse summed up his personal impressions of mr browning as follows  i am bound to tell you that i saw a different browning from the hero of all the handbooks and gospels which are now in vogue people are beginning to treat this vehement and honest poet as if he were a sort of marcus aurelius and john the baptist rolled into one i have just seen a book in which it is proposed that browning should supersede the bible in which it is asserted that a set of his volumes will teach religion better than all the theologies in the world well i did not know that holy monster what i saw was an unostentatious keen active man of the world one who never failed to give good practical advice in matters of business and conduct one who loved his friends and certainly hated his enemies a man alive in every eager passionate nerve of him a man who loved to discuss people and affairs and a bit of a gossip a bit of a partisan too and not without his humorous prejudices he was simple to a high degree simple in his scrupulous dress his loud happy voice his insatiable curiosity  brownings london life was varied by many summer journeyings to french seacoast towns to wales and to scotland but it was seventeen years after the death of his wife before he could bring himself to revisit italy even then he avoided florence he took his sister to northern italy and asolo and venice became the towns around which their affections centered two american friends mrs bloomfieldmoore and mrs arthur bronson6 contributed to the happiness of these italian sojourns in 1888 brownings son who had married an american girl bought the palazzo rezzonico in venice so that browning had an additional personal reason for his trip to venice in 1889 he was well and he took great pleasure in his sons admirably planned restoration of the old venetian palace he worked walked talked with nearly normal vigor but a bronchial attack proved more than his weakened heart could withstand and he died peacefully almost painlessly in his sons home on december 12 1889 on the day of his death his last book asolando was published so that his bravehearted epilogue was really his valediction to this and his heroic greeting to another world he could greet the unseen with a cheer because in thought and act he was     one who never turned his back but marched breast forward      never doubted clouds would break    never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph    held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better      sleep to wake  browning was buried in westminster abbey on the last day of the year the most pathetic element of the imposing ceremonies was the singing of mrs brownings poem he giveth his beloved sleep   the poetry of browning  before entering upon a discussion of brownings poetry it will be of interest to note briefly some of the more striking general characteristics of the english literature contemporary with his work from pauline to asolando is over half a century but as a central and especially significant portion of brownings career we may take the three decades from 1841 when he began the bells and pomegranates series to 1869 when the ring and the book appeared for these years include all of his dramas and most of the poetry on which his fame rests a survey of this period at once reveals the predominance of fiction within these years come nearly all the novels of charles dickens of william makepeace thackeray of charlotte brontë of wilkie collins of charles kingsley of mrs gaskell of anthony trollope of george macdonald of charles reade much of the work of bulwer lytton all the novels of george eliot except middlemarch and daniel deronda and the earliest of george merediths books this is a notable showing no previous period in english literature had presented anything like so wide a range in fiction or had brought forward so large a number of novels of the first rank these years were equally rich in essays including much of carlyles work all of macaulays except the early essay on milton the religious polemics of frederick dennison maurice and john henry newman nearly all of ruskins discussions of art and social history most of leigh hunts literary criticism and matthew arnolds important early critical essays this too is a notable showing but if we turn to the two realms in which browning excelled poetry and drama we find different conditions during the central period of his career there was aside from his own work not a single important drama published the theaters were prosperous but they brought out only old plays or new ones of inferior rank in poetry too if we set aside the great names of tennyson and browning the period was neither rich nor varied during brownings first great productive period 184146 the only other poems of note were tennysons two volumes in 1842 in the nine years from 1846 to men and women in 1855 the chief poems were tennysons the princess in memoriam and maud for though wordsworths prelude was one of the greatest publications of the midcentury it was written years before and can hardly be counted as belonging to this era there are during the decade many poems of secondary rank the most important of them being mrs brownings sonnets from the portuguese and aurora leigh but besides tennyson and browning the only poet of high rank is matthew arnold whose slender volumes voice the doubts and difficulties of the age as brownings poems voice its optimism in the fourteen years between men and women and the ring and the book poets of a new kind appear william morriss defense of guinevere the life and death of jason and the earthly paradise and swinburnes early poems are alien to the work of browning in form subjectmatter and ideals the fact is the more definitely we try to place browning in his literary environment the more distinctly do we perceive that he was sui generis among his contemporaries he combined in striking fashion the intensity of the poet and the strong social sense of the prose writer  it seems also wise to glance at the outset at a few of the main criticisms that have been made on brownings poetry for the result of his marked originality is that no poet of the time has been so greatly praised and blamed  a natural first topic is his really famous obscurity this obscurity is variously ascribed to a diction unduly learned or almost unintelligibly colloquial or grotesquely inventive to figures of speech drawn from sources too unfamiliar or elaborated to the point of confusion to sentences complicated by startling inversions by double parentheses by broken constructions or by a grammatical structure defying analysis it would be quite possible to illustrate each of these points from brownings works and it cannot be denied that his poetry is sometimes needlessly and inexcusably hard reading but in reality the difficulties in his poems come less from stylistic defects than from the subject matter what mr chesterton calls brownings love for the holes and corners of history leads him to the use of much unfamiliar detail a large part of the difficulty in reading sordello arises from the fact that all brownings accumulated knowledge of medieval italy is there poured forth in an allusive takenforgranted manner till even the practiced reader turns away perplexed and overwhelmed so too old pictures in florence pictor ignotus and fra lippo lippi assume on the part of the reader a minute familiarity with early florentine art occasionally the poems demand an exceptional technical knowledge of some sort as in abt vogler where only a trained musician can fully understand the terminology many even of the minor poems belong to realms of thought and experience so remote that only by distinct effort do we transport ourselves thither it would for instance be absurd to call two in the campagna difficult in form or phrasing yet it narrates an experience intelligible only to those who have loved deeply but have found in the very heart of that love a baffling sense of inevitable personal isolation sometimes the difficulty arises from the extreme subtlety of the thought evelyn hope the simplest of poems in expression presents novel and elusive ideas mr chesterton ingeniously ascribes brownings obscurity to intellectual humility to an assumption that his readers were in possession of a native endowment and an acquired intellectual wealth on a par with his own but the defense seems rather forced mrs browning gave one of the best brief analyses of mr brownings obscurity he had been attacked as being misty and she wrote to him you never are misty not even in sordellonever vague your graver cuts deep sharp lines alwaysand there is an extra distinctness in your images and thoughts from the midst of which crossing each other infinitely the general significance seems to escape but the classic defense of browning from this point of view may be found in swinburnes introduction to chapmans poems  the difficulty found by many in certain of mr brownings works arises from a quality the very reverse of that which produces obscurity properly socalled obscurity is the natural product of turbid forces and confused ideas of a feeble and clouded or of a vigorous but unfixed and chaotic intellect now if there is any great quality more perceptible than another in mr brownings intellect it is his decisive and incisive faculty of thought his sureness and intensity of perception his rapid and trenchant resolution of aim the very essence of mr brownings aim and method as exhibited in the ripest fruits of his intelligence is such as implies above all other things the possession of a quality the very opposite of obscuritya faculty of spiritual illumination rapid and intense and subtle as lightning which brings to bear upon its object by way of direct and vivid illustration every symbol and every detail on which its light is flashed in passing browning has himself a word to say on this topic he wrote to a friend  i can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main too hard for many i should have been pleased to communicate with but i never designedly tried to puzzle people as some of my critics have supposed on the other hand i never pretended to offer such literature as should be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle man so perhaps on the whole i get my deserts and something overnot a crowd but a few i value more  a second charge not infrequently brought against brownings verse is that it is harsh and at times even ugly this charge like that of obscurity cannot be wholly denied the harshness results from incorrect rhymes from irregular movement of the verse or from difficult combinations of vowels and consonants no reader of brownings poems can fail to have been impressed by his intellectual agility in matching odd rhymes in dash and originality his rhymes outrank even those in butlers hudibras and lowells fable for critics we find in pacchiarotto for instance many rhymes of the gayest most freakish most grotesque charactermonkey one key prelude hellhued stubborn cubborn was hard hazard all occur in a single stanza an example of exceptional facility in rhyming is found in through the metidja where without repetition of words and without forcing of the sense thirtysix words rhyme with ride it cannot be denied that this remarkable facility led browning occasionally into the use of odd rhymes in poems where no light or comic effect was intended but a detailed study of his rhymes7 shows that the proportion of incorrect rhymes is really small that the grotesque rhymes are more striking than numerous and that they are usually in places where they are dramatically appropriate his use of harsh words and soundblendings is also often to be justified on the ground of their appropriateness to the idea compare for instance the flowing easy words the musical linking of sounds in the first stanza of love among the ruins with the harsh words harshly combined in the twelfth and thirteenth stanzas of childe roland both effects are artistic because each sort of combination is in response to the nature of the thought it is true that sometimes perhaps not infrequently the verse is rugged or uncouth where the sense does not call for such form and there are lines that not only remind us of de quinceys dictum that certain words should be boiled before they are eaten but which have no metrical flow at all they defy any sort of scansion and read like rough prose but a poet has a right of appeal to the sum of his manifest excellencies rather than to his defects and if we take brownings best work we find a harmony of movement superior in musical effect to a more technically regular meter in many poems the meter is indissolubly fused with the pictures the ideas the events take for instance the pied piper of hamelin where the hurryskurry of the verse is in complete harmony with the quaint rapid tale the hoofbeats of galloping horses is heard all through how they brought the good news from ghent to aix the slow march the stately chant are rhythmically present throughout a grammarians funeral in the flight of the duchess the change from the rough servitors narrative to the incantation of the gypsyqueen is as exquisitely marked in the metrical movement and in the rhymes as it is in the diction and tone of thought many other examples might be cited mr brinton who has made a detailed and competent study of brownings verse gives his final opinion in these words in the volumes of browning i maintain that we find so many instances of profound insight into verbal harmonies such singular strength of poetic grouping and such a marvelous grasp of the rhythmic properties of the english language that we must assign to him a rank second to no english poet of this century8  a third charge brought against brownings art is that he makes all his characters talk browningese that is that he endows all of them with the power to use such words and sentences and thought processes as are natural to him and to him only mr stedman in emphasizing this characteristic of the poet says of pippa passes the usual fault is presentthe characters whether students peasants or soldiers all talk like sages pippa reasons like a paracelsus in pantalettes it is of course obvious at the first glance that there is a lack of verisimilitude in pippas rich and beautiful soliloquies certainly no fourteenyearold mill girl could so describe a sunrise or play so brilliantly with a sunbeam in a waterbasin or outline so cleverly the stories of the happiest four in asolo the same is true of phenes long speech to jules no untutored girl brought up in degradation could present such thoughts in such words when we analyze brownings way of presenting a character however we find that the lack of verisimilitude is usually external and has to do chiefly with expression browning works on the fundamental assumption that he has a poetic right to make all sorts of people articulate he lends his mind out in the service of their thoughts and feelings he makes people reveal themselves by putting into words their elusive dim tangled and even unrecognized motives and hopes and joys and despairs he sums up in the speeches all the potentialities of the situation all the significance latent in the type of character and environment is somehow heightened and symbolized all this is put in his own highly individual diction yet it can hardly be said that he violates poetic realism in the deeper sense for he never puts a halo around a situation never goes counter to its potentialities instead he strikes fire from it he shows what is actually in the situation but at white heat and laid bare to its center when this method has once been recognized discomfort on the score of lack of verisimilitude practically disappears and the reader yields himself to the joy of the rich subtle and stimulating analysis  we may now turn to a consideration of the subjectmatter and the main ideas of brownings poetry from whatever point of view we regard his work we find that ultimately the emphasis rests on the same great central fact the supremacy of his interest in human nature this dominating interest is shown for instance by a study of his treatment of physical nature to be sure no one can read his poems without recognizing the truth that his use of natural facts is distinctive in kind and very stimulating a mere reference to the pictures of the sky in pippa passes the vivid descriptions of fruits and flowers in an englishman in italy the remarkable studies of small animal life in saul and caliban upon setebos of birds in homethoughts from abroad of insects in the first part of paracelsus and in many later poems suffices to show that in mature life he did not lose the keenness of observation and interest characteristic of his youth yet it is also evident that his use of nature by way of direct description or even as illustrative material is far less in amount than that of other notable nineteenth century poets he cares much less for the rivers line the mountains round it and the sky above than for the figures of man woman and child these are frame to where nature is drawn upon it is almost invariably in complete subordination to some human interest and its literary form is almost always that of casual mention background or similitude and the first of these is the most frequent furthermore nearly all these passages are a mere statement of observed fact without comment or interpretation there is one great passage in paracelsus where the joy of god in the act of creation is depicted there are occasional references to the delight of man in the external world and now and then as in by the fireside man and nature are intimately fused but such conceptions rarely occur in brownings poetry the boundary lines between man and nature are clearly marked in paracelsus he definitely protests against mans way of reading his own moods into nature and of attributing to her his own qualities and emotions he also always accounts man if he has truly entered into his spiritual heritage as consciously superior to nature the troubadour eglamour in sordello says that man shrinks to naught if matched with a quiet sea or sky but browning calls that eglamours false thought to browning nature was to be studied enjoyed and used but it was not as to keats a realm of enchantment or as to wordsworth the realm where alone the divine and the human could pass the boundaries of sense and meet or as to matthew arnold a refuge from pain and disillusionment browning regards the world about him more in the sane unsentimental straightforward intelligible way of chaucer or of shakespeare the mystical elements in wordsworths feeling for nature were foreign to brownings mind an instructive comparison might be made between wordsworths ode on intimations of immortality and brownings prologue to asolando the poems have the same starting point each one attributes sadness to the poets old age and each gives as a cause of the sadness the inevitable fading of the glory with which all nature was invested to the eye of his youth but here the resemblance ends wordsworth believes that the youthful vision was a divine revelation to be regained when the round of existence should be completed by a return to his immortal home and on the memory of that vision he founded his faith in a future life but browning welcomed the loss of the vision objects had been to him palpably fireclothed but with the loss of flame there was a gain in reality the vision had enthralled and subjugated him but with the sight of a naked world he had become conscious of things as they are and he rejoiced in a justness of perception that declared what were to him the two great facts of life the power and beauty of god and the glory of the human soul on these not on nature he put his stress  brownings paramount interest in human nature is further illustrated by his poems on the various arts of music painting and sculpture he has written with the intimate and minute knowledge of a specialist in each art he is familiar with implements and materials with the tricks of the trade the talk of the studios but after all the art as an art is of much less interest to him than is the worker the process and even the completed product are in brownings view important only in so far as they reveal or affect the artist the musician the sculptor or some phase of life in such poems as abt vogler fra lippo lippi andrea del sarto we are conscious not so much of music and pictures as of the secret springs of failure the divine despairs and discontents the aspirations the creative ecstasies of the men who wrought in these realms andrea del sartos art is not the real theme of the poem bearing his name it is rather his character of which his art is an expression the central fact of the poem is the recognition that a soul morally impoverished cannot even with wellnigh perfect technique produce great work while even with faulty technique a setting of the soul to grand issues will secure transcendent meanings so too with abt vogler his music is not of the greatest but our concern is with the musician who through the completeness of his spiritual absorption in music is conducted into a realm of experience beyond that of speech or even of articulate thought  another distinctly human aspect of art interests browning and that is its power to represent and so to recall a vanished civilization greek statues the devotional pictures of the early florentines the work of the later italian realists stand in old pictures in florence as representatives of the life and thought that produced them in a toccata of galuppis the music revivifies the superficial gaiety the undertone of fear in the life of eighteenth century venice highly significant in this connection are the poems in which he traces the evolution of art running through old pictures in florence and fra lippo lippi we find an ordered statement of the chief changes in the ideals of art as browning saw them the greeks we are told had produced in sculpture the most beautiful representations of the human body but if their successors had been content merely to admire this perfect achievement they would have purchased satisfaction at the price of their own arrested development progress came only when in the dawn of italian art men turned from greek perfection from the supremely beautiful but limited representations of the human body to an attempt to paint the invisible the spiritual side of mans nature the work of these artists was great because it was not imitative and because it stretched toward an unending and ideal future but the idealistic and aspiring temper of early tuscan art had the defects of its qualities its spiritual ecstasy once conventionalized and reduced to a formula led to unreality and if not to untruth at least to an unwholesome ignoring of a part of truth there was therefore an inevitable reaction to the naturalism described with such verve and gusto by fra lippo lippi but this is after all social history in terms of art and to browning what has happened in painting is of value chiefly as showing concretely what has happened in the mind of man  from the instances already cited it is apparent that brownings interest centered not in abstract or theoretical discussions of human problems but in the individuals who face the problems in this point browning is sharply distinguished from his poetic contemporaries as a class they felt deeply all the weary weight of this unintelligible world so deeply that while they gave much thought to ideals of social amelioration few of them presented individuals with any dramatic distinctness browning stands practically by himself in the nineteenth century as the poet who gives us both the doubter and the doubt who is able to join with an impressive statement of the hopes and fears of man an equally impressive sequence of individual men and women in this he harks back to the broad inclusiveness of the elizabethan dramatists in contemporary literature his nearest congeners are in fiction not in poetry  the great number and variety of brownings characters can be illustrated in different ways we might for instance note how many nationalities are represented the personages in stafford and the cavalier tunes are englishmen from the time of the civil war clive is a true story of the indian empire we have from italian life the numerous characters in sordello fra lippo lippi pictor ignotus the bishop orders his tomb at st praxeds church my last duchess the ring and the book a grammarians funeral up at a villadown in the city in a gondola and many more count gismond and hervé riel are french stories paracelsus and abt vogler are of german origin balaustions adventure aristophanes apology pheidippides and echetlos celebrate greek thought and adventure very important poems such as saul and rabbi ben ezra have to do with jewish life and unlike shakespeare who is not concerned with making julius cæsar a roman or duke theseus a greek browning brings to the creation of each of these widely divergent characters a detailed knowledge of the special habits of life and thought of the nation or race concerned he represents also many kinds of human interest we find in his poems seekers after knowledge such as paracelsus who takes all thought and fact as his domain or such as the grammarian who found greek particles too wide a realm or such as the pedant sibrandus schafnaburgensis whose learned rubbish cumbers the land there are likewise those who grope after the truths of religion from caliban on his island to the learned physician karshish and the highly cultured cleon those who have the full vision from john to rabbi ben ezra those who juggle with terms and creeds as does bishop blougram and out and out frauds like sludge the medium the church is represented by many men dissimilar in endowments tastes spiritual experiences and aims there are italian prelates of every sort from the worldlyminded bishop of st praxeds occupied in death with vain thoughts of lapislazuli and pure latin to the soldiersaint caponsacchi who saved pompilia and the wise old pope who pronounced guidos doom from the unworthy priest in the spanish cloister to the very human kindly pope in the bean feast and from all these it is far down the ages to the evangelical parish priest of the inn album that purblind honest drudge who the deeper to impress his flock painted heaven dimly but made hell distinct there are many artists many musicians there are poets from aprile in paracelsus and the troubadours eglamour and sordello to keats and shelley the extremes of social life are given there are the streetgirls in pippa passes and there are kings and queens with royal retinues there are statesmen and warriors and seekers after romantic adventure there are haughty aristocrats of cold and cruel natures and there are obscure but highhearted doers of heroic deeds brownings dictum study man man whatever the issue led him into a world wider than that known by any other poet of his time and akin as has been pointed out to that of the great writers of fiction as an observer of human life he was not unlike his poor poet of valladolid who with his scrutinizing hat went about the streets absorbed in watching all kinds of people all sorts of occupations scenting the world looking it full in the face he chose to set forth the wants and ways of actual life he summed up his work in the epilogue to pacchiarotto     mans thoughts and loves and hates    earth is my vineyard these grew there    from grape of the ground i made or marred    my vintage  it is further apparent that brownings characters are never merely types but must always be reckoned with as individuals it was his belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart hence even where there are external similarities the essential elements are strongly differentiated take for instance three poems in which the situations are not unlike in my last duchess the flight of the duchess and the ring and the book we have a portrayal of three men of high lineage but cold egotistic cruel who have married very young and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute power but there the likeness ends we cannot for a moment class together the polished aesthetic wellbred aristocrat of the first poem the absurd little popinjay of the second and the tigercat of the third less strongly but as clearly are the wives differentiated to the innocent gaiety of heart the bright sweet friendliness of the hapless lady in my last duchess must be added for the lady in the flight of the duchess a native force of character which when roused by the call of the gypsyqueen enables her to break the yoke imposed on her by the duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure freedom and love the delicate flowerlike pompilia in the ring and the book has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom her passive endurance changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her love for her child or take pippa and phene in pippa passes two beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings but both innately pure in character and experience they are however as unlike as two girls could be phene undeveloped in mind and heart the easily duped agent of a cruel trick appeals to us by her slow incredulous but eager response to goodness and aspiration the tremulous opening of her soul to love but pippa with her observant love of nature her gay sportive winsome fancies her imaginative sympathy with the lives of others her knowledge of good and evil her poise her bright steadiness of soul carries us into a different and much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling so we might go through the great assemblage of brownings characters to find that each one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities possibilities and problems  in all this portrayal of individuals the emphasis is on things of the mind and heart in these realms browning found nothing alien or uninteresting from point to point his poetry illustrates what he said in his comment on sordello my stress lay on the incidents in the development of a human soul little else is worth study in all his poetry environment is of importance only in so far as it is the stuff on which the soul works it is the subtle thing called spirit it is the souls world to which he devotes himself  it is only from a study of brownings many characters that we may arrive at a statement of some of the distinguishing features of his philosophy of life and any such statements must be made with extreme caution because of his dramatic method he utters this caution himself when he says of his poems their contents are always dramatic in principle and so many utterances of so many imaginary people yet it is possible by taking the general trend and scope of his work to make justifiable deductions concerning the dominant ideas in the rich field of his poetry and drama  in brownings philosophy of life words of especial significance are growth and progress domizia in luria says     how inexhaustibly the spirit grows    one object she seemed erewhile born to reach    with her whole energies and die content    so like a wall at the worlds edge is stood    with naught beyond to live foris that reached    already are new undreamed energies    outgrowing under and extending farther    to a new object  so too john in a death in the desert sums up his belief in the line     i say that man was made to grow not stop  growth here and growth hereafter are the essential elements of brownings creed and there is no other poet in whom all kinds of thinking and doing are so uniformly tested by their outcome in the growth of the soul does joy stimulate to fuller life does suffering bring out moral qualities do obstacles develop energy do sharp temptations become a source of strength and assured soldiership does knowledge of evil lead to a new exaltation of good does sin lead to selfknowledge and so to regeneration then all these are ministers of grace for through them the soul has reached greater heights and fuller life whatever bids the soul nor stand nor sit but go is to be welcomed the cost of this growth may be great but the advances of spirit are represented as worth any sacrifice the lady in the flight of the duchess goes from splendor and ease to hardship and obscurity but she wins freedom of thought and of act and the opportunity to test the qualities of her soul in pippa passes sebald might have had love and wealth jules might have attained fame along the conventional path marked out for him by the monsignor luigi had the prospect of an easy life and happy love the monsignor might have had enhanced honor from the church into whose coffers he could have turned great revenues but instead each responds in turn to pippas songs sebald gains a true view of sin jules gets a new conception of service and attainment luigis wavering purpose of selfsacrifice for his countrys good is strengthened the monsignor is held back from connivance at a crime in all these cases the external loss is as nothing compared to the gain in spiritual knowledge and energy  contact with magnetic and superior personalities is a way of growth particularly noted by browning there are men he says who bring new feeling fresh from god and whose life reteaches us what life should be what faith is loyalty and simpleness pompilia says of caponsacchi     through such souls alone    god stooping shows sufficient of his light    for us i the dark to rise by  the highest souls are seers in the noblest sense and they impart the gift of seeing to the rest but the helpful personality need not be great in knowledge or rank in pippa browning emphasizes the power of unconscious goodness in clarifying the spiritual vision of others and in thus stimulating to right action and in david he shows the power of poetic charm innocence and eager love to drive away from another heart a mood of black despair  but outside influences are after all says browning of secondary importance they can at best do no more than stimulate and guide when andrea del sarto attributes his general lowering of ideals and power to the influence of lucrezia he evades the real issue incentives must come from the souls self growth is dependent on personal struggle man is by his very nature               forced to try and make else fail to grow    formed to rise reach at if not grasp and gain    the good beyond himwhich attempt is growth  so also is it better that youth       should strive through acts uncouth    toward making than repose on aught found made  it is in the independence and originality of such striving that the soul discovers and frees its innate potentialities  an inevitable corollary of this idea of progress is the emphasis put upon aspiration as a habit of the mind the pursuit of an ideal a divine discontent with present accomplishment are enjoined upon man the gleams of heaven on earth are not meant to be permanent or satisfying but only to sting man into hunger for full light when a human being has achieved to the full extent of his perceptions or aspirations he has thinks browning met with the greatest possible disaster that of arrested development mans powers should ever climb new heights for his souls health he should always see a flying point of bliss remote a happiness in store afar a sphere of distant glory a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for according to this ideal mans conception of good is ever changing and ever widening and hence never in this life to be fully attained yet the condition of growth is that he have an unmeasured thirst for good and that he pursue it with unquenchable ardor  the importance of love as one of the most effective agencies in spiritual growth is stated and restated in brownings poetry and by exceedingly diverse characters the queen in in a balcony turns away from her lonely splendor to exclaim     there is no good of life but lovebut love    what else looks good is some shade flung from love    love gilds it gives it worth  the duchess learns from the gypsy     how love is the only good in the world  the famous singer in dis aliter visum knows that art verse music count as naught beside love found gained and kept browning seems to regard almost any genuine love as a means of opening out the nature to fuller selfknowledge to wider sympathies and to increased power of action hence he condemns all cautious calculation of obstacles all dwelling upon conventional difficulties in the path of those who have clearly seen the loveway hence even love unrequited is counted of inestimable value in colombes birthday valence says     is the knowledge of her naught the memory naught    lady should such an one have looked on you    neer wrong yourself so far as quote the world    and say love can go unrequited here    you will have blessed him to his whole lifes end    low passions hindered baser cares kept back    all goodness cherished where you dweltand dwell  but the love of man and woman is not the only sort a part of the value of this individual relationship is that it may be regarded as a revelation and symbol of the spirit of allembracing sympathy whereby mankind should be ruled when paracelsus analyzes his life he ascribes his failure to the fact that he has sought knowledge to the exclusion of all else he finally came to see that knowledge however profound is of itself barren of satisfaction he had meant to serve men by revealing truth to them but he found that real service is based on the understanding given by love in self condemnation he says     in my own heart love had not been made wise    to trace loves faint beginnings in mankind    to know even hate is but a mask of loves    to see a good in evil and a hope    in illsuccess to sympathize be proud    of their halfreasons faint aspirings dim    struggles for truth their poorest fallacies    their prejudice and fears and cares and doubts    all with a touch of nobleness despite    their error upward tending all though weak  brownings conception of the function and power of love is based on his belief in its divine origin twice at least in easter day and saul his characters work out from an overpowering recognition of gods omniscience and omnipotence to a final recognition that his love is equal in scope with his power and knowledge and he counts human service as most complete when as in david before saul it reaches out to gods love and recruits its failing forces from the divine source  underlying brownings doctrine of the value of love and his doctrine of progress and aspiration is his belief in personal immortality when he was charged with being strongly against darwin with rejecting the truths of science and regretting its advance he answered that the idea of a progressive development from senseless matter until mans appearance had been a familiar conception to him from the beginning but he reiterated his constant faith in creative intelligence acting on matter but not resulting from it soul he said is not matter nor from matter but above two assumptions which though not susceptible of proof he regards as inescapable are the existence of creative intelligence and of the subtle thing called spirit when he argues out the question of the immortality of this spirit as in la saisiaz he admits the subjective character of the evidence but when he speaks spontaneously out of his own feeling or experience it is with positive belief in life after death to mr sharp he said death death it is this harping on death that i do despise so much why amico mio you know as well as i that death is life just as our daily our momentarily dying body is none the less alive and ever recruiting new forces of existence without death which is our crapelike churchyardy word for change for growth there could be no prolongation of what we call life pshaw it is foolish to argue upon such a thing even for myself i deny death as an end of everything never say of me that i am dead when his wife died he wrote in her testament these words from dante thus i believe thus i affirm thus i am certain it is that from this life i shall pass to another better there where that lady lives of whom my soul was enamored this faith in life after death explains much of brownings philosophy the source of the pagan cleons profound discouragement was the fact that man should be dowered with joyhunger should be given the ability to perceive and comprehend splendor and breadth of experience but should through the straitness of human limitations be held back from satisfaction and achievement and should be left to die thus dazzled thus baffled the secret of brownings optimism on the other hand is his belief that in heaven the soul is freed from limitations and blossoms out into capabilities of joy and of activity beyond anything suggested by the most golden dreams of earth to him all life is a unit beginning here and destined to unimaginable development hereafter earth is regarded as a place of tutelage where man may learn to set foot on some one path to heaven and no work begun here shall ever pause for death even apparent failure here counts for little so the quest be not abandoned each of us may as abt vogler look without despair on the broken arcs of earth if his faith reveals the perfect round in heaven  from any prolonged study of brownings poetry we become conscious of certain dominant qualities of style that may be thought of quite apart from his themes or message that his style has the defect of its qualities has already been pointed out here we may appropriately indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power his diction rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial is responsive to all demands his power of phrasing runs the whole gamut from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality his figures of speech drawn from all realms are penetrating in quality of startling aptness equally characteristic is his versification varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness and grace to lines as strident broken and harsh as the thought they dramatically reflect in narration whether in the brilliant rapidity and ease of a short poem like hervé riel or in the sustained flow of a long story like that of pompilia we find unusual skill in disquisition in the presentation of complicated and elusive intellectual processes there is a quite unmatched agility and dexterity probably no two forms of poetry contain more of brownings most noteworthy work than the lyric especially the reflective love lyric and that form which is distinctively his own the dramatic monologue in his best poems in this last form he has no competitor it is in the presentation of character through the medium of dramatic monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his analysis his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery the ease with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding place and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn  finally whether we consider brownings style or subject matter or philosophy of life we become growingly conscious of his force the clear virgilian line of tennyson is the outcome of a nature instinctively aristocratic and aloof browning is out in the thick of the fight and almost vociferously demands a hearing whatever makes his thought clear vivid active forcible seems to him however prosaic it may appear at first glance proper poetic material the immediate effect of his verse is the rousing of the mind to great issues his tremendous sincerity results in a dispelling of mists a stripping off of husks his demand for the truth is a trumpet note of challenge to our doubt or fear or indifference his penetrating study of human problems leads to an inevitable widening of the horizon of comprehension and sympathy on the part of his readers and his courage and optimism constitute an inspiration and stimulus of an uncommonly virile sort  it has been said that browning is not a poet but a literature and in work so vast and varied that it can be thus characterized there must be wide extremes of value it is almost certain that portions of his work cannot live they are too difficult too unliterary but in the portions where great thought finds adequate form the product is a priceless gift and one not equaled by any other poet of his age

the playful billows game    so each good ship was rude to see    rude and bare to the outward view      but each upbore a stately tent    where cedar pales in scented row                                   30    kept out the flakes of the dancing brine    and an awning drooped the mast below    in fold on fold of the purple fine    that neither noontide nor starshine    nor moonlight cold which maketh mad                               35      might pierce the regal tenement    when the sun dawned oh gay and glad    we set the sail and plied the oar    but when the nightwind blew like breath    for joy of one days voyage more                                  40    we sang together on the wide sea    like men at peace on a peaceful shore    each sail was loosed to the wind so free    each helm made sure by the twilight star    and in a sleep as calm as death                                   45    we the voyagers from afar      lay stretched along each weary crew    in a circle round its wondrous tent    whence gleamed soft light and curled rich scent      and with light and perfume music too                           50    so the stars wheeled round and the darkness passed      and at morn we started beside the mast    and still each ship was sailing fast     now one morn land appeareda speck    dim trembling betwixt sea and sky                                 55    avoid it cried our pilot check    the shout restrain the eager eye    but the heaving sea was black behind    for many a night and many a day    and land though but a rock drew nigh                            60    so we broke the cedar pales away    let the purple awning flap in the wind      and a statue bright was on every deck    we shouted every man of us    and steered right into the harbor thus                            65    with pomp and pæan glorious     a hundred shapes of lucid stone      all day we built its shrine for each    a shrine of rock for everyone    nor paused till in the

neither drunken nor eaten have we nor until from his tent    thou return with the joyful assurance the king liveth yet          5    shall our lip with the honey be bright with the water be wet    for out of the black midtents silence a space of three days    not a sound hath escaped to thy servants of prayer nor of praise    to betoken that saul and the spirit have ended their strife    and that faint in his triumph the monarch sinks back upon        10         life   ii     yet now my heart leaps o beloved gods child with his dew    on thy gracious gold hair and those lilies still living and blue    just broken to twine round thy harpstrings as if no wild heat    were now raging to torture the desert   iii                                          then i as was meet    knelt down to the god of my fathers and rose on my feet          15    and ran oer the sand burnt to powder the tent was unlooped    i pulled up the spear that obstructed and under i stooped    hands and knees on the slippery grasspatch all withered and gone    that extends to the second enclosure i groped my way on    till i felt where the foldskirts fly open then once more i        20         prayed    and opened the foldskirts and entered and was not afraid    but spoke here is david thy servant and no voice replied    at the first i saw naught but the blackness but soon i descried    a something more black than the blacknessthe vast the upright    main prop which sustains the pavilion and slow into sight         25    grew a figure against it gigantic and blackest of all    then a sunbeam that burst through the tentroof showed saul   iv     he stood as erect as that tentprop both arms stretched out wide    on the great crosssupport in the center that goes to each side    he relaxed not a muscle but hung there as caught in his          30         pangs    and waiting his change the kingserpent all heavily hangs    far away from his kind in the pine till deliverance come    with the springtimeso agonized saul drear and stark blind and         dumb   v     then i tuned my harptook off the lilies we twine round its chords    lest they snap neath the stress of the noontidethose            35         sunbeams like swords    and i first played the tune all our sheep know as one after one    so docile they come to the pendoor till folding be done    they are white and untorn by the bushes for lo they have fed    where the long grasses stifle the water within the streams bed    and now one after one seeks its lodging as star follows star      40    into eve and the blue far above usso blue and so far   vi     then the tune for which quails on the cornland will each leave his         mate    to fly after the player then what makes the crickets elate    till for boldness they fight one another and then what has weight    to set the quick jerboa amusing outside his sand house          45    there are none such as he for a wonder half bird and half mouse    god made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear    to give sign we and they are his children one family here   vii     then i played the helptune of our reapers their winesong when         hand    grasps at hand eye lights eye in good friendship and great       50         hearts expand    and grow one in the sense of this worlds lifeand then the last         song    when the dead man is praised

          60    but i stopped here for here in the darkness saul groaned   viii     and i paused held my breath in such silence and listened apart    and the tent shook for mighty saul shuddered and

moved not still hung there erect    and i bent once again to my playing pursued it unchecked    as i sang   ix     oh our manhoods prime vigor no spirit feels waste    not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced         70    oh the wild joys of living the leaping from rock up to rock    the strong rending of boughs from the firtree the cool silver shock    of the plunge in a pools living water the hunt of the bear    and the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair    and the meal the rich dates yellowed over with gold dust          75         divine    and the locustflesh steeped in the pitcher the full draft of wine    and the sleep in the dried riverchannel where bulrushes tell    that the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well    how good is mans life the mere living how fit to employ    all the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy          80    hast thou loved the white locks of thy father whose sword thou didst         guard    when he trusted thee forth with the armies for glorious reward    didst thou see the thin hands of thy mother held up as men sung    the low song of the nearlydeparted and hear her faint tongue    joining in while it could to the witness let one more            85         attest    i have lived seen gods hand through a lifetime and all was for         best    then they sung through their tears in strong triumph not much but         the rest    and thy brothers the help and the contest the working whence grew    such result as from seething grapebundles the spirit strained

rapture of service strains through its array    and upsoareth the cherubimchariotsaul cried i and stopped    and waited the thing that should follow then saul who hung propped    by the tents crosssupport in the center was struck by his name    have ye seen when springs arrowy summons goes right to the       105         aim    and some mountain the last to withstand her that held he alone    while the vale laughed in freedom and flowers on a broad bust of         stone    a years snow bound about for a breastplateleaves grasp of the         sheet    fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to his feet    and there fronts you stark black but alive yet your           110         mountain of old    with his rents the successive bequeathings of ages untold    yea each harm

was stilled    at the kings self left standing before me released and aware    what was gone what remained all to traverse twixt hope and         despair    death was past life not come so he waited awhile his           120         right hand    held the brow held the eyes left too vacant forthwith to remand    to their place what new objects should enter twas saul as before    i looked up and dared gaze at those eyes nor was hurt any more    than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn ye watch from the shore    at their sad level gaze oer the oceana suns slow decline      125    over hills which resolved in stern silence oerlap and entwine    base with base to knit strength more intensely so arm folded arm    oer the chest whose slow heavings subsided   xi                                 what spell or what charm    for awhile there was trouble within me what next should i urge    to sustain him where song had restored himsong filled to       130         the verge    his cup with the wine of this life pressing all that it yields    of mere fruitage the strength and the beauty beyond on what         fields    glean a vintage more potent and perfect to brighten the eye    and bring blood to the lip and commend them the cup they put by    he saith it is good still he drinks not he lets me           135         praise life    gives assent yet would die for his own part   xii                                  then fancies grew rife    which had come long ago on the pasture when round me the sheep    fed in silenceabove the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep    and i lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie    neath his ken though i saw but the strip twixt the hill        140         and the sky    and i laughedsince my days are ordained to be passed with my

 schemes of life its best rules and right uses the courage       145         that gains    and the prudence that keeps what men strive for and now these old         trains    of vague thought came again i grew surer so once more the string    of my harp made response to my spirit as thus   xiii                                                yea my king    i beganthou dost well in rejecting mere

as i say with my head just above his vast knees    which were thrust out on each side around me like oakroots      225         which please    to encircle a lamb when it slumbers i looked up to know    if the best i could do had brought solace he spoke not but slow    lifted up the hand slack at his side till he laid it with care    soft and grave but in mild settled will on my brow through my hair    the large fingers were pushed and he bent back my head          230         with kind power    all my face back intent to peruse it as men do a flower    thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mineand    oh all my heart how it loved him but where was the sign    i yearnedcould i help thee my father inventing a bliss    i would add to that life of the past both the future

unuttered unseen the alive the aware    i repressed i got through them as hardly as strugglingly there    as a runner beset by the populace famished for news    life or death   the whole earth was awakened hell loosed with her         crews    and the stars of night beat with emotion and tingled and         320         shot    out in fire the strong pain of pent knowledge but i fainted not    for the hand still impelled me at once and supported suppressed    all the tumult and quenched it with quiet and holy behest    till the rapture was shut in itself and the earth sank to rest    anon at the dawn all that trouble had withered from earth      325    not so much but i saw it die out in the days tender birth    in the gathered intensity brought to the gray of the hills    in the shuddering forests held breath in the sudden windthrills    in the startled wild beasts that bore off each with eye sidling         still    though averted with wonder and dread in the birds stiff and      330         chill    that rose heavily as i approached them made stupid with awe    een the serpent that slid away silenthe felt the new law    the same stared in the white humid faces upturned by the flowers    the same worked in the heart of the cedar and moved the vinebowers    and the little brooks witnessing murmured persistent and         335         low    with their obstinate all but hushed voiceseen so it is so     my star              all that i know              of a certain star            is it can throw              like the angled spar            now a dart of red                                          5              now a dart of blue            till my friends have said              they would fain see too    my star that dartles the red and the blue    then it stops like a bird like a flower hangs furled            10      they must solace themselves with the saturn above it    what matter to me if their star is a world      mine has opened its soul to me therefore i love it     two in the campagna      i wonder do you feel today      as i have felt since hand in hand    we sat down on the grass to stray      in spirit better through the land    this morn of rome and may                                          5     for me i touched a thought i know      has tantalized me many times    like turns of thread the spiders throw      mocking across our path for rhymes    to catch at and let go                                            10     help me to hold it first it left      the yellowing fennel run to seed    there branching from the

fresh the splinters keep and fine    only a touch and we combine     too long this time of year the days    but nights at least the nights are short    as night shows where her one moon is                              10    a handsbreadth of pure light and bliss    so lifes night gives my lady birth    and my eyes hold her what is worth    the rest of heaven the rest of earth     o loaded curls

   to see the townsfolk suffer so      from vermin was a pity   ii     rats                                                              10    they fought the dogs and killed the cats      and bit the babies in the cradles    and ate the cheeses out of the vats      and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles    split open the kegs of salted sprats                              15    made nests

   20   iii     at last the people in a body      to the town hall came flocking    tis clear cried they our mayors a noddy    and as for our corporationshocking    to think we buy gowns lined with

mighty consternation   iv     an hour they sat in council                                       35      at length the mayor broke silence    for a guilder id my ermine gown sell      i wish i were a mile hence    its easy to bid one rack ones brain    im sure my poor head aches again                                 40    ive scratched it so and all in vain    oh for a trap a trap a trap    just as he said this what should hap    at the chamber door but a gentle tap    bless us cried the mayor whats that                        45    with the corporation as he sat    looking little though wondrous fat    nor brighter was his eye nor moister    than a toolongopened oyster    save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous                         50    for a plate of turtle green and glutinous    only a scraping of shoes on the mat    anything like the sound of a rat    makes my heart go pitapat   v     come inthe mayor cried looking bigger                      55    and in did come the strangest figure    his queer long coat from heel to head    was half of yellow and half of red    and he himself was tall and thin    with sharp blue eyes each like a pin                             60    and light loose hair yet swarthy skin    no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin    but lips where smiles went out and in    there was no guessing his kith and kin    and nobody could enough admire                                     65    the tall man and his quaint attire    quoth one its as my greatgrandsire    starting up at the trump of dooms tone    had walked this way from his painted tombstone   vi     he advanced to the counciltable                                  70    and please your honors said he im able    by means of a secret charm to draw      all creatures living beneath the sun      that creep or swim or fly or run    after me so as you never saw                                      75    and i chiefly use my charm    on creatures that do people harm    the mole and toad and newt and viper    and people call me the pied piper    and here they noticed round his neck                              80      a scarf of red and yellow stripe    to match with his coat of the selfsame check      and at the scarfs end hung a pipe    and his fingers they noticed were ever straying    as if impatient to be playing                                      85    upon this pipe as low it dangled    over his vesture so oldfangled    yet said he poor piper as i am    in tartary i freed the cham      last june from his huge swarms of gnats                        90    i eased in asia the nizam      of a monstrous brood of vampirebats    and as for what your brain bewilders      if i can rid your town of rats    will you give me a thousand guilders                             95    one fifty thousandwas the exclamation    of the astonished mayor and corporation   vii     into the street the piper stepped      smiling first a little smile    as if he knew what magic slept                                    100      in his quiet pipe the while    then like a musical adept    to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled    and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled    like a candleflame where salt is sprinkled                      105    and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered    you heard as if an army muttered    and the muttering grew to a grumbling    and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling    and out of the houses the rats came tumbling                     110    great rats small rats lean rats brawny rats    brown rats black rats gray rats tawny rats    grave old plodders gay young friskers      fathers mothers uncles cousins    cocking tails and pricking whiskers                              115      families by tens and dozens    brothers sisters husbands wives    followed the piper for their lives    from street to street he piped advancing    and step for step they followed dancing                          120    until they came to the river weser      wherein all plunged and perished    save one who stout as julius cæsar    swam across and lived to carry      as he the manuscript he cherished                            125    to ratland home his commentary    which was at the first shrill notes of the pipe    i heard a sound as of scraping tripe    and putting apples wondrous ripe    into a ciderpresss gripe                                       130    and a moving away of pickletubboards    and a leaving ajar of conservecupboards    and a drawing the corks of trainoilflasks    and a breaking the hoops of buttercasks    and it seemed as if a voice                                       135        sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery    is breathed called out o rats rejoice      the world is grown to one vast drysaltery    so munch on crunch on take your nuncheon    breakfast supper dinner luncheon                             140    and just as a bulky sugarpuncheon    all ready staved like a great sun shone    glorious scarce an inch before me    just as methought it said come bore me    i found the weser rolling oer me                             145   viii     you should have heard the hamelin people    ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple    go cried the mayor and get long poles    poke out the nests and block up the holes    consult with carpenters and builders                             150    and leave in our town not even a trace    of the ratswhen suddenly up the face    of the piper perked in the marketplace    with a first if you please my thousand guilders   ix     a thousand guilders the mayor looked blue                       155    so did the corporation too    for council dinners made rare havoc    with claret moselle vindegrave hock    and half the money would replenish    their cellars biggest butt with rhenish                         160    to pay this sum to a wandering fellow    with a gypsy coat of red and yellow    beside quoth the mayor with a knowing wink    our business was done at the rivers brink    we saw with our eyes the vermin sink                             165    and whats dead cant come to life i think    so friend were not the folks to shrink    from the duty of giving you something for drink    and a matter of money to put in your poke    but as for the guilders what we spoke                            170    of them as you very well know was in joke    beside our losses have made us thrifty    a thousand guilders come take fifty   x     the pipers face fell and he cried    no trifling i cant wait beside                               175    ive promised to visit by dinner time    bagdat and accept the prime    of the headcooks pottage all hes rich in    for having left in the caliphs kitchen    of a nest of scorpions no survivor                               180    with him i proved no bargaindriver    with you dont think ill bate a stiver    and folks who put me in a passion    may find me pipe after another fashion   xi     how cried the mayor dye think i brook                       185    being worse treated than a cook    insulted by a lazy ribald    with idle pipe and vesture piebald    you threaten us fellow   do your worst    blow your pipe there till you burst                             190   xii     once more he stepped into the street      and to his lips again    laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane      and ere he blew three notes such sweet    soft notes as yet musicians cunning                              195      never gave the enraptured air    there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling    of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling    small feet were pattering wooden shoes clattering    little hands clapping and little tongues chattering              200    and like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering    out came the children running    all the little boys and girls    with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls    and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls                         205    tripping and skipping ran merrily after    the wonderful music with shouting and laughter   xiii     the mayor was dumb and the council stood    as if they were changed into blocks of wood    unable to move a step or cry                                     210    to the children merrily skipping by    could only follow with the eye    that joyous crowd at the pipers back    but how the mayor was on the rack    and the wretched councils bosoms beat                           215    as the piper turned from the high street    to where the weser rolled its waters    right in the way of their sons and daughters    however he turned from south to west    and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed                       220    and after him the children pressed    great was the joy in every breast    he never can cross that mighty top    hes forced to let the piping drop    and we shall see our children stop                              225    when lo as they reached the mountainside    a wondrous portal opened wide    as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed    and the piper advanced and the children followed    and when all were in to the very last                            230    the door in the mountainside shut fast    did i say all no one was lame      and could not dance the whole of the way    and in after years if you would blame      his sadness he was used to say                               235    its dull in our town since my playmates left    i cant forget that im bereft    of all the pleasant sights they see    which the piper also promised me    for he led us he said to a joyous land                         240    joining the town and just at hand    where waters gushed and fruittrees grew    and flowers put forth a fairer hue    and everything was strange and new    the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here                    245    and their dogs outran our fallow deer    and honeybees had lost their stings    and horses were born with eagles wings    and just as i became assured    my lame foot would be speedily cured                             250    the music stopped and i stood still    and found myself outside the hill    left alone against my will    to go now limping as before    and never hear of that country more                             255   xiv     alas alas for hamelin      there came into many a burghers pate      a text which says that heavens gate      opes to the rich at as easy rate    as the needles eye takes a camel in                             260    the mayor sent east west north and south    to offer the piper by word of mouth      wherever it was mens lot to find him    silver and gold to his hearts content    if hed only return the way he went                              265      and bring the children behind him    but when they saw twas a lost endeavor    and piper and dancers were gone forever    they made a decree that lawyers never      should think their records dated duly                           270    if after the day of the month and year    these words did not as well appear    and so long after what happened here      on the twentysecond of july    thirteen hundred and seventysix                                275    and the better in memory to fix    the place of the childrens last retreat    they called it the pied pipers street    where anyone playing on pipe or tabor    was sure for the future to lose his labor                        280    nor suffered they hostelry or tavern      to shock with mirth a street so solemn    but opposite the place of the cavern      they wrote the story on a column    and on the great churchwindow painted                            285    the same to make the world acquainted    how their children were stolen away    and there it stands to this very day    and i must not omit to say    that in transylvania theres a tribe                              290    of alien people who ascribe    the outlandish ways and dress    on which their neighbors lay such stress    to their fathers and mothers having risen    out of some subterraneous prison                                  295    into which they were trepanned    long time ago in a mighty band    out of hamelin town in brunswick land    but how or why they dont understand   xv     so willy let me and you be wipers                               300    of scores out with all menespecially pipers    and whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice    if weve promised them aught let us keep our promise     the flight of the duchess   i     youre my friend      i was the man the duke spoke to      i helped the duchess to cast off his yoke too    so heres the tale from beginning to end    my friend                                                          5   ii     ours is a great wild country      if you climb to our castles top      i dont see where your eye can stop    for when youve passed the cornfield country    where vineyards leave off flocks are packed                      10    and sheeprange leads to cattletract    and cattletract to openchase    and openchase to the very base    of the mountain where at a funeral pace    round about solemn and slow                                      15    one by one row after row    up and up the pinetrees go    so like black priests up and so    down the other side again      to another greater wilder country                              20    thats one vast red drear burntup plain    branched through and through with many a vein    whence irons dug and coppers dealt      look right look left look straight before    beneath they mine above they smelt                               25      copperore and ironore    and forge and furnace mold and melt      and so on more and ever more    till at the last for a bounding belt      comes the salt sand hoar of the great seashore                  30    and the whole is our dukes country   iii     i was born the day this present duke was      and o says the song ere i was old    in the castle where the other duke was      when i was happy and young not old                           35    i in the kennel he in the bower    we are of like age to an hour    my father was huntsman in that day    who has not heard my father say    that when a boar was brought to bay                              40    three times four times out of five    with his huntspear hed contrive    to get the killingplace transfixed    and pin him true both eyes betwixt    and thats why the old duke would rather                           45    he lost a saltpit than my father    and loved to have him ever in call    thats why my father stood in the hall    when the old duke brought his infant out      to show the people and while they passed                        50    the wondrous bantling round about      was first to start at the outside blast    as the kaisers courier blew his horn    just a month after the babe was born    and quoth the kaisers courier since                          55    the duke has got an heir our prince      needs the dukes self at his side    the duke looked down and seemed to wince      but he thought of wars oer the world wide    castles afire men on their march                                60    the toppling tower the crashing arch      and up he looked and awhile he eyed    the row of crests and shields and banners    of all achievements after all manners      and aye said the duke with a surly pride                     65      the more was his comfort when he died    at next years end in a velvet suit    with a gilt glove on his hand his foot    in a silken shoe for a leather boot    petticoated like a herald                                         70      in a chamber next to an anteroom    where he breathed the breath of page and groom      what he called stink and they perfume    they should have set him on red berold    mad with pride like fire to manage                               75    they should have got his cheek fresh tannage    such a day as today in the merry sunshine    had they stuck on his fist a roughfoot merlin    hark the winds on the heath at its game    oh for a noble falconlanner                                      80    to flap each broad wing like a banner    and turn in the wind and dance like flame    had they broached a whitebeer cask from berlin    or if you incline to prescribe mere wine    put to his lips when they saw him pine                           85    a cup of our own moldavia fine    cotnar for instance green as may sorrel    and ropy with sweetwe shall not quarrel   iv     so at home the sick tall yellow duchess    was left with the infant in her clutches                          90    she being the daughter of god knows who      and now was the time to revisit her tribe    abroad and afar they went the two      and let our people rail and gibe    at the empty hall and extinguished fire                           95      as loud as we liked but ever in vain    till after long years we had our desire      and back came the duke and his mother again   v     and he came back the pertest little ape    that ever affronted human shape                                  100    full of his travel struck at himself      youd say he despised our bluff old ways    not he for in paris they told the elf      our rough north land was the land of lays      the one good thing left in evil days                           105    since the midage was the heroic time      and only in wild nooks like ours    could you taste of it yet as in its prime      and see true castles with proper towers    younghearted women oldminded men                              110    and manners now as manners were then    so all that the old dukes had been without knowing it    this duke would fain know he was without being it    twas not for the joys self but the joy of his showing it    nor for the prides self but the pride of our seeing it         115    he revived all usages thoroughly wornout    the souls of them fumedforth the hearts of them tornout    and chief in the chase his neck he periled    on a lathy horse all legs and length    with blood for bone all speed no strength                      120    they should have set him on red berold    with the red eye slow consuming in fire    and the thin stiff ear like an abbeyspire   vi     well such as he was he must marry we heard    and out of a convent at the word                                125    came the lady in time of spring    oh old thoughts they cling they cling    that day i know with a dozen oaths    i clad myself in thick huntingclothes    fit for the chase of urochs or buffle                             130    in wintertime when you need to muffle    but the duke had a mind we should cut a figure      and so we saw the lady arrive    my friend i have seen a white crane bigger      she was the smallest lady alive                                135    made in a piece of natures madness    too small almost for the life and gladness      that overfilled her as some hive    out of the bears reach on the high trees    is crowded with its safe merry bees                             140    in truth she was not hard to please    up she looked down she looked round at the mead    straight at the castle thats best indeed    to look at from outside the walls    as for us styled the serfs and thralls                        145    she as much thanked me as if she had said it      with her eyes do you understand    because i patted her horse while i led it      and max who rode on her other hand    said no bird flew past but she inquired                          150    what its true name was nor ever seemed tired    if that was an eagle she saw hover    and the green and gray bird on the field was the plover    when suddenly appeared the duke      and as down she sprung the small foot pointed                  155    on to my handas with a rebuke      and as if his backbone were not jointed    the duke stepped rather aside than forward      and welcomed her with his grandest smile      and mind you his mother all the while                         160    chilled in the rear like a wind to norward    and up like a weary yawn with its pulleys    went in a shriek the rusty portcullis    and like a glad sky the northwind sullies    the ladys face stopped its play                                 165    as if her first hair had grown gray    for such things must begin some one day   vii     in a day or two she was well again    as who should say you labor in vain    this is all a jest against god who meant                         170    i should ever be as i am content    and glad in his sight therefore glad i will be    so smiling as at first went she   viii     she was active stirring all fire    could not rest could not tire                                  175    to a stone she might have given life      i myself loved once in my day    for a shepherds miners huntsmans wife      i had a wife i know what i say    never in all the world such an one                               180    and here was plenty to be done    and she that could do it great or small    she was to do nothing at all    there was already this man in his post      this in his station and that in his office                    185    and the dukes plan admitted a wife at most      to meet his eye with the other trophies    now outside the hall now in it      to sit thus stand thus see and be seen    at the proper place in the proper minute                         190      and die away the life between    and it was amusing enough each infraction      of rulebut for aftersadness that came    to hear the consummate selfsatisfaction      with which the young duke and the old dame                      195    would let her advise and criticize    and being a fool instruct the wise      and childlike parcel out praise or blame    they bore it all in complacent guise    as though an artificer after contriving                          200    a wheelwork image as if it were living    should find with delight it could motion to strike him    so found the duke and his mother like him    the lady hardly got a rebuff    that had not been contemptuous enough                            205    with his cursed smirk as he nodded applause    and kept off the old mothercats claws   ix     so the little lady grew silent and thin      paling and ever paling    as the way is with a hid chagrin                                 210      and the duke perceived that she was ailing    and said in his heart tis done to spite me    but i shall find in my power to right me    dont swear friend the old one many a year    is in hell and the dukes self  you shall hear               215   x     well early in autumn at first winterwarning    when the stag had to break with his foot of a morning    a drinkinghole out of the fresh tender ice    that covered the pond till the sun in a trice    loosening it let out a ripple of gold                           220      and another and another and faster and faster    till dimpling to blindness the wide water rolled      then it so chanced that the duke our master    asked himself what were the pleasures in season      and found since the calendar bade him be hearty               225    he should do the middle age no treason      in resolving on a huntingparty    always provided old books showed the way of it      what meant old poets by their strictures    and when old poets had said their say of it                      230      how taught old painters in their pictures    we must revert to the proper channels    workings in tapestry paintings on panels    and gather up woodcrafts authentic traditions    here was food for our various ambitions                          235    as on each case exactly stated      to encourage your dog now the properest chirrup      or best prayer to saint hubert on mounting your stirrup    we of the household took thought and debated    blessed was he whose back ached with the jerkin                   240    his sire was wont to do forestwork in    blesseder he who nobly sunk ohs    and ahs while he tugged on his grandsires trunkhose    what signified hats if they had no rims on      each slouching before and behind like the scallop              245      and able to serve at sea for a shallop    loaded with lacquer and looped with crimson    so that the deer now to make a short rhyme ont      what with our venerers prickers and verderers      might hope for real hunters at length and not murderers        250    and oh the dukes tailor he had a hot time ont   xi     now you must know that when the first dizziness      of flaphats and buffcoats and jackboots subsided      the duke put this question the dukes part provided    had not the duchess some share in the business                  255    for out of the mouth of two or three witnesses    did he establish all fitorunfitnesses    and after much laying of heads together    somebodys cap got a notable feather    by the announcement with proper unction                           260    that he had discovered the ladys function    since ancient authors gave this tenet      when horns wind a mort and the deer is at siege      let the dame of the castle prick forth on her jennet      and with water to wash the hands of her liege                  265    in a clean ewer with a fair toweling    let her preside at the disemboweling    now my friend if you had so little religion      as to catch a hawk some falconlanner      and thrust her broad wings like a banner                        270    into a coop for a vulgar pigeon    and if day by day and week by week      you cut her claws and sealed her eyes    and clipped her wings and tied her beak      would it cause you any great surprise                           275    if when you decided to give her an airing    you found she needed a little preparing    i say should you be such a curmudgeon    if she clung to the perch as to take it in dudgeon    yet when the duke to his lady signified                          280    just a day before as he judged most dignified    in what a pleasure she was to participate      and instead of leaping wide in flashes      her eyes just lifted their long lashes    as if pressed by fatigue even he could not dissipate             285    and duly acknowledged the dukes forethought    but spoke of her health if her health were worth aught    of the weight by day and the watch by night    and much wrong now that used to be right    so thanking him declined the hunting                          290    was conduct ever more affronting    with all the ceremony settled      with the towel ready and the sewer      polishing up his oldest ewer    and the jennet pitched upon a piebald                           295      blackbarred creamcoated and pink eyeballed    no wonder if the duke was nettled    and when she persisted nevertheless    well i suppose heres the time to confess    that there ran half round our ladys chamber                      300    a balcony none of the hardest to clamber    and that jacynth the tirewoman ready in waiting    stayed in call outside what need of relating    and since jacynth was like a june rose why a fervent    adorer of jacynth of course was your servant                     305    and if she had the habit to peep through the casement      how could i keep at any vast distance      and so as i say on the ladys persistence    the duke dumbstricken with amazement    stood for a while in a sultry smother                            310      and then with a smile that partook of the awful    turned her over to his yellow mother      to learn what was held decorous and lawful    and the mother smelt blood with a catlike instinct    as her cheek quick whitened through all its quincetinct         315    oh but the lady heard the whole truth at once      what meant shewho was sheher duty and station    the wisdom of age and the folly of youth at once      its decent regard and its fitting relation    in brief my friend set all the devils in hell free              320    and turn them out to carouse in a belfry    and treat the priests to a fiftypart canon    and then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on    well somehow or other it ended at last    and licking her whiskers out she passed                        325    and after hermaking he hoped a face      like emperor nero or sultan saladin    stalked the dukes self with the austere grace      of ancient hero or modern paladin    from door to staircaseoh such a solemn                         330    unbending of the vertebral column   xii     however at sunrise our company mustered      and here was the huntsman bidding unkennel    and there neath his bonnet the pricker blustered      with feather dank as a bough of wet fennel                     335    for the courtyard walls were filled with fog    you might have cut as an ax chops a log    like so much wool for color and bulkiness    and out rode the duke in a perfect sulkiness    since before breakfast a man feels but queasily                340      and a sinking at the lower abdomen      begins the day with indifferent omen    and lo as he looked around uneasily    the sun plowed the fog up and drove it asunder    this way and that from the valley under                          345      and looking through the courtyard arch    down in the valley what should meet him      but a troop of gypsies on their march    no doubt with the annual gifts to greet him   xiii     now in your land gypsies reach you only                         350      after reaching all lands beside    north they go south they go trooping or lonely      and still as they travel far and wide    catch they and keep now a trace here a trace there    that puts you in mind of a place here a place there              355    but with us i believe they rise out of the ground    and nowhere else i take it are found    with the earthtint yet so freshly embrowned    born no doubt like insects which breed on    the very fruit they are meant to feed on                         360    for the earthnot a use to which they dont turn it      the ore that grows in the mountains womb      or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb    they sift and soften it bake it and burn it    whether they weld you for instance a snaffle                    365    with sidebars never a brute can baffle    or a lock thats a puzzle of wards within wards    or if your colts forefoot inclines to curve inwards    horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel    and wont allow the hoof to shrivel                              370    then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle    that keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle    but the sandthey pinch and pound it like otters    commend me the gypsy glassmakers and potters    glasses theyll blow you crystalclear                          375    where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear    as if in pure water you dropped and let die    a bruised blackblooded mulberry    and that other sort their crowning pride    with long white threads distinct inside                          380    like the lakeflowers fibrous roots which dangle    loose such a length and never tangle    where the bold swordlily cuts the clear waters    and the cuplily couches with all the white daughters    such are the works they put their hand to                        385    the uses they turn and twist iron and sand to    and these made the troop which our duke saw sally    toward his castle from out of the valley    men and women like newhatched spiders    come out with the morning to greet our riders                    390    and up they wound till they reached the ditch    whereat all stopped save one a witch    that i knew as she hobbled from the group    by her gait directly and her stoop    i whom jacynth was used to importune                             395    to let that same witch tell us our fortune    the oldest gypsy then above ground      and sure as the autumn season came round    she paid us a visit for profit or pastime    and every time as she swore for the last time                  400    and presently she was seen to sidle      up to the duke till she touched his bridle    so that the horse of a sudden reared up    as under its nose the old witch peered up    with her wornout eyes or rather eyeholes                       405      of no use now but to gather brine      and began a kind of level whine    such as they used to sing to their viols    when their ditties they go grinding    up and down with nobody minding                                  410    and then as of old at the end of the humming    her usual presents were forthcoming    a dogwhistle blowing the fiercest of trebles    just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles    or a porcelain mouthpiece to screw on a pipeend                415    and so she awaited her annual stipend    but this time the duke would scarcely vouchsafe      a word in reply and in vain she felt      with twitching fingers at her belt      for the purse of sleek pinemarten pelt                        420    ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe    till either to quicken his apprehension    or possibly with an afterintention    she was come she said to pay her duty    to the new duchess the youthful beauty                          425    no sooner had she named his lady    than a shine lit up the face so shady    and its smirk returned with a novel meaning    for it struck him the babe just wanted weaning    if one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow              430    she foolish today would be wiser tomorrow    and who so fit a teacher of trouble    as this sordid crone bent wellnigh double    so glancing at her wolfskin vesture      if such it was for they grow so hirsute                       435      that their own fleece serves for natural fursuit    he was contrasting twas plain from his gesture    the life of the lady so flowerlike and delicate    with the loathsome squalor of this helicat    i in brief was the man the duke beckoned                        440      from out of the throng and while i drew near    he told the croneas i since have reckoned      by the way he bent and spoke into her ear    with circumspection and mystery    the main of the ladys history                                   445    her frowardness and ingratitude    and for all the crones submissive attitude    i could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening    and her brow with assenting intelligence brightening      as though she engaged with hearty goodwill                      450      whatever he now might enjoin to fulfill    and promised the lady a thorough frightening    and so just giving her a glimpse    of a purse with the air of a man who imps    the wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw               455      he bade me take the gypsy mother      and set her telling some story or other    of hill or dale oakwood or fernshaw    to wile away a weary hour    for the lady left alone in her bower                             460    whose mind and body craved exertion    and yet shrank from all better diversion   xiv     then clapping heel to his horse the mere curveter      out rode the duke and after his hollo    horses and hounds swept huntsman and servitor                   465      and back i turned and bade the crone follow    and what makes me confident whats to be told you      had all along been of this crones devising    is that on looking round sharply behold you      there was a novelty quick as surprising                        470    for first she had shot up a full head in stature      and her step kept pace with mine nor faltered    as if age had foregone its usurpature      and the ignoble mien was wholly altered    and the face looked quite of another nature                      475    and the change reached too whatever the change meant    her shaggy wolfskin cloaks arrangement    for where its tatters hung loose like sedges    gold coins were glittering on the edges    like the bandroll strung with tomans                             480    which proves the veil a persian womans    and under her brow like a snails horns newly      come out as after the rain he paces    two unmistakable eyepoints duly      live and aware looked out of their places                      485    so we went and found jacynth at the entry    of the ladys chamber standing sentry    i told the command and produced my companion    and jacynth rejoiced to admit anyone    for since last night by the same token                          490    not a single word had the lady spoken    they went in both to the presence together    while i in the balcony watched the weather   xv     and now what took place at the very first of all    i cannot tell as i never could learn it                         495    jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall    on that little head of hers and burn it    if she knew how she came to drop so soundly      asleep of a sudden and there continue    the whole time sleeping as profoundly                             500      as one of the boars my father would pin you    twixt the eyes where life holds garrison    jacynth forgive me the comparison    but where i begin my own narration    is a little after i took my station                               505    to breathe the fresh air from the balcony    and having in those days a falcon eye    to follow the hunt through the open country      from where the bushes thinlier crested    the hillocks to a plain wheres not one tree                    510      when in a moment my ear was arrested    bywas it singing or was it saying    or a strange musical instrument playing    in the chamberand to be certain    i pushed the lattice pulled the curtain                         515    and there lay jacynth asleep    yet as if a watch she tried to keep    in a rosy sleep along the floor    with her head against the door    while in the midst on the seat of state                         520    was a queenthe gypsy woman late    with head and face downbent    on the ladys head and face intent    for coiled at her feet like a child at ease    the lady sat between her knees                                   525    and oer them the ladys clasped hands met    and on those hands her chin was set    and her upturned face met the face of the crone    wherein the eyes had grown and grown    as if she could double and quadruple                              530    at pleasure the play of either pupil      very like by her hands slow fanning    as up and down like a gorcrows flappers    they moved to measure or bellclappers      i said is it blessing is it banning                         535    do they applaud you or burlesque you     those hands and fingers with no flesh on    but just as i thought to spring in to the rescue      at once i was stopped by the ladys expression    for it was life her eyes were drinking                            540    from the crones wide pair above unwinking    lifes pure fire received without shrinking    into the heart and breast whose heaving    told you no single drop they were leaving    life that filling her passed redundant                        545      into her very hair back swerving    over each shoulder loose and abundant      as her head thrown back showed the white throat curving    and the very tresses shared in the pleasure    moving to the mystic measure                                     550    bounding as the bosom bounded    i stopped short more and more confounded    as still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened    as she listened and she listened    when all at once a hand detained me                              555    the selfsame contagion gained me    and i kept time to the wondrous chime    making out words and prose and rhyme    till it seemed that the music furled      its wings like a task fulfilled and dropped                    560      from under the words it first had propped    and left them midway in the world    word took word as hand takes hand    i could hear at last and understand    and when i held the unbroken thread                              565    the gypsy said    and so at last we find my tribe    and so i set thee in the midst    and to one and all of them describe      what thou saidst and what thou didst                           570    our long and terrible journey through    and all thou art ready to say and do    in the trials that remain    i trace them the vein and the other vein    that meet on thy brow and part again                             575    making our rapid mystic mark      and i bid my people prove and probe      each eyes profound and glorious globe    till they detect the kindred spark    in those depths so dear and dark                                 580    like the spots that snap and burst and flee    circling over the midnight sea    and on that round young cheek of thine      i make them recognize the tinge    as when of the costly scarlet wine                                585      they drip so much as will impinge    and spread in a thinnest scale afloat    one thick gold drop from the olives coat    over a silver plate whose sheen    still through the mixture shall be seen                          590    for so i prove thee to one and all      fit when my people ope their breast    to see the sign and hear the call      and take the vow and stand the test      which adds one more child to the rest                         595    when the breast is bare and the arms are wide    and the world is left outside    for there is probation to decree    and many and long must the trials be    thou shalt victoriously endure                                   600    if that brow is true and those eyes are sure    like a jewelfinders fierce assay      of the prize he dug from its mountaintomb    let once the vindicating ray      leap out amid the anxious gloom                                605    and steel and fire have done their part    and the prize falls on its finders heart    so trial after trial past    wilt thou fall at the very last    breathless half in trance                                        610    with the thrill of the great deliverance      into our arms forevermore    and thou shalt know those arms once curled      about thee what we knew before    how love is the only good in the world                           615    henceforth be loved as heart can love    or brain devise or hand approve    stand up look below    it is our life at thy feet we throw    to step with into light and joy                                  620    not a power of life but we employ    to satisfy thy natures want    art thou the tree that props the plant    or the climbing plant that seeks the tree    canst thou help us must we help thee                            625    if any two creatures grew into one    they would do more than the world has done    though each apart were never so weak    ye vainly through the world should seek    for the knowledge and the might                                   630    which in such union grew their right    so to approach at least that end    and blendas much as may be blend    thee with us or us with thee    as climbing plant or propping tree                               635    shall someone deck thee over and down      up and about with blossoms and leaves    fix his hearts fruit for thy garlandcrown      cling with his soul as the gourdvine cleaves    die on thy boughs and disappear                                   640    while not a leaf of thine is sere    or is the other fate in store    and art thou fitted to adore    to give thy wondrous self away    and take a stronger natures sway                                645    i foresee and could foretell    thy future portion sure and well    but those passionate eyes speak true speak true    let them say what thou shalt do    only be sure thy daily life                                      650    in its peace or in its strife    never shall be unobserved      we pursue thy whole career      and hope for it or doubt or fear    lo hast thou kept thy path or swerved                           655    we are beside thee in all thy ways    with our blame with our praise    our shame to feel our pride to show    glad angrybut indifferent no    whether it be thy lot to go                                      660    for the good of us all where the haters meet    in the crowded citys horrible street    or thou step alone through the morass    where never sound yet was    save the dry quick clap of the storks bill                      665    for the air is still and the water still    when the blue breast of the dipping coot    dives under and all is mute    so at the last shall come old age    decrepit as befits that stage                                    670    how else wouldst thou retire apart    with the hoarded memories of thy heart    and gather all to the very least    of the fragments of lifes earlier feast    let fall through eagerness to find                                675    the crowning dainties yet behind    ponder on the entire past    laid together thus at last    when the twilight helps to fuse    the first fresh with the faded hues                              680    and the outline of the whole    as round eves shades their framework roll    grandly fronts for once thy soul    and then as mid the dark a gleam      of yet another morning breaks                                  685    and like the hand which ends a dream    death with the might of his sunbeam      touches the flesh and the soul awakes    then             aye then indeed something would happen      but what for here her voice changed like a birds             690      there grew more of the music and less of the words    had jacynth only been by me to clap pen    to paper and put you down every syllable      with those clever clerkly fingers      all ive forgotten as well as what lingers                      695    in this old brain of mine thats but ill able    to give you even this poor version      of the speech i spoil as it were with stammering      more fault of those who had the hammering      of prosody into me and syntax                                  700      and did it not with hobnails but tintacks    but to return from this excursion    just do you mark when the song was sweetest    the peace most deep and the charm completest    there came shall i say a snap                                 705      and the charm vanished      and my sense returned so strangely banished    and starting as from a nap    i knew the crone was bewitching my lady    with jacynth asleep and but one spring made i                    710    down from the casement round to the portal      another minute and i had entered    when the door opened and more than mortal      stood with a face where to my mind centered    all beauties i ever saw or shall see                             715    the duchess i stopped as if struck by palsy    she was so different happy and beautiful      i felt at once that all was best      and that i had nothing to do for the rest    but wait her commands obey and be dutiful                       720    not that in fact there was any commanding      i saw the glory of her eye    and the brows height and the breasts expanding      and i was hers to live or to die    as for finding what she wanted                                   725    you know god almighty granted    such little signs should serve wild creatures      to tell one another all their desires      so that each knows what his friend requires    and does its bidding without teachers                            730    i preceded her the crone    followed silent and alone    i spoke to her but she merely jabbered      in the old style both her eyes had slunk      back to their pits her stature shrunk                         735      in short the soul in its body sunk    like a blade sent home to its scabbard    we descended i preceding    crossed the court with nobody heeding    all the world was at the chase                                   740    the courtyard like a desertplace    the stable emptied of its small fry    i saddled myself the very palfrey    i remember patting while it carried her    the day she arrived and the duke married her                     745    and do you know though its easy deceiving    oneself in such matters i cant help believing    the lady had not forgotten it either    and knew the poor devil so much beneath her    would have been only too glad for her service                     750    to dance on hot plowshares like a turk dervise    but unable to pay proper duty where owing it    was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it    for though the moment i began setting    his saddle on my own nag of berolds begetting                   755    not that i meant to be obtrusive      she stopped me while his rug was shifting      by a single rapid fingers lifting    and with a gesture kind but conclusive    and a little shake of the head refused me                      760    i say although she never used me    yet when she was mounted the gypsy behind her    and i ventured to remind her    i suppose with a voice of less steadiness      than usual for my feeling exceeded me                         765    something to the effect that i was in readiness      whenever god should please she needed me    then do you know her face looked down on me    with a look that placed a crown on me    and she felt in her bosommark her bosom                      770    and as a flowertree drops its blossom    dropped me  ah had it been a purse    of silver my friend or gold thats worse    why you see as soon as i found myself      so understoodthat a true heart so may gain                    775      such a rewardi should have gone home again    kissed jacynth and soberly drowned myself    it was a little plait of hair      such as friends in a convent make      to wear each for the others sake                            780    this see which at my breast i wear    ever did rather to jacynths grudgment    and ever shall till the day of judgment    and thenand thento cut shortthis is idle      these are feelings it is not good to foster                   785    i pushed the gate wide she shook the bridle      and the palfrey boundedand so we lost her   xvi     when the liquors out why clink the cannikin    i did think to describe you the panic in    the redoubtable breast of our master the mannikin                790    and what was the pitch of his mothers yellowness      how she turned as a shark to snap the sparerib      clean off sailors says from a pearldiving carib    when she heard what she called the flight of the feloness    but it seems such childs play                                 795    what they said and did with the lady away    and to dance on when weve lost the music    always made meand no doubt makes yousick    nay to my mind the worlds face looked so stern    as that sweet form disappeared through the postern               800    she that kept it in constant good humor    it ought to have stopped there seemed nothing to do more    but the world thought otherwise and went on    and my heads one that its spite was spent on    thirty years are fled since that morning                         805    and with them all my heads adorning    nor did the old duchess die outright    as you expect of suppressed spite    the natural end of every adder    not suffered to empty its poisonbladder                         810    but she and her son agreed i take it    that no one should touch on the story to wake it    for the wound in the dukes pride rankled fiery    so they made no search and small inquiry    and when fresh gypsies have paid us a visit ive                 815    noticed the couple were never inquisitive    but told them theyre folks the duke dont want here    and bade them make haste and cross the frontier    brief the duchess was gone and the duke was glad of it      and the old one was in the young ones stead                   820      and took in her place the households head    and a blessed time the household had of it    and were i not as a man may say cautious    how i trench more than needs on the nauseous    i could favor you with sundry touches                             825    of the paintsmutches with which the duchess    heightened the mellowness of her cheeks yellowness    to get on faster until at last her    cheek grew to be one masterplaster    of mucus and fucus from mere use of ceruse                       830    in short she grew from scalp to udder    just the object to make you shudder   xvii     youre my friend    what a thing friendship is world without end    how it gives the heart and soul a stirup                         835      as if somebody broached you a glorious runlet      and poured out all lovelily sparklingly sunlit    our green moldavia the streaky syrup    cotnar as old as the time of the druids    friendship may match with that monarch of fluids                 840    each supples a dry brain fills you its insandouts    gives your lifes hourglass a shake when the thin sand doubts    whether to run on or stop short and guarantees    age is not all made of stark sloth and arrant ease    i have seen my little lady once more                             845      jacynth the gypsy berold and the rest of it    for to me spoke the duke as i told you before      i always wanted to make a clean breast of it    and now it is madewhy my hearts blood that went trickle      trickle but anon in such muddy driblets                      850    is pumped up brisk now through the main ventricle      and genially floats me about the giblets    ill tell you what i intend to do    i must see this fellow his sad life through    he is our duke after all                                        855    and i as he says but a serf and thrall    my father was born here and i inherit      his fame a chain he bound his son with    could i pay in a lump i should prefer it      but theres no mine to blow up and get done with               860    so i must stay till the end of the chapter    for as to our middleagemannersadapter    be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on    some day or other his head in a morion    and breast in a hauberk his heels hell kick up                 865    slain by an onslaught fierce of hiccup    and then when red doth the sword of our duke rust    and its leathern sheath lie oergrown with a blue crust    then i shall scrape together my earnings      for you see in the churchyard jacynth reposes                870      and our children all went the way of the roses    its a long lane that knows no turnings    one needs but little tackle to travel in      so just one stout cloak shall i indue    and for a staff what beats the javelin                           875      with which his boars my father pinned you    and then for a purpose you shall hear presently      taking some

        885      come all the way from the northparts with sperm oil      i hope to get safely out of the turmoil    and arrive one day at the land of the gypsies    and find my lady or hear the last news of her    from some old thief and son of lucifer                           890    his forehead chapleted green with wreathy hop    sunburned all over like an Æthiop    and when my cotnar begins to operate    and the tongue of the rogue to run at a proper rate    and our wineskin tight once shows each flaccid dent           895    i shall drop in withas if by accident    you never knew then how it all ended    what fortune good or bad attended    the little lady your queen befriended    and when thats told me whats remaining                      900    this worlds too hard for my

himstill loftier than the world suspects            living and dying     childe roland to the dark tower came  see edgars song in lear      my first thought was he lied in every word      that hoary cripple with malicious eye      askance to watch the working of his lie    on mine and mouth scarce able to afford    suppression of the glee that pursed and scored                     5      its edge at one more victim gained thereby     what else should he be set for with his staff      what save to waylay with his lies ensnare      all travelers who might find him posted there    and ask the road i guessed what skulllike laugh                  10    would break what crutch gin write my epitaph      for pastime in the dusty thoroughfare     if at his counsel i should turn aside      into the ominous tract which all agree      hides the dark tower yet acquiescingly                          15    i did turn as he pointed neither pride    nor hope rekindling at the end descried      so much as gladness that some end might be     for what with my whole worldwide wandering      what with my search drawn out through years my hope             20      dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope    with that obstreperous joy success would bring    i hardly tried now to rebuke the spring      my heart made finding failure in its scope    as when a sick man very near to death                              25      seems dead indeed and feels begin and end      the tears and takes the farewell of each friend    and hears one bid the other go draw breath    freelier outside since all is oer he saith      and the blow fallen no grieving can amend                    30     while some discuss if near the other graves      be room enough for this and when a day      suits best for carrying the corpse away    with care about the banners scarves and staves    and still the man hears all and only craves                       35      he may not shame such tender love and stay     thus i had so long suffered in this quest      heard failure prophesied so oft been writ      so many times among the bandto wit    the knights who to the dark towers search addressed               40    their stepsthat just to fail as they seemed best      and all the doubt was nowshould i be fit     so quiet as despair i turned from him      that hateful cripple out of his highway      into the path he pointed all the day                            45    had been a dreary one at best and dim    was settling to its close yet shot one grim      red leer to see the plain catch its estray     for mark no sooner was i fairly found      pledged to the plain after a pace or two                       50      than pausing to throw backward a last view    oer the safe road twas gone gray plain all round    nothing but plain to the horizons bound      i might go on naught else remained to do     so on i went i think i never saw                                 55      such starved ignoble nature nothing

gaunt and colloped neck astrain                  80      and shut eyes underneath the rusty mane    seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe    i never saw a brute i hated so      he must be wicked to deserve such pain     i shut my eyes and turned them on my heart                        85      as a man calls for wine before he fights      i asked one draft of earlier happier sights

dismal flat      came to arrest my thoughts and change their train     a sudden little river crossed my path      as unexpected as a serpent comes                               110      no sluggish

it though none did    the cloak that somewhat shone and showed the threads    had purpose and the ruff significance    he walked and tapped the pavement with his cane                   10    scenting

for vulgar souls by ruling and the rest                          25    thou in the daily building of thy tower    whether in fierce and sudden spasms of toil    or through dim lulls of unapparent growth    or when the general work mid good acclaim    climbed with the eye to cheer the architect                      30    didst neer engage in work for mere works sake    hadst ever in thy heart the luring hope    of some eventual rest atop of it    whence all the tumult of the building hushed    thou first of men mightst look out to the east                    35    the vulgar saw thy tower thou sawest the sun    for this i promise on thy festival    to pour libation looking oer the sea    making this slave narrate thy fortunes speak    thy great words and describe thy royal face                     40    wishing thee wholly where zeus lives the most    within the eventual element of calm       thy letters first requirement meets me here    it is as thou hast heard in one short life    i cleon have effected all those things                           45    thou wonderingly dost enumerate    that epos on thy hundred plates of gold    is mineand also mine the little chant    so sure to rise from every fishingbark    when lights at prow the seamen haul their net                   50    the image of the sungod on the phare    men turn from the suns self to see is mine    the poecile oerstoried its whole length    as thou didst hear with painting is mine too    i know the true proportions of a man                               55    and woman also not observed before    and i have written three books on the soul    proving absurd all written hitherto    and putting us to ignorance again    for musicwhy i have combined the moods                         60    inventing one in brief all arts are mine    thus much the people know and recognize    throughout our seventeen islands marvel not    we of these latter days with greater mind    than our forerunners since more composite                        65    look not so great beside their simple way    to a judge who only sees one way at once    one mindpoint and no other at a time    compares the small part of a man of us    with some whole man of the heroic age                             70    great in his waynot ours nor meant for ours    and ours is greater had we skill to know    for what we call this life of men on earth    this sequence of the souls achievements here    being as i find much reason to conceive                          75    intended to be viewed eventually    as a great whole not analyzed to parts    but each part having reference to all    how shall a certain part pronounced complete    endure effacement by another part                                 80    was the thing donethen whats to do again    see in the checkered pavement opposite    suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb    and next a lozenge then a trapezoid    he did not overlay them superimpose                               85    the new upon the old and blot it out    but laid them on a level in his work    making at last a picture there it lies    so first the perfect separate forms were made    the portions of mankind and after so                            90    occurred the combination of the same    for where had been a progress otherwise    mankind made up of all the single men    in such a synthesis the labor ends    now mark me those divine men of old time                          95    have reached thou sayest well each at one point    the outside verge that rounds our faculty    and where they reached who can do more than reach    it takes but little water just to touch    at some one point the inside of a sphere                         100    and as we turn the sphere touch all the rest    in due succession but the finer air    which not so palpably nor obviously    though no less universally can touch    the whole circumference of that emptied sphere                   105    fills it more fully than the water did    holds thrice the weight of water in itself    resolved into a subtler element    and yet the vulgar call the sphere first full    up to the visible heightand after void                        110    not knowing airs more hidden properties    and thus our soul misknown cries out to zeus    to vindicate his purpose in our life    why stay we on the earth unless to grow    long since i imaged wrote the fiction out                      115    that he or other god descended here    and once for all showed simultaneously    what in its nature never can be shown    piecemeal or in successionshowed i say    the worth both absolute and relative                              120    of all his children from the birth of time    his instruments for all appointed work    i now go on to imagemight we hear    the judgment which should give the due to each    show where the labor lay and where the ease                      125    and prove zeus self the latent everywhere    this is a dreambut no dream let us hope    that years and days the summers and the springs    follow each other with unwaning powers    the grapes which dye thy wine are richer far                     130    through culture than the wild wealth of the rock    the suave plum than the savagetasted drupe    the pastured honeybee drops choicer sweet    the flowers turn double and the leaves turn flowers    that young and tender crescentmoon thy slave                   135    sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds    refines upon the women of my youth    what and the soul alone deteriorates    i have not chanted verse like homer no    nor swept string like terpander nonor carved                   140    and painted men like phidias and his friend    i am not great as they are point by point    but i have entered into sympathy    with these four running these into one soul    who separate ignored each others art                          145    say is it nothing that i know them all    the wild flower was the larger i have dashed    roseblood upon its petals pricked its cups    honey with wine and driven its seed to fruit    and show a better flower if not so large                         150    i stand myself refer this to the gods    whose gift alone it is which shall i dare    all pride apart upon the absurd pretext    that such a gift by chance lay in my hand    discourse of lightly or depreciate                               155    it might have fallen to anothers hand what then    i pass too surely let at least truth stay       and next of what thou followest on to ask    this being with me as i declare o king    my works in all these varicolored kinds                         160    so done by me accepted so by men    thou askest if my soul thus in mens hearts    i must not be accounted to attain    the very crown and proper end of life    inquiring thence how now life closeth up                        165    i face death with success in my right hand    whether i fear death less than dost thyself    the fortunate of men for writest thou    thou leavest much behind while i leave naught    thy life stays in the poems men shall sing                       170    the pictures men shall study while my life    complete and whole now in its power and joy    dies altogether with my brain and arm    is lost indeed since what survives myself    the brazen statue to oerlook my grave                           175    set on the promontory which i named    and thatsome supple courtier of my heir    shall use its robed and sceptered arm perhaps    to fix the rope to which best drags it down    i go then triumph thou who dost not go                        180       nay thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind    is this apparent when thou turnst to muse    upon the scheme of earth and man in chief    that admiration grows as knowledge grows    that imperfection means perfection hid                           185    reserved in part

bird                       190    ere man her last appeared upon the stage    thou wouldst have seen them perfect and deduced    the perfectness of others yet unseen    conceding whichhad zeus then questioned thee    shall i go on a step improve on this                           195    do more for visible creatures than is done    thou wouldst have answered aye by making each    grow conscious

flight    till lifes mechanics can no further go    and all this joy in natural life is put    like fire from off thy finger into each    so exquisitely perfect is the same                               205    but tis pure fire and they mere matter are    it has them not they it and so i choose    for man thy last premeditated work    if i might add a glory to the scheme    that a third thing

adaptabilities    the more joygiving will his life become    thus man who hath this quality is best                         220       but thou king hadst more reasonably said    let progress end at onceman make no step    beyond the natural man the better beast    using his senses not the sense of sense    in man theres failure only since he left                        225    the lower and

brutes head                      230    this grew the only life the pleasurehouse    watchtower and treasurefortress of the soul    which whole surrounding flats of natural life    seemed only fit to yield subsistence to    a tower that crowns a country but alas                          235    the soul now climbs it just to perish there    for thence we have discovered tis no dream    we know this which we had not else perceived    that theres a world of capability    for joy spread round about us meant for us                     240    inviting us and still the soul craves all    and still the flesh replies take no jot more    than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad    nay so much less as that fatigue has brought    deduction to it we struggle fain to enlarge                    245    our bounded physical recipiency    increase our power supply fresh oil to life    repair the waste of age and sickness no    it skills not lifes inadequate to joy    as the soul sees joy tempting life to take                      250    they praise a fountain in my garden here    wherein a naiad sends the waterbow    thin from her tube she smiles to see it rise    what if i told her it is just

thought the gone thing was to go        60    never to be again but many more of the kind      as good nay better perchance is this your comfort to me    to me who must be saved because i cling with

fullness of the days have we withered or agonized    why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence      why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized    sorrow is

pinned him to earth with my weight    and persistence of hate    and he lay would not moan would not curse    as his lot might be worse                                         10   iii     were the object less mean would he stand    at the swing of my hand    for obscurity helps him and blots    the hole where he squats    so i set my five wits on the stretch                               15    to inveigle the wretch    all in vain gold and jewels i threw    still he couched there perdue    i tempted his blood and his flesh    hid in roses my mesh

                30    no i could not but smile through my chafe    for the fellow lay safe    as his mates do the midge and the nit      through minuteness to wit   v     then a humor more great took

creephole with never a break                          55    ran my fires for his sake    overhead did my thunder combine    with my underground mine    till i looked from my labor content    to enjoy

see just my vengeance complete    the man sprang to his feet                                        70    stood erect caught at gods skirts and prayed    so i was afraid     the italian in england      that second time they hunted me    from hill to plain from shore to sea    and austria hounding far and wide    her bloodhounds through the countryside    breathed hot and instant on my trace                              5    i made six days a hidingplace    of that dry green old aqueduct    where i and charles when boys have plucked    the fireflies from the roof above    bright creeping through the moss they love                        10    how long it seems since charles was lost    six days the soldiers crossed and crossed    the country in my very sight    and when that peril ceased at night    the sky broke out in red dismay                                    15    with signal fires well there i lay    close covered oer in my recess    up to the neck in ferns and cress    thinking of metternich our friend    and charless miserable end                                       20    and much beside two days the third    hunger oercame me when i heard    the peasants from the village go    to work among the maize you know    with us in lombardy they bring                                    25    provisions packed on mules a string    with little bells that cheer their task    and casks and boughs on every cask    to keep the suns heat from the wine    these i let pass in jingling line                                 30    and close on them dear noisy crew    the peasants from the village too    for at the very rear would troop    their wives and sisters in a group    to help i knew when these had passed                            35    i threw my glove to strike the last    taking the chance she did not start    much less cry out but stooped apart    one instant rapidly glanced round    and saw me beckon from the ground                                 40    a wild bush grows and hides my crypt    she picked my glove up while she stripped    a branch off then rejoined the rest    with that my glove lay in her breast    then i drew breath they disappeared                              45    it was for italy i feared         an hour and she returned alone    exactly where my glove was thrown    meanwhile came many thoughts on me    rested the hopes of italy                                         50    i had devised a certain tale    which when twas told her could not fail    persuade a peasant of its truth    i meant to call a freak of youth    this hiding and give hopes of pay                                55    and no temptation to betray    but when i saw that womans face    its calm simplicity of grace    our italys own attitude    in which she walked thus far and stood                           60    planting each naked foot so firm    to crush the snake and spare the worm    at first sight of her eyes i said    i am that man upon whose head    they fix the price because i hate                                 65    the austrians over us the state    will give you goldoh gold so much    if you betray me to their clutch    and be your death

harm should follow    unless i spoke their lesson to the end    but harm to me i thought she meant not you                     150    your friendsnatalia said they were your friends    and meant you wellbecause i doubted it    observing what was very strange to see    on every face so different in all else    the same smile girls like me are used to bear                    155    but never men men cannot stoop so low    yet your friends speaking of you used that smile    that hateful smirk of boundless selfconceit    which seems to take possession of the world    and make of god a tame confederate                               160    purveyor to their appetitesyou know    but still natalia said they were your friends    and they assented though they smiled the more    and all came round methat thin englishman    with light lank hair seemed leader of the rest                   165    he held a paperwhat we want said he    ending some explanation to his friends    is something

as in the apples core the noisome fly    for insects on the rind are seen at once    and brushed aside as soon but this is found    only when on the lips or loathing tongue                        175    and so he read what i have got by heart    ill speak itdo not die love i am yours    nois not that or like that part of words    yourself began by speaking strange to lose    what cost such pains to learn is this more right                180             i am a painter who cannot paint            in my life a devil rather than saint            in my brain as poor a creature too            no end to all i cannot do            yet do one thing at least i can                       185            love a man or hate a man            supremely thus my lore began            through the valley of love i went            in the lovingest spot to abide            and just on the verge where i pitched my tent          190            i found hate dwelling beside            let the bridegroom ask

go on without a word             so i grew wise in love and hate                        205            from simple that i was of late            once when i loved i would enlace            breast eyelids hands feet form and face            of her i loved in one embrace            as if by mere love i could love immensely              210            once when i hated i would plunge            my sword and wipe with the first lunge            my foes whole life out like a sponge            as if by mere hate i could hate intensely            but now i am wiser know better the fashion

valley of love            the nest or the nook in hates grove                  220            where my soul may surely reach            the essence naught less of each            the hate of all hates

disguised            in hate and when hate is surprised            in love then i hate most ask            how love smiles through hates iron casque             230            hate grins through loves rosebraided mask            and how having hated thee            i sought long and painfully            to reach thy heart nor prick            the skin but pierce to the quick

monsignor thanks friends many thanks i chiefly    desire life now that i may recompense every one of you    most i know something of already what a repast prepared    benedicto benedicaturugh ugh where was    i oh as you were remarking ugo the weather is                   5    mild very unlike winter weather but i am a sicilian you    know and shiver in your julys here to be sure when    twas full summer at messina as we priests used to cross    in procession the great square on assumption day you    might see our thickest yellow tapers twist suddenly in             10    two each like a falling star or sink down on themselves    in a gore of wax but go my friends but go to the    intendant not you ugo the others leave the apartment    i have long wanted to converse with you ugo     intendant uguccio                                             15     monsignor  guccio stefani man of ascoli    fermo and fossombrunowhat i do need instructing    about are these accounts of your administration of my    poor brothers affairs ugh i shall never get through a    third part of your accounts take some of these dainties           20    before we attempt it however are you bashful to that    degree for me a crust and water suffice     intendant do you choose this especial night to question    me     monsignor this night ugo you have managed my                  25    late brothers affairs since the death of our elder brother    fourteen years and a month all but three days on    the third of december i find him     intendant if you have so intimate an acquaintance    with your brothers affairs you will be tender of turning         30    so far back they will hardly bear looking into so far back     monsignor aye aye ugh ughnothing but disappointments    here below i remark a considerable payment    made to yourself on this third of december talk    of disappointments there was a young fellow here                 35    jules a foreign sculptor i did my utmost to advance that    the church might be a gainer by us both he was going    on hopefully enough and of a sudden he notifies to me    some marvelous change that has happened in his notions    of art heres his letter he never had a clearly conceived       40    ideal within his brain till today yet since his hand    could manage a chisel he has practiced expressing other    mens ideals and in the very perfection he has attained    to he foresees an ultimate failure his unconscious hand    will pursue its prescribed course of old years and will           45         reproduce    with a fatal expertness the ancient types let the    novel one appear never so palpably to his spirit there    is but one method of escape confiding the virgin type to    as chaste a hand he will turn painter instead of sculptor    and paint not carve its characteristicsstrike out i          50    dare say a school like correggio how think you ugo     intendant is correggio a painter     monsignor foolish jules and yet after all why    foolish he mayprobably willfail egregiously but    if there should arise a new painter will it not be in some        55    such way by a poet now or a musician spirits who have    conceived and perfected an ideal through some other    channel transferring it to this and escaping our conventional    roads by pure ignorance of them eh ugo if    you have no appetite talk at least ugo                          60     intendant sir i can submit no longer to this course    of yours first you select the group of which i formed    onenext you thin it graduallyalways retaining me    with your smileand so do you proceed till you have    fairly got me alone with you between four stone walls             65    and now then let this farce this chatter end now    what is it you want with me     monsignor ugo     intendant from the instant you arrived i felt your    smile on me as you questioned me about this and the                70    other article in those paperswhy your brother should    have given me this villa that podereand your nod at    the end meantwhat     monsignor possibly that i wished for no loud talk    here if once you set me coughing ugo                          75     intendant i have your brothers hand and seal to all i    possess now ask me what for what service i did himask me     monsignor i would better not i should rip up old    disgraces let out my poor brothers weaknesses by the            80    way maffeo of forli which i forgot to observe is    your true name was the interdict ever taken off you    for robbing that church at cesena     intendant no nor needs be for when i murdered    your brothers friend pasquale for him                         85     monsignor ah he employed you in that business    did he well i must let you keep as you say this villa    and that podere for fear the world should find out my    relations were of so indifferent a stamp maffeo my family    is the oldest in messina and century after century                90    have my progenitors gone on polluting themselves with    every wickedness under heaven my own fatherrest his    souli have i know a chapel to support that it may    rest my dear two dead brothers werewhat you know    tolerably well i the youngest might have rivaled them           95    in vice if not in wealth but from my boyhood i came    out from among them and so am not partaker of their    plagues my glory springs from another source or if    from this by contrast onlyfor i the bishop am the    brother of your employers ugo i hope to repair some             100    of their wrong however so far as my brothers illgotten    treasure reverts to me i can stop the consequences    of his crimeand not one soldo shall escape me maffeo    the sword we quiet men spurn away you shrewd knaves    pick up and commit murders with what opportunities               105    the virtuous forego the villainous seize because to    pleasure myself apart from other considerations my    food would be milletcake my dress sackcloth and my    couch strawam i therefore to let you the offscouring    of the earth seduce the poor and ignorant by appropriating       110    a pomp these will be sure to think lessens the abominations    so unaccountably and exclusively associated with    it must i let villas and poderi go to you a murderer    and thief that you may beget by means of them other    murderers and thieves noif my cough would but                  115    allow me to speak     intendant what am i to expect you are going to punish me     monsignor must punish you maffeo i cannot    afford to cast away a chance i have whole centuries of    sin to redeem and only a month or two of life to do it in       120    how should i dare to say     intendant forgive us our trespasses     monsignor my friend it is because i avow myself a    very worm sinful beyond measure that i reject a line of    conduct you would applaud perhaps shall i proceed               125    as it were apardoningiwho have no symptom    of reason to assume that aught less than my strenuousest    efforts will keep myself out of mortal sin much less    keep others out no i do trespass but will not double    that by allowing you to trespass                                 130     intendant and suppose the villas are not your    brothers to give nor yours to take oh you are hasty    enough just now     monsignor 1 2no 3aye can you read the substance    of a letter no 3 i have received from rome it                 135    is precisely on the ground there mentioned of the suspicion    i have that a certain child of my late elder brother who    would have succeeded to his estates was murdered in    infancy by you maffeo at the instigation of my late    younger brotherthat the pontiff enjoins on me not               140    merely the bringing that maffeo to condign punishment    but the taking all pains as guardian of the infants heritage    for the church to recover it parcel by parcel howsoever    whensoever and wheresoever while you are now    gnawing those fingers the police are engaged in sealing          145    up your papers maffeo and the mere raising my voice    brings my people from the next room to dispose of yourself    but i want you to confess quietly and save me raising    my voice why man do i not know the old story    the heir between the succeeding heir and this heirs             150    ruffianly instrument and their complots effect and the    life of fear and bribes and ominous smiling silence did    you throttle or stab my brothers infant come now     intendant so old a story and tell it no better    when did such an instrument ever produce such an                  155    effect either the child smiles in his face or

five parts each of which describes an important period in the experience of paracelsus the celebrated germanswiss physician alchemist and philosopher of the sixteenth century book i tells of the eagerness and pride with which he set out in his youth to compass all knowledge he believed himself commissioned of god to learn truth and to give it to mankind books ii and iii show him followed and idolized by multitudes to whom he imparts the fragments of knowledge he has gained but though these fragments seem to his disciples the sum and substance of wisdom his own mind is preoccupied with a desolating certainty that he has hardly touched on the outer confines of truth in book iv after experiencing the ingratitude of his fickle adherents he is represented as abjuring the dreams of his youth at this point comes the first of the three songs given in the text he builds an imaginary altar on which he offers up the aspirations the hopes the plans with which he had begun his career   song i  13 cassia is an unidentified fragrant plant the wood of the sandal tree is also fragrant labdanum or ladanum is a resinous gum of dark color and pungent odor exuding from various species of the cistus a plant found around the mediterranean aloeballs are made from a bitter resinous juice extracted from the leaves of aloeplants nard is an ointment made from an aromatic plant and used in the east indies these substances have long been traditionally associated in literature in psalms xlv 8 we read all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad milton in paradise lost v 293 speaks of flowering odors cassia nard and balms  4 such balsam the meaning of ii 48 is obscure seaside mountain pedestals are presumably cliffs in the tops of the trees on these cliffs the wind weary of its rough work on the ocean has gently dropped the fragrant things it has swept up from the island  916 in this stanza the faint sweetness from the spices used in embalming and the perfume still clinging to the tapestry in an ancient royal room carry suggestions of vanished power and beauty that add an appropriate pathos to the richly piled altar on which paracelsus is to offer up the lovely fancies of his youth shredded is a transferred epithet referring really to arras but transferred to the perfume of the arras   song ii book iv  when paracelsus confesses the failure of his pursuit of absolute knowledge his friend festus urges him to redeem the past by making new use of what he has gained but paracelsus has no courage to attempt a reorganization of his life in accordance with a new ideal his answer to festus is the second of the three songs he afterwards calls it     the sad rhyme of the men who proudly clung    to their first fault and withered in their pride  the song is a beautiful and clear allegory vivid in its pictures rapid and musical   song iii book v  in book v paracelsus is described as lying ill in the hospital of st sebastian festus is endeavoring to divert the current of his dying friends fierce delirious thoughts into a gentler channel he brings up one picture after another of the early happy life of paracelsus and dwells on the grandeur of his mind and achievements and on the fame that shall be his but the desired peace comes only when festus sings the song of the river mayne beside which their youth had been spent at the end of the song paracelsus exclaims     my heart they loose my heart those simple words    its darkness passes which naught else could touch  the mayne or main is the most important of the righthand tributaries of the rhine wurzburg where festus and paracelsus had been as students is on its banks its university was especially noted for its medical department mr stopford brooke the poetry of robert browning p 99 says of this lovely lyric i have driven through that gracious country of low hill and dale and wide watermeadows where under flowered banks only a foot high the slow river winds in gentleness and this poem is steeped in the sentiment of the scenery but as before browning quickly slides away from the beauty of inanimate nature into a record of the animals that haunt the streams he could not get on long with mountains and rivers alone he must people them with breathing feeling things anything for life   cavalier tunes  these three stirring songs represent the gay reckless loyalty of the cavaliers to the cause of king charles i and their contempt for his puritan opposers the puritans wore closely cropped hair hence the parliament which came together in 1640 and was controlled by the opponents of the king is dubbed cropheaded john pym and john hampden were leaders in the struggle against the tyranny of the king hazelrig fiennes and young sir henry vane were also adherents of oliver cromwell rupert prince of the palatinate was a nephew of charles i and was a noted cavalry leader on the royal side during the civil war the followers of the king unfurled the royal standard at nottingham in august 1642 kentish sir byng raised a troop and hurried on to join the main royal army in september occurred the battle of edgehill the noll l 16 of give a rouse is oliver cromwell the third song was entitled originally my wife gertrude it was she who held the castle of brancepeth against the roundheads   the lost leader  this poem indignantly records a poets defection from the cause of progress and liberty who this poet might be was for some time a matter of conjecture wordsworth southey and charles kingsley all of whom had gone from radicalism in their youth to conservatism in their old age were severally proposed as the original of brownings portrait the poem was published in 1845 two years after wordsworth was made poet laureate early in 1845 wordsworth was presented at court a proceeding which aroused commentsometimes amused sometimes indignantfrom those who recalled the poets early scorn of rank and titles browning and miss barrett exchanged several gay letters on this subject in may 1845 in commenting on a letter from miss martineau describing wordsworth in his home in 1846 browning wrote did not shelley say long ago he had no more imagination than a pintpotthough in those days he used to walk about france and flanders like a man now he is most comfortable in his worldly affairs and just this comes of it he lives the best twenty years of his life after the way of his own heartand when one presses in to see the result of his rare experimentwhat the one alchemist whom fortune has allowed to get all his coveted materials and set to work at last with fire and melting potwhat he produces after all the talk of him and the like of him why you get pulvis et cinisa man at the mercy of the tongs and shovel in later life however browning spoke of wordsworth in a different tone in a letter to mr grosart written feb 24 1875 he said i have been asked the question you now address me with and as duly answered i cant remember how many times there is no sort of objection to one more assurance or rather confession on my part that i did in my hasty youth presume to use the great and venerated personality of wordsworth as a sort of painters model one from which this or the other particular feature may be selected and turned to account had i intended moreabove all such a boldness as portraying the entire mani should not have talked about handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon these never influenced the change of politics in the great poetwhose defection nevertheless accompanied as it was by a regular faceabout of his special party was to my private apprehension and even mature consideration an event to deplore but just as in the tapestry on my wall i can recognize figures which have struck out a fancy on occasion that though truly enough thus derived yet would be preposterous as a copy so though i dare not deny the original of my little poem i altogether refuse to have it considered as the very effigies of such a moral and intellectual superiority for an interesting parallelism in theme see whittiers ichabod  20 whom the reference is to the lower classes whom the liberals were endeavoring to rouse to aspiration and action the conservatives opposed such beginnings of independence  29 best fight on well it is the deserting leader who is exhorted to fight well though it is pain to have him desert their party they have gloried in his power and it would be an even greater pain to see him weak they wish him to fight well even though their cause is thereby menaced   how they brought the good news from ghent to aix  this poem was written during mr brownings first journey to italy in 1838 he sailed from london in a merchant vessel bound for trieste on which he found himself the only passenger the weather was stormy and for the first fortnight browning was extremely ill as they passed through the straights of gibraltar the captain supported him upon deck that he might not lose the sight of the composition of the poem he says i wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the african coast after i had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain good horse york there in my stable at home the poem was written in pencil on the flyleaf of bartolis simboli a favorite book of his browning says that there was no sort of historical foundation for the story but the pacification of ghent in 1576 has been suggested as an appropriate background the incident narrated could naturally belong to the efforts of the united cities of holland zealand and the southern netherlands to combat the tyranny of philip ii  6 of this line miss barrett wrote it drew us out into the night as witnesses  13 twas moonset the distance from ghent to aix is something over a hundred miles the first horse gave out at hasselt about eighty miles from ghent the second horse failed at dalhem in sight of aix roland made the whole

schafnaburgensis a companion poem appeared in hoods magazine july 1844 under the title of garden fancies the flowers name is a description of a garden by a lover whose conception of its beauty is heightened and made vital by the memories it enshrines of this poem miss barrett wrote to browning then the garden fanciessome of the stanzas about the name of the flower with such exquisite music in

is speaking the him in l 3 must refer to the sun in any case after the isolation with the woman he loved as described in the first poem there comes with the morning a sense of the world of action to which the man must return the two poems are fully discussed in poetlore volume vii april may junejuly the poems are noteworthy for the fusion of human emotion and natural scenery and for the startlingly specific phrasing of the first quatrain   evelyn hope  in this lyric are embodied brownings faith in personal immortality his belief in the permanence of true love and in the value of love though unrequited in this world  34 what meant from this point on through line 52 the lover repeats what he shall say to evelyn hope when in the life to come he claims her   love among the ruins  a man is on his way across the fields to a turret where he is to meet the girl he loves as he walks through the solitary pastures he mentally recreates the powerful life and varied interests of the city which tradition has it once occupied this site and he seems to be absorbed in a melancholy recognition of the evanescence of human glory the girl is not mentioned till stanza 5 does the emphasis on the scenery and its historic associations unduly minimize the love element of the poem or is the whole picture of vanished joy and woe pride and defeat but a background against which stands out more clearly the rapture of the meeting in the ruined turret  80 earths returns this phrase refers to the ruins which are all that now remains of the centuries of folly noise and sin them in l 81 refers apparently to the fighters and the others of the first part of the stanza   up at a villadown in the city  it is an admirable piece of work crowded with keen descriptions of nature in the casentino and of life in the streets of florence and every piece of description is so filled with the character of the italian person of quality who describes thema petulant humorous easily angered happy observant ignorant poor gentlemanthat browning entirely disappears the poem retains for us in its verse and indeed in its light rhythm the childlikeness the naïveté the simple pleasures the ignorance and the honest boredom with the solitudes of natureof a whole class of italians not only of the time when it was written but of the present day it is a delightful inventive piece of gay and pictorial humor stopford brooke the poetry of browning p 322  33 corn in great britain the word is generally applied to wheat rye oats and barley not to maize as in america  34 stinking hemp in chapter i of james lane allens the reign of law is the following passage on the odor of the hempfield and now borne far through the steaming air floats an odor balsamic startling the odor of those plumes and stalks and blossoms from which is exuding freely the narcotic resin of the great nettle when the long swaths of cut hemp lies across the field the smell is represented as strongest impregnating the

some central musical theme as is the sonata or soundpiece the toccata in its early and pure form possessed no decided subject made such by repetition but bore rather the form of a capricious improvisation or impromptu a toccata of galuppis by mrs alexander ireland published in london browning society papers  1 galuppi baldassare galuppi 17061784 was an italian composer born near venice he

piano  1930 the musical terms in these lines show brownings knowledge of the technicalities of the art to one without such expert knowledge the exact musical connotation is doubtless obscure but the epithets and phrases are in themselves sufficient to suggest the varying moods of the venetian merrymakers the plaintiveness the sighs the sense of death the trembling hope that life may last the renewed lovemaking the new round of futile pleasures or evil deeds the end of it all in the grave are clearly brought forth an elaborate explanation of the musical terms is given in the notes to the camberwell edition of brownings poems  31 but when i sit down to reason the first thirty lines of the poem have recorded the effect of the music in recreating in the poets imagination the gay careless life of eighteenth century venice and its close in death now when the poet endeavors to turn from that picture of death lurking under smiles he finds that the cold music has filled his mind with an inescapable sense of the futility of life and even his own chosen mental activities seem to him along with the rest hardly more than dust and ashes ambition and enthusiasm fade before the spell of the music   old pictures in florence  3 aloed arch the genus aloe includes trees shrubs and herbs the american variety is the centuryplant brownings hillside villa evidently had aloes trained to grow in

development of art is not yet understood it must be made clear browning thinks that painters like leonardo da vinci 14521519 come in natural succession from earlier obscure artists like dello that art

representing the subtler activities of the soul lines 145152 state the ideals that actuated the new art the reference is to the religious art of the italian renaissance  115144 these lines sum up the reasons for the importance of the art that strives to bring the invisible full into play l 150 it may be roughhewn and faulty but it is greater and grander than greek art because of its greater range variety and complexity and because it reaches beyond any possible present perfection into eternity  134 thy one work  done at a stroke giotto when asked for a proof of his skill to send to the pope

effects in the poem the use of a light semijocose form to give the greater emphasis to serious subjectmatter is characteristic of browning lowell in a fable for critics employs the same device  161176

quality of the birds song is rivaled only by wilson flaggs the bobolink quoted in john burroughss birds and poets and wordsworths to the cuckoo   homethoughts from the sea  this poem and the preceding one express two phases of the poets love of country his affection for the physical beauty of england and his pride in her political freedom in the first poem he turns in thought from the glowing color of italy to the more delicate loveliness of england in april in the second poem he longs to repay the service his country has rendered him in defeating foreign foes  homethoughts from the sea was

most often attributed to a snake is malignancy but in this picture of the serpent lying dormant and waiting for the sloughing of its old skin in the springtime when it will come forth with new beauty and power the idea presented is that of tremendous force temporarily in abeyance  42 then the tune the boy alone in the field tries all sorts of experiments in musical attraction on the animals about him professor albert s cook suggests that browning is here indebted to the greek pastoral romance of daphnis and chloe see smiths translation in the bohn edition the passages read in part as follows he ran through all variations of pastoral melody he played the tune which the oxen obey and which attracts the goatsthat in which the sheep delight  he took his pipe from his scrip and breathed into it very gently the goats stood still merely lifting up their heads next he played the pasture tune upon which they all put down their heads and began to graze now he produced some notes soft and sweet in tone at once his herd lay down after this he piped in a sharp key and they ran off to the woods as if a wolf were in sight these quotations serve at least to show how old is the fancy that animals

rage is like the earthquake that may tear open the rock but at the same time sets the gold free his final release from the evil spirit is described by the sudden fall of the avalanche from the

change in the direction of davids thought up to stanza x it was the glorious past that he had been urging upon sauls attention but now he realizes that true inspiration comes not so much from a reliving of ones achievements as from the thought of the permanence of ones fame and ones deeds  192 and behold while i sang at this point david is overcome by the memory of the sudden spiritual illumination that came to him in his interview with saul he had reached the summit of his endeavor l 191 and yet knew himself powerless to give the king new life then there flashed upon him the truth expressed in stanzas xviixix he breaks off in lines 192205 going in his strong feeling ahead of his story and commenting on what is described in stanza xix in stanza xv he resumes his narrative  204

the thought that had come to david was that god had proved supreme in all the ways in which a human being could test knowledge and power but that in the one way of love the creature might surpass the creator at line 302 he has come to believe in the infinitude of gods love as well as in the infinitude of his power it is interesting to note that george eliot in silas marner gives to ignorant dolly winthrop an experience and a philosophy of life almost identical with those of brownings david  307312 a prophecy of the revelation of the divine in the human the coming of god in the person of christ it is the human in the divine that men seek and love in the old testament days such an idea though foretold and longed for could be but vaguely conceived except in moments of especial insight in the minds of poetprophets like david mr herford robert browning p 120 says of this passage  david is occupied with no speculative question but with the practical problem of saving a ruined soul and neither logical ingenuity nor divine suggestion but the inherent spiritual significance of the situation urges his thought along the lonely path of prophecy the love for the old king which prompted him to try all the hidden paths of his soul in quest of healing becomes a lighted torch by which he tracks out the meaning of the world and the still unrevealed purposes of god until the energy of thought culminates in vision and the christ stands full before his eyes  313335 in this stanza david represents all existences good and evil spirits all animals all forms of nature as stirred by the

ancient times the seat of many cities it is now dotted with ruins there is a solemnity and beauty about the campagna entirely its own to the reflective mind this ghost of old rome is full of suggestion its vast almost limitless extent as it seems to the traveler its abundant herbage and floral wealth in early spring its desolation its crumbling monuments and its evidences of a vanished

which he fancifully pursues from point to point in the surrounding landscape finds statement in lines 3460 of these lines sharp life of browning p 159 says there is a gulf which not the profoundest search can fathom which not the strongestwinged love can overreach the gulf of individuality it is those who have loved most deeply who recognize most acutely this always pathetic and often terrifying isolation of the soul none save the weak can believe in the absolute union of two spirits  no man no poet assuredly could love as browning loved and fail to be aware often with vague anger and bitterness no doubt of this insuperable isolation even when spirit seemed to leap to spirit in the touch of a kiss in the evanishing sigh of some one or other exquisite moment   in three days  another poem of waiting love is in three days and this has the spirit of a true love lyric in it it reads like a personal thing it breathes exaltation it is quick hurried and thrilled the delicate fears of chance and changes in the three days or in the years to come belong of right and nature to the waiting and are subtly varied and condensed it is however the thoughtful love of a man who can be

course more rapidly and freely   a grammarians funeral  the revival of learning the revival of learning or the renaissance began as early as the tenth century its period of most rapid progress was from the twelfth century to the fifteenth one phase of the interest in the revival of learning was the effort to restore latin to its ancient purity the word grammarian was more widely inclusive than now meaning one who devoted himself to general learning of this poem dr burton in renaissance pictures in browning poetlore vol x pp 6076 no 1 1898 says i know of no lyric of the poets more representative of his peculiar and virile strength than this in that it makes vibrant and thoroughly emotional an apparently unemotional theme in relation to the renaissance the revival of learning the moral is the higher inspiration derived from the new wine of the classics so that what in later times has cooled down too often to a dryasdust study of the husks of knowledge is shown to be at the start a veritable reveling in the delights of the fruit  mr stopford brooke in the poetry of browning p 155 says this is the artist at work and i doubt whether all the laborious prose written in history and criticism on the revival of learning will ever express better than this short poem the inexhaustible thirst of the renaissance in its pursuit of knowledge or the enthusiasm of the pupils of a new scholar for his desperate strife to know in a short life the very center of the universe  3 leave we the common crofts as the procession starts up the hill they leave behind them the small

of spiritual insight  129 hoti  oun  de points in greek grammar concerning which there was much learned discussion   childe roland to the dark tower came  mrs orr handbook of brownings works p 274 says of this poem we can connect no idea of definite pursuit or attainment with a series of facts so dreamlike and so disjointed still less extract from it a definite moral and we are reduced to taking the poem as a simple work of fancy built up of picturesque impressions which have separately or collectively produced themselves in the authors mind and she adds in a note i may venture to state that these picturesque materials included a tower which mr browning once saw in the carrara mountains a painting which caught his eye years later in paris and the figure of a horse in the tapestry in his own drawingroomwelded together in the remembrance of the line from king lear which forms the heading of the poem the possible allegorical signification of the poem has been the subject of much and often of singularly futile discussion dr furnivall said he had asked browning if it was an allegory and in answer had on three separate occasions received an emphatic statement that it was simply a dramatic creation called forth by a line of shaksperes porterclarke study programmes p 406 yet allegorical interpretations continue to be made according to one line of interpretation the pilgrim is a truthseeker misdirected by the lying spirit the hoary cripple and when he blows the slughorn it is as a warning to others that he has failed in his quest and that the way to the dark tower is the way of destruction and death berdoe browning cyclopædia p 105 according to other readings of the tale the blast which the pilgrim blows at the end of his quest is one of spiritual victory and incitement to others when the rev john s chadwick visited the poet and asked him if constancy to an idealhe that endureth to the end shall be savedwas not a sufficient understanding of the central purpose of the poem browning said yes just about that with constancy to an ideal as the central purpose the details of this poem without being minutely interpreted may yet serve as a representation of the depression the hopelessness the dullness and deadness of soul the doubt and terror even of the man who travels the last stages of a difficult journey to a longsought but unknown goal his victory consists in the unfaltering persistence of his search the squat tower when he reaches it is prosaic and ugly but finding it is after all not the essential point the essential element of his success is that encircled by the last temptations to despair he holds heart and brain steady and carries out his quest to its last detail see an article in the critic may 3 1886 by mr arlo bates in opposition to any definite allegory mr nettleship in robert browning p 89 devotes a chapter to a paraphrase and an allegorical explanation  mr herford life of browning p 94 calls the poem a great romantic legend and emphasizes its intensity and boldness of invention he compares its horrorworld with that of coleridge in the ancient mariner what the ancient mariner is in the poetry of the mysterious terrors and splendors of the sea that childe roland is in the poetry of bodeful horror of haunted desolation of waste and plague ragged distortion and rotting ugliness in landscape the childe like the mariner advances through an atmosphere and scenery of steadily gathering menace  mr chesterton says of the scenery it is  the poetry of the shabby and hungry aspect of the earth itself daring poets who wished to escape from the conventional gardens and orchards had long been in the habit of celebrating the poetry of rugged and gloomy landscapes but browning is not content with this he insists on celebrating the poetry of mean landscapes that sense of scrubbiness in nature as of a man unshaved had never been conveyed with this enthusiasm and primeval gusto before robert browning p 159   how it strikes a contemporary  this poem is the story of an obscure poet in the spanish city of valladolid it brings out his actual life and the townfolks misinterpretations of it reports multiply upon themselves and take new meanings till the harmless poet is generally accounted the kings spy and the real agent of all royal edicts the towns master in fact the interest which as a poet he takes in all manifestations of life is popularly supposed to be the alertness of a secret agent of the government the reams of poetry he writes are transformed into letters of information to the king rumor

came they declared that such homage to the perishable clay was a mere devils game the business of the painter they said was to ignore the body and paint the soul  184 mans soul note the difficulty the

followed good authority in making masaccio a pupil of fra lippo lippi but in point of fact he was probably the master whose works fra lippo studied lübke history of art ii 207 says of guidi in his exceedingly short life he rapidly traversed the various stages of development of earlier art and pressed on with a bold confidence to a greatness and power of vision which have rendered his works the characteristic ones of an epoch and his example a decisive influence in all the art of the fifteenth century almost every master in the fifteenth century  studied these great works and learned from them one of the first of these masters was fra lippo lippi the important point is that fra lippo and masaccio were both pioneers in the new art which took infinite pains in the representation of the body masaccio is said to have been the first italian artist to paint a nude figure  323 a saint laurence  at prato prato a town near florence attracted many artists in the fifteenth century so that

of his flowering manhood when the bright and buoyant genius in him had free play and large delight in its handiwork when the fresh interest of invention was still his and the dramatic sense the pleasure in the play of life the power of motion and variety before the old strength of sight and of flight had passed from weary wing and clouding eye the old pride and energy of enjoyment had gone

matter of art with which we are specially concerned there is hardly a principle connected with the medieval temper that he has not struck upon in these seemingly careless and too rugged lines of his i

paul lines 1158 give an account of the achievements of cleon a man who has attained eminence in the various realms of poetry philosophy painting and sculpture he is not in any one accomplishment equal

ago as an organist and a composer he founded three schools of music one at mannheim one at stockholm and one at darmstadt he was especially noted for his organ recitals as many as 7000 tickets having been sold for a single recital in amsterdam in 1798 it was said that he had then given over a thousand organ concerts his knowledge of acoustics and his consequent skill in combining the stops enabled him to bring much power and variety from organs with fewer pipes than were generally considered necessary the remodeling and simplification of organs was one of his most eagerly pursued activities he not only rearranged the pipes but he introduced free reeds through some skillful swedish organbuilders he was at last enabled to have an organ small enough to be portable and constructed according to his ideas this he called an orchestrion of voglers power as an organist rinck says his organ playing was grand effective in the utmost degree it was however when he was improvising that his power was most astonishing once at a musical soirée vogler and beethoven extemporized alternately each giving the other a theme and gansbacher records the pitch of enthusiasm to which he was roused by voglers masterly playing three of voglers most famous pupils at darmstadt were meyerbeer gansbacher and carl maria von weber the last of these gives an attractive picture of the musician extemporizing in the old church at darmstadt never says weber did vogler in his extemporization drink more deeply at the source of all beauty than when before his three dear boys as he liked to call us he drew from the organ angelic voices and word of thunder brownings poem records the experiences of the musician in one of these moods of rapturous creation  the argument of the poem is thus given by mr stopford brooke in the poetry of robert browning page 149  when solomon pronounced the name of god all the spirits good and bad assembled to do his will and build his palace and when i abt vogler touched the keys i called the spirits of sound to me and they have built my palace of music and to inhabit it all the great dead came back till in the vision i made a perfect music nay for a moment i touched in it the infinite perfection but now it is gone i cannot bring it back had i painted it had i written it i might have explained it but in music out of the sounds something emerges which is above the sounds and that ineffable thing i touched and lost i took the wellknown sounds of earth and out of them came a fourth sound nay not a soundbut a star this was a flash of gods will which opened the eternal to me for a moment and i shall find it again in the eternal life therefore from the achievement of earth and the failure of it i turn to god and in him i see that every image thought impulse and dream of knowledge or beautywhich coming whence we know not flit before us in human life breathe for a moment and then depart which like my music build a sudden palace in imagination which abide for an instant and dissolve but which memory and hope retain as a ground of aspirationare not lost to us though they seem to die in their immediate passage their music has its home in the will of god and we shall find them completed there  3 solomon in jewish legend it is said that solomon had power over angels and demons through a seal on which the most great name of god was engraved  13 and one would bury his brow this description of the foundations of the palace is not unlike miltons account of the work of the fallen angels in building the palace in hell paradise lost i 170 that fabric huge

comes back to everyday life proud because of the vision that has been granted him but with a consciousness that experiences so exalted are not for human natures daily food and that their true function is to send one back to ordinary pains and pleasures with a new acquiescence  in the browning society papers are mrs turnbulls abt vogler and three papers by miss helen omerod 1 abt vogler the man 2 some notes on brownings poems relating to music 3 andrea del sarto and abt vogler   rabbi ben ezra  ben ezra was an eminent jewish rabbi of the middle ages his commentaries on the books of the old testament are of great value mr a j campbell who has studied brownings poem in connection with the writings of the real rabbi ben ezra thinks that the distinctive features of the rabbi of the poem and the philosophy ascribed to him were drawn from the works of the historical rabbi the keynote of whose teaching was that the essential life of man is the life of the soul and that age is more important than youth berdoe browning cyclopædia cf also berdoe brownings message to his times pp 157172  1 grow old along with me cf saul lines 161162 see matthew arnolds tis time to grow old for a beautiful statement of the pessimistic attitude toward old age  715 it would be folly says the rabbi to object to the unreasoning ambitions the fluctuations of desire the hopes and fears of youth in fact ll 1630 he counts these very aspirations toward the impossible this very state of mental and spiritual unrest and doubt a proof of the spark of divinity which separates men from beasts and allies them to god it is a characteristic browning doctrine that conflict struggle the pangs and throes of learning are the stimuli through which character develops  4042 cf saul l 295  4972 in lines 4348 the rabbi had urged the subservience of the body to the soul but in these lines he shows that the life of the flesh is not to be underestimated that ideal progress comes from a just alliance of the soul and the body see tennysons st simeon stylites for an account of the ascetic ideal in its lowest form  81 adventure brave and new in prospice death is reckoned an adversary to be courageously met and overcome here the rabbi is represented as fearless and unperplexed as he contemplates the new life he will lead after death in both poems we find unquestioning belief in an active and progressive and happy life after death  85 youth ended i shall try etc compare tennysons by an evolutionist  87 leave the fire ashes in this figure the fire stands for the conflicts of life the gold for whatever has proved of permanent worth and the ashes for whatever has failed to stand the test of time and experience  92 a certain moment the moment between the fading of the sunset glory and the shutting down of evening darkness is here selected as the moment in which to appraise the work of the day in the application of the simile to the life of man lines 97102 the moment apparently refers to old age when man has leisure and wisdom to appraise the past  102 the future the life of his adventure brave and new after death  109111 in old pictures in florence browning applies this idea to the development of art as soon as men were content to repose in the perfection of greek art the thing found made stagnation ensued the new life of art came when men strove for something new and original even though their first attempts were crude acts uncouth  120 nor let thee feel alone the solitude of age gives a chance for unhampered thought  133150 one of the things he has learned is that any judgment to be fair must take into account instincts efforts desires as well as accomplishment  151186 this metaphor of the wheel is found in isaiah lxiv 8 jeremiah xviii 26 romans ix 21 throughout this metaphor as browning uses it man seems to be passive clay in the hands of the potter and under the power of the machinery the potter uses to give the soul its bent the tone of the whole poem is however one of strenuous endeavor ardor effort progress are the keynotes of life from youth to age but life is finally counted a divine training for the service of god and in this training the pious rabbi sees joined the will of man and the care and guidance of god  157 all that is etc cf abt vogler ll 6980   caliban upon setebos  the idea of this poem was evolved from shaksperes caliban a strange misshapen fishlike being one of the servants of prospero in the tempest he was the son of a foul witch who had potent ministers and could control moon and tides but could not undo her own hateful sorceries and who worshiped a god called setebos morally shaksperes caliban was insensible to kindness had bestial passions was cowardly vengeful superstitious he had keen animal instincts and knew the island well he understood prospero in some measure learned to talk to know the stars to compose poetry and took pleasure in music  thou thoughtest etc a quotation from psalms 1 21 this sentence is the keynote of calibans theological speculations  1 will for he will instead of i will through most of the poem caliban speaks of himself in the third person as a child does but note lines 6897 where caliban rises to unusual mental heights under the stimulus of the gourdfruitmash and uses the first person how is it in ll 100108 135136 160  123 this portion of calibans soliloquy and the portion in lines 284295 give the setting for his speculations the hot still summer day creates a mood in which calibans ideas flow out easily into speech the thunderstorm at the end abruptly calls him back from his speculations to his normal state of subservience and superstitious fear  24 setebos the god of the patagonians when the natives were taken prisoners by magellan they cryed upon their devil setebos to help them eden history of travaile  25 he the pronoun of the third person when referring to setebos is capitalized  31 it came of being ill at ease each step in calibans reasoning proceeds from some personal experience or observation in this case he reasons from the fish to setebos caliban attributes to setebos unlimited power to create and control in whatever is comparatively near at hand and changeable but caliban had been affected by the mystery of the starry heavens the remoteness and fixedness of the stars had suggested a quiet unalterable passionless force beyond setebos who must therefore have limitations he did not make the stars l 27 he cannot create a mate like himself ll 578 he cannot change his nature so as to be like the quiet above him ll 1445 hence like the fish setebos had a dissatisfied consciousness of a bliss he was not born for discontent with himself spite envy restlessness love of power as a means of distraction are the motives that according to calibans reasoning actuated setebos in his creation of the world  45 the fowls here beast and creeping thing brownings remarkably minute and accurate knowledge of small animals is well illustrated by this poem for further illustration see saul the last soliloquy in pippa passes and the lyric thus the mayne glideth  75 put case etc in determining the natural attitude of setebos toward his creations the formula caliban uses is caliban plus power equals setebos the illustration from the bird ll 7597 shows cruelty and unreasoning capricious exercise of power the caprice of setebos is further emphasized in ll 100108  117 hath cut a pipe in his attitude toward his creatures setebos is envious of all human worth or happiness if it is for a moment unconscious of absolute dependence on him  150 himself peeped late etc as caliban gets some poor solace out of imitating prospero so one reason for seteboss creation of the world was a halfscornful attempt to delude himself into apparent content his imitations his make believes are the unwilling homage his weakness pays to the power of the quiet  170184 the weaknesses of all living beings were special devices whereby setebos could through need and fear torture and rule  185199 setebos worked also out of pure ennui he liked the exercise of power he liked to use his wit and he needed distraction  200210 setebos hates and favors human beings without discoverable reason  211285 it is impossible to discover a way to please setebos his favor goes by caprice as does calibans with the daring squirrel and the terrified urchin who please one day and doing the same things the next would bring down vengeance the only philosophy at which caliban can arrive is that it is best not to be too happy simulated misery is more likely to escape than any show of happiness   may and death  in memory of brownings cousin james silverthorne the charles of the poem the one plant of the last two stanzas is supposed to be the spotted

prologue to pacchiarotto and how he worked in distemper published in 1876 it was however given the title a wall when published in 1880 in selections from robert brownings poems second series the last

house he sets forth his thought of the barrier between himself and a longedfor future life in heaven the forth to thee is to be interpreted as referring to his wife   house and shop  three of brownings poems at the mermaid house and shop refer with more or less explicitness to shakspere the last stanza in house contains a quotation from wordsworths scorn not the sonnet to the effect that in his sonnets shakspere revealed the most intimate facts of his life at the mermaid and house both combat this idea in at the mermaid browning in the person of shakspere says     which of you did i

to make a rout of      rarities he found inside  as applied to browning the poems represent the indignation with which he regarded such personal revelations such utterance of sighs and groans as characterized byron the last king of at the mermaid but they overstate the impersonal nature of brownings own work which is frequently a very direct statement of his own emotions and views while even from his dramatic work it is not difficult to find his hopes and fears beliefs and doubts in stanzas 1012 of at the mermaid for example just after he has protested against leaving bosoms gate ajar he fully sets forth the joy the optimism of his own outlook on life shop is an indirect protest against the assumption that shakspere wrote mainly for money caring merely for the material success of his

lemoyne in 1884 read hervé riel to browning and he then told her that it was his custom to learn all about the heroes and legends of any town that he stopped in and that he had thus in going over the records of the town of st malo come upon the story of hervé riel which he narrated just as it happened in 1692 except that in reality the hero had a life holiday the facts of the story had been

cyclopædia p 280   wanting iswhat  this poem is in the nature of a prelude to the group of poems published under the title jocoseria 1883 each poem in this volume shows the lack of some element that would have brought the human action or experience to perfection  8 comer the invocation probably refers to the spirit of love with its inspiring transforming power   never the time and the place  this poem was published in jocoseria in 1883 it is doubtless to be grouped with the poems that refer directly to mrs browning   the patriot  browning says that this poem has no direct historical reference he calls it an old story because in all ages men have experienced this unjust reversal of public approval the poem is merely an imaginative dramatic representation of the fickleness of popular favor   instans tyrannus  the title of this poem means threatening tyrant it comes from horaces ode on the just man in odes iii 3 i the just man is not frightened by the frown of the threatening tyrantnon vullus instantis tyranni archdeacon farrar refers the incidents to persecution of the early christians the poem certainly deals with some period when the ruler of a great realm had unlimited power to follow out his most insignificant animosities and when just men and just causes had no human recourse  the general idea of the poem is clear and forcible but there are many minor difficulties of interpretation  6 what was his force an ironic question the man groveled because he was powerless to resist and line 10 because resistance might bring even worse punishment  11 were the object etc if the man could be made rich if his life could be crowded with pleasures if there could be found relatives or friends whom he loved then there would be obvious ways of hurting him he would stand forth in sufficient importance to make the swing of the tyrants hand effective but as it is the mans poverty and friendlessness and meagerness of life render it difficult to find out vulnerable points of attack he remains hidden perdue and like the midge of the egg of an insect nit is safe through his very insignificance  21 spilth that which is poured out profusely the flagon is a vessel with one handle and a long narrow neck or spout  35 then a humor etc the tyrant goes through various changes of mood in his attitude toward his enemy in lines 3543 he feels a moment of contemptuous compunction at the mans suffering and recognizes the absurdity of a contest between a great king and a person as insignificant as a tricksy elf a toad or a rat but in line 44 his mood turns he perceives that the burden gravamen of the whole matter lies in the incredibly petty nature of this unconquerable baffling opposition to his will he sees how the situation would awaken the wonder of the great lords who abjectly obey his lightest word but he concludes that after all the small becomes great if it vexes you  53 i soberly etc even the tyrant sees a kind of grotesque humor as he narrates first the elaborate plans to entrap and crush so seemingly powerless a foe and then the striking reversal of position when the man proves to have god on his side and the tyrant becomes the one to cower in fear   the italian in england  at the congress of vienna in 1815 lombardy and venetia were assigned to austria most of the inhabitants submitted to the foreign rule but there were always small bands of patriots who stirred up revolutions against austria the chief revolution was that led by mazzini in 1848 and when he was in exile he read this poem with much appreciation in pippa passes 1840 in the story of luigi and the austrian police browning had already given a picture based on italys struggle for freedom in 1844 he visited italy and then wrote the italian in england which appeared in 1845

compare this poem and tennysons crossing the bar   pippa passes  mrs sutherland orr writes that while browning was one day strolling through dulwich wood the image flashed upon him of someone walking

and the date of departure luigi had obtained such a passport for vienna for that night it was however suspected that this was a mere trick to give a wrong notion of his whereabouts if the passport should prove to be a pretense other suspicions against luigi would be confirmed it would be taken for granted that he belonged to the carbonari a secret society of italian patriots he would be arrested and sent to the prison at spielberg but if he should go to vienna he is to be let alone the officers are of course on the wrong track if luigi goes to vienna it is to carry out his purpose of

from rome is based on a wrong assumption the elder brother had an infant heir whom the second brother endeavored to put out of the way in order that he might himself inherit the estate he hired maffeo to destroy the child and according to the information from rome maffeo did so on this assumption maffeo is to be arrested and the money and land given him by the second brother to keep the deed a secret are now to revert to the church  154 so old a story in reality maffeo has been more astute than they thought he did not kill the child but kept it ready to produce as the heir to the estates if the second brother at any time proved delinquent in the required payments  174 let us understand one another he believes that when the bishop sees himself about to lose the estate he too will show himself ready for a bargain the bishop is simply to keep still and maffeo will see that the heirwho is pippashall be finally brought to shame and death the bishop is to have the estates and maffeo is to keep his illgotten gains and be given a chance to escape the bishop is apparently listening to the tempter when he hears pippas song its fresh lilting sweetness and especially perhaps the wording of the last line touch his heart and his conscience and he suddenly orders maffeos arrest at the same time uttering the prayer have mercy upon me o god  epilogue  7 my zanze zanze was evidently the
