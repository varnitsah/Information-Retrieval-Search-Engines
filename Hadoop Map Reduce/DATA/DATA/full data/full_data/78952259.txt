78952259	the clever woman of the family  by charlotte m yonge  from the 1880 edition published by macmillan and co london     chapter i in search of a mission     thou didst refuse the daily round     of useful patient love  and longedst for some great emprise     thy spirit high to provec m n     che mi sedea con lantica racheledante    it is very kind in the dear mother  butwhat rachel dont you like it she so enjoyed choosing it for you  oh yes it is a perfect thing in its way dont say a word to her but if you are consulted for my next birthday present grace couldnt you suggest that one does cease to be a girl  only try it on rachel dear she will be pleased to see you in it  oh yes i will bedizen myself to oblige her i do assure you i am not ungrateful it is beautiful in itself and shows how well nature can be imitated but it is meant for a mere girl and this is the very day i had fixed for hauling down the flag of youth  oh rachel  ah ha if rachel be an old maid what is grace come my dear resign yourself there is nothing more unbecoming than want of perception of the close of youngladyhood  of course i know we are not quite young girls now said grace half perplexed half annoyed  exactly from this moment we are established as the maiden sisters of avonmouth husband and wife to one another as maiden pairs always are  then thus let me crown our bridal quoth grace placing on her sisters head the wreath of white roses  treacherous child cried rachel putting up her hands and tossing her head but her sister held her still  you know brides always take liberties please dear let it stay till the mother has been in and pray dont talk before her of being so very old  no ill not be a shock to her we will silently assume our immunities and she will acquiesce if they come upon her gradually  grace looked somewhat alarmed being perhaps in some dread of immunities and aware that rachels silence would in any one else have been talkativeness  ah mother dear good morning as a pleasant placidlooking lady entered dressed in black with an air of feeble health but of comely middle age  birthday greetings congratulations and thanks followed and the mother looked critically at the position of the wreath and rachel for the first time turned to the glass and met a set of features of an irregular characteristic cast brow low and broad nose retrousse with large singularly sensitive nostrils quivering like those of a highbred horse at any emotion full pouting lips round cheeks glowing with the freshest red eyes widely opened dark deep grey and decidedly prominent though curtained with thick black lashes the glossy chestnut hair partook of the redundance and vigour of the whole being and the roses hung on it gracefully though not in congruity with the thick winter dress of blue and black tartan still looped up over the dark petticoat and hose and stout highheeled boots that like the grey cloak and felt hat bore witness to the early walk graces countenance and figure were in the same style though without so much of mark or animation and her dress was of like description but less severely plain  yes my dear it looks very well and now you will oblige me by not wearing that black lace thing that looks fit for your grandmother  poor lovedy kellands aunt made it mother and it was very expensive and wouldnt sell  no wonder i am sure and it was very kind in you to take it off their hands but now it is paid for it cant make much difference whether you disfigure yourself with it or not  oh yes dear mother ill bind my hair when you bid me do it and really these buds do credit to the makers i wonder whether they cost them as dear in health as lace does she added taking off the flowers and examining them with a grave sad look  i chose white roses proceeded the wellpleased mother because i thought they would suit either of the silks you have now though i own i should like to see you in another white muslin  i have done with white muslin said rachel rousing from her reverie it is an affectation of girlish simplicity not becoming at our age  oh rachel thought grace in despair but to her great relief in at that moment filed the five maids the coachman and butler and the mother began to read prayers  breakfast over rachel gathered up her various gifts and betook herself to a room on the ground floor with all the appliances of an ancient schoolroom rather dreamily she took out a number of copybooks and began to write copies in them in large text hand  and this is all i am doing for my fellowcreatures she muttered half aloud one class of halfgrown lads and those grudged to me here is the world around one mass of misery and evil not a paper do i take up but i see something about wretchedness and crime and here i sit with health strength and knowledge and able to do nothing nothingat the risk of breaking my mothers heart i have pottered about cottages and taught at schools in the dilettante way of the young lady who thinks it her duty to be charitable and i am told that it is my duty and that i may be satisfied satisfied when i see children cramped in soul destroyed in body that fine ladies may wear lace trimmings satisfied with the blight of the most promising buds satisfied when i know that every alley and lane of town or country reeks with vice and corruption and that there is one cry for workers with brains and with purses and here am i able and willing only longing to task myself to the uttermost yet tethered down to the merest mockery of usefulness by conventionalities i am a young lady forsoothi must not be out late i must not put forth my views i must not choose my acquaintance i must be a mere helpless useless being growing old in a ridiculous fiction of prolonged childhood affecting those graces of socalled sweet seventeen that i never hadbecause because why is it for any better reason than because no mother can bear to believe her daughter no longer on the lists for matrimony our dear mother does not tell herself that this is the reason but she is unconsciously actuated by it and i have hitherto given way to her wish i mean to give way still in a measure but i am five and twenty and i will no longer be withheld from some path of usefulness i will judge for myself and when my mission has declared itself i will not be withheld from it by any scruple that does not approve itself to my reason and conscience if it be only a domestic missionsay the care of fanny poor dear helpless fanny i would that i knew she was safei would not despise it i would throw myself into it and regard the training her and forming her boys as a most sacred office it would not be too homely for me but i had far rather become the founder of some establishment that might relieve women from the oppressive taskwork thrown on them in all their branches of labour oh what a worthy ambition  rachel called grace come theres a letter a letter from fanny herself for you make haste mamma is so nervous till you read it  no exhortation was needed to make rachel hurry to the drawingroom and tear open the blackedged letter with the australian stamp  all is right mamma she has been very ill but is fast recovering and was to sail by the voluta why she may be here any day  any day my dear grace see that the nurseries are well aired  no mother she says her party is too large and wants us to take a furnished house for her to come into at oncemyrtlewood if possible is it let grace  i think i saw the notice in the window yesterday  then ill go and see about it at once  but my dear you dont really mean that poor dear fanny thinks of coming anywhere but to us said her mother anxiously  it is very considerate of her said grace with so many little children you would find them too much for you dear mother it is just like fanny to have thought of it how many are there rachel  oh i cant tell they got past my reckoning long ago i only know they are all boys and that this baby is a girl  baby ah poor fanny i feared that was the reason the did not come sooner  yes and she has been very ill she always is i believe but there is very little about it fanny never could write letters she only just says i have not been able to attempt a letter sooner though my dear little girl is five weeks old today think of the daughter coming at last too late for her dear father who had so wished for one she is very healthy i am thankful to say and i am now so much better that the doctor says i may sail next week major keith has taken our cabins in the voluta and soon after you receive this i hope to be showing you my dear boys they are such good affectionate fellows but i am afraid they would be too much for my dear aunt and our party is so large so the major and i both think it will be the best way for you to take a house for me for six months i should like myrtlewood best if it is to be had i have told conrade all about it and how pretty it is and it is so near you that i think there i can be happy as ever i can be again in this world and have your advice for the dear children  poor darling she seems but a child herself  my agefive and twenty returned rachel well i shall go and ask about the house remember mother this influx is to bring no trouble or care on you fanny temple is my charge from henceforth my mission has come to seek me she added as she quitted the room in eager excitement of affection emotion and importance for fanny had been more like a sister than a cousin  grace and rachel curtis were the daughters of the squire of the homestead fanny of his brother an officer in the army left at home for education the little girl had spent her life from her seventh to her sixteenth year as absolutely one with her cousins until she was summoned to meet her father at the cape under the escort of his old friend general sir stephen temple she found colonel curtis sinking under fatal disease and while his relations were preparing to receive almost to maintain his widow and daughter they were electrified by the tidings that the gentle little fanny at sixteen had become the wife of sir stephen temple at sixty  from that time little had been known about her her mother had continued with her but the two mrs curtises had never been congenial or intimate and fanny was never a full nor willing correspondent feeling perhaps the difficulty of writing under changed circumstances her husband had been in various commands in the colonies without returning to england and all that was known of her was a general impression that she had much illhealth and numerous children and was tended like an infant by her bustling mother and doting husband more than half a year back tidings had come of the almost sudden death of her mother and about three months subsequently one of the officers of sir stephens staff had written to announce that the good old general had been killed by a fall from his horse while on a round of inspection at a distance from home the widow was then completely prostrated by the shock but promised to write as soon as she was able and this was the fulfilment of that promise bringing the assurance that fanny was coming back with her little ones to the home of her childhood  of that home grace and rachel were the jointheiresses though it was owned by the mother for her life it was an estate of farm and moorland worth some three or four thousand a year and the house was perched on a beautiful promontory running out into the sea and inclosing one side of a bay where a small fishingvillage had recently expanded into a quiet wateringplace esteemed by some for its remoteness from railways and for the calm and simplicity that were yearly diminished by its increasing popularity it was the family fashion to look down from their crag at the new esplanade with pity and contempt for the ruined loneliness of the pebbly beach and as mrs curtis had not health to go often into society she had been the more careful where she trusted her daughters they belonged to the county by birth and tradition and were not to be mixed up with the fleeting residents of the wateringplace on whom they never called unless by special recommendation from a mutual friend and the few permanent inhabitants chanced to be such that a visit to them was in some degree a condescension perhaps there was more of timidity and caution than of pride in the mothers exclusiveness and grace had always acquiesced in it as the natural and established state of affairs without any sense of superiority but rather of being protected she had a few alarms as to the results of rachels new immunities of age and though never questioning the wisdom of her clever sisters conclusions dreaded the effect on the mother whom she had been forbidden to call mamma at their age it was affecting an interesting childishness  rachel had had the palm of cleverness conceded to her ever since she could recollect when she read better at three years old than her sister at five and ever after through the days of education had enjoyed and excelled in the studies that were a toil to grace subsequently while grace had contented herself with the ordinary course of unambitious feminine life rachel had thrown herself into the process of selfeducation with all her natural energy and carried on her favourite studies by every means within her reach until she considerably surpassed in acquirements and reflection all the persons with whom she came in frequent contact it was a homely neighbourhood a society well born but of circumscribed interests and habits and little connected with the great progressive world where however rachels sympathies all lay necessarily fed however by periodical literature instead of by conversation or commerce with living minds  she began by being stranded on the ignorance of those who surrounded her and found herself isolated as a sort of pedant and as time went on the narrowness of interests chafed her and in like manner left her alone as she grew past girlhood the cui bono question had come to interfere with her ardour in study for its own sake and she felt the influence of an age eminently practical and sifting but with small powers of acting the quiet lady bountiful duties that had sufficed her mother and sister were too small and easy to satisfy a soul burning at the report of the great cry going up to heaven from a world of sin and woe the examples of successful workers stimulated her longings to be up and doing and yet the ever difficult question between charitable works and filial deference necessarily detained her and perhaps all the more because it was not so much the fear of her mothers authority as of her horror and despair that withheld her from the decisive and eccentric steps that she was always feeling impelled to take gentle mrs curtis had never been a visible power in her house and it was through their desire to avoid paining her that her government had been exercised over her two daughters ever since their fathers death which had taken place in graces seventeenth year both she and grace implicitly accepted rachels superiority as an unquestionable fact and the mother when traversing any of her clever daughters schemes never disputed either her opinions or principles only entreated that these particular developments might be conceded to her own weakness and rachel generally did concede she could not act but she could talk uncontradicted and she hated herself for the enforced submission to a state of things that she despised  this twentyfifth birthday had long been anticipated as the turningpoint when this submissive girlhood ought to close and the privileges of acting as well as thinking for herself ought to be assumed something to do was her cry and on this very day that something seemed to be cast in her way it was not ameliorating the condition of the masses but it was educating those who might ameliorate them and rachel gladly hailed the prospect of a vocation that might be conducted without pain to her mother  young children of her own class were not exactly what her dream of usefulness had devised but she had already a decided theory of education and began to read up with all her might whilst taking the lead in all the details of house taking servant hiring c to which her regular occupations of night school in the evening and reading to the lacemakers by day became almost secondary in due time the arrival of the ship was telegraphed a hurried and affectionate note followed and on a bright eastwindy afternoon rachel curtis set forth to take up her mission a telegram had announced the arrival of the voluta and the train which would bring the travellers to avonchester the homestead carriage was sent to meet them and rachel in it to give her helpless cousin assistance in this beginning of english habits a roomy fly had been engaged for nurses and children and mrs curtis had put under the coachmans charge a parcel of sandwiches and instructed him to offer all the appliances for making her own into an invalid carriage  full of warm tenderness to those who were to be dependent on her exertions led by her good sense rachel paced the platform till the engine rushed up and she looked along the line of windows suddenly bewildered doors opened but gentlemen alone met her disappointed eye until close to her a soft voice said rachel and she saw a figure in deep black close to her but her hand had been hardly clasped before the face was turned eagerly to a tall bearded man who was lifting out little boy after little boy apparently in an endless stream till at last a sleeping baby was brought out in the arms of a nurse  goodbye thank you oh thank you you will come soon oh do come on now  do come on now was echoed by many voices  i leave you in good hands goodbye  goodbye conrade dear see what cyril is doing never mind wilfred the major will come and see us run on with coombe this last was a respectable militarylooking servant who picked up a small child in one hand and a dressingcase in the other and awaited orders  there was a clinging to the major by all the children only ended by his finally precipitating himself into the carriage and being borne off then came a chorusmamma let me go with you ill go with mamma me go with mamma according to the gradations of age  while coombe and mamma decided the question by lifting the lesser ones into the fly rachel counted heads her mission exceeded her expectations here was a pair of boys in knickerbockers a pair in petticoats a pair in pelisses besides the thing in arms when the fly had been nearly crammed the two knickerbockers and one pelisse remained for the carriage quite against rachels opinion but little wilfred can sit on my lap he has not been well poor little man was quite conclusive and when rachel suggested lying back to rest there was a sweet low laugh and oh no thank you wilfred never tires me  rachels first satisfaction was in seeing the veil disclose the face of eight years back the same soft clear olive skin delicate oval face and pretty deepbrown eyes with the same imploring earnest sweetness no signs of having grown older no sign of wear and tear climate or exertion only the widows dress and the presence of the great boys enhancing her soft youthfulness the smile was certainly changed it was graver sadder tenderer and only conjured up by maternal affection or in grateful reply and the blitheness of the young brow had changed to quiet pensiveness but more than ever there was an air of dependence almost beseeching protection and rachels heart throbbed with britomarts devotion to her amoret  why wouldnt the major come mamma  he will soon come i hope my dear  those few words gave rachel a strong antipathy to the major  then began a conversation under difficulties fanny trying to inquire after her aunt and rachel to detail the arrangements made for her at myrtlewood while the two boys were each accommodated with a window but each moment they were claiming their mothers attention or rushing across the ladies feet to each others window treating rachels knees as a pivot and vouchsafing not the slightest heed to her attempts at intelligent pointing out of the new scenes  and fanny made no apology but seemed pleased ready with answers and with eyes apparently ignorant that rachels toes were less insensible than her own and her heavy threeyearsold wilfred asleep on her lap all the time  she feeble helpless sickly thought rachel i should have been less tired had i walked the twenty miles  she gave up talking in despair and by the time the young gentlemen had tired themselves into quiescence and began to eat the provisions both ladies were glad to be allowed a little silence  coming over the last hill conrade roused at his mothers summons to look out at home and every word between them showed how fondly avonmouth had been remembered far away  the sea said fanny leaning forwards to catch sight of the long grey line it is hard to believe we have been on it so long this seems so much more my own  yes cried rachel you are come to your own home for us to take care of you  i take care of mamma major keith said so indignantly exclaimed conrade  theres plenty of care for you both to take said fanny halfsmiling halfsobbing the major says i need not be a poor creature and i will try but i am afraid i shall be on all your hands  both boys drummed on her knee in wrath at her presuming to call herself a poor creatureconrade glaring at rachel as if to accuse her of the calumny  see the church said lady temple glad to divert the storm and eagerly looking at the slender spire surmounting the bellturret of a small building in earlydecorated style new but somewhat stained by seawind without having as yet acquired the tender tints of time how beautiful was her cry you were beginning the collection for it when i went away how we used to wish for it  yes we did said rachel with a significant sigh but her cousin had no time to attend for they were turning in a pepperbox lodge the boys were told that they were arrived and they were at the door of a sort of overgrown swiss cottage where mrs curtis and grace stood ready to receive them  there was a confusion of embraces fondlings and tears as fanny clung to the aunt who had been a mother to herperhaps a more tender one than the ruling managing spirit whom she had hardly known in her childhood but it was only for a moment for wilfred shrieked out in an access of shyness at graces attempt to make acquaintance with him francis was demanding wheres the orderly and conrade looking brimful of wrath at any one who made his mother cry moreover the fly had arrived and the remainder had to be produced named and kissedconrade and francis leoline and hubert wilfred and cyril and little stephana the baby really the names were a study in themselves and the cousins felt as if it would be hopeless to endeavour to apply them  servants had been engaged conditionally and the house was fully ready but the young mother could hardly listen to her aunts explanations in her anxiety that the little ones should be rested and fed and she responded with semicomprehending thanks while moving on with her youngest in her arms and as many hanging to her dress as could get hold of it her thanks grew more emphatic at the sight of cribs in inviting order and all things ready for a meal  i dont drink tea with nurse was conrades cry the signal for another general outcry untranquillized by soothings and persuasions till the door was shut on the younger half of the family and those who could not open it remained to be comforted by nurse a soldiers widow who had been with them from the birth of conrade  the temple form of shyness seemed to consist in ignoring strangers but being neither abashed nor silenced only resenting or avoiding all attempts at intercourse and as the boys rushed in and out of the rooms exploring exclaiming and calling mamma to the interruption of all that was going on only checked for a few minutes by her uplifted hand and gentle hush grace saw her mother so stunned and bewildered that she rejoiced in the fear of cold that had decided that rachel alone should spend the evening there fanny made some excuses she longed to see more of her aunt but when they were a little more settledand as a fresh shout broke out she was afraid they were rather unrulyshe must come and talk to her at the dear homestead so kind of rachel to staynot that the boys seemed to think so as they went racing in and out stretching their shipbound legs and taking possession of the minute shrubbery which they scorned for the want of gumtrees and parrots  you wont mind rachel dear i must first see about baby and rachel was left to reflect on her mission while the boys feet cantered up and down the house and one or other of them would look in and burst away in search of mamma  little more satisfactory was the rest of the evening for the boys took a great deal of waiting on at tea and then some of the party would not go to sleep in strange beds without long persuasions and comfortings till fanny looked so weary that it was plain that no conversation could have been hoped from her even if the baby had been less vociferous all that could be done for her was to wish her goodnight and promise to come down early  come early yes rachel might come but what was the use of that when fanny was at the mercy of so many claimants she looked much better than the day before and her sweet soft welcome was most cordial and clinging dear rachel it is like a dream to have you so near i felt like the old life come back again to hear the surge of the sea all night and know i should see you all so soon again  yes it is a great satisfaction to have you back in your old home under our wing i have a great deal to tell you about the arrangements  oh yes thank you  mamma roared two or three voices  i wanted to explain to you but fannys eye was roaming and just then in burst two boys mamma nurse wont undo the tin box and my ship is in it that the major gave me  yes and my stuffed duckbill and i want it mamma  my dear con the major would not let you shout so loud about it and you have not spoken to aunt rachel  the boys did present their hands and then returned to the charge please order nurse to unpack it mamma and then coombe will help us to sail it  excuse me dear rachel said fanny i will first see about this  and a very long seeing it was probably meaning that she unpacked the box herself whilst rachel was deciding on the terrible spoiling of the children and preparing a remonstrance  dear rachel you have been left a long time  oh never mind that but fanny you must not give way to those children too much they will be alwayshark was that the doorbell  it was and the visitor was announced as mr touchett a small dark thin young clergyman he was of a nervous manner which growing more nervous as he shook hands with rachel became abrupt and hesitating  my call isis early lady temple but i always pay my respects at once to any new parishionerresident i meanin case i can be of any service  thank you i am very much obliged said fanny with a sweet gracious smile and manner that would have made him more at ease at once if rachel had not added my cousin is quite at home here mr touchett  oh yes he said soso i understood  i know no place in england so well it is quite a home to me so beautiful it is continued fanny  and you see great changes here  changes so much for the better said fanny smiling her winning smile again  one always expects more from improvements than they effect put in rachel severely  you have a large young party said mr touchett looking uneasily towards lady temple  yes i have half a dozen boys and one little girl  seven mr touchett looked up half incredulous at the girlish contour of the gentle face then cast down his eyes as if afraid he had been rude seven it isit is a great charge  yes indeed it is she said earnestly and i am sure you will be kind enough to give your influence to help me with thempoor boys  oh oh he exclaimed anything i can do in such a transport of eager helpfulness that rachel coldly said we are all anxious to assist in the care of the children he coloured up and with a sort of effort at selfassertion blurted out as the clergyman of the parish and there halted and was beginning to look foolish when lady temple took him up in her soft persuasive way of course we shall look to you so much and you will be so kind as to let me know if there is any one i can send any broth to at anytime  thank you you are very good and he was quite himself again i shall have the pleasure of sending you down a few names  i never did approve the broken victual system began rachel it creates dependence  come here hubert said fanny beckoning a boy she saw at a distance come and shake hands with mr touchett it was from instinct rather than reason there was a fencing between rachel and the curate that made her uncomfortable and led her to break it off by any means in her power and though mr touchett was not much at his ease with the little boy this discussion was staged off but again mr touchett made bold to say that in case lady temple wished for a daily governess he knew of a very desirable young person a most admirable pair of sisters who had met with great reverses but rachel snapped him off shorter than ever we can decide nothing yet i have made up my mind to teach the little boys at present  oh indeed  it is very kind said the perplexed lady temple  i beg your pardon i only thought in case you were wishing for some one that miss williams will be at liberty shortly  i do not imagine miss williams is the person to deal with little boys said rachel in fact i think that home teaching is always better than hired  i am so much obliged said fanny as mr touchett after this defeat rose up to take leave and she held out her hand smiled thanked and sent him away so much sweetened and gratified that rachel would have instantly begun dissecting him but that a whole rush of boys broke in and again engrossed their mother and in the next lull the uppermost necessity was of explaining about the servants who had been hired for the time one of whom was a young woman whose health had given way over her lace pillow and rachel was eloquent over the crying evils of the system everything was a system with rachel that chained girls to an unhealthy occupation in their early childhood and made an overstocked market and underpaid workersholding fanny fast to listen by a sort of fascination in her overpowering earnestness and great fixed eyes which when once their grasp was taken would not release the victim and this was a matter of daily occurrence on which rachel felt keenly and spoke strongly  it is very sad if you want to help the poor things i will give anything i can  oh yes thank you but it is doleful merely to help them to linger out the remnant of a life consumed upon these cobwebs of vanity it is the fountainhead that must be reachedthe root of the system  fanny saw or rather felt a boy making signs at the window but durst not withdraw her eyes from the fascination of those eager ones lace and lacemakers are facts continued rachel but if the middle men were exploded and the excess of workers drafted off by some wholesome outlet the price would rise so that the remainder would be at leisure to fulfil the domestic offices of womanhood  there was a great uproar above  i beg your pardon dear rachel and away went fanny  i do declare cried rachel when grace having despatched her homecares entered the room a quarter of an hour after poor fannys a perfect slave one cant get in a word edgeways  fanny at last returned but with her baby and there was no chance for even rachel to assert herself while this small queen was in presence grace was devoted to infants and there was a whole court of brothers vying with one another in picking up her constantly dropped toys and in performing antics for her amusement rachel desirous to be gracious and resigned attempted conversation with one of the eldest pair but the baby had but to look towards him and he was at her feet  on her departure rachel resumed the needful details of the arrangements respecting the house and servants and found lady temple as grateful and submissive as ever except that when advised to take myrtlewood for a term of seven years she replied that the major had advised her not to bind herself down at once  did you let him think we should quarrel  oh no my dear but it might not agree with the children  avonmouth grace do you hear what heresy fanny has been learning why the proportion of ozone in the air here has been calculated to be five times that of even aveton  yes dearest said poor fanny very humbly and rather scared there is no place like avonmouth and i am sure the major will think so when he has seen it  but what has he to do with your movements  sir stephen wished murmured fanny  the major is military secretary and always settles our headquarters and no one interferes with him shouted conrade  rachel suspicious and jealous of her rival was obliged to let fanny pass on to the next item where her eager acceptance of all that was prescribed to her was evidently meant as compensation for her refractoriness about the house  grace had meanwhile applied herself to keeping off the boys and was making some progress in their good graces and in distinguishing between their sallow faces dark eyes and crisp black heads conrade was individualized not only by superior height but by soldierly bearing bright pride glancing in his eyes his quick gestures bold decided words and imperious tone towards all save his motherand whatever he was doing his keen black eye was always turning in search of her he was ever ready to spring to her side to wait on her to maintain her cause in rough championship or to claim her attention to himself francis was thickset roundshouldered bulletheaded and dulleyed in comparison not aggressive but holding his own and not very approachable leoline thin whitecheeked largeeyed and fretfullipped was ready to whine at conrades tyranny and franciss appropriations but was grateful for graces protection and more easy of access than his elders and hubert was a handsome placid child the good boy as well as the beauty of the family the pair in the nursery hardly came on the stage and the two elders would be quite sufficient for mrs curtis with whom the afternoon was to be spent  the mother evidently considered it a very long absence but she was anxious to see both her aunt and her own home and set out leaning on rachels arm and smiling pleased though sad recognition of the esplanade the pebbly beach bathing machines and fishing boats and pointing them out to her sons who on their side would only talk of the much greater extent of melbourne  within the gates of the homestead there was a steep sharp bit of road cut out in the red sandstone rock and after a few paces she paused to rest with a sigh that brought conrade to her side when she put her arm round his neck and leant on his shoulder but even her two supporters could not prevent her from looking pale and exhausted  never mind she said this salt wind is delightful how like old times it is and she stood gazing across the little steep lawn at the grey sea the line of houses following the curve of the bay and straggling up the valley in the rear and the purple headlands projecting point beyond point showing them to her boys and telling their names  it is all ugly and cold said francis with an ungracious shiver i shall go home to melbourne when im a man  and you will come mamma added conrade  he had no answer for fanny was in her aunts arms and like mother and daughter they clung to each othermore able to sympathize more truly one together than the young widow could be with either of the girls  as soon as fanny had rested and enjoyed the home atmosphere downstairs she begged to visit the dear old rooms and carried conrade through a course of recognitions through the scarcely altered apartments only one had been much changed namely the schoolroom which had been stripped of the kindly old shabby furniture that fanny tenderly recollected and was decidedly bare but a mahogany box stood on a stand on one side there was a great accession of books and writing implements occupied the plain deal table in the centre  what have you done to the dear old roomdo you not use it still asked fanny  yes i work here said rachel  vainly did lady temple look for that which women call work  i have hitherto ground on at aftereducation and selfimprovement said rachel now i trust to make my preparation available for others i will undertake any of your boys if you wish it  thank you but what is that boxin obedience to a curious push and pull from conrade  it is her dispensary said grace  yes said rachel you are weak and nervous and i have just the thing for you  is it homoeopathy  yes here is my book i have done great things in my district and should do more but for prejudice there this globule is the very thing for your case i made it out last night in my book that is right and i wanted to ask you some questions about little wilfred  fanny had obediently swallowed her own globule but little wilfred was a different matter and she retreated from the large eyes and open book saying that he was better and that mr frampton should look at him but rachel was not to be eluded and was in full career of elucidation to the meanest capacity when a sharp skirmish between the boys ended the conversation and it appeared that conrade had caught francis just commencing an onslaught on the globules taking them for english sweetmeats of a minute description  the afternoon passed with the strange heaviness well known to those who find it hard to resume broken threads after long parting there was much affection but not full certainty what to talk about and the presence of the boys would have hindered confidence even had they not incessantly occupied their mother conrade indeed betook himself to a book but francis was only kept out of mischief by his constantly turning over pictures with him however at dark coombe came to convey them home and the ladies of the homestead experienced a sense of relief rachel immediately began to talk of an excellent preparatory school  i was thinking of asking you said fanny if there is any one here who would come as a daily governess  oh cried rachel these two would be much better at school and i would form the little ones who are still manageable  conrade is not eight years old yet said his mother in an imploring tone and the major said i need not part with him till he has grown a little more used to english ways  he can read i see said grace and he told me he had done some latin with the major  yes he has picked up a vast deal of information and on the voyage the major used to teach him out of a little pocket virgil the major said it would not be of much use at school as there was no dictionary but that the discipline and occupation would be useful and so they were conrade will do anything for the major and indeed so will they all  three majors in one speech thought rachel and by way of counteraction she enunciated i could undertake the next pair of boys easily but these two are evidently wanting school discipline  lady temple feathered up like a mother dove over her nest  you do not know conrade he is so trustworthy and affectionate dear boy and they are both always good with me the major said it often hurts boys to send them too young  they are very young poor little fellows said mrs curtis  and if they are forward in some things they are backward in others said fanny what major keith recommended was a governess who would know what is generally expected of little boys  i dont like half measures muttered rachel i do not approve of encouraging young women to crowd the overstocked profession of governesses  fanny opened her brown eyes and awaited the words of wisdom  is it not a flagrant abuse continued rachel that whether she have a vocation or not every woman of a certain rank who wishes to gain her own livelihood must needs become a governess a nursery maid must have a vocation but an educated or halfeducated woman has no choice and educator she must become to her own detriment and that of her victims  i always did think governesses often much to be pitied said fanny finding something was expected of her  whats the use of pity if one runs on in the old groove we must prevent the market from being drugged by diverting the supply into new lines  are there any new lines asked fanny surprised at the progress of society in her absence  homoeopathic doctresses whispered grace who dutiful as she was sometimes indulged in a little fun which rachel would affably receive unless she took it in earnest as in the present instance  why noti ask why not some women have broken through prejudice and why should not others do you not agree with me fanny that female medical meni mean medical womenwould be an infinite boon  it would be very nice if they would never be nervous  nerves are merely a matter of training think of the numbers that might be removed from the responsibility of incompetently educating i declare that to tempt a person into the office of governess instead of opening a new field to her is the most shortsighted indolence  i dont want to tempt any one said fanny she ought to have been out before and be experienced only she most be kind to the poor boys i wanted the major to inquire in london but he said perhaps i might hear of some one here  that was right my dear returned her aunt a gentleman an officer could not do much in such a matter  he always does manage whatever one wants  at which speech rachel cast a glance towards her mother and saw her look questioning and perplexed  i was thinking said grace that i believe the people at the cliff cottages are going away and that miss williams might be at liberty  didnt i know that grace would come out with miss williams exclaimed rachel a regular eruption of the touchettomania we have had him already advertising her  miss williams said mrs curtis yes she might suit you very well i believe they are very respectable young women poor things i have always wished that we could do more for them  who asked fanny  certain pets of mr touchetts said rachel some of the numerous ladies whose mission is that curatolatry into which grace would lapse but for my strenuous efforts  i dont quite know why you call them his pets said grace except that he knew their antecedents and told us about them  exactly that was enough for me i perfectly understand the meaning of mr touchetts recommendations and if what fanny wants is a commonplace sort of upper nursemaid i dare say it would do and rachel leant back applied herself to her wood carving and virtually retired from the discussion  one sister is a great invalid said grace quite a cripple and the other goes out as a daily governess they are a clergymans daughters and once were very well off but they lost everything through some speculation of their brother i believe he fled the country under some terrible suspicion of dishonesty and though no one thought they had anything to do with it their friends dropped them because they would not give him up nor believe him guilty and a little girl of his lives with them  poor things exclaimed lady temple i should very much like to employ this one how very sad  mrs grey told me that her children had never done so well with any one said mrs curtis she wanted to engage miss williams permanently but could not induce her to leave her sister or even to remove her to london on account of her health  do you know her grace asked fanny  i have called once or twice and have been very much pleased with the sick sister but rachel does not fancy that set you see i meet the other at the sunday school i like her looks and manner very much and she is always at the early service before her work  just like a little mauve book muttered rachel  fanny absolutely stared you go dont you rachel how we used to wish for it  you have wished and we have tried said rachel with a sigh  yes rachel said grace but with all drawbacks all disappointments in ourselves it is a great blessing we would not be without it  i could not be satisfied in relinquishing it voluntarily said rachel but i am necessarily one of the idle were i one of the occupied laborare est orare would satisfy me and that poor governess ought to feel the same think of the physical reaction of body on mind and tell me if you could have the barbarity of depriving that poor jaded thing of an hours sleep giving her an additional walk fasting in all weathers and preparing her to be savage with the children  perhaps it refreshes her and hinders her from being cross  maybe she thinks so but if she have either sense or ear nothing would so predispose her to be cross as the squeaking of mr touchetts pennywhistle choir  poor mr touchett sighed mrs curtis i wish he would not make such ambitious attempts  but you like the choral service said fanny feeling as if everything had turned round when all the men of a regiment chant together you cannot think how grand it is almost finer than the cathedral  yes where you can do it said rachel but not where you cant  i wish you would not talk about it said grace  i must or fanny will not understand the state of parties at avonmouth  parties oh i hope not  my dear child party spirit is another word for vitality so you thought the church we sighed for had made the place all we sighed to see it and ourselves too oh fanny is this what you have been across the world for  what is wrong asked fanny alarmed  do you remember our axiom build your church and the rest will take care of itself you remember our scraping and begging and how that good mr davison helped us out and brought the endowment up to the needful point for consecration on condition the incumbency was given to him he held it just a year and was rich and could help out his bad health with a curate but first he went to madeira and then he died and there we are a perpetual curacy of £70 a year no resident gentry but ourselves a fluctuating population mostly sick our poor demoralized by them and either crazed by dissent or heathenized by their former distance from church who would take us no more mr davisons there was no more novelty and too much smartness to invite selfdevotion so we were driven from pillar to post till we settled down into this mr touchett as good a being as ever lived working as hard as any two and sparing neither himself nor any one else  fanny looked up prepared to admire  but he has two misfortunes he was not born a gentleman and his mind does not measure an inch across  rachel my dear it is not fair to prejudice fanny i am sure the poor man is very wellbehaved  mother would you be calling the ideal anglican priest poor man  i thought he was quite gentlemanlike added fanny  gentlemanlike ay thats it said rachel just so like as to delight the born curatolatress like grace and miss williams  would it hurt the children asked fanny hardly comprehending the tremendous term  yes if it infected you said rachel intending some playfullness a mother of contracted mind forfeits the allegiance of her sons  oh rachel i know i am weak and silly said the gentle young widow terrified but the major said if i only tried to do my duty by them i should be helped  and i will help you fanny said rachel all that is requisite is good sense and firmness and a thorough sense of responsibility  that is what is so dreadful the responsibility of all those dear fatherless boys and ifif i should do wrong by them  poor fanny fell into an uncontrollable fit of weeping at the sense of her own desolation and helplessness and mrs curtis came to comfort her and tell her affectionately of having gone through the like feelings and of the repeated but most comfortable words of promise to the fatherless and the widowwords that had constantly come before the sufferer but which had by no means lost their virtue by repetition and fanny was soothed with hearing instances of the special providence over orphaned sons and their love and deference for their mother rachel shocked and distressed at the effect of her sense retired out of the conversation till at the announcement of the carriage for lady temple her gentle cousin cheered up and feeling herself to blame for having grieved one who only meant aid and kindness came to her and fondly kissed her forehead saying i am not vexed dear rachel i know you are right i am not clever enough to bring them up properly but if i try hard and pray for them it may be made up to them and you will help me rachel dear she added as her readiest woeoffering for her tears and it was the most effectual for rachel was perfectly contented as long as fanny was dependent on her and allowed her to assume her mission provided only that the counter influence could be averted and this major this universal referee be eradicated from her foolish clinging habits of reliance before her spirits were enough recovered to lay her heart open to danger  but the more rachel saw of her cousin the more she realized this peril when she went down on monday morning to complete the matters of business that had been slurred over on the saturday she found that fanny had not the slightest notion what her own income was to be all she knew was that her general had left everything unreservedly to herself except £100 and one of his swords to major keith who was executor to the will and had gone to london to see about it by which word poor fanny expressed all the business that her maintenance depended on if an old general wished to put a major in temptation could he have found a better means of doing so rachel even thought that fannys incapacity to understand business had made her mistake the terms of the bequest and that sir stephen must have secured his property to his children but fanny was absolutely certain that this was not the case for she said the major had made her at once sign a will dividing the property among them and appointing himself and her aunt curtis their guardians i did not like putting such a charge on my dear aunt said fanny but the major said i ought to appoint a relation and i had no one else and i knew you would all be good to them if they had lost me too when baby was born  we would have tried said rachel a little humbly but oh i am glad you are here fanny  nothing could of course be fixed till the major had seen about it after which he was to come to let lady temple know the result but she believed he would first go to scotland to see his brother he and his brother were the only survivors of a large family and he had been on foreign service for twelve years so that it would be very selfish to wish him not to take full time at home selfish thought rachel if he will only stay away long enough you shall learn my dear how well you can do without him  the boys had interrupted the conversation less than the previous one because the lesser ones were asleep or walking out and the elder ones having learnt that a new week was to be begun steadily with lessons thought it advisable to bring themselves as little into notice as possible but fate was sure to pursue them sooner or later for rachel had come down resolved on testing their acquirements and deciding on the method to be pursued with them and though their mamma with a curtain instinctive shrinking both for them and for herself had put off the ordeal to the utmost by listening to all the counsel about her affairs it was not to be averted  now fanny since it seems that more cannot be done at present let us see about the childrens education where are their books  we have very few books said fanny hesitating we had not much choice where we were  you should have written to me for a selection  whyso we would but there was always a talk of sending conrade and francis home i am afraid you will think them very backward dear rachel especially francie but it is not their fault dear children and they are not used to strangers added fanny nervously  i do not mean to be a stranger said rachel  and while fanny in confusion made loving protestations about not meaning that rachel stepped out upon the lawn and in her clear voice called conrade francis no answer she called conrade again and louder then turned round with where can they benot gone down on the beach  oh dear no i trust not said the mother flurried and coming to the window with a call that seemed to rachels ears like the roar of a sucking dove  but from behind the bushes forth came the two young gentlemen their black garments considerably streaked with the green marks of laurel climbing  oh my dears what figures you are go to coombe and get yourselves brushed and wash your hands and then come down and bring your lesson books  rachel prognosticated that these preparations would be made the occasion of much waste of time but she was answered and with rather surprised eyes that they had never been allowed to come into the drawingroom without looking like little gentlemen  but you are not living in state here said rachel i never could enter into the cult some people mamma especially pay to their drawingroom  the major used to be very particular about their not coming to sit down untidy said fanny he said it was not good for anybody  martinet thought rachel nearly ready to advocate the boys making no toilette at any time and the present was made to consume so much time that urged by her fanny once more was obliged to summon her boys and their books  it was not an extensive school librarya latin grammar an extremely dilapidated spellingbook and the fourth volume of mrs marcets little willie the other threeone was unaccounted for but cyril had torn up the second and francis had thrown the first overboard in a passion rachel looked in dismay i dont know what can be done with these she said  oh then well have holidays till we have got books mamma said conrade putting his hands on the sofa and imitating a kicking horse  it is very necessary to see what kind of books you ought to have returned rachel how far have you gone in this  i say mamma reiterated conrade we cant do lessons without books  attend to what your aunt rachel says my dear she wants to find out what books you should have  yes let me examine you  conrade came most inconveniently close to her she pushed her chair back he came after her his mother uttered a remonstrating my dear  i thought she wanted to examine me quoth conrade when dr mvicar examines a thing he puts it under a microscope  it was said gravely and whether it were malice or simplicity rachel was perfectly unable to divine but she thought anyway that fanny had no business to laugh and explaining the species of examination that she intended she went to work in her younger days she had worked much at schools and was really an able and spirited teacher liking the occupation and laying hold of the first book in her way she requested conrade to read he obeyed but in such a detestable gabble that she looked up appealingly to fanny who suggested my dear you can read better than that he read four lines not badly but then broke off mamma are not we to have ponies coombe heard of a pony this morning it is to be seen at the jolly mariner and he will take us to look at it  the jolly mariner it is a dreadful place fanny you never will let them go there  my dear the major will see about your ponies when he comes  we will send the coachman down to inquire added rachel  he is only a civilian and the major always chooses our horses said conrade  and i am to have one too mamma added francis you know i have been out four times with the staff and the major said i could ride as well as con  reading is what is wanted now my dear go on  five lines more but francis and his mother were whispering together and of course conrade stopped to listen rachel saw there was no hope but in getting him alone and at his mothers reluctant desire he followed her to the diningroom but there he turned dogged and indifferent made a sort of feint of doing what he was told but whether she tried him in arithmetic latin or dictation he made such ludicrous blunders as to leave her in perplexity whether they arose from ignorance or impertinence his spelling was phonetic to the highest degree and though he owned to having done sums he would not or did not answer the simplest question in mental arithmetic five apples and eight apples come conrade what will they make  a pie  that was the hopeful way in which the examination proceeded and when rachel attempted to say that his mother would be much displeased he proceeded to tumble head over heels all round the room as if he knew better which performance broke up the seance with a resolve on her part that when she had the books she would not be so beaten she tried francis but he really did know next to nothing and whenever he came to a word above five letters long stopped short and when told to spell it said mamma never made him spell also muttering something depreciating about civilians  rachel was a woman of perseverance she went to the booksellers and obtained a fair amount of books which she ordered to be sent to lady temples but when she came down the next morning the parcel was nowhere to be found there was a grand interrogation and at last it turned out to have been safely deposited in an empty dogkennel in the back yard it was very hard on rachel that fanny giggled like a schoolgirl and even though ashamed of herself and her sons could not find voice to scold them respectably no wonder after such encouragement that rachel found her mission no sinecure and felt at the end of her mornings work much as if she had been driving pigs to market though the repetition was imposing on the boys a sort of sense of fate and obedience and there was less active resistance though learning it was not only letting teaching be thrown at them all the rest of the day except those two hours they ran wild about the house garden and beachthe latter place under the inspection of coombe whom since the jolly mariner proposal rachel did not in the least trust all the less when she heard that major keith whose soldierservant he had originally been thought very highly of him a call at myrtlewood was formidable from the beargarden sounds and delicate as lady temple was considered to be unable to walk or bear fatigue she never appeared to be incommoded by the uproar in which she lived and had even been seen careering about the nursery or running about the garden in a way that grace and rachel thought would tire a strong woman as to a teteatete with her it was never secured by anything short of rachels strong will for the children were always with her and she went to bed or at any rate to her own room when they did and she was so perfectly able to play and laugh with them that her cousins scarcely thought her sufficiently depressed and comparing her with what their own mother had been after ten months widowhood agreed that after all she had been very young and sir stephen very old and perhaps too much must not be expected of her  the grand passion of her life is yet to come said rachel  i hope not said grace  you may be certain of that said rachel feminine women always have it one time or other in their lives only superior ones are exempt but i hope i may have influence enough to carry her past it and prevent her taking any step that might be injurious to the children     chapter ii rachels discipline     thought is free as sages tells us     free to rove and free to soar  but affection lives in bondage     that enthrals her more and more                             jean ingelow   an old friend lived in the neighbourhood who remembered fannys father and was very anxious to see her again though not able to leave the house so the first day that it was fine enough for mrs curtis to venture out she undertook to convey fanny to call upon her and was off with a wonderfully moderate allowance of children only the two youngest boys outside with their maid this drive brought more to light about fannys past way of life and feelings than had ever yet appeared rachel had never elicited nearly so much as seemed to have come forth spontaneously to the aunt who had never in old times been fannys confidante  fannys life had been almost a prolonged childhood from the moment of her marriage with the kind old general he and her mother had conspired to make much of her all the more that she was almost constantly disabled by her state of health and was kept additionally languid and helpless by the effects of climate her mother had managed her household and she had absolutely had no care no duty at all but to be affectionate and grateful and to be pretty and gracious at the dinner parties even in her mothers short and sudden illness the one thought of both the patient and the general had been to spare fanny and she had been scarcely made aware of the danger and not allowed to witness the suffering the chivalrous old man who had taken on himself the charge of her still regarded the young mother of his children as almost as much of a baby herself and devoted himself all the more to sparing her trouble and preventing her from feeling more thrown upon her by her mothers death the notion of training her to act alone never even occurred to him and when he was thrown from his horse and carried into a waysidehut to die his first orders were that no hurried message might be sent to her lest she might be startled and injured by the attempt to come to him all he could do for her was to leave her in the charge of his military secretary who had long been as a son to him fanny told her aunt with loving detail all that she had heard from major keith of the brave old mans calm and resigned endtoo full of trust even to be distressed with alarms for the helpless young wife and children but committing them in full reliance to the care of their father in heaven and to the present kindness of the friend who stood by his pillow  the will which not only rachel but her mother thought strangely unguarded had been drawn up in haste because sir stephens family had outgrown the provisions of a former one which had besides designated her mother and a friend since dead as guardians haste and the conscious want of legal knowledge had led to its being made as simple as possible and as it was sir stephen had scarcely had the power to sign it  it was major keith who had borne the tidings to the poor little widow and had taken the sole care of the boys during the sad weeks of care utter prostration and illness female friends were with her and tended her affectionately but if exertion or thought were required of her the major had to be called to her sofa to awaken her faculties and she always awoke to attend to his wishes as though he were the channel of her husbands this state of things ended with the birth of the little girl the daughter that sir stephen had so much wished for coming too late to be welcomed by him but awakening her mother to tearful joy and renewed powers of life the nine months of little stephanas life had been a tone of continual change and variety of new interests and occupations and of the resumption of a feeling of health which had scarcely been tasted since the first plunge into warm climates perhaps it was unreasonable to expect to find fanny broken down and she talked in her own simple way with abundant overflowing affection of her husband but even mrs curtis thought it was to her more like the loss of her own father than of the father of her children and though not in the least afraid of anything unbecoming in her gentle retiring fanny still felt that it was more the charge of a girl than of a widow dreaded the boys dreaded their fate and dreaded the major more  during this drive grace and rachel had the care of the elder boys whom rachel thought safer in her keeping than in coombes a walk along the cliffs was one resource for their amusement but it resulted in conrades climbing into the most breakneck places by preference selecting those that rachel called him out of and as all the others thought it necessary to go after him the jeopardy of leoline and hubert became greater than it was possible to permit so grace took them by the hands and lured them home with promises of an introduction to certain white rabbits at the lodge after their departure their brothers became infinitely more obstreperous whether it were that conrade had some slight amount of consideration for the limbs of his lesser followers or whether the fact werewhat rachel did not remotely imaginethat he was less utterly unmanageable with her sister than with herself certain it is that the brothers went into still more intolerable places and treated their guardian as ducklings treat an old hen at last they quite disappeared from the view round a projecting point of rock and when she turned it she found a battle royal going on over an old lobsterpotconrade hand to hand with a stout fisherboy and francis and sundry amphibious creatures of both sexes exchanging a hail of stones watersmoothed brickbats cockleshells fishes backbones and other unsavoury missiles abstractedly rachel had her theory that young gentlemen had better scramble their way among their poor neighbours and become used to all ranks but when it came to witnessing an actual skirmish when she was responsible for fannys sons it was needful to interfere and in equal dismay and indignation she came round the point the light artillery fled at her aspect and she had to catch franciss arm in the act of discharging after them a cuttlefishs white spine with a sharp for shame they are running away conrade zack have done zack was one of her own scholars and held her in respect  he desisted at once and with a touch of his rough forelock looked sheepish and said please maam he was meddling with our lobsterpot  i wasnt doing any harm said conrade i was just looking in and they all came and shied stones at us  i dont care how the quarrel began said rachel you would not have run into it if you had been behaving properly zack was quite right to protect his fathers property but he might have been more civil now shake hands and have done with it  not shake hands with a low boy growled francis but happily conrade was of a freer spirit and in spite of rachels interference had sense enough to know himself in the wrong he held out his hand and when the ceremony had been gone through put his hands in his pockets produced a shilling and said there thats in case i did the thing any harm rachel would have preferred zacharys being above its acceptance but he was not and she was thankful that a wood path offend itself leading through the homestead plantations away from the temptations and perils of the shore  that the two boys instead of listening to her remonstrance took to punching and kicking one another was a mitigated form of evil for which she willingly compounded having gone through so much useless interference already that she felt as if she had no spirit left to keep the peace and that they must settle their little affairs between themselves it was the most innocent diversion in which she could hope to see them indulge she only desired that it might last them past a thrushs nest in the hedge between the park and plantation a somewhat treasured discovery of graces no such good luck either the thrushs imprudence or graces visits had made the nest dangerously visible and it was proclaimed with a shout rachel in hot haste warned them against taking birdsnests in general and that in particular  nests are made to be taken said francis  ive got an egg of all the australian birds the major could get me said conrade and i mean to have all the english ones  oh one egg theres no harm in taking that but this nest has young birds  the young birds must of course be seen and rachel stood by with despairing frowns commands and assurances of their mothers displeasure while they peeped in tantalized the gaping yellow throats by holding up their fingers and laid hands on the side of the nest peeping at her with laughing mischievous eyes enjoying her distress she was glad at last to find them coming away without the nest and after crossing the park arrived at the house tired out but with two hours of the boys still on her hands they however were a little tired too and further grace had hunted out the old bowls much to the delight of the younger ones this sport lasted a good while but at last the sisters who had relaxed their attention a little perceived that conrade and hubert were both missing and on rachels inquiry where they were she received from francis that elegant stock answer in their skins however they came to light in process of time the two mothers returned home and mrs curtis and grace had the conversation almost in their own hands rachel was too much tired to do anything but read the new number of her favourite travellers magazine listening to her mother with one ear and gathering additional impressions of sir stephen temples imprudence and the need of their own vigilance to make fanny feel that she could lean upon some one besides the military secretary seemed to be the great object and she was so confiding and affectionate with her own kin that there were great hopes those boys were an infliction no doubt but thought rachel there is always an ordeal at the beginning of ones mission i am mastering them by degrees and should do so sooner if i had them in my own hands and no more worthy task can be done than training human beings for their work in this world so i must be willing to go through a little while i bring them into order and fit their mother for managing them  she spent the time before breakfast the next morning in a search among the back numbers of the travellers magazine for a paper upon educational laws which she thought would be very good reading for fanny her search had been just completed when grace returned home from church looking a good deal distressed my poor thrushes have not escaped rachel she said i came home that way to see how they were going on and the nest is torn out one poor little fellow lying dead below it  well that is much worse than i expected burst out rachel i did think that boy conrade would at least keep his promises and she detailed the adventure of the previous day whence the conclusion was but too evident grace however said in her own sweet manner that she believed boys could not resist a nest and thought it mere womanhood to intercede for such lawful game she thought it would be best to take no notice it would only distress fanny and make the mother more afraid of the boys than she was already and she doubted the possibility of bringing it home to the puerile conscience  that is weak said rachel i received the boys word and it is my business to deal with the breach of promise  so down went rachel and finding the boys rushing about the garden according to their practice before her arrival she summoned conrade and addressed him with well conrade i knew that you were violent and disobedient but i never expected you to fail in your honour as a gentleman  ill thrash any one who says i have hotly exclaimed conrade  then you must thrash me you gave your word to me not to take your aunt graces thrushs nest  and i didnt said conrade boldly  but rachel used to flat denials at the villageschool was not to be thus set aside i am shocked at you conrade she said i know your mamma will be exceedingly grieved you must have fallen into very sad ways to be able to utter such a bold untruth you had better confess at once and then i shall have something to tell her that will comfort he  conrades dark face looked set as iron  come tell me you are sorry you took the nest and have broken your word and told a falsehood  red colour flushed into the brown cheek and the hands were clenched  there is not the smallest use in denying it i know you took it when you and hubert went away together your aunt grace found it gone this morning and one of the poor little birds dead below what have you done with the others  not a word  then i grieve to say i must tell all to your mother  there was a sort of smile of defiance and he followed her for a moment she thought of preventing this and preparing fanny in private but recollecting that this would give him the opportunity of preparing hubert to support his falsehood she let him enter with her and sought lady temple in the nursery  dear fanny i am very sorry to bring you so much vexation i am afraid it will be a bitter grief to you but it is only for conrades own sake that i do it it was a cruel thing to take a birdsnest at all but worse when he knew that his aunt grace was particularly fond of it and besides he had promised not to touch it and now saddest of all he denies having done so  oh conrade conrade cried fanny quite confounded you cant have done like this  so i have not said conrade coming up to her as she held out her hand positively encouraging him as rachel thought to persist in the untruth  listen fanny said rachel i do not wonder that you are unwilling to believe anything so shocking but i do not come without being only too certain and she gave the facts to which fanny listened with pale cheeks and tearful eyes then turned to the boy whose hand she had held all the time and said dear con do pray tell me if you did it  i did not said conrade wrenching his hand away and putting it behind his back  wheres hubert asked rachel looking round and much vexed when she perceived that hubert had been within hearing all the time though to be sure there was some little hope to be founded upon the simplicity of five years old  come here hubert dear said his mother dont be frightened only come and tell me where you and con went yesterday when the others were playing at bowls hubert hung his head and looked at his brother  tell quoth conrade never mind her shes only a civilian  where did you go hubert  con showed me the little birds in their nest  that is right hubert good little boy did you or he touch the nest  yes then as conrade started and looked fiercely at him yes you did con you touched the inside to see what it was made of  but what did you do with it asked rachel  left it there up in the tree said the little boy  there rachel said the mother triumphantly  i dont know what you mean said rachel angrily only that conrade is a worse boy than i had thought him end has been teaching his little brother falsehood  the angry voice set hubert crying and little cyril who was very softhearted joined in chorus followed by the baby who was conscious of something very disagreeable going on in her nursery thereupon after the apparently most important business of comforting miss temple had been gone through the court of justice adjourned rachel opening the door of conrades little room and recommending solitary imprisonment there till he should be brought to confession she did not at all reckon on his mother going in with him and shutting the door after her it was not the popular notion of solitary confinement and rachel was obliged to retire and wait in the drawingroom for a quarter of an hour before fanny came down and then it was to say  do you know rachel dear i am convinced that it must be a mistake conrade assures me he never touched the nest  so he persists in it  and indeed rachel dear i cannot help believing him if it had been francie now but i never knew conrade tell an untruth in his life  you never knew because you always believe him  and it is not only me but i have often heard the major say he could always depend on conrades word  rachels next endeavour was at gentle argument it must be dreadful to make such a discovery but it was far worse to let deceit go on undetected and if only they were firm at that moment she beheld two knickerbocker boys prancing on the lawn  didnt you lock the door has he broken out how audacious  i let him come out said fanny there was nothing to shut him up for i beg your pardon dear rachel i am very sony for the poor little birds and for grace but i am sure conrade did not take it  how can you be so unreasonable fannythe evidence and rachel went over it all again  dont you think said fanny that some boy may have got into the park  my dear fanny i am sorry for you it is quite out of the question to think so the place is not a stonesthrow from randalls lodge it will be the most fatal thing in the world to let your weakness be imposed on in this way now that the case is clear the boy must be forced to confession and severely punished  fanny burst into tears  i am very sorry for you fanny i know it is very painful i assure you it is so to me perhaps it would be best if i were to lock him up and go from time to time to see if he is come to a better mind  she rose up  no no rachel absolutely screamed fanny starting up my boy hasnt done anything wrong and i wont have him locked up go away if anything is to be done to my boys ill do it myself they havent got any one but me oh i wish the major would come  fanny how can you be so foolishas if i would hurt your boys  but you wont believe conrademy conrade that never told a falsehood in his life cried the mother with a flush in her cheeks and a bright glance in her soft eyes you want me to punish him for what he hasnt done  how much alike mothers are in all classes of life thought rachel and much in the way in which she would have brought zacks mother to reason by threats of expulsion from the shoeclub she observed well fanny one thing is clear while you are so weak as to let that boy go on in his deceit unrepentant and unpunished i can have no more to do with his education  indeed softly said fanny i am afraid so rachel you have taken a great deal of trouble but conrade declares he will never say a lesson to you again and i dont quite see how to make him after this  oh very well then theres an end of it i am sorry for you fanny  and away walked rachel and as she went towards the gate two artificial jets deau making a considerable curve in the air alighted the one just before her the other better aimed in the back of her neck she had too much dignity to charge back upon the offenders but she went home full of the story of fannys lamentable weakness and prognostications of the misery she was entailing on herself her mother and sister were both much concerned and thought fanny extremely foolish mrs curtis consoling herself with the hope that the boys would be cured and tamed at school and begging that they might never be let loose in the park again rachel could not dwell much longer on the matter for she had to ride to upper avon park to hold council on the books to be ordered for the bookclub for if she did got go herself whatever she wanted especially was always set aside as too something or other for the rest of the subscribers  mrs curtis was tired and stayed at home and grace spent the afternoon in investigations about the harrying of the thrushes but alas without coming a bit nearer the truth nothing was seen or heard of lady temple till at halfpast nine one of the midges or diminutive flies used at avonmonth came to the door and fanny came into the drawingroomwan tearful agitated  dear rachel i am so afraid i was hasty i could not sleep without coming to tell you how sorry i am  then you are convinced i knew you would be  oh yes i have just been sitting by him after he was gone to bed he never goes to sleep till i have done that and he always tells me if anything is on his mind i could not ask him again it would have been insulting him but he went over it all of himself and owned he ought not to have put a finger on the edge of the nest but he wanted so to see what it was lined with otherwise he never touched it he says poor boy that it was only your being a civilian that made you not able to believe him i am sure you must believe him now  mrs curtis began in her gentle way about the difficulty of believing ones children in fault but lady temple was entirely past accepting the possibility of conrades being to blame in this particular instance it made her bristle up again so that even rachel saw the impossibility of pressing it and trusted to some signal confutation to cure her of her infatuation but she was as affectionate as ever only wanting to be forgiven for the mornings warmth and to assure dear aunt curtis dear grace and dearest rachel in particular that there was no doing without them and it was the greatest blessing to be near them  oh and the squirting dear rachel i was so sorry when i found it out it was only francie and leo i was very angry with them for it and i should like to make them ask pardon only i dont think francie would im afraid they are very rude boys i must write to the major to find me a governess that wont be very strict with them and if she could be an officers daughter the boys would respect her so much more     chapter iii mackarel lane     for i would lonely stand   uplifting my white hand   on a mission on a mission   to declare the coming vision                elizabeth barrett browning   well grace all things considered perhaps i had better walk down with you to mackarel lane and then i can form a judgment on these williamses without committing fanny  then you do not intend to go on teaching  not while conrade continues to brave me and is backed up by poor fanny  i might speak to miss williams after church and bring her in to myrtlewood for fanny to see  yes that might do in time but i shall make up my mind first poor fanny is so easily led that we must take care what influences fall in her way  i always wished you would call  yes and i would not by way of patronage to please mr touchett but this is for a purpose and i hope we shall find both sisters at home  mackarel lane was at right angles to the shore running up the valley of the avon but it soon ceased to be fishy and became agricultural owning a few cottages of very humble gentility which were wont to hang out boards to attract lodgers of small means at one of these grace rang and obtained admittance to a parlour with crazy french windows opening on a little strip of garden in a large wheeled chair between the fire and the window surrounded by numerous little appliances for comfort and occupation sat the invalid miss williams holding out her hand in welcome to the guests  a fine countenance what one calls a fine countenance thought rachel is it a delusion of insipidity as usual the brow is good massive too much for the features but perhaps they were fuller once eyes bright and vigorous hazel the colour for thought complexion meant to be brilliant brunette a pleasant glow still hair with threads of grey i hope she does not affect youth she cant be less than one or two and thirty many people set up for beauties with far less claim what is the matter with her it is not the countenance of deformityaccident i should say yes it is all favourable except the dress what a material what a pattern did she get it secondhand from a ladysmaid will there be an incongruity in her conversation to match let us see grace making inquiriesquite at my bestah she is not one of the morbid sort never thinking themselves better  i was afraid i had not seen you out for some time  no going out is a troublesome business and sitting in the garden answers the same purpose  of air perhaps but hardly of change or of view  oh i assure you there is a wonderful variety she answered with an eager and brilliant smile  clouds and sunsets asked rachel beginning to be interested  yes differing every day then i have the tamarisk and its inhabitants there has been a tomtits nest every year since we came and that provides us with infinite amusement besides the seagulls are often so good as to float high enough for me to see them there is a wonderful charm in a circumcribed view because one is obliged to look well into it all  yes eyes and no eyes apply there said rachel  we found a great prize too the other day rosie  at the call a brownhaired browneyed child of seven looking like a little fawn sprang to the window from the outside  my dear will you show the sphynx to miss curtis  the little girl daintily brought a box covered with net in which a huge applegreen caterpillar with dashes of bright colour on his sides and a horny spike on his tail was feasting upon tamarisk leaves grace asked if she was going to keep it yes till it buries itself said the child aunt ermine thinks it is the elephant sphynx  i cannot be sure said the aunt my sister tried to find a figure of it at villars but he had no book that gave the caterpillars do you care for those creatures  i like to watch them said grace but i know nothing about them scientifically rachel does that  then can you help us to the history of our sphynx asked miss williams with her pleasant look  i will see if i have his portrait said rachel but i doubt it i prefer general principles to details  dont you find working out details the best way of entering into general principles  it was new to rachel to find the mention of a general principle received neither with a stare nor a laugh and she gathered herself up to answer naming and collecting is not science  and masonry is not architecture but you cant have architecture without it  one can have broad ideas without all the petty work of flower botanists and butterfly naturalists  dont you think the broad ideas would be rather of the hearsay order at least to most people unless their application were worked out in the trifle that came first to hand  experimental philosophy said rachel in rather a considering tone as if the notion when presented to her in plain english required translation into the language of her thoughts  if you like to call it so said miss williams with a look of arch fun for instance the great art of mud pie taught us the porous nature of clay the expansive power of steam etc etc  you had some one to improve it to you  oh dear no only afterwards when we read of such things we remembered how our clay manufactures always burst in the baking unless they were well dried first  then you had the rare power of elucidating a principle  no not i my brother had but i could only perceive the confirmation  this reminds me of an interesting article on the edgeworth system of education in the travellers review i will send it down to you  thank you but i have it here  indeed and do you not think it excellent and quite agree with it  yes i quite agree with it and there was an odd look in her bright transparent eyes that made grace speculate whether she could have heard that agreement with the invalid in the travellers review was one of the primary articles of faith acquired by rachel  but grace though rather proud of rachels falling under the spell of miss williams conversation deemed an examination rather hard on her and took the opportunity of asking for her sister  she is generally at home by this time but this is her last day at cliff cottages and she was to stay late to help in the packing up  will she be at home for the present asked grace  yes rose and i are looking forward to a festival of her  grace was not at all surprised to hear rachel at once commit herself with my cousin lady temple and rush into the matter in hand as if secure that the other miss williams would educate on the principles of the invalid but full in the midst there was a sound of wheels and a ring at the bell miss williams quietly signed to her little attendant to put a chair in an accessible place and in walked lady temple mrs curtis and the middle brace of boys  the room will be too full was graces aside to her sister chiefly thinking of her mother but also of their hostess but rachel returned for answer i must see about it and grace could only remove herself into the verandah and try to attract leoline and hubert after her but failing in this she talked to the far more conversible rose about the bullfinch that hung at the window which loved no one but aunt ermine and scolded and pecked at every one else and augustus the beloved tame toad that lived in a hole under a tree in the garden mrs curtis considerate and tenderhearted startled to find her daughter in the field and wishing her niece to begin about her own affairs talked commonplace by way of filling up the time and rachel had her eyes free for a range of the apartment the foundation was the dull thirdrate lodginghouse the superstructure told of other scenes one end of the room was almost filled by the frameless portrait of a dignified clergyman who would have had far more justice done to him by greater distance a beautifullypainted miniature of a lady with short waist and small crisp curls was the centre of a system of photographs over the mantelpiece a large crayon sketch showed three sisters between the ages of six and sixteen sentimentalizing over a flowerbasket a pair of watercolour drawings represented a handsome church and comfortable parsonage and the domestic gallery was completed by two printsone of a middleaged countymember the other one of chalons ladylike matrons in wateredsilk aprons with some difficulty rachel read on the one the autograph j t beauchamp and on the other the inscription the lady alison beauchamp the tablecover was of tasteful silk patchwork the vase in the centre was of red earthenware but was encircled with real ivy leaves gummed on in their freshness and was filled with wild flowers books filled every corner and rachel felt herself out of the muchloathed region of commonplace but she could not recover from her surprise at the audacity of such an independent measure on the part of her cousin and under cover of her mothers civil talk said to fanny i never expected to see you here  my aunt thought of it said fanny and as she seems to find the children too much  she broke off for mrs curtis had paused to let her introduce the subject but poor fanny had never taken the initiative and rachel did it for her by explaining that all had come on the same errand to ask if miss williams would undertake the lessons of her nephews lady temple softly murmured under her veil something about hopes and too much trouble an appointment was made for the following morning and mrs curtis with a general sensation of an oppressive multitude in a small room took her leave and the company departed fanny all the way home hoping that the other miss williams would be like her sister pitying the cripple wishing that the sisters were in the remotest degree military so as to obtain the respect of the hoys and wondering what would be the majors opinion  so many ladies exclaimed little rose aunt ermine have they made your head ache  no my dear thank you i am only tired if you will pull out the rest for my feet i will be quiet a little and be ready for tea when aunt ailie comes  the child handily converted the chair into a couch arranging the dress and coverings with the familiarity of long use and by no means shocked by the contraction and helplessness of the lower limbs to which she had been so much accustomed all her life that it never even occurred to her to pity aunt ermine who never treated herself as an object of compassion she was thanked by a tender pressure on her hair and then saying  now i shall wish augustus good night bring violetta home from her play in the garden and let her drink tea and go to bed  ah violetta purchased with a silver groat what was not your value in mackarel lane were you not one of its most considered inhabitants scarcely less a child of aunt ermine and aunt alison than their rosebud herself  murmur murmur rippled the childs happy lowtoned monologue directed to her silent but sufficient playmate and so far from disturbing the aunt that more than one smile played on her lips at the quaint fancies and at the well of gladness in the young spirit which made day after day of the society of a cripple and an old doll one constant song of bliss one dream of bright imaginings surely it was an equalization of blessings that rendered little lonely rose motherless and well nigh fatherless poor with no companion but a crippled aunt a bird and a toad with scarcely a toy and never a party of pleasure one of the most joyous beings under the sun free from occasions of childish troubles without collisions of temper with few contradictions and with lessons rather pleasure than toil perhaps ermine did not take into account the sunshiny content and cheerfulness that made herself a delightful companion and playfellow able to accept the child as her solace not her burthen  presently rose looked up and meeting the bright pleasant eyes observedvioletta has been very good and said all her lessons quite perfect and she would like to sit up till her aunt ailie comes home do you think she may  will she not be tired tomorrow  oh then she will be lazy and not get up when she is called till i pull all the clothes off and that will be fun  or she may be fretful now  a series of little squeaks ensued followed by now my love that is taking a very unfair advantage of my promise you will make your poor aunt ermines head ache and i shall have to send you to bed  would not a story pass away the time  you tell it aunt ermine your stories are always the best and let there be a fairy in it  the fairy had nearly performed her part when the arrival took place and rose darted forward to receive aunt ailies greeting kiss  yes rosieyes violetta what do you think i have got for you  and out came a dolls chair with a broken leg condemned by the departing pupils and granted with a laugh to the governesss request to take it to her little niece but never in its best days had the chair been so prized it was introduced to violetta as the reward of virtue for having controlled her fretfulness and the repair of its infirmity was the first consideration that occupied all the three after all violettas sitting posture was as alison observed an example of the inclined plane but that was nothing to rose and the seance would have been indefinitely prolonged but for considerations for violettas health  the sisters were alike and alison had like her elder what is emphatically called countenance but her features were less chiselled and her dark straight brows so nearly met that as rose had once remarked they made a bridge of one arch instead of two six years younger in full health and daily battling with the world alison had a remarkable look of concentration and vigour her upright bearing clear decided speech and glance of kindness won instant respect and reliance but her face missed the radiant beamy brightness of her sisters her face was sweet and winning but it was not habitual with her and there was about her a look as if some terrible wave of grief or suffering had swept over her ere yet the features were fully fixed and had thus moulded her expression for life but playfulness was the tone that reigned around ermines couch at ordinary moments and beside her the grave alison was lively not with effort but by infection  there she said holding up a cheque now well have a jubilee and take you down under the east cliff and well invest a shilling in ivanhoe and rose and violetta shall open their ears  and you shall have a respectable sunday mantle  oh i dare say julia will send us a box  then you will have to put a label on your back secondhand or her velvet will be a scandal i cant wear out that at home like this flagrant flowery thing that i saw miss curtis looking at as rather a disreputable article theres preferment for you ailie what do you think of a generals widow with six boys she is come after you we had a great invasionthree curtises and this pretty little widow and various sons  will she stay  most likely for she is a relation of mrs curtis and comes to be near her you are to call for inspection at eleven oclock tomorrow so i fear your holiday will be short  well the less play the less anxiety how many drives will the six young gentlemen be worth to you  i am afraid it will be at the cost of tough work to you she looked to me too sweet a creature to have broken her sons in but i should think she would be pleasant to deal with  if she be like miss curtis i am sure she will  miss curtis my old friend you mean she was rather suppressed today and i began to comprehend the reason of the shudder with which mr touchett speaks of the dogmatical young lady  i hope she did not overwhelm you  oh no i rather liked her she was so earnest and spirited i could fancy enjoying a good passage at arms with her if these were old times but i hope she will not take the direction of your schoolroom though she is an admirer of the educational papers in the traveller  and here the discussion was ended by the entrance of little rose with the preliminaries of the evening meal after which she went to bed and the aunts took out books work and writing materials  alisons report the next day waswell she is a very sweet creature there is something indescribably touching in her voice and eyes so soft and wistful especially when she implores one not to be hard on those great scrambling boys of hers  so she is your fate  oh yes if there had been ten more engagements offered i could not have helped accepting hers even if it had not been on the best terms i have ever had  what  seventyfor the hours between nine and five pretty well for a journeyman hack is it not indeed the pretty things only fear seemed to be that she was requiring too much and offering too little no not her only fear for there is some major in the distance to whose approval everything must be subjectuncle or guardian i suppose but he seemed to be rather an object of jealousy to the younger miss curtis for every hint of wishing to wait for the major made her press on the negotiations  seventy i hope you will make it do ailie it would be a great relief  and spare your brains not a little yes i do trust to keeping it for lady temple is delightful and as to the boys i fancy it is only taming they want the danger is as miss rachel told me whether she can bear the sight of the process i imagine miss rachel herself has tried it and failed  part amateur work said ermine smiling it really is lucky you had to turn governess ailie or there would have been a talent thrown away  stay till i have tried said alison who had however had experience enough not to be much alarmed at the prospect order was wont to come with her presence and she hardly knew the aspect of tumultuous idleness or insubordination to unenforced authority for her eye and voice in themselves brought cheerful discipline without constraint and upheld by few punishments for the strong influence took away the spirit of rebellion  after her first mornings work she came home full of good auguries the boys had been very pleasant with her after the first ten minutes and conrade had gained her heart by his attention to his mother he had however examined her minutely whether she had any connexion with the army and looked grave on her disavowal of any relationship with soldiers hubert adding you see aunt rachel is only a civilian and she hasnt any sense at all and when francis had been reduced to the much disliked process of spelling unknown words he had muttered under his breath she was only a civilian to which she had rejoined that at least she knew thus much that the first military duty was obedience and franciss instant submission proved that she had made a good shot of the major she had heard much more everything was referred to him both by mother and children and alison was the more puzzled as to his exact connexion with them i sometimes suspect she said that he may have felt the influence of those winsome brown eyes and caressing manner as i know i should if i were a man i wonder how long the old general has been dead no ermine you need not shake your head at me i dont mean even to let miss curtis tell me if she would i know confidences from partisan relations are the most mischiefmaking things in the world  in pursuance of this principle alison or miss williams as she was called in her vocation was always reserved and discreet and though ready to talk in due measure rachel always felt that it was the upper not the under current that was proffered the brow and eyes the whole spirit of the face betokened reflection and acuteness and rachel wanted to attain to her opinions but beyond a certain depth there was no reaching her ways of thinking her views of the childrens characters her estimate of mr touchettnay even her tastes as to the invalids letters in the travellers review remained only partially revealed in spite of rachels best efforts at fishing and attempting to set the example  it really seemed as she observed to grace as if the more i talk the less she says at which grace gave way to a small short laugh though she owned the force of rachels maxim that to bestow confidence was the way to provoke it and forbore to refer to a certain delightful afternoon that rachel in her childhood had spent alone with a little girl whom she had never discovered to be deaf and dumb still rachel had never been able to make out why grace with no theories at all got so many more confidences than she did she was fully aware of her sisters superior attractiveness to commonplace people and made her welcome to stand first with the chief of their kindred and most of the clergy and young ladies around but it was hard that where rachel really liked and met halfway the intimate confidence should always be bestowed upon grace or even the mother she had yet to learn that the way to draw out a snail is not to grasp its horns and that halfway meeting is not to launch ones self to the opposite starting point either her inquiries were too point blank to invite detailed replies or her own communications absorbed her too much to leave room for a return thus she told miss williams the whole story of the thrushs nest and all her own reflections upon the characteristics it betokened and only afterwards on thinking over the conversation perceived that she had elicited nothing but that it was very difficult to judge in such cases not even any decided assent to her own demonstrations it was true that riots and breaches of the peace ceased while miss williams was in the house and learning and good manners were being fast acquired but until conrades duplicity should be detected or the whole disposition of the family discussed with herself rachel doubted the powers of the instructress it was true that fanny was very happy with her and only regretted that the uncertainty of the majors whereabouts precluded his being informed of the newlyfound treasure but fanny was sure to be satisfied as long as her boys were happy and not very naughty and she cared very little about peoples minds  if any one did get on with the governess it was grace who had been the first acquaintance in the family and met her often in the service of the parish as well as in her official character at the homestead it so chanced that one sunday afternoon they found themselves simultaneously at the door of the schoolhouse whence issued not the customary hum but loud sounds of singing  ah said grace mr touchett was talking of getting the choir master from avoncester and giving up an afternoon to practice for easter but he never told me it was to be today  on inquiry it appeared that notice had been given in the morning but not till after miss williams had gone home to fetch her little niece and while rachel was teaching her boys in the classroom out of hearing it was one of the little bits of bad management that were sure to happen wherever poor mr touchett was concerned and both ladies feeling it easy to overlook for themselves were thankful that it had not befallen rachel alison williams thinking it far to walk either to the homestead or myrtlewood before church proposed to grace to come home with her an offer that was thankfully accepted with merely the scruple whether she should disturb the invalid  oh no it would be a great pleasure i always wish we could get more change and variety for her on sunday  she is very selfdenying to spare you to the school  i have often wished to give it up but she never will let me she says it is one of the few things we can do and i see besides that it brings her fresh interests she knows about all my class and works for them and has them to see her and i am sure it is better for her though it leaves her more hours alone with rose  and the sunday services are too long for her  not so much that as that she cannot sit on those narrow benches unless two are put close together so that she can almost lie and there is not room for her chair in the aisle on a sunday it is the greatest deprivation of all  it is so sad and she is so patient and so energetic said grace using her favourite monosyllable in peace out of rachels hearing  you would say so indeed if you really knew her or how she has found strength and courage for me through all the terrible sutfering  then does she suffer so much  oh no not now that was in the first years  it was not always so  no indeed you thought it deformity oh no no she was so beautiful  that she is still i never saw my sister so much struck with any one there is something so striking in her bright glance out of those clear eyes  ah if you had only seen her bloom before  the accident  i burnt her said alison almost inaudibly  you you poor dear how dreadful for you  yes i burnt her said alison more steadily you ought not to be kind to me without knowing about it it was an accident of course but it was a fit of petulance i threw a match without looking where it was going  it must have been when you were very young  fourteen i was in a naughty fit at her refusing to go to the great musical meeting with us we always used to go to stay at one of the canons houses for it a house where one was dull and shy and i could not bear going without her nor understand the reason  and was there a reason  yes poor dear ermine she knew he meant to come there to meet her and she thought it would not be right because his father had objected so strongly and made him exchange into a regiment on foreign service  and you did not know this  no i was away all the time it was going on with my eldest sister having masters in london i did not come home till it was all over and then i could not understand what was the matter with the house or why ermine was unlike herself and papa restless and anxious about her they thought me too young to be told and the atmosphere made me cross and fretful and papa was displeased with me and ermine tried in vain to make me good poor patient ermine even then the chief sufferer  i can quite imagine the discomfort and fret of being in ignorance all the time  dear ermine says she longed to tell me but she had been forbidden and she went on blaming herself and trying to make me enjoy my holidays as usual till this dreadful day when i had worried her intolerably about going to this music meeting and she found reasoning only made me worse she still wrote her note of refusal and asked me to light the taper i dashed down the match in a frenzy of temper and  she paused for breath and grace squeezed her hand  we did not see it at first and then she threw herself down and ordered me not to come near every one was there directly i believe but it burst out again and again and was not put out till they all thought she had not an hour to live there was no pain and there she lay all calmness comforting us all and making papa and edward promise to forgive meme who only wished they would kill me and the next day he came he was just going to sail and they thought nothing would hurt her then i saw him while he was waiting and never did i see such a fixed deathly face but they said she found words to cheer and soothe him  and what became of him  we do not know as long as lady alison lived his aunt she let us hear about him and we knew he was recovering from his wound then came her death and then my fathers and all the rest and we lost sight of the beauchamps we saw the name in the gazette as killed at lucknow but not the right christian name nor the same rank but then though the regiment is come home we have heard nothing of him and though she has never spoken of him to me i am sure ermine believes he is dead and thinks of him as part of the sunshine of the old beauchamp daysthe sunshine whose reflection lasts ones life  he ought to be dead said grace  yes it would be better for her than to hear anything else of him he had nothing of his own so there would have been a long waiting but his father and brother would not hear of it and accused us of entrapping him and that angered my father for our family is quite good and we were very well off then my father had a good private fortune besides the rectory at beauchamp and lady alison who had been like a mother to us ever since our own died quite thought that the prospect was good enough and i believe got into a great scrape with her family for having promoted the affair  your squires wife  yes and julia and ermine had come every day to learn lessons with her daughters i was too young but as long as she lived we were all like one family how kind she was how she helped us through those frightful weeks  of your sisters illness it must have lasted long  long oh longer than long no one thought of her living the doctors said the injury was too extensive to leave any power of rallying but she was young and strong and did not die in the torture though people said that such an existence as remained to her was not worth the anguish of struggling back to it i think my father only prayed that she might suffer less and julia stayed on and on thinking each day would be the last till dr long could not spare her any longer and then lady alison nursed her night after night and day after day till she had worn herself into an illness and when the doctors spoke of improvement we only perceived worse agony it was eight months before she was even lifted up in bed and it was years before the burns ceased to be painful or the constitution at all recovered the shock and even now weather tells on her though since we have lived here she has been far better than i ever dared to hope  then you consider her still recovering  in general health she is certainly greatly restored and has strength to attempt more but the actual injury the contraction can never be better than now when we lived at richmond she had constantly the best advice and we were told that nothing more could be hoped for  i wonder more and more at her high spirits i suppose that was what chiefly helped to carry her through  i have seen a good many people said alison pausing but i never did see any one so happy others are always wanting something she never is every enjoyment seems to be tenfold to her what it is to other people she sees the hopeful side of every sorrow no burthen is a burthen when one has carried it to her  as alison spoke she pushed open the narrow green door of the little lodginghouse and there issued a weak sweet sound of voices the strain upraise of joy and praise it was the same that had met their ears at the schooldoor but the want of body in the voices was fully compensated by the heartfelt ring as if here indeed was praise not practice  aunt ailie o aunt ailie cried the child as the roomdoor opened and showed the little choir consisting of herself her aunt and the small maid of the house you should not have come you were not to hear us till trinity sunday  explanations were given and miss curtis was welcomed but alison still too much moved for ordinary conversation slipped into the bedroom adjoining followed by her sisters quick and anxious eye and halfuttered inquiry  i am afraid it is my fault said grace she has been telling me about your accident  poor ailie said ermine she never will receive kindness without having that unlucky story out it is just one of the things that get so cruelly exaggerated by consequences it was one moments petulance that might have caused a fright and been forgotten ever after but for those chemicals ah i see she said nothing about them because they were edwards they were some parcels for his experiments gun cotton and the like which were lying in the window till he had time to take them upstairs we had all been so long threatened with being blown up by his experiments that we had grown callous and careless and it served us right she added stroking the childs face as it looked at her earnest to glean fresh fragments of the terrible halfknown tale of the past yes rosie when you go and keep house for papa on the top of the oural mountains or wherever it may be you are to remember that if aunt ermine had not been in a foolish inattentive mood and had taken his dangerous goods out of the way she might have been trotting to church now like other people but poor ailie has always helped herself to the whole blame and if every childish fit of temper were the root of such qualities what a world we should have here  ah no wonder she is devoted to you  the child was not fifteen had never known cross or care but from that moment she never was out of my room if it was possible to be in and when nurse after nurse was fairly worn out because i could not help being so distressing there was always that poor child always handy and helpful growing to be the chief dependence and looking so piteously imploring whatever was tried that it really helped me to go through with it poor ailie she added with an odd turn of playfulness i always fancied those frowns of anxiety made her eyebrows grow together and ever since we came here we know how she has worked away for her old cinder and her small rosebud dont we she added playfully squeezing the childs cheeks up into a more budding look hiding deeper and more overcoming feelings by the sportive action and as her sister came back she looked up and shook her head at her saying  you gossiping ailie to go ripping up old grievances i am going to ask miss curtis not to let the story go any farther now you have relieved your mind of it  i did tell lady temple said alison i never think it right not to let people know what sort of person they have to teach their children  and grace on feeling her way discovered that lady temple had been told the bare fact in miss williamss reserved and businesslike manner but with nothing of the affair that had led to it she merely looked on it in the manner fully expressed byah poor thing how sad for her as a shocking secret never to be talked of or thought about and that voluntary detailed relation from alison could only be regarded as drawn forth by graces own individual power of winning confidence and the friendliness that had so long subsisted between them nor indeed was the reserve regarding the cause of the present reduced circumstances of the sisters at all lessened it was only known that their brother had ruined them by a fraudulent speculation and had then fled to the continent leaving them burthened with the maintenance of his child but that they refused to believe in his guilt and had thus incurred the displeasure of other relatives and friends alison was utterly silent about him ermine seemed to have a tender pleasure in bringing in a reference to his ways as if all were well and it were a matter of course to speak of edward but it was plain that ermines was an outspoken nature this might however be only because the one had been a guarded sheltered invalid while the other had gone forth among strangers to battle for a livelihood and moreover the elder sister had been fully grown and developed before the shock which had come on the still unformed alison  at any rate nobody but grace got on with the governess while the invalid made friends with all who visited her and most signally with rachel who ere long esteemed her environment a good work worthy of herself the charity of sitting with a twaddling muffateeknitting old lady was indisputable but it was perfectly within graces capacity and rachel believed herself to be far more capable of entertaining the sick miss williams nor was she mistaken when excited or interested most people thought her oppressive but ermine williams except when unwell did not find her so and even then a sharp debate was sometimes a cure for the nervous ailments induced by the monotony of her life they seemed to have a sort of natural desire to rub their minds one against the other and rachel could not rest without miss williamss opinion of all that interested herpaper essay book or event but often when expecting to confer a favour by the loan she found that what was new to her was already well known in that little parlour and even the authorship no mystery ermine explained this by her correspondence with literary friends of her brothers and countrybred rachel to whom literature was still an oracle unconnected with living agencies listened yes absolutely listened to her anecdotes of sayings and doings far more like clever memoirs than the experiences of the banks of the avon perhaps there was this immediate disadvantage that hearing of a more intellectual tone of society tended to make rachel less tolerant of that which surrounded her and especially of mr touchett it was droll that having so long shunned the two sisters under the impression that they were his protegees and worshippers she found that ermines point of view was quite the rectorial one and that to venerate the man for his office sake was nearly as hard to ermine as to herself though the office was more esteemed  alison the reserved had held her tongue on his antecedents but ermine was drawn into explaining that his father had been a minor canon who had eked out his means with a combination of chaplaincies and parts of curacies and by teaching at the school where his son was educated indignant at the hack estimation in which his father had been held the son far more justly viewing both the dignity and duty of his office was resolved to be respected but bred up in second rate society had neither weight talent nor manners to veil his aggressive selfassertion and he was at this time especially trying to the curtises  cathedral music had been too natural to him for the endurance of an unchoral service and the prime labour of his life was to work up his choir but he was musical by education rather than nature and having begun his career with such mortal offence to the native fiddlers and singers as to impel them into the arms of dissent he could only supply the loss from the school by his own voice of which he was not chary though using it with better will than taste the staple of his choir were rachels scholars her turn had always been for boys and her class on sunday mornings and two evenings in the week had long been in operation before the reign of mr touchett then two lads whose paternal fiddles had seceded to the plymouth brethren were suspended from all advantages by the curate and rachel was with difficulty withheld from an explosion but even this was less annoying than the summons at the classroom door every sunday morning that in the midst of her lesson carried off the chief of her scholars to practise their chants moreover the blame of all imperfect lessons was laid on the singing for the parson and all faults in the singing by the tasks for miss rachel and one night the excellent zack excused his failure in geography by saying that mr touchett had thrown away his book and said that it was no better than sacrilege omitting however to mention that he had been caught studying it under his surplice during the lessons  at last with his usual fatality the curate fixed the grand practice for the saturday evenings that were rachels great days for instruction in the three rs and for a sort of popular lecture cricket was to succeed the singing and novelty carried the day but only by the desertion of her scholars did rachel learn the new arrangement and she could hardly credit the assertion that the curate was not aware that it was her day in fact it was the only one when the fisher lads were sure not to be at sea and neither party would yield it mr touchett was determined not to truckle to dictation from the great house so when rachel declared she would have nothing to do with the boys unless the saturdays were conceded to her he owned that he thought the clergyman had the first right to his lads and had only not claimed them before out of deference for the feelings of a wellmeaning parishioner  both parties poured out their grievances to the same auditor for mr touchett regarded ermine williams as partly clerical and rachel could never be easy without her sympathy to hear was not however to make peace while each side was so sore so conscious of the merits of its own case so blind to those of the other one deemed praise in its highest form the prime object of his ministry the other found the performance indevotional and raved that education should be sacrificed to wretched music but that the dissension was sad and mischievous it would have been very diverting they were both so young in their incapacity of making allowances their certainty that theirs was the theory to bring in the golden age and even in their magnanimity of forgiveness and all the time they thought themselves so very old i am resigned to disappointments i have seen something of lifeyou forget miss williams that my ministerial experience is not very recent  there was one who would have smoothed matters far better than any who like ermine took her weapons from the armoury of good sense but that person was entirely unconscious how the incumbent regarded her soft eyes meek pensiveness motherly sweetness and above all the refined graceful dignity that remained to her from the leading station she had occupied her gracious respect towards her clergyman was a contrast as much to the deferential coquetry of his admirers as to the abruptness of his foe and her indifference to parish details had even its charm in a world of fussiness he did not know himself how far a wish of hers would have led him and she was the last person to guess she viewed him like all else outside her nursery as something out of the focus of her eye her instinct regarded her clergyman as necessarily good and worthy and her ear heard rachel railing at him it sounded hard but it was a pity rachel should be vexed and interfered with in fact she never thought of the matter at all it was only part of that outer kind of dreamy stageplay at avonmouth in which she let herself he moved about at her cousins bidding one part of her life had passed away from her and what remained to her was among her children her interests and intelligence seemed contracted to conrades horizon and as to everything else she was subdued gentle obedient but slow and obtuse  yet little as he knew it mr touchett might have even asserted his authority in a still more trying manner if the gentle little widow had not cast a halo round her relatives he could have preached that sermon upon the homekeeping duties of women or have been too much offended to accept any service from the curtis family and he could have done without them for he had a wide middleclass popularity his manners with the secondrate society in which he had been bred were just sufficiently superior and flattering to recommend all his best points and he obtained plenty of subscriptions from visitors and of cooperation from inhabitants many a young lady was in a flutter at the approach of the spruce little figure in black and so many volunteers were there for parish work that districts and classes were divided and subdivided till it sometimes seemed as if the only difficulty was to find poor people enough who would submit to serve as the corpus vile for their charitable treatment  for it was not a really poor population the men were seafaring the women lacemaking and just well enough off to make dissent doubly attractive as an escape from some of the interfering almsgiving of the place overvisiting criticism of dress and inquisitorial examinations had made more than one primitive methodist and no severe distress had been so recent as to render the women tolerant of troublesome weekly inspections the curtis sisters were however regarded as an exception they were viewed as real gentlefolks not only by their own tenants but by all who were conscious of their hereditary claims to respect they did not care whether hair were long or short and their benefits were more substantial and reliable than could be looked for from the casual visitors and petty gentry around so that sundry houses that were forbidden ground to district visitors were ready to grant them a welcome  one of these belonged to the most able lacemaker in the place a hardworking woman who kept seven little pupils in a sort of cupboard under the staircase with a window into the back garden because said she they did no work if they looked out into the front there were so many gapsies these gapsies consisting of the very scanty traffic of the further end of mackarel lane for ten hours a day did these children work in a space just wide enough for them to sit with the two least under the slope of the stairs permitted no distraction from their bobbins but invaded by their mistress on the faintest sound of tongues into this hotbed of sprigs was admitted a child who had been a special favourite at school an orphan niece of the head of the establishment the two brothers had been lost together at sea and while the one widow became noted for her lace the other a stranger to the art had maintained herself by small millinery and had not sacrificed her little girl to the moloch of lace but had kept her at school to a later age than usual in the place but the mother died and the orphan was at once adopted by the aunt with the resolve to act the truly kind part by her and break her in to lacemaking that determination was a great blow to the school visitors the girls were in general so young or so stupefied with their work that an intelligent girl like lovedy kelland was no small treasure to them there were designs of making her a pupil teacher in a few years and offers and remonstrances rained in upon her aunt but they had no effect mrs kelland was persuaded that the child had been spoilt by learning and in truth poor lovedy was a refractory scholar she was too lively to bear the confinement patiently her mind was too much awake not to rebel against the dulness and her fingers had not been brought into training early enough her incessant tears spoilt her thread and mrs kelland decided that shed never get her bread till she was broke of her buke which breaking was attempted by a summary pawning of all poor lovedys reward books the poor child confided her loss to her young lady teacher at the sunday school the young lady being new young and inflammable reproached mrs kelland with dishonesty and tyranny to the orphan and in return was nearly frightened out of her wits by such a scolding as only such a woman as the lace mistress could deliver then mr touchett tried his hand and though he did not meet with quite so much violence all he heard was that she had given lovedy the stick for being such a little tod as to complain when she knew the money for the bukes was put safe away in her moneybox she was not going to the sunday schule again not she to tell stories against her best friends and when the next district visitor came that way the door was shut in her face with the tract thrown out at the opening and an intimation in mrs kellands shrill voice that no more bukes were wanted she got plenty from miss curtis  these bukes from miss curtis were sanatory tracts which rachel was constantly bestowing and which on sundays mrs kelland spelt through with her finger under the line in happy ignorance whether the subject were temporal or spiritual and feeling herself in the exemplary discharge of a sunday duty moreover old feudal feeling made rachel be unmolested when she came down twice a week opened the door of the blackhole under the stairs and read aloud something religious something improving and a bit of a story following it up by mental arithmetic and a lesson on objects which seemed to mrs kelland the most arrant nonsense in the world and to her wellbroken scholars was about as interesting as the humming of a bluebottle fly but it was poor lovedys one enjoyment though making such havoc of her work that it was always expiated by extra hours not on her pillow but at it  these visits of rachel were considered to encourage the kelland refractoriness and it was officially intimated that it would be wise to discontinue them and that it was thought better to withdraw from mrs kelland all that direct patronage of her trade by which the ladies had enabled her to be in some degree independent of the middlemen who absorbed so much of the profit from the workers grace and rachel sufficiently old inhabitants to remember the terrible wreck that had left her a struggling widow felt this a hard not to say a vindictive decision they had long been a kind of agents for disposing of her wares at a distance and feeling that the woman had received provocation grace was not disposed to give her up while rachel loudly averred that neither mr touchett nor any of his ladies had any right to interfere and she should take no notice  but said grace can we run counter to our clergymans direct wishes  yes when he steps out of his province my dear grace you grew up in the days of curatolatry but it wont do men are fallible even when they preach in a surplice and you may be thankful to me that you and fanny are not both led along in a string in the train of mr touchetts devotees  i wish i knew what was right to do said grace quietly and she remained wishing it after rachel had said a great deal more but the upshot of it was that one day when grace and fanny were walking together on the esplanade they met mr touchett and grace said to him we have been thinking it over and we thought perhaps you would not wish us not to give any orders to mrs kelland i know she has behaved very ill but i dont see how she is to get on and she has this child on her hands  i know said mr touchett but really it was flagrant  oh said lady temple gently i dare say she didnt mean it and you could not be hard on a widow  well said mr touchett miss brown was very much put out andandit is a great pity about the child but i never thought myself that such strong measures would do any good  then you will not object to her being employed  no not at all from a distance it is not the same thing as close at home it wont be an example  thank you said grace and i am so glad said lady temple and mr touchett went on his way lightened of his fear of having let his zealous coadjutors oppress the hardworking and far more brightened by the sweet smile of requital but all the time doubtful whether he had been weak as to the victory rachel only laughed and said if it made grace more comfortable it was well except for that acknowledgment of mr touchetts jurisdiction  a few days after rachel made her appearance in mackerel lane and announced her intention of consulting ermine williams under seal of secrecy i have an essay that i wish you to judge of before i send it to the traveller  indeed said ermine her colour rising would it not be better  oh i know what you mean but dont scruple on that score at my age with a mother like mine it is simply to avoid teasing and excitement that i am silent  i was going to say i was hardly a fair  because of your different opinions but those go for nothing you are a worthy antagonist and enter into my views as my mother and sister cannot do even while you oppose them  but i dont think i can help you even if  i dont want help i only want you to judge of the composition in fact i read it to you that i may hear it myself  ermine resigned herself  curatolatry is a species  i beg your pardon  curatolatry ah i thought that would attract attention  but i am afraid the scholars would fall foul of it  why have not they just made mariolatry  yes but they are very severe on hybrids between latin and greek  it is not worth while to boggle at trifles when one has an expressive term said rachel if it turns into english that is all that is wanted  would it not be rather a pity if it should turn into english might it not be hard to brand with a contemptuous name what does more good than harm  that sickly mixture of flirtation and hero worship with a religious daub as a salve to the conscience  laugh it down and what do you leave in miss austens time silly girls ran to balls after militiamen now if they run to schools and charities more for the curates sake than they quite know is not the alternative better  it is greater humbug said rachel but i knew you would not agree at least beforehand it is appreciation that i want  never did madame de genlis make a cleverer hit than in the reading of the genius phanors tragedy in the palace of truth comically absurd as the inconsistency is of transporting the lecture of a parisian academician into an enchanted palace full of genii and fairies of the remotest possible connexion with the arab jinn the whole is redeemed by the truth to nature of the sole dupe in the palace of truth being the author reading his own works ermine was thinking of him all the time she was under none of the constraint of phanors auditors though she carried a perpetual palace of truth about with her she would not have had either fears or compunctions in criticising if she could the paper was in the essay style between argument and sarcasm something after the model of the invalids letters but it was scarcely lightly touched enough the irony was wormwood the gravity heavy and sententious and where there was a just thought or happy hit it seemed to travel in a roadwaggon and be lost in the rumbling of the wheels ermine did not restrain a smile half of amusement half of relief at the selfantidote the paper contained but the smile passed with the authoress as a tribute to her satire  in this age she said we must use those lighter weapons of wit or no one will attend  perhaps said ermine if i approve your object i should tell you you dont use them lightly  ah but i know you dont approve it you are not lay woman enough to be impartial and you belong to the age that was trying the experiment of the hierarchy modified i to that which has found it will not do but at least you understand my view i have made out my case  yes i understand your view but  you dont sympathize of course not but when it receives its full weight from the printers bands you will see that it will tell that bit about the weak tea fumes i thought of afterwards and i am afraid i did not read it well  i remember it but forgive me if i say first i think the whole is rather tootoo lengthy to take  oh that is only because manuscript takes long to read aloud i counted the words so i cant be mistaken at least i collated twenty lines and multiplied and it is not so long as the invalids last letter about systematic reading  and then comes my question again is good to come of it  that i cant expect you to see at this time but it is to be the beginning of a series exposing the fallacies of womans life as at present conducted and out of these i mean to point the way to more consistent more independent better combined exertion if i can make myself useful with my pen it will compensate for the being debarred from so many more obvious outlets i should like to have as much influence over peoples minds as that invalid for instance and by earnest effort i know i shall attain it  ii halflaughing and blushing i hope you will for i know you would wish to use it for good but to speak plainly i doubt about the success of this effort oror if it ought to succeed  yes i know you do said rachel no one ever can judge of a manuscript you have done all i wished you to do and i value your sincerity of course i did not expect praise since the more telling it is on the opposite side the less you could like it i saw you appreciated it  and rachel departed while rose crept up to her aunt asking aunt ermine why do you look so very funny it was very tiresome are not you glad it is over  i was thinking rose what a difficult language plain english is sometimes  what miss rachels i couldnt understand one bit of her long story except that she did not like weak tea  it was my own that i meant said ermine but rose always remember that a person who stands plain speaking from one like me has something very noble and generous in her were you here all the time rosie i dont wonder you were tired  no aunt ermine i went and told violetta and augustus a fairy tale out of my own head  indeed and how did they like it  violetta looked at me all the time and augustus gave three winks so i think he liked it  appreciated it said aunt ermine     chapter iv the hero    and which is lucys  can it be   that puny fop armed capapie   who loves in the saloon to show   the arms that never knew a foescott   my ladys compliments maam and she would he much obliged if you would remain till she comes home was coombes reception of alison she is gone to avoncester with master temple and master francis  gone to avoncester exclaimed rachel who had walked from church to myrtlewood with alison  mamma is gone to meet the major cried three of the lesser boys rushing upon them in full cry then leoline facing round not the major he is lieutenantcolonel nowcolonel keith hurrah  whatwhat do you mean speak rationally leoline if you can  my lady sent a note to the homestead this morning explained coombe she heard this morning that colonel keith intended to arrive today and took the young gentlemen with her to meet him  rachel could hardly refrain from manifesting her displeasure and bluntly asked what time lady temple was likely to be at home  it depended coombe said upon the train it was not certain whether colonel keith would come by the twelve or the two oclock train  and rachel was going to turn sharply round and dash home with the tidings when alison arrested her with the question  and who is colonel keith  rachel was too much wrapped up in her own view to hear the trembling of the voice and answered colonel keith why the major you have not been here so long without hearing of the major  yes but i did not know who is he and a more observant person would have seen the governesss gasping effort to veil her eagerness under her wonted selfcontrol  dont you know who the major is shouted leoline he is our military secretary  thats the sum total of my knowledge said rachel i dont understand his influence nor know where he was picked up  nor his regiment  he is not a regimental officer he is on our staff said leoline whose imagination could not attain to an earlier condition than on our staff  i shall go home then said rachel and see if there is any explanation there  i shall ask the major not to let aunt rachel come here observed hubert as she departed it was well it was not before  leoline anxiously asked alison can you tell me the majors name  colonel keithlieutenantcolonel keith was all the answer  i meant his christian name my dear  only little boys have christian names they returned and alison was forced to do her best to tame herself and them to the duties of the long day of anticipation so joyous on their part so full of confusion and bewildered anxiety on her own she looked in vain half stealthily as often before for a recent army list or peerage long ago she had lost the honourable colin a keith from among the officers of the th highlanders and though in the last peerage she had laid hands on he was still among the surviving sons of the late lord keith of gowanbrae the date had not gone back far enough to establish that he had not died in the indian war it was fear that predominated with her there were many moments when she would have given worlds to be secure that the newcomer was not the man she thought of who whether constant or inconstant could bring nothing but pain and disturbance to the calm tenour of her sisters life everything was an oppression to her the children in their wild joyous spirits and gladsome inattention tried her patience almost beyond her powers the charge of the younger ones in their mothers absence was burthensome and the delay in returning to her sister became wellnigh intolerable when she figured to herself rachel curtis going down to ermine with the tidings of colonel keiths arrival and her own discontent at his influence with her cousin would that she had spoken a word of warning yet that might have been merely mischievous for the subject was surely too delicate for rachel to broach with so recent a friend but rachel had bad taste for anything that the little boys did not find miss williams very cross that day was an effect of the long habit of selfcontrol and she could hardly sit still under the additional fret when just as tea was spread for the schoolroom party in walked miss rachel and sat herself down in spite of hubert who made up a most coaxing entreating face as he said please aunt rachel doesnt aunt grace want you very much  not at all why hubert  oh if you would only go away and not spoil our fun when the major comes  for once rachel did laugh but she did not take the hint and alison obtained only the satisfaction of hearing that she had at least not been in mackarel lane the wheels sounded on the gravel out rushed the boys alison and rachel sat in strange absolute silence each forgetful of the other neither guarding her own looks nor remarking her companions alisons lips were parted by intense listening rachels teeth were set to receive her enemy there was a chorus of voices in the hall and something about tea and coming in warned both to gather up their looks before lady temple had opened the door and brought in upon them not one foe but two was rachel seeing double hardly that for one was tall bald and bearded not dangerously young but on that very account the more dangerously goodlooking and the other was almost a boy slim and light just of the empty young officer type here too was fanny flushed excited prettier and brighter than rachel had seen her at all waving an introduction with head and hand and the boys hanging round the major with deafening exclamations of welcome in which they were speedily joined by the nursery detachment those greetings those observations on growth and looks those glad eager questions and answers were like the welcome of an integral part of the family it was far more intimate and familiar than had been possible with the curtises after the long separation and it was enough to have made the two spectators feel out of place if such a sensation had been within rachels capacity or if alison had not been engaged with the tea lady temple made a few explanations sotto voce to alison whom she always treated as though in dread of not being sufficiently considerate i do hope the children have been good i knew you would not mind i could not wait to see you or i should have been too late to meet the train and then he would have come by the coach and it is such a raw east wind he must be careful in this climate  how warm and sunshiny it has been all day said rachel by way of opposition to some distant echo of this whisper  sunshiny but treacherous answered colonel keith there are cold gusts round corners this must be a very sheltered nook of the coast  quite a different zone from avoncester said the youth  yes delightful i told you it was just what would suit you added fanny to the colonel  some winds are very cold here interposed rachel i always pity people who are imposed upon to think it a mentone near home they are choking our churchyard  very inconsiderate of them muttered the young man  but what made you come home so late fanny said rachel  alison suspected a slight look of wonder on the part of both the officers at hearing their generals wife thus called to account but fanny taking it as a matter of course answered we found that theth was at avoncester i had no idea of it and they did not know i was here so i went to call upon mrs hammond and colonel keith went to look for alick and we have brought him home to dine  fanny took it for granted that rachel must know who alick was but she was far from doing so though she remembered that the th had been her uncles regiment and had been under sir stephen temples command in india at the time of the mutiny the thought of fannys lapsing into military society was shocking to her the boys were vociferating about boats ponies and all that had been deferred till the majors arrival and he was answering them kindly but hushing the extra outcry less by word than sign and his own lowered voice and polished mannera manner that excessively chafed her as a sort of insult to the blunt rapid ways that she considered as sincere and unaffected a silkiness that no doubt had worked on the honest simple general as it was now working on the weak young widow anything was better than leaving her to such influence and in pursuance of the intention that rachel had already announced at home she invited herself to stay to dinner and fanny eagerly thanked her for making it a little less dull for colonel keith and alick it was so good to come down and help certainly fanny was an innocent creature provided she was not spoilt and it was a duty to guard her innocence  alison williams escaped to her home sure of nothing but that her sister must not be allowed to share her uncertainties and lady temple and her guests sat down to dinner rachel meant to have sat at the bottom and carved as belonging to the house but fanny motioned the colonel to the place observing it is so natural to see you there one only wants poor captain dent at the other end do you know whether he has his leave  wherewith commenced a discussion of military friendswho had been heard of from australia who had been met in england who was promoted who married who retired c and all the quarters of theth since its return from india two years ago fanny eagerly asking questions and making remarks quite at home and all animation absolutely a different being from the subdued meek little creature that rachel had hitherto seen attempts were made to include miss curtis in the conversation by addressing anecdotes to her and asking if she knew the places named but she had been to none and the three old friends quickly fell into the swing of talk about what interested them once however she came down on them with what conclusion have you formed upon female emigration       his sister she went beyond the seas       and died an old maid among black savagees   thats the most remarkable instance of female emigration on record isnt it observed alick  what her dying an old maid said colonel keith i am not sure wholesale exportations of wives are spoiling the market  i did not mean marriage said rachel stoutly i am particularly anxious to know whether there is a field open to independent female labour  all the superior young women seemed to turn nurserymaids said the colonel  oh interposed fanny do you remember that nice girl of ours who would marry that orderlysergeant odonoghoe i have had a letter from her in such distress  of course the natural termination said alick in his lazy voice  and i thought you would tell me how to manage sending her some help proceeded fanny  i could have helped you fanny wont an order do it  not quite said fanny a shade of a smile playing on her lip it is whether to send it through one of the officers or not if captain lee is with the regiment i know he would take care of it for her  so they plunged into another regiment and rachel decided that nothing was so wearisome as to hear triflers talk shop  there was no opportunity of calling fanny to order after dinner for she went off on her progress to all the seven cribs and was only just returning from them when the gentlemen came in and then she made room for the younger beside her on the sofa saying now alick i do so want to hear about poor dear little bessie and they began so low and confidentially that rachel wondered if her alarms wore to be transfered from the bearded colonel to the dapper boy or if in very truth she must deem poor fanny a general coquette besides a man must be contemptible who wore gloves at so small a party when she did not  she had been whiling away the time of fannys absence by looking over the books on the table and she did not regard the present company sufficiently to desist on their account colonel keith began to turn over some numbers of the traveller that lay near him and presently looked up and said do you know who is the writer of this  what is it ah one of the invalids essays they strike every one but i fancy the authorship is a great secret  you do not know it  no i wish i did which of them are you reading country walks that is not one that i care about it is a mere hash of old recollections but there are some very sensible and superior ones so that i have heard it sometimes doubted whether they are mans or womans writing for my part i think them too earnest to be a mans men always play with their subject  oh yes said fanny i am sure only a lady could have written anything so sweet as that about flowers in a sickroom it so put me in mind of the lovely flowers you used to bring me one at a time when i was ill at cape town  there was no more sense to be had after those three once fell upon their reminiscences  that night after having betrayed her wakefulness by a movement in her bed alison williams heard her sisters voice low and steady saying ailie dear be it what it may guessing is worse than certainty  oh ermine i hopedi know nothingi have nothing to tell  you dread something said ermine you have been striving for unconcern all the evening my poor dear but surely you know ailie that nothing is so bad while we share it  and i have frightened you about nothing  nothing nothing about edward  oh no no  and no one has made you uncomfortable  no  then there is only one thing that it can be ailie and you need not fear to tell me that i always knew that if he lived i must be prepared for it and you would not have hesitated to tell me of his death  it is not that indeed it is not ermine it is only thisthat i found today that lady temples major has the same name  but you said she was come home you must have seen him  yes but i should not know him i had only seen him once remember twelve years ago and when i durst not look at him  at least said ermine quickly you can tell me what you saw today  a scotch face bald head dark beard grizzled hair  yes i am grey and he was five years older but he used not to have a scotch face can you tell me about his eyes  dark i think  they were very dark blue almost black time and climate must have left them alone you may know him by those eyes ailie and you could not make out anything about him  no not even his christian name nor his regiment i had only the little ones and miss rachel to ask and they knew nothing i wanted to keep this from you till i was sure but you always find me out  do you think i couldnt see the misery you were in all the evening poor child but now you have had it out sleep and dont be distressed  but ermine if you  my dear i am thankful that nothing is amiss with you or edward for the rest there is nothing but patience now not another word you must not lose your sleep nor take away my chance of any  how much the sisters slept they did not confide to one another but when they rose alison shook her head at her sisters heavy eyelids and ermine retorted with a reproachful smile at certain dark tokens of sleeplessness under alisons eyes  no not the flowered flimsiness please she said in the course of her toilette let me have the respectable grey silk and next she asked for a drawer whence she chose a little nuremberg horn brooch for her neck i know it is very silly she said but i cant quite help it only one question ailie that i thought of too late did he hear your name  i think not lady temple named nobody but why did you not ask me last night  i thought beginning to talk again would destroy your chance of sleep and we had resolved to stop  and ermine if it be what shall i do  do as you feel right at the moment said ermine after a moments pause i cannot tell how it may be i have been thinking over what you told me about the major and lady temple  oh ermine what a reproof this is for that bit of gossip  not at all my dear the warning may be all the better for me said ermine with a voice less steady than her words it is not what under the circumstances i could think likely in the colin whom i knew but were it indeed so then ailie you had better say nothing about me unless he found you out we would get employment elsewhere  and i must leave you to the suspense all day  much better so the worst thing we could do would be to go on talking about it it is far better for me to be left with my dear little unconscious companion  alison tried to comfort herself with this belief through the long hours of the morning during which she only heard that mamma and colonel keith were gone to the homestead and she saw no one till she came forth with her troop to the midday meal  and there at sight of lady temples content and calm satisfied look as though she were once more in an accustomed atmosphere and felt herself and the boys protected and of the colonels courteous attention to her and affectionate authority towards her sons it was an absolute pang to recognise the hue of eye described by ermine but still alison tried to think them generic keith eyes till at length amid the merry chatter of her pupils came an appeal to miss williams and then came a look that thrilled through her the same glance that she had met for one terrible moment twelve years before and renewing the same longing to shrink from all sight or sound how she kept her seat and continued to attend to the children she never knew but the voices sounded like a distant babel and she did not know whether she were most relieved disappointed or indignant when she left the diningroom to take the boys for their walk oh that ermine could be hid from all knowledge of what would be so much harder to bear than the death in which she had long believed  harder to bear yes ermine had already been passing through a heart sickness that made the morning like an age her resolute will had struggled hard for composure cheerfulness and occupation but the little watchful niece had seen through the endeavour and had made her own to the sleepless night and the headache the usual remedy was a drive in a wheeled chair and rose was so urgent to be allowed to go and order one that ermine at last yielded partly because she had hardly energy enough to turn her refusal graciously partly because she would not feel herself staying at home for the vague hope and when the child was out of sight she had the comfort of clasping her hands and ceasing to restrain her countenance while she murmured oh colin colin are you what you were twelve years back is this all dream all delusion and waste of feeling while you are lying in your indian grave more mine than you can ever be living be as it may                     calm me my god and keep me calm                       while these hot breezes blow                     be like the night dews cooling balm                       upon earths fevered brow                     calm me my god and keep me calm                       soft resting on thy breast                     soothe me with holy hymn and psalm                       and bid my spirit rest     chapter v military society                             my trust  like a good parent did beget of him  a falsehood in its contrary as great  as my trust was which had indeed no limittempest   rose found the wheeled chair to which her aunt gave the preference was engaged and shaking her little discreet head at the shakey chair and the stuffy chair she turned pensively homeward and was speeding down mackarel lane when she was stayed by the words my little girl and the grandest and most bearded gentleman she had ever seen demanded can you tell me if miss williams lives here  my aunt exclaimed rose gazing up with her pretty frightenedfawn look  indeed he exclaimed looking eagerly at her then you are the child of a very old friend of mine did you never hear him speak of his old schoolfellow colin keith  papa is away said rose turning back her neck to get a full view of his face from under the brim of her hat  will you run on and ask your aunt if she would like to see me he added  thus it was that ermine heard the quick patter of the childs steps followed by the manly tread and the words sounded in her ears aunt ermine theres a gentleman and he has a great beard and he says he is papas old friend and here he is  ermines beaming eyes as absolutely met the new comer as though she had sprung forward i thought you would come she said in a voice serene with exceeding bliss  i have found you at last as their hands clasped and they gazed into each others faces in the untroubled repose of the meeting exclusive of all else  ermine was the first to break silence oh colin you look worn and altered  you dont you have kept your sunbeam face for me with the dear brown glow i never thought to have seen again why did they tell me you were an invalid ermine  have you not seen alison she asked supposing he would have known all  i saw her but did not hear her name till just now at luncheon when our looks met and i saw it was not another disappointment  and she knows you are come to me  it was not in me to speak to her till i had recovered you one can forgive but not forget  you will do more when you know her and how she has only lived and worked for me dear ailie and suffered far more than i  while i was suffering from being unable to do anything but live for you he repeated taking up her words but that is ended now and as she made a negative motion of her head have you not trusted to me  i have thought you not living she said the last i know was your letter to dear lady alison written from the hospital at cape town after your wound she was ill even when it came and she could only give it to ailie for me  dear good aunt she got into trouble with all the family for our sake and when she was gone no one would give me any tidings of you  it was her last disappointment that you were not sent home on sick leave did you get well too fast  not exactly but my father or rather i believe my brother intimated that i should be welcome only if i had laid aside a certain foolish fancy and as lying on my back had not conduced to that end i could only say i would stay where i was  and was it worse for you i am sure in spite of all that tanned skin that your health has suffered ought you to have come home  no i do not know that london surgeons could have got at the ball he said putting his hand on his chest and it gives me no trouble in general i was such a spectacle when i returned to duty that good old sir stephen temple always a proverb for making his staff a refuge for the infirm made me his aidedecamp and was like a father to me  now i see why i never could find your name in any list of the officers in the moves of the regiment i gave you quite up when i saw no keith among those that came home from india i did believe then that you were the colonel alexander keith whose death i had seen mentioned though i had long trusted to his not being honourable nor having your first name  ah he succeeded to the command after lady temples father a kind friend to me he was and he left me in charge of his son and daughter a very good and gallant fellow is that young alick i must bring him to see you some day  oh i saw his name i remember i gloried in the doings of a keith but i was afraid he had died as there was no such name with the regiment when it came home  no he was almost shattered to pieces but sir stephen sent him up the hills to be nursed by lady temple and her mother and he was sent home as soon as he could be moved i was astonished to see how entirely he had recovered  then you went through all that indian war  yes with sir stephen  you must show me all your medals how much you have to tell me and then  just when the regiment was coming home my dear old chief was appointed to the command in australia and insisted on my coming with him as military secretary he had come to depend on me so much that i could not well leave him and in five years there was the way to promotion and to claiming you at once we were just settled there when what i heard made me long to have decided otherwise but i could not break with him then i wrote to edward but had my letter returned to me  no wonder edward was abroad all connexion broken  i wrote to beauchamp and he knew nothing and i could only wait till my chiefs time should be up you know how it was cut short and how the care of the poor little widow detained me till she was fit for the voyage i came and sought you in vain in town i went home and found my brother lonely and dispirited he has lost his son his daughters are married and he and i are all the brothers left out of the six he was urgent that i should come and live with him and marry i told him i would with all my heart when i had found you and he saw i was too much in earnest to be opposed then i went to beauchamp but harry knew nothing about any one i tried to find out your sister and dr long but heard they were gone to belfast  yes they lost a good deal in the crash and did not like retrenching among their neighbours so they went to ireland and there they have a flourishing practice  i thought myself on my way there he said smiling only i had first to settle lady temple little guessing who was her treasure of a governess last night i had nearly opened on another false scent i fell in with a description that i could have sworn was yours of the heather behind the parsonage i made a note of the publisher in case all else had failed  im glad you knew the scent of the thyme  then it was no false scent  one must live and i was thankful to do anything to lighten ailies burthen i wrote down that description that i might live in the place in fancy and one day when the contribution was wanted and i was hard up for ideas i sent it though i was loth to lay open that bit of home and heart  well it might give me the sense of meeting you and in other papers of the series i traced your old self more ripened  the editor was a friend of edwards and in our london days he asked me to write letters on things in general and when i said i saw the world through a keyhole he answered that a circumscribed view gained in distinctness most kind and helpful he has been and what began between sport and need to say out ones mind has come to be a resource for which we are very thankful he sends us books for reviewal and that is pleasant and improving not to say profitable  little did i think you were in such straits he said stroking the childs head and waiting as though her presence were a restraint on inquiries but she eagerly availed herself of the pause aunt ermine please what shall i say about the chairs will you have the nice one and billy when they come home i was to take the answer only you did talk so that i could not ask  thank you my dear i dont want chairs nor anything else while i can talk so she answered smiling you had better take a run in the garden when you come back and rose replied with a nod of assent that made the colonel smile and say goodbye then my sweet lady discretion some day we will be better acquainted  dear child said ermine she is our great blessing and some day i trust will be the same to her dear father oh colin it is too much to hope that you have not believed what you must have heard and yet you wrote to him  nay i could not but feel great distrust of what i heard since i was also told that his sisters were unconvinced and besides i had continually seen him at school the victim of other peoples faults  this is best of all exclaimed ermine with glistening eyes and hand laid upon his it is the most comfortable word i have heard since it happened yes indeed many a time before i saw you had i heard of keith as the friend who saw him righted oh colin thanks thanks for believing in him more than for all  not believing but knowing he answeredknowing both you and edward besides is it not almost invariable that the inventor is ruined by his inventiona prospero by nature  it was not the invention she answered that throve as long as my father lived  yes he was an excellent man of business  and he thought the concern so secure that there was no danger in embarking all the available capital of the family in it and it did bring us in a very good income  i remember that it struck me that the people at home would find that they had made a mistake after all and missed a fortune for me it was an invention for diminishing the fragility of glass under heat was it not  yes and the manufacture was very prosperous so that my father was quite at ease about us after his death we made a home for edward in london and looked after him when he used to be smitten with some new idea and forgot all sublunary matters when he married we went to live at richmond and had his dear little wife very much with us for she was a delicate tender creature half killed by london in process of time he fell in with a man named maddox plausible and clever who became a sort of manager especially while edward was in his trances of invention and at all times knew more about his accounts than he did himself nothing but my fathers authority had ever made him really look into them and this man took them all off his hands there was a matter about the glass that edward was bent on ascertaining and he went to study the manufacture in bohemia taking his wife with him and leaving rose with us shortly after dr long and harry beauchamp received letters asking for a considerable advance to be laid out on the materials that this improvement would require immediately afterwards came the crash  exactly what i heard of course the letters were written in ignorance of what was impending  colin they were never written at all by edward he denied all knowledge of them alison saw dr longs most ingeniously managedforeign paper and allbut she could swear to the forgery  you suspect this maddox  most strongly he knew the state of the business edward did not and he had a correspondence that would have enabled so ingenious a person easily to imitate edwards letters i do not wonder at their having been taken in but how juliahow harry beauchamp could believewhat they do believe oh colin it will not do to think about it  oh that i had been at home were no measures taken  alas alas we urged edward to come home and clear himself but that poor little wife of his was terrified beyond measure imagined prisons and trials she was unable to move and he could not leave her she took from him an unhappy promise not to put himself in what she fancied danger from the law and then died leaving him a baby that did not live a day he was too brokenhearted to care for vindicating himself and no oneno one would do it for him  colonel keith frowned and clenched the hand that lay in his grasp till it was absolute pain but pain that was a relief to feel madness madness he said miserable but how was it at home did this maddox stand his ground  yes if he had fled all would have been clear but he doctored the accounts his own way and quite satisfied dr long and harry he showed edwards receipt for the £6000 that had been advanced and besides there was a large sum not accounted for which was of course supposed to have been invested abroad by edwardsome said gambled awayas if he had not had a regular hatred of all sorts of games  edward with his head in the clouds one notion is as likely as the otherthen absolutely nothing was done  nothing the bankruptcy was declared the whole affair broken up and certainly if every one had not known edward to be the most heedless of men the confusion would have justified them in thinking him a dishonest one things had been done in his name by maddox that might have made a stranger think him guilty of the rest but to those who had ever known his abstraction and far more his real honour and uprightness nothing could have been plainer  it all turned upon his absence  yes he must have borne the brunt of what had been done in his name i know that would have been bad enough but in a court of justice his whole character would have been shown and besides a prosecution for forgery of his receipt would have shown what maddox was sufficiently to exculpate him  and you say the losers by the deception would not believe in it  no they only shook their heads at our weak sisterly affection  i wish i could see one of those letters where is maddox now  i cannot tell he certainly did not go away immediately after the settlement of accounts but it has not been possible to us to keep up a knowledge of his movements or something might have turned up to justify edward oh what it is to be helpless women you are the very first person colin who has not looked at me pityingly like a creature to be forborne with an undeniable delusion  they must be very insolent people then to look at that brow and eyes and think even sisterly love could blind them he said yes ermine i was certain that unless edward were more changed than i could believe there must be some such explanation you have never seen him since  no he was too utterly broken by the loss of his wife to feel anything else for a long time we heard nothing and that was the most dreadful time of all then he wrote from a little german town where he was getting his bread as a photographers assistant and since that he has cast about the world till just now he has some rather interesting employment at the mines in the oural mountains the first thing he has really seemed to like or care for  the oural mountains that is out of reach i wish i could see him one might find some means of clearing him what directed your suspicion to maddox  chiefly that the letters professed to have been sent in a parcel to him to be posted from the office if it had been so edward and lucy would certainly have written to us at the same time i could have shown too that maddox had written to me the day before to ascertain where edward was so as to be sure of the date it was a little country village and i made a blunder in copying the spelling from lucys writing ailie found that very blunder repeated in dr longs letter and we showed him that edward did not write it so besides before going abroad edward had lost the sealring with his crest which you gave him you remember the saxons head  i remember you all took it much to heart that the engraver had made it a saracens head and not a longhaired saxon  well edward had renewed the ring and taken care to make it a saxon now ailie could get no one to believe her but she is certain that the letter was sealed with the old saracen not the new saxon butbutif you had but been there  tell me you wished for me ermine  i durst not wish anything about you she said looking up through a mist of tears  and you what fixed you here  an old servant of ours had married and settled here and had written to us of her satisfaction in finding that the clergyman was from hereford we thought he would recommend ailie as daily governess to visitors and that sarah would be a comfortable landlady it has answered very well rose deserves her name far more than when we brought her here and it is wonderful how much better i have been since doctors have become a mere luxury  do you can you really mean that you are supporting yourselves  all but twentyfive pounds a year from a legacy to us that mr beauchamp would not let them touch but it has been most remarkable colin she said with the dew in her eyes how we have never wanted our daily bread and how happy we have been if it had not been for edward this would in many ways have been our happiest time since the old days the little frets have told less and ailie has been infinitely happier and brighter since she has had to work instead of only to watch me ah colin must i not own to having been happy indeed it was very much because peace had come when the suspense had sunk into belief that i might think of you as where you would not be grieved by the sight of what i am now  as she spoke a knock not at the house but at the room door made them both start and impel their chairs to a more ordinary distance just as rachel curtis made her entrance extremely amazed to find not mr touchett but a much greater foe and rival in that unexpected quarter ermine the least disconcerted was the first to speak you are surprised to find a visitor here she said and indeed only now did we find out that our military secretary as your little cousins say was our clear old squires nephew  there was a ring of gladness in the usually patient voice that struck even rachel though she was usually too eager to be observant but she was still unready with talk for the occasion and ermine continued we had heard so much of the major beforehand that we had a sort of jupiterlike expectation of the coming man i am not sure that i shall not go on expecting a mythic major  rachel never understanding playfulness thought this both audacious and unnecessary and if it had come from any one else would have administered a snub but she felt the invalid sacred from her weapons  have you ever seen the boys asked colonel keith i am rather proud of conrade my pupil he is so chivalrous towards his mother  alison has brought down a division or two to show me how much alike they are  exactly alike and excessively unruly and unmanageable said rachel i pity your sister  more unmanageable in appearance than in reality said the colonel theres always a little trial of strength against the hand over them and they yield when they find it is really a hand they were wonderfully good and considerate when it was an object to keep the house quiet  rachel would not encourage him to talk of lady temple so she turned to ermine on the business that had brought her collecting and adapting old clothes for emigrantsit was not exactly gentlemens pastime and ermine tried to put it aside and converse but rachel never permitted any petty consideration to interfere with a useful design and as there was a press of time for the things she felt herself justified in driving the intruder off the field and outstaying him she succeeded he recollected the desire of the boys that he should take them to inspect the pony at the jolly mariner and took leave withi shall see you tomorrow  you knew him all the time exclaimed rachel pausing in her unfolding of the master temples ship wardrobe why did you not say so  we did not know his name he was always the major  who and what is he demanded rachel as she knelt before her victim fixing those great prominent eyes so like those of red riding hoods grandmother that ermine involuntarily gave a backward impulse to her wheeled chair as she answered the readiest thing that occurred to herhe is brother to lord keith of gowanbrae  oh said rachel kneeling on meditatively that accounts for it so much the worse the staff is made up of idle honourables  quoth the times replied ermine but his appointment began on account of a wound and went on because of his usefulness  wounded i dont like wounded heroes said rachel people make such a fuss with them that they always get spoilt  this was nine years ago so you may forget it if you like said ermine diversion suppressing displeasure  and what is your opinion of him said rachel edging forward on her knees so as to bring her inquisitorial eyes to bear more fully  i had not seen him for twelve years said ermine rather faintly  he must have had a formed character when you saw him last the twelve years before fiveandforty dont alter the nature  fiveandforty illness and climate have told but i did not think it was so much he is only thirtysix  that is not what i care about said rachel you are both of you so cautious that you tell me what amounts to nothing you should consider how important it is to me to know something about the person in whose power my cousins affairs are left  have you not sufficient guarantee in the very fact of her husbands confidence  i dont know a simplehearted old soldier always means a very foolish old man  witness the newcomes said ermine who besides her usual amusement in tracing rachels dicta to their source could only keep in her indignation by laughing  general observation said rachel not to be turned from her purpose i am not foolishly suspicious but it is not pleasant to see great influence and intimacy without some knowledge of the person exercising it  i think said ermine bringing herself with difficulty to answer quietly that you can hardly understand the terms they are on without having seen how much a staff officer becomes one of the family  i suppose much must be allowed for the frivolity and narrowness of a military set in a colony imagine my one attempt at rational conversation last night asking his views on female emigration absolutely he had none at all he and fanny only went off upon a nursemaid married to a sergeant  perhaps the bearings of the question would hardly suit mixed company  to be sure there was a conceited young officer there for as ill luck will have it my uncles old regiment is quartered at avoncester and i suppose they will all be coming after fanny it is well they are no nearer and as this colonel says he is going to belfast in a day or two there will not be much provocation to them to come here now this great event of the majors coming is over we will try to put fanny upon a definite system and i look to you and your sister as a great assistance to me in counteracting the follies and nonsenses that her situation naturally exposes her to i have been writing a little sketch of the dangers of indecision that i thought of sending to the traveller it would strike fanny to see there what i so often tell her but i cant get an answer about my paper on curatocult as you made me call it  did i  you said the other word was of two languages i cant think why they dont insert it but in the meantime i will bring down my human reeds and show them to you i have only an hours work on them so ill come tomorrow afternoon  i think colonel keith talked of calling againthank you suggested ermine in despair  ah yes one does not want to be liable to interruptions in the most interesting part when he is gone to belfast  yes when he is gone to belfast repeated ermine with an irresistible gleam of mirth about her lips and eyes and at that moment alison made her appearance the looks of the sisters met and read one another so far as to know that the meeting was over and for the rest they endured while rachel remained little imagining the trial her presence had been to alisons burning heartsick anxiety and doubt how could it be well let him be loveable let him be constant that only rendered ermines condition the more pitiable and the shining glance of her eyes was almost more than alison could bear so happy as the sisters had been together so absolutely united it did seem hard to disturb that calm life with hopes and agitations that must needs be futile and alison whose whole life and soul were in her sister could not without a pang see that sisters heart belonging to another and not for hopeful joy but pain and grief the yearning of jealousy was sternly reproved and forced down and told that ermine had long been colin keiths that the perpetrator of the evil had the least right of any one to murmur that her own monopoly of her sister was interfered with that she was selfish unkind envious that she had only to hate herself and pray for strength to bear the punishment without alloying ermines happiness while it lasted how it could be so bright alison knew not but so it was she recognised by every tone of the voice by every smile on the lip by even the upright vigour with which ermine sat in her chair and undertook rachels tasks of needlework  and yet when the visitor rose at last to go alison was almost unwilling to be alone with her sister and have that power of sympathy put to the test by those clear eyes that were wont to see her through and through she went with rachel to the door and stood taking a last instruction hearing it not at all but answering and relieved by the delay hardly knowing whether to be glad or not that when she returned rose was leaning on the arm of her aunts chair with the most eager face but rose was to be no protection for what was passing between her and her aunt  o auntie i am go glad he is coming back he is just like the picture you drew of robert bruce for me and he is so kind i never saw any gentleman speak to you in such a nice soft voice  alison had no difficulty in smiling as ermine stroked the childs hair kissed her and looked up with an arch blushing glittering face that could not have been brighter those long twelve years ago  and then rose turned round impatient to tell her other aunt her story o aunt ailie we have had such a gentleman here with a great brown beard like a picture and he is papas old friend and kissed me because i am papas little girl and i do like him so very much i went where i could look at him in the garden when you sent me out aunt ermine  you did you monkey said ermine laughing and blushing again what will you do if i send you out next time no i wont then my dear for all the time i should like you to see him and know him  only if you want to talk of anything very particular observed rose  i dont think i need ask many questions said alison smiling being happily made very easy to her dear ermine i see you are perfectly satisfied  o ailie that is no word for it not only himself but to find him loving rose for her fathers sake undoubting of him through all ailie the thankfulness of it is more than one can bear  and he is the same said alison  the sameno not the same it is more better or i am able to feel it more it was just like the morrow of the day he walked down the lane with me and gathered honeysuckles only the night between has been a very very strange time  i hope the interruption did not come very soon  i thought it was directly but it could not have been so soon since you are come home we had just had time to tell what we most wanted to know and i know a little more of what he is i feel as if it were not only colin again but ten times colin o ailie it must be a little bit like the meetings in heaven  i believe it is so with you said alison scarcely able to keep the tears from her eyes  after sometimes not daring to dwell on him and then only venturing because i thought he must be dead to have him back again with the same looks only deeperto find that he clung to those weeks so long ago and above all that there was not one cloud one doubt about the troublesoh it is too too much  ermine lent back with clasped hands she was like one weary with happiness and lain to rest in the sense of newlywon peace she said little more that evening and if spoken to seemed like one wakened out of a dream so that more than once she laughed at herself begged her sisters pardon and said that it seemed to her that she could not hear anything for the one glad voice that rang in her ear colin is come home that was sufficient for her no need for any other sympathy felt alison with another of those pangs crushed down then wonder camewhether ermine could really contemplate the future or if it were absolutely lost in the present  colonel keith went back to be seized by conrade and francis and walked off to the pony inspection the two boys on either side of him communicating to him the great grievance of living in a poky place like this where nobody had ever been in the army nor had a bit of sense and aunt rachel was always bothering and trying to make mamma think that con told stories  i dont mind that said conrade stoutly let her try  oh but she wanted mamma to shut you up added francis  well and mamma knows better said conrade and it made her leave off teaching me so it was lucky but i dont mind that only dont you see colonel they dont know how to treat mamma they go and bully her and treat her likelike a subaltern till i hate the very sight of it  my boy said the colonel who had been giving only half attention you must make up your mind to your mother not being at the head of everything as she used to be in your fathers time she will always be respected but you must look to yourself as you grow up to make a position tor her  i wish i was grown up sighed conrade how i would give it to aunt rachel but why must we live here to have her plaguing us  questions that the colonel was glad to turn aside by moans of the ponies and by a suggestion that if a very quiet one were found and if conrade would be very careful mamma might perhaps go out riding with them the motion was so transcendant that no sooner had the ponies been seen than the boys raced home and had communicated it at the top of their voices to mamma long before their friend made his appearance lady temple was quite startled at the idea dear papa as she always called her husband had wished her to ride but she had seldom done so and now the tears came into her eyes  i think you might said the colonel gently i could find you a quiet animal and to have you with conrade would be such a protection to him he added as the boys had rushed out of the room  yes perhaps dear boy but i could not begin alone it is so long since i rode perhaps when you come back from ireland  i am not going to ireland  i thought you said said fanny looking up surprised i am very glad but if you wished to go pray dont think about us i shall learn to manage in time and i cannot bear to detain you  you do not detain me he said sitting down by her i have found what i was going in search of and through your means  whatwhat do you mean you were going to see miss williams this afternoon i thought  yes and it was she whom i was seeking he paused and added slowly as if merely for the sake of dwelling on the words i have found her  miss williams said fanny with perplexed looks  miss williamsmy ermine whom i had not seen since the day after her accident when we parted as on her deathbed  that sister oh poor thing i am so glad but i am sorry cried the much confused fanny in a breath were not you very much shocked  i had never hoped to see her face in all its brightness again he said twelve years it is twelve years that she has suffered and of late she has been brought to this grievous state of poverty and yet the spirit is as brave and cheerful as ever it looks out of the beautiful eyesmore beautiful than when i first saw themi could see and think of nothing else  twelve years repeated fanny is it so long since you saw her  almost since i heard of her she was like a daughter to my aunt at beauchamp and her brother was my schoolfellow for one summer when i was quartered at hertford i was with her constantly but my family would not even hear of the indefinite engagement that was all we could have looked to and made me exchange into the th  ah that was the way we came to have you i must tell you dear sir stephen always guessed once when he had quite vexed poor mamma by preventing her from joking you in her way about young ladies he told me that once when he was young he had liked some one who died or was married i dont quite know which and he thought it was the same with you from something that happened when you withdrew your application for leave after your wound  yes it was a letter from home implying that my return would be accepted as a sign that i gave her up so that was an additional instance of the exceeding kindness that i always received  and there was a pause both much affected by the thought of the good old mans ever ready consideration at last fanny said i am sure it was well for us what would he have done without youand she added do you really mean that you never heard of her all these years  never after my aunts death except just after we went to melbourne when i heard in general terms of the ruin of the family and the false imputation on their brother  ah i remember that you did say something about going home and sir stephen was distressed and mamma and i persuaded you because we saw he would have missed you so much and mamma was quite hurt at your thinking of going but if you had only told him your reason he would never have thought of standing in your way  i know he would not but i saw he could hardly find any one else just then who knew his ways so well besides there was little use in going home till i had my promotion and could offer her a home and i had no notion how utter the ruin was or that she had lost so much so little did i imagine their straits that but for alisons look i should hardly have inquired even on hearing her name  how very curioushow strangely things come round said fanny then with a start of dismay but what shall i do pray tell me what you would like if i might only keep her a little while till i can find some one else though no one will ever be so nice but indeed i would not for a moment if you had rather not  why so alison is very happy with you and there can be no reason against her going on  oh cried lady temple with an odd sound of satisfaction doubt and surprise but i thought you would not like it  i should like of course to set them all at ease but as i can do no more than make a home for ermine and her niece i can only rejoice that alison is with you  but your brother  if he does not like it he must take the consequence of the utter separation he made my father insist on said the colonel sternly for my own part i only esteem both sisters the more if that were possible for what they have done for themselves  oh that is what rachel would like she is so fond of the sicki mean of yourmiss williams i suppose i may not tell her yet  not yet if you please i have scarcely had time as yet to know what ermine wishes but i could not help telling you  thank youi am so glad she said with sweet earnestness holding out her hand in congratulation when may i go to her i should like for her to come and stay here do you think she would  thank you i will see i know how kind you would beindeed have already been to her  and i am so thankful that i may keep miss williams the dear boys never were so good and perhaps she may stay till baby is grown up oh how long it will be first  she could not have a kinder friend said the colonel smiling and looking at his watch  oh is it time to dress it is very kind of my dear aunt but i do wish we could have stayed at home tonight it is so dull for the boys when i dine out and i had so much to ask you one thing was about that poor little bessie keith dont you think i might ask her down here to be near her brother  it would be a very kind thing in you and very good for her but you must be prepared for rather a gay young lady  oh but she would not mind my not going out she would have alick you know and all the boys to amuse her but if you think it would be tiresome for her and that she would not be happy i should be very sorry to have her poor child  i was not afraid for her said colonel keith smiling but of her being rather too much for you  rachel is not too much for me said fanny and she and grace will entertain bessie and take her out but i will talk to alick he spoke of coming tomorrow and dont you think i might ask colonel and mrs hammond to spend a day they would so like the sea for the children  certainly  then perhaps you would writeoh i forgot colouring up i never can forget the old days it seems as if you were on the staff still  i always am on yours and always hope to be he said smiling though i am afraid i cant write your note to the hammonds for you  but you wont go away she said i know your time will be taken up and you must not let me or the boys be troublesome but to have you here makes me so much less lost and lonely and i shall have such a friend in your erminia is that her name  ermine an old welsh name the softest i ever heard indeed it is dressing time added colonel keith and both moved away with the startled precision of members of a punctual military household still feeling themselves accountable to somebody     chapter vi ermines resolution     for as his hand the weather steers   so thrive i best twixt joys and tears   and all the year have some green earsh vaughan   alison had not been wrong in her presentiment that the second interview would be more trying than the first the exceeding brightness and animation of ermines countenance her speaking eyes unchanged complexion and lively mannerabove all the restoration of her real substantial selfhad so sufficed and engrossed colin keith in the gladness of their first meeting that he had failed to comprehend her helpless state and already knowing her to be an invalid not entirely recovered from her accident he was only agreeably surprised to see the beauty of face he had loved so long retaining all its vivacity of expression and when he met alison the next morning with a cordial brotherly greeting and inquiry for her sister her very well and not at all the worse for the excitement were so hearty and ready that he could not have guessed that well with ermine meant something rather relative than positive alison brought him a playful message from her that since he was not going to belfast she should meet him with a freer conscience if he would first give her time for roses lessons and as he said he had lived long enough with messrs conrade and co to acknowledge the wisdom of the message but rose had not long been at leisure to look out for him before he made his appearance and walked in by right as one at home and sitting down in his yesterdays place took the little maiden on his knee and began to talk to her about the lessons he had been told to wait for what would she have done without them he knew some people who never could leave the house quiet enough to hear onesself speak if they were deprived of lessons was that the way with her rose laughed like a creature her aunt said to whom the notion of noise at play was something strange and ridiculous necessity has reduced her to jacqueline pascals system with her pensionnaires who were allowed to play one by one without any noise  but i dont play all alone said rose i play with you aunt ermine and with violetta  and violetta speedily had the honour of an introduction very solemnly gone through in due form ermine in the languid sportiveness of enjoyment of his presence and his kindness to the child inciting rose to present miss violetta williams to colonel keith an introduction that he returned with a grand military salute at the same time as he shook the dolls inseparable fingers well miss violetta and miss rose when you come to live with me i shall hope for the pleasure of teaching you to make a noise  what does he mean said rose turning round amazed upon her aunt  i am afraid he does not quite know said ermine sadly  nay ermine said he turning from the child and bending over her you are the last who should say that have i not told you that there is nothing now in our wayno one with a right to object and means enough for all we should wish including her what is the matter he added startled by her look  ah colin i thought you knew  knew what ermine with his brows drawn together  knewwhat i am she said knew the impossibility what they have not told you i thought i was the invalid the cripple with every one  i knew you had suffered cruelly i knew you were lame he said breathlessly butwhat  it is more than lame she said i should be better off if the fiction of the queens of spain were truth with me i could not move from this chair without help oh colin poor colin it was very cruel not to have prepared you for this she added as he gazed at her in grief and dismay and made a vain attempt to find the voice that would not come yes indeed it is so she said the explosion rather than the fire did mischief below the knee that poor nature could not repair and i can but just stand and cannot walk at all  has anything been doneadvice he murmured  advice upon advice so that i felt at the last almost a compensation to be out of the way of the doctors no nothing more can be done and now that one is used to it the snail is very comfortable in its shell but i wish you could have known it sooner she added seeing him shade his brow with his hand overwhelmed  what you must have suffered he murmured  that is all over long ago every year has left that further behind and made me more content dear colin for me there is nothing to grieve  he could not control himself rose up made a long stride and passed through the open window into the garden  oh if i could only follow him gasped ermine joining her hands and looking up  is it because you cant walk said rose somewhat frightened and for the first time beginning to comprehend that her joyoustempered aunt could be a subject for pity  oh this was what i feared sighed ermine oh give us strength to go through with it then becoming awake to the childs presencea little water if you please my dear then more composedly dont be frightened my rose you did not know it was such a shock to find me so laid by  he is in the garden walking up and down said rose may i go and tell him how much merrier you always are than aunt ailie  poor ermine felt anything but merry just then but she had some experience of roses powers of soothing and signed assent so in another second colonel keith was met in the hasty agonized walk by which he was endeavouring to work off his agitation and the slender child looked wistfully up at him from dark depths of half understanding eyesplease please dont be so very sorry she said aunt ermine does not like it she never is sorry for herself  have i shaken herdistressed her he asked anxiously  she doesnt like you to be sorry said rose looking up and indeed she does not mind it she is such a merry aunt please come in again and see how happy we always are  the last words were spoken so near the window that ermine caught them and said yes come in colin and learn not to grieve for me or you will make me repent of my selfish gladness yesterday  not grieve he exclaimed when i think of the beautiful vigorous being that used to be the life of the place and he would have said more but for a deprecating sign of the hand  well she said half smiling it is a pity to think even of a crushed butterfly but indeed colin if you can bear to listen to me i think i can show you that it all has been a blessing even by sight as well as of course by faith only remember the unsatisfactoriness of our conditionthe never seeing or hearing from one another after that day when mr beauchamp came down on us did not the accident win for us a parting that was much better to remember than that state of things oh the pining weary feel as if all the world had closed on me i do assure you it was much worse than anything that came after the burn yes if i had been well and doing like others i know i should have fretted and wearied pined myself ill perhaps whereas i could always tell myself that every year of your absence might be a step towards your finding me well and when i was forced to give up that hope for myself why then colin the never seeing your name made me think you would never be disappointed and grieved as you are now it is very merciful the way that physical trials help one through those of the mind  i never knew said the colonel all my aunts latter letters spoke of your slow improvement beyond hope  true in her time i had not reached the point where i stopped the last time i saw her i was still upstairs and indeed i did not half know what i could do till i tried  yes said he brightened by that buoyant look so remarkable in her face and you will yet do more ermine you have convinced me that we shall be all the happier together  but that was not what i meant to convince you of she said faintly  not what you meant perhaps but what it did convince me was that youas you are my ermineare ten thousand times more to me than even as the beautiful girl and that there never can be a happier pair than we shall be when i am your hands and feet  ermine sat up and rallied all her forces choked back the swelling of her throat and said dear colin it cannot be i trusted you were understanding that when i told you how it was with me  he could not speak from consternation  no she said it would be wrong in me to think of it for an instant that you should have done so showso colin i cannot talk of it but it would be as ungenerous in me to consent as it is noble of you to propose it  it is no such thing he answered it has been the one object and thought of my life the only hope i have had all these years  exactly so she said struggling again to speak firmly and that is the very thing you kept your allegiance to the bright tall walking active girl and it would be a shame in the scorched cripple to claim it  dont call yourself names have i not told you that you are more than the same  you do not know you are pleased because my face is not burnt nor grown much older and because i can talk and laugh in the same voice still oh how it quivered but it would be a wicked mockery in me to pretend to be the wife you want yes i know you think you do but that is just because my looks are so deceitful and you have kept on thinking about me but you must make a fresh beginning  you can tell me that he said indignantly  because it is not new to me she said the quarter of an hour you stood by me with that deadly calm in your white face was the real farewell to the young hopeful dream of that bright summer i wish it was as calm now  i believed you dying then answered he  do not make me think it would have been better for you if i had been she said imploringly it was as much the end and i knew it from the time my recovery stopped short i would have let you know if i could and then you would not have been so much shocked  so as to cut me off from you entirely  no indeed the thought of seeing you again was tootoo overwhelming to be indulged in knowing as i did that if you were the same to me it must be at this sad cost to you and her eyes filled with tears  it is you who make it so ermine  no it is the providence that has set me aside from the active work of life pray do not go on colin it is only giving us both useless pain you do not know what it costs me to deny you and i feel that i must i know you are only acting on the impulse of generosity yes i will say so though you think it is to please yourself she added with one of those smiles that nothing could drive far from her lips and which made it infinitely harder to acquiesce in her denial  i will make you think so in time he said then i might tell you you had no right to please yourself she answered still with the same air of playfulness you have got a brother you knowandyes i hear you growl but if he is a poor old broken man out of health it is the more reason you should not vex him nor hamper yourself with a helpless commodity  you are not taking the way to make me forget what my brother has done for us  how do you know that he did not save me from being a strongminded military lady after all it was absurd to expect people to look favourably on our liking for one another and you know they could not be expected to know that there was real stuff in the affair if there had not been we should have thought so all the same you know and been quite as furious  he could not help smiling recollecting fury that in the course of these twelve years he had seen evinced under similar circumstances by persons who had consoled themselves before he had done pitying them still he said gravely i think there was harshness  so do i but not so much as i thought at that time andoh surely that is not rachel curtis i told her i thought you would call  intolerable he muttered between his teeth is she always coming to bore you  she has been very kind and my great enlivenment said ermine and she cant be expected to know how little we want her oh there the danger is averted she must have asked if you were here  i was just thinking that she was the chief objection to lady temples kind wish of having you at myrtlewood  does lady temple know asked ermine blushing  i could not keep it from one who has been so uniformly kind to me but i desired her not to let it go further till i should hear your wishes  yes she has a right to know said ermine but please not a word elsewhere  and will you not come to stay with her  i oh no i am fit for no place but this you dont half know how bad i am when you have seen a little more of us you will be quite convinced  well at least you give me leave to come here  leave when it is a greater pleasure than i ever thought to have again that is while you understand that you said goodbye to the ermine of beauchamp parsonage twelve years ago and that the thing here is only a sort of ghost most glad and grateful to be a frienda sister  so he said those are to be the terms of my admission  the only possible ones  i will consider them i have not accepted them  you will she said  but she met a smile in return implying that there might be a will as steadfast as her own although the question might be waived for a time  meantime rachel was as nearly hating colonel keith as principle would allow with human reeds newly finished burning in her pocket military society fermenting in her brain and curatocult still unacknowledged had he not had quite time for any rational visit was he to devour mackarel lane as well as myrtlewood she was on her way to the latter house meeting grace as she went and congratulating herself that he could not be in two places at once whilst grace secretly wondered how far she might venture to build on alison williamss half confidence and regretted the anxiety wasted by rachel and the mother though to be sure that of mrs curtis was less uncalled for than her daughters since it was only the fear of fannys not being sufficiently guarded against misconstructions  rachel held up her hands in despair in the hall six officers cards she exclaimed  no only six cards said grace there are two of each  thats enough sighed rachel and look there gazing through the gardendoor she is walking with the young puppy that dined here on thursday and they called alick  do you remember said grace how she used to chatter about alick when she first came to us at six years old he was the child of one of the officers can this be the same  thats one of your ideas grace look this youth could have been hardly born when fanny came to us no he is only one of the idlers that military life has accustomed her to  rather against graces feeling rachel drew her on so as to come up with lady temple and her friend in the midst of their conversation and they heard the last words  then you will give me dear bessies direction  thank you it will be the greatest kindness  oh grace rachel is it you exclaimed fanny you have not met before i think mr keithmiss curtis  very young indeed were both face and figure fair and pale and though there was a moustache it was so light and silky as to be scarcely visible the hair too was almost flaxen and the whole complexion had a washedout appearance the eyes indeed were of the same peculiar deep blue as the colonels but even these were little seen under their heavy sleepy lids and the long limbs had in every movement something of weight and slowness the very sight of which fretted rachel and made her long to shake him it appeared that he was come to spend the sunday at avonmouth and grace tried to extract the comfort for her mother that two gentlemen were better than one and fanny need not be on their minds for chaperonage for that day  a party of gardenchairs on the lawn invited repose and there the ladies seated themselves fanny laying down her heavy crape bonnet and showing her pretty little delicate face now much fresher and more roseate than when she arrived though her widespreading black draperies gave a certain dignity to her slight figure contrasting with the summer muslins of her two cousins as did her hothouse plant fairness with their firm healthy glow of complexion her tender shrinking grace with their upright vigour the gentleman of the party leant hack in a languid easy posture as though only half awake and the whole was so quiet that grace missing the usual tumult of children asked after them  the boys have gone to their favourite cove under the plantation they have a fort there and hubert told me he was to be a hero and miss williams a shero  i would not encourage that description of sport said rachel willing to fight a battle in order to avert maternal anecdotes of boyish sayings  they like it so much said fanny and they learn so much now that they act all the battles they read about  that is what i object to said rachel it is accustoming them to confound heroism with pugnacity  no but rachel dear they do quarrel and fight among themselves much less now that this is all in play and good humour pleaded fanny  yes that may be but you are cultivating the dangerous instinct although for a moment giving it a better direction  dangerous oh alick do you think it can be said fanny less easily borne down with a supporter beside her  according to the peace society he answered with a quiet air of courteous deference perhaps you belong to it  no indeed answered rachel rather indignantly i think war the great purifier and ennobler of nations when it is for a good and great cause but i think education ought to protest against confounding mere love of combat with heroism  query the true meaning of the word he said leaning back  heros yes from the same root as the german herr readily responded rachel meaning no more than lord and master but there can be no doubt that the progress of ideas has linked with it a much nobler association  progress what since the heroes were half divine  half divine in the esteem of a people who thought brute courage godlike to us the word maintains its semidivinity and it should be our effort to associate it only with that which veritably has the godlike stamp  and that is  doing more than ones duty exclaimed rachel with a glistening eye  very uncomfortable and superfluous and not at all easy he said half shutting his already heavy eyes  easy no thats the beauty and the glory  major sherborne and captain lester in the drawing room my lady announced coombe who had looked infinitely cheered since this military influx  you will come with me grace said fanny rising i dare say you had rather not rachel and it would be a pity to disturb you alick  thank you it would be decidedly more than my duty  i am quite sorry to go you are so amusing said fanny but i suppose you will have settled about heroism by the time we come out again and will tell me what the boys ought to play at  rachels age was quite past the need of troubling herself at being left teteatete with a mere lad like this and besides it was an opportunity not to be neglected of giving a young carpet knight a lesson in true heroism there was a pause after the other two had moved off rachel reflected for a few moments and then precipitated by the fear of her audience falling asleep she exclaimed  no words have been more basely misused than hero and heroine the one is the mere fighting animal whose strength or fortune have borne him through some more than ordinary danger the other is only the subject of an adventure perfectly irrespective of her conduct in it  bathos attends all high words he said as she paused chiefly to see whether he was awake and not like her dumb playfellow of old  this is not their natural bathos but their misuse they ought to be reserved for those who in any department have passed the limits to which the necessity of their position constrained them and done acts of selfdevotion for the good of others i will give you an instance and from your own profession that you may see i am not prejudiced besides the hero of it is past praise or blame  encouraged by seeing a little more of his eyes she went on it was in the course of the siege of delhi a shell came into a tent where some sick and wounded were lying there was one young officer among them who could move enough to have had a chance of escaping the explosion but instead of that he took the shell up its fuse burning as it was and ran with it out of the tent then hurled it to a distance it exploded and of course was his death but the rest were saved and i call that a deed of heroism far greater than mounting a breach or leading a forlorn hope  killed you say inquired mr keith still in the same lethargic manner  oh yes mortally wounded carried back to die among the men he had saved  jessie cameron singing his dirge mumbled this provoking individual with something about the form of his cheek that being taken by rachel for a derisive smile made her exclaim vehemently you do not mean to undervalue an action like that in comparison with mere animal pugnacity in an advance  more than ones duty was your test he said  and was not this more than duty ah i see yours is a spirit of depreciation and i can only say i pity you  he took the trouble to lift himself up and make a little bow of acknowledgment certainly he was worse than the colonel but rachel while mustering her powers for annihilating him was annoyed by all the party in the drawingroom coming forth to join them the other officers rallying young keith upon his luxurious station and making it evident that he was a proverb in the regiment for taking his ease chairs were brought out and afternoon tea and the callers sat down to wait for colonel keith to come in grace feeling obliged to stay to help fanny entertain her visitors and rachel to protect her from their follies one thing grace began to perceive that lady temple had in her former world been a person of much more consideration than she was made here and seeing the polite and deferential manner of these officers to her could only wonder at her gentle content and submission in meeting with no particular attention from anybody and meekly allowing herself to be browbeaten by rachel and lectured by her aunt  a lecture was brewing up for her indeed poor mrs curtis was very much concerned at the necessity and only spurred up by a strong sense of duty to give a hintthe study of which hint cost her a whole sleepless night and a very weary sunday morning she decided that her best course would be to drive to myrtlewood rather early on her way to church and take up fanny gaining a previous conference with her alone if possible yes my dear she said to grace i must get it over before church or it will make me so nervous all through the service and grace loving her mother best durst not suggest what it might do to fanny hoping that the service might help her to digest the hint  mrs curtiss regular habits were a good deal shocked to find fanny still at the breakfast table the children had indeed long finished and were scattered about the room one of them standing between colonel keiths knees repeating a hymn but the younger guest was still in the midst of his meal and owned in his usual cool manner that he was to blame for the lateness there was no resisting the charms of no morning parade  her aunts appearance made fanny imagine it much later than it really was and she hurried off the children to be dressed and proceeded herself to her room mrs curtis following and by way of preliminary asking when colonel keith was going to ireland  oh said fanny blushing most suspiciously under her secret he is not going to ireland now  indeed i quite understood he intended it  yes faltered fanny but he found that he need not  indeed again ejaculated poor perplexed mrs curtis but then at least he is going away soon  he must go to scotland byandby but for the present he is going into lodgings do you know of any nice ones dear aunt  well i suppose you cant help that you know my dear it would never do for him to stay in this house  i never thought of that said fanny simply the colour coming in a fresh glow  no my dear but you see you are very young and inexperienced i do not say you have done anything the least amiss or that you ever would mean it only you will forgive your old aunt for putting you on your guard  fanny kissed her but with eyes full of tears and cheeks burning then her candour drew from herit was he that thought of getting a lodging i am glad i did not persuade him not but you know he always did live with us  with us yes my poor dear that is the difference and you see he feels it but indeed my dear child though he is a very good man i dare say and quite a gentleman all but his beard you had better not encourageyou know people are so apt to make remarks  i have no fear said fanny turning away her head conscious of the impossibility of showing her aunt her mistake  ah my dear you dont guess how ready people are to talk and you would not likefor your childrens sake for your husbands sakethatthat  pray pray aunt cried fanny much pained indeed you dont know my husband had confidence in him more than in any one he told him to take care of me and look after the boys i couldnt hold aloof from him without transgressing those wishesand the words were lost in a sob  my dear indeed i did not mean to distress you you know i dare sayi mean hesitated poor mrs curtis i know you must see a great deal of him i only want you to take careappearances are appearances and if it was said you had all these young officers always coming about  i dont think they will come it was only just to call and they have known me so long it is all out of respect to my father and sir stephen said fanny meekly as ever indeed i would not for the world do anything you did not like dear aunt but there cant be any objection to my having mrs hammond and the children to spend the day tomorrow  mrs curtis did not like it she had an idea that all military ladies were dashing and vulgar but she could not say there was any objection so she went on to the head of poor fannys offending this young man my dear he seems to make himself very intimate  alick keith oh aunt said fanny more surprised than by all the rest dont you know about him his father and mother were our greatest friends always i used to play with him every day till i came to you and then just as i married poor mrs keith died and we had dear little bessie with us till her father could send her home and when poor alick was so dreadfully wounded before delhi sir stephen sent him up in a litter to the hills for mamma and me to nurse mamma was so fond of him she used to call him her son  yes my dear i dare say you have been very intimate but you see you are very young and his staying here  i thought he would be so glad to come and be with the colonel who was his guardian and bessies said fanny and i have promised to have bessie to stay with me she was such a dear little thing  well my dear it may be a good thing for you to have a young lady with you and if he is to come over her presence will explain it understand me my dear i am not at all afraid of youryour doing anything foolish only to get talked of is so dreadful in your situation that you cant be too careful  yes yes thank you dear aunt murmured the drooping and subdued fanny aware how much the remonstrance must cost her aunt and sure that she must be in fault in some way if she could only see how please dear aunt help me for indeed i dont know how to managetell me how to be civil and kind to my dear husbands friends withoutwithout  her voice broke down though she kept from tears as an unkindness to her aunt  in very fact little as she knew it she could not have defended herself better than by this humble question throwing the whole guidance of her conduct upon her aunt if she had been affronted mrs curtis could have been displeased but to be thus set to prescribe the right conduct was at once mollifying and perplexing  well well my dear child we all know you wish to do right you can judge best i would not have you ungrateful or uncivil only you know you are living very quietly and intimacyoh my dear i know your own feeling will direct you dear child you have taken what i said so kindly and now let me see that dear little girl  rachel had not anticipated that the upshot of a remonstrance even from her mother would be that fanny was to be directed by her own feeling  that same feeling took lady temple to mackarel lane later in the day she had told the colonel her intention and obtained alisons assurance that ermines stay at myrtlewood need not be impracticable and armed with their consent she made her timid tap at miss williams door and showed her sweet face within it  may i come in your sister and your little niece are gone for a walk i told them i would come i did want to see you  thank you said ermine with a sweet smile colouring cheek yet grave eyes and much taken by surprise at being seized by both hands and kissed on each cheek  yes you must let me said her visitor looking up with her pretty imploring gesture you know i have known him so long and he has been so good to me  indeed it is very kind in you said ermine fully feeling the force of the plea expressed in the winning young face and gentle eyes full of tears  oh no i could not help it i am only so sorry we kept him away from you when you wanted him so much but we did not know and he was sir stephens right hand and we none of us knew what to do without him but if he had only told  thank you oh thank you said ermine but indeed it was better for him to be away  even her wish to console that pleading little widow could not make her say that his coming would not have been good for her it has been such a pleasure to hear he had so kind and happy a home all these years  oh you cannot think how sir stephen loved and valued him the one thing i always did wish was that conrade should grow up to be as much help and comfort to his father and now he never can but driving back a tear it was so hard that you should not have known how distinguished and useful and good he was all those years only now i shall have the pleasure of telling you and she smiled she was quite a different being when free from the unsympathizing influence which without her understanding it had kept her from dwelling on her dearest associations  it will be a pleasure of pleasures said ermine eagerly  then you will do me a favour a very great favour said lady temple laying hold of her hand again if you and your sister and niece will come and stay with me and as ermine commenced her refusal she went on in the same coaxing way with a description of her plans for ermines comfort giving her two rooms on the ground floor and assuring her of the absence of steps the immunity from all teasing by the children of the full consent of her sister and the wishes of the colonel nay when ermine was still unpersuaded of the exceeding kindness it would be to herself you see i am terribly young really she said though i have so many boys and my aunt thinks it awkward for me to have so many officers calling and i cant keep them away because they are my fathers and sir stephens old friends so please do come and make it all right  ermine was driven so hard and so entirely deprived of all excuse that she had no alternative left but to come to the real motive  i ought not she said it is not good for him so you must not press me dear lady temple you see it is best for him that nobody should ever know of what has been between us  what dont you mean exclaimed fanny breaking short off  i cannot said ermine  but he would like it he wishes it as much as ever  i know he does said ermine with a troubled voice but you see that is because he did not know what a wretched remnant i am and he never has had time to think about any one else  oh no no  and it would be very unfair of me to take advantage of that and give him such a thing as i am  oh dear but that is very sad cried fanny looking much startled  but i am sure you must see that it is right  it may be right and out burst fannys ready tears but it is very very hard and disagreeable if you dont mind my saying so when i know it is so good of you and dont you mean to let him even see you when he has been constant so long  no i see no reason for denying myself that indeed i believe it is better for him to grow used to me as i am and be convinced of the impossibility  well then why will you not come to me  do you not see in all your kindness that my coming to you would make every one know the terms between us while no one remarks his just coming to me here as an old friend and if he were ever to turn his mind to any one else  he will never do that i am sure  there is no knowing he has never been in his own estimation disengaged from me said ermine his brother is bent on his marrying and he ought to be perfectly free to do so and not under the disadvantage that any report of this affair would be to him  well i am sure he never will said fanny almost petulantly i know i shall hate her thats all  ermine thought her own charity towards mrs colin keith much more dubious than lady temples but she continued  at any rate you will be so very kind as not to let any one know of it i am glad you do i should not feel it right that you should not but it is different with others  thank you and if you will not come to me you will let me come to you wont you it will be so nice to come and talk him over with you perhaps i shall persuade you some of these days after all only i must go now for i always give the children their tea on sunday but please let your dear little niece come up tomorrow and play with them the little hammonds will be there she is just their age  ermine felt obliged to grant this at least though she was as doubtful of her shy roses happiness as of the expedience of the intimacy but there was no being ungracious to the gentle visitor and no doubt ermine felt rejoiced and elevated she did not need fresh assurances of colins constancy but the affectionate sisterlike congratulations of this loving winning creature showed how real and in earnest his intentions were and then lady temples grateful esteem for him being as it was the reflection of her husbands was no small testimony to his merits  pretty creature said ermine to herself really if it did come to that i could spare him to her better than to any one else she has some notion how to value him  alison and rose had in the meantime been joined by colonel keith and the boys whom alick had early deserted in favour of a sunny sandy nook the colonels purpose was hard on poor alison it was to obtain her opinion of her sisters decision and the likelihood of persistence in it it was not perhaps bad for either that they conversed under difficulties the boys continually coming back to them from excursions on the rocks and rose holding her aunts hand all the time but to be sure rose had heard nearly all the colonels affairs and somehow mixed him up with henry of cranstoun  very tenderly towards alison herself did colin keith speak it was the first time they had ever been brought into close contact and she had quite to learn to know him she had regarded his return as probably a misfortune but it was no longer possible to do so when she heard his warm and considerate way of speaking of her sister and saw him only desirous of learning what was most for her real happiness nay he even made a convert of alison herself she did believe that would ermine but think it right to consent she would be happy and safe in the care of one who knew so well how to love her terrible as the wrench would be to alison herself she thought he deserved her sister and that she would be as happy with him as earth could make her but she did not believe ermine would ever accept him she knew the strong unvarying resolution by which her sister had always held to what she thought right and did not conceive that it would waver the acquiescence in his visits and the undisguised exultant pleasure in his society were evidences to alison not of wavering or relenting but of confidence in ermines own sense of impossibility she durst not give him any hope though she owned that he merited success did she think his visits bad for her sister he then asked in the unselfishness that pleaded so strongly for him  no certainly not she answered eagerly then made a little hesitation that made him ask further  my only fear she said candidly is that if this is pressed much on her and she has to struggle with you and herself too it may hurt her health trouble tells not on her cheerfulness but on her nerves  thank you he said i will refrain  alison was much happier than she had been since the first apprehension of his return the first pang at seeing ermines heart anothers property had been subdued the present state of affairs was indefinitelyprolonged and she not only felt trust in colin keiths consideration for her sister but she knew that an act of oblivion was past on her perpetration of the injury she was right his original pitying repugnance to a mere unknown child could not be carried on to the grave saddened woman devoted to her sister and in the friendly brotherly tone of that interview each understood the other and when alison came home and said i have been walking with colin her look made ermine very happy  and learning to know him  learning to sympathize with him ermine with steady eyes and voice you are hard on him  now ailie said ermine once for all he is not to set you on me as he has done with lady temple the more he persuades me the better i know that to listen would be an abuse of his constancy it would set him wrong with his brother and as dear edwards affairs stand we have no right to carry the supposed disgrace into a family that would believe it though he does not if i were ever so well i should not think it right to marry i shall not shun the sight of him it is delightful to me and a less painful cure to him than sending him away would be it is in the nature of things that he should cool into a friendly kindly feeling and i shall try to bear it or if he does marry it will be all right i suppose but her voice faltered and she gave a sort of broken laugh  there she said with a recovered flash of liveliness theres my resolution to do what i like more than anything in the world as long as i can and when it is over i shall be helped to do without it  i cant believe broke out alison  not in your heart but in your reason said ermine endeavouring to smile he will hover about here and always be kind loving considerate but a time will come that he will want the home happiness i cannot give then he will not wear out his affection on the impossible literary cripple but begin over again and be happy and alison if your love for me is of the sound strong sort i know it is you will help me through with it and never say one word to make all this less easy and obvious to him     chapter vii waitng for rose     not envy sure for if you gave me   leave to take or to refuse   in earnest do you think id choose   that sort of new love to enslave mer browning   so instead of going to belfast here was colonel keith actually taking a lodging and settling himself into it nay even going over to avoncester on a horsebuying expedition not merely for the temples but for himself  this time rachel did think herself sure of miss williams ear in peace and came down on her with two fat manuscripts upon human reeds and military society preluding however by bitter complaints of the traveller for never having vouchsafed her an answer nor having even restored curatocult though she had written three times and sent a directed envelope and stamps for the purpose the paper must be ruined by so discourteous an editor indeed she had not been nearly so much interested as usual by the last few numbers if only she could get her paper back she should try the englishwomans hobbyhorse or some other paper of more progress than that traveller is it not very hard to feel ones self shut out from the main stream of the work of the world when ones heart is burning  i think you overrate the satisfaction  you cant tell you are contented with that sort of home peaceful sunshine that i know suffices many even intellectual as you are you cant tell what it is to feel power within to strain at the leash and see others in the race  i was thinking whether you could not make an acceptable paper on the lace system which you really know so thoroughly  the fact is said rachel it is much more difficult to describe from ones own observation than from other sources  but rather more original said ermine quite overcome by the naivete of the confession  i dont see that said rachel it is abstract reasoning from given facts that i aim at as you will understand when you have heard my human reeds and my otherdear me theres your door bell i thought that colonel was gone for the day  there are other people in the world besides the colonel ermine began to say though she hardly felt as if there were and at any rate a sense of rescue crossed her the persons admitted took them equally by surprise being conrade temple and mr keith  i thought said rachel as she gave her unwilling hand to the latter that you would have been at avoncester today  i always get out of the way of horsedealing i know no greater bore he answered  mamma sent me down conrade was explaining mr keiths uncle found out that he knew miss williamsno thats not it miss williams uncle found out that mr keith preached a sermon or something of that sort so mamma sent me down to show him the way to call upon her but i need not stay now need i  after that elegant introduction and lucid explanation i think you may be excused returned alick keith  the boy shook ermines hand with his soldierly grace but rather spoilt the effect thereof by his aside i wanted to see the toad and the pictures our miss williams told me about but ill come another time and the wink of his black eyes and significant shrug of his shoulders at rachel were irresistible they all laughed even rachel herself as ermine seeing it would be worse to ignore the demonstration said the elements of aunt and boy do not always work together  no said rachel i have never been forgiven for being the first person who tried to keep those boys in order  and now said ermine turning to her other visitor perhaps i may discover which of us or of our uncles preached a sermon  mine i suspect returned mr keith your sister and i made out at luncheon that you had known my uncle mr clare of bishopsworthy  mr clare oh yes cried ermine eagerly he took the duty for one of our curates once for a long vacation did you ever hear him speak of beauchamp  yes often and of dr williams he will be very much interested to hear of you  it was a time i well remember said ermine he was an oxford tutor then and i was about fourteen just old enough to be delighted to hear clever talk and his sermons were memorable they were the first i ever listened to  there are few sermons that it is not an infliction to listen to began rachel but she was not heard or noticed  i assure you they are even more striking now in his blindness  blindness indeed i had not heard of that  even rachel listened with interest as the young officer explained that his uncle whom both he and miss williams talked of as a man of note of whom every one must have heard had for the last four years been totally blind but continued to be an active parish priest visiting regularly preaching and taking a share in the service which he knew by heart he had of course a curate who lived with him and took very good care of him  no one else said rachel i thought your sister lived at bishopsworthy  no my sister lives or has lived at little worthy the next parish and as unlike it as possible it has a railroad in it and the cockneys have come down on it and villafied it my aunt mrs lacy clare has lived there ever since my sister has been with her but now her last daughter is to be married she wishes to give up housekeeping  and your sister is coming to lady temple said rachel in her peculiar affirmative way of asking questions she will find it very dull here  with all the advantages of avoncester at hand inquired alick with a certain gleam under his flaxen eyelashes that convinced ermine that he said it in mischief but rachel drew herself up gravely and answered  in lady temples situation any such thing would be most inconsistent with good feeling  such as the cathedral calmly not to say sleepily inquired alick to the excessive diversion of ermine who saw that rachel had never been laughed at in her life and was utterly at a loss what to make of it  if you meant the cathedral she said a little uncertainly recollecting the tone in which mr clare had just been spoken of and thinking that perhaps miss keith might be a curatolatress i am afraid it is not of much benefit to people living at this distance and there is not much to be said for the imitation here  you will see what my sister says to it she only wants training to be the main strength of the bishopsworthy choir and perhaps she may find it here  rachel was evidently undecided whether chants or marches were miss keiths passion and perhaps which propensity would render the young lady the most distasteful to herself ermine thought it merciful to divert the attack by mentioning mr clares love of music and hoping his curate could gratify it no mr keith said it was very unlucky that mr lifford did not know one note from another so that his vicar could not delude himself into hoping that his playing on his violin was anything but a nuisance to his companion and in spite of all the curates persuasions he only indulged himself therewith on rare occasions but as ermine showed surprise at the retention of a companion devoid of this sixth sense so valuable to the blind he addedno one would suit him so well mr lifford has been with him ever since his sight began to fail and understands all his ways  yes that makes a great difference  and pursued the young man coming to something like life as he talked of his uncle though he is not quite all that a companion might be my uncle says there would be no keeping the living without him and i do not believe there would unless my uncle would have me instead  ermine laughed and looked interested not quite knowing what other answer to make rachel lifted up her eyebrows in amazement  another advantage added alick who somehow seemed to accept ermine as one of the family is that he is no impediment to bessies living there for poor man he has a wife but insane  then your sister will live there said rachel what an enviable position to have the control of means of doing good that always falls to the women of a clerical family  tell her so said the brother with his odd suppressed smile  what she does not think so  now said mr keith leaning back on my answer depends whether bessie enters this place with a character for chanting croquet or crochet which should you like worst miss curtis  i like evasions worst of all said rachel with a flash of something like playful spirit though there was too much asperity in it  but you see unfortunately i dont know said alick keith slowly i have never been able to find out nor she either i dont know what may be the effect of example he added ermine wondered whether he were in mischief or earnest and suspected a little of both  i shall be very happy to show miss keith any of my ways said rachel with no doubts at all but she will find me terribly impeded here when does she come  not for a month or six weeks when the wedding will be over it is high time she saw something of her respected guardian  the colonel  yes then to ermine every one turns to him with reliance and confidence i believe no one in the army received so many last charges as he has done or executes them more fully  and said ermine feeling pleasure colour her cheek more deeply than was convenient you are relations  so far away that only a scotsman would acknowledge the cousinship  but do not you call yourself scotch said ermine who had for years thought it glorious to do so  my great grandfather came from gowanbrae said alick but our branch of the family has lived and died in the th highlanders for so many generations that we dont know what a home is out of it our birthplacesyes and our gravesare in all parts of the world  were you ever in scotland  never and i dread nothing so much as being quartered there just imagine the trouble it would be to go over the pedigree of every keith i met and to dine with them all upon haggis and sheeps head  theres no place i want to sea as much as scotland said rachel  oh yes young ladies always do  it is not for a young lady reason said rachel bluntly i want to understand the principle of diffused education as there practised the only other places i should really care to see are the grand reformatory for the destitute in holland and the hospital for cretins in switzerland  scotch pedants dutch thieves swiss goitresi will bear your tastes in mind said mr keith rising to take leave  really said rachel when he was gone if he had not that silly military tone of joking there might be something tolerable about him if he got into good hands he seems to have some good notions about his sister she must be just out of the schoolroom at the very turn of life and i will try to get her into my training and show her a little of the real beauty and usefulness of the career she has before her how late he has stayed i am afraid there is no time for the manuscripts  and though ermine was too honest to say she was sorry rachel did not miss the regret  colonel keith came the next day and under his arm was a parcel which was laid in little roses arms and when unrolled proved to contain a magnificent wax doll no doubt long the object of unrequited attachment to many a little avoncestrian a creature of beauteous and unmeaning face limpid eyes hair that could be brushed and all her members waxen as far as could be seen below the provisional habiliment of pink paper that enveloped her little roses complexion became crimson and she did not utter a word while her aunt colouring almost as much laughed and asked where were her thanks  oh with a long gasp it cant be for me  do you think it is for your aunt said the colonel  oh thank you but such a beautiful creature for me said rose with another gasp quite oppressed aunt ermine how shall i ever make her clothes nice enough  we will see about that my dear now take her into the verandah and introduce her to violetta  yes then pausing and looking into the fixed eyes aunt ermine i never saw such a beauty except that one the little girl left behind on the bench on the esplanade when aunt ailie said i should he coveting if i went on wishing violetta was like her  i remember said ermine i have heard enough of that ne plus ultra of doll indeed colin you have given a great deal of pleasure where the materials of pleasure are few no one can guess the delight a doll is to a solitary imaginative child  thank you he said smiling  i believe i shall enjoy it as much as rose added ermine both for play and as a study please turn my chair a little this way i want to see the introduction to violetta here comes the beauty in roses own cloak  colonel keith leant over the back of her chair and silently watched but the scene was not quite what they expected violetta was sitting in her slantingdicular position on her chair placed on a bench and her little mistress knelt down before her took her in her arms and began to hug her  violetta darling you need not be afraid there is a new beautiful creature come and i shall call her colinette and we must be very kind to her because colonel keith is so good and knows your grandpapa and to tell you a great secret violetta that you must not tell colinette or anybody i think he is aunt ermines own true knight  hush whispered the colonel over ermines head as he perceived her about to speak  so you must be very good to her violetta and you shall help me make her clothes but you need not be afraid i ever could love any one half or one quarter as much as you my own dear child not if she were ten times as beautiful and so come and show her to augustus shell never be like you dear old darling  it is a study said the colonel as rose moved off with a doll in either hand a moral that you should take home  ermine shook her head but smiled saying tell me does your young cousin know  alick keith not from me and lady temple is perfectly to be trusted but i believe his father knew it was for no worse reason that i was made to exchange but never mind ermine he is a very good fellow and what is the use of making a secret of what even violetta knows  there was no debating the point for her desire of secrecy was prompted by the resolution to leave him unbound whereas his wish for publicity was with the purpose of binding himself and ermine was determined that discussion was above all to be avoided and that she would after the first explanation keep the conversation upon other subjects so she only answered with another reproving look and smile and said and now i am going to make you useful the editor of the traveller is travelling and has left his work to me i have been keeping some letters for him to answer in his own hand because mine betrays womanhood but i have just heard that he is to stay about six weeks more and people must be put out of their misery before that will you copy a few for me here is some paper with the office stamp  what an important woman you are ermine  if you had been in england all this time you would see how easy the step is into literary work but you must not betray this for the travellers sake or ailies  your writing is not very womanish said the colonel as she gave him his task or is this yours it is not like that of those verses on malvern hills that you copied out for me the only thing you ever gave me  i hope it is more to the purpose than it was then and it has had to learn to write in all sorts of attitudes  whats this as he went on with the paper your manuscript entitled curatocult is that the word i had taken it for the produce of miss curtiss unassisted genius  have you heard her use it said ermine disconcerted having by no means intended to betray rachel  oh yes i heard her declaiming on sunday about what she knows no more about than conrade a detestable pragmatical domineering girl i am thankful that i advised lady temple only to take the house for a year it was right she should see her relations but she must not be tyrannized over  i dont believe she dislikes it  she dislikes no one she used to profess a liking for a huge irishwoman whose husband had risen from the ranks the most tremendous woman i ever saw except miss curtis  you know they were brought up together like sisters  all the worse for she has the habit of passive submission if it were the mother it would be all right and i should be thankful to see her in good keeping but the mother and sister go for nothing and down comes this girl to battle every suggestion with principles picked up from every catchpenny periodical things she does not half understand and enunciates as if no one had even heard of them before  i believe she seldom meets any one who has i mean to whom they are matters of thought i really do like her vigour and earnestness  dont say so ermine one reason why she is so intolerable to me is that she is a grotesque caricature of what you used to be  you have hit it i see why i always liked her besides that it is pleasant to have any sort of visit and a good scrimmage is refreshing she is just what i should have been without papa and edward to keep me down and without the civilizing atmosphere at the park  never  no i was not her equal in energy and beneficence and i was younger when you came but i feel for her longing to be up and doing and her puzzled chafing against constraint and conventionality though it breaks out in very odd effervescences  extremely generous of you when you must be bored to death with her interminable talk  you dont appreciate the pleasure of variety besides she really interests me she is so full of vigorous crudities i believe all that is unpleasing in her arises from her being considered as the clever woman of the family having no man nearly connected enough to keep her in check and living in society that does not fairly meet her i want you to talk to her and take her in hand  me thank you ermine why i could not even stand her talking about you though she has the one grace of valuing you  then you ought in common gratitude for there is no little greatness of soul in patiently coming down to mackarel lane to be snubbed by ones cousins governesss sister  if you will come up to myrtlewood you dont know what you may do  no you are to set no more people upon me though lady temples eyes are very wistful  i did not think you would have held out against her  not when i had against you no indeed though i never did see anybody more winning than she is in that meek submissive gentleness alison says she has cheered up and grown like another creature since your arrival  and alexander keiths yes poor thing we have brought something of her own old world where she was a sort of little queen in her way it is too much to ask me to have patience with these relations ermine if you could see the change from the petted creature she was with her mother and husband almost always the first lady in the place and latterly with a colonial court of her own and now ordered about advised domineered over made nobody of and taking it as meekly and sweetly as if she were grateful for it i verily believe she is but she certainly ought to come away  i am not so sure of that it seems to me rather a dangerous responsibility to take her away from her own relations unless there were any with equal claims  they are her only relations and her husband had none still to be under the constant yoke of an overpowering woman with unfixed opinions seems to be an unmitigated evil for her and her boys and no ones feelings need be hurt by her fixing herself near some public school for her sons education however she is settled for this year and at the end we may decide  with which words he again applied himself to ermines correspondence and presently completed the letter offering to direct the envelope which she refused as having one already directed by the author he rather mischievously begged to see it that he might judge of the character of the writing but this she resisted  however in four days time there was a very comical twinkle in his eye as he informed her that the new number of the traveller was in no favour at the homestead there was such a want of original thought in it ermine felt her imprudence in having risked the betrayal but all she did was to look at him with her full steady eyes and a little twist in each corner of her mouth as she said indeed then we had better enliven it with the recollections of a military secretary and he was both convinced of what he guessed and also that she did not think it right to tell him but he said there is something in that girl i perceive ermine she does think for herself and if she were not so dreadfully earnest that she cant smile she would be the best company of any of the party  i am so glad you think so i shall be delighted if you will really talk to her and help her to argue out some of her crudities indeed she is worth it but i suppose you will hardly stay here long enough to do her any good  what are you going to order me away  i thought your brother wanted you at home  it is all very well to talk of an ancestral home but when it consists of a tall slim house with blank walls and pepperbox turrets set down on a bleak hill side and every one gone that made it once a happy place it is not attractive moreover my only use there would be to be kept as a tame heir the person whose interference would be most resented and i dont recognise that duty  you are a gentleman at large with no obvious duty said ermine meditatively  what none bending his head and looking earnestly at her  oh if you come here out of duty she said archly and with her merry laugh there is not that a nice occasion for picking a quarrel and seriously she continued perhaps it might be good for you if we did i am beginning to fear that i ought not to keep you lingering here without purpose or occupation  fulfil my purpose and i will find occupation  dont say that  this once ermine for one year i shall wait in the hope of convincing you if you do not change your mind in that time i shall look for another staff appointment to last till rose is ready for me  the gravity of this conclusion made ermine laugh thats what you learnt of your chief she said  there would be less difference in age he said though i own i should like my widow to be less helpless than poor little lady temple so he added with the same face of ridiculous earnest if you continue to reject me yourself you will at least rear her with an especial view to her efficiency in that capacity  and as rose at that critical moment looked in at the window eager to be encouraged to come and show colinettes successful toilette he drew her to him with the smile that had won her whole heart and listening to every little bit of honesty about my work and aunt ermines work he told her that he knew she was a very managing domestic character perfectly equal to the charge of both young ladies  aunt ermine says i must learn to manage because some day i shall have to take care of papa  yes with his eyes on ermine all the while learn to be a useful woman who knows if we shant all depend on you byandby  oh do let me be useful to you cried rose i could hem all your handkerchiefs and make you a kettleholder  ermine had never esteemed him more highly than when he refrained from all but a droll look and uttered not one word of the sportive courtship that is so peculiarly unwholesome and undesirable with children perhaps she thought her colonel more a gentleman than she had done before if that were possible and she took an odd quaint pleasure in the idea of this match often when talking to alison of her views of life and education putting them in the form of what would become of rose as lady keith and colin kept his promise of making no more references to the future on moving into his lodgings the hour for his visits was changed and unless he went out to dinner he usually came in the evening thus attracting less notice and moreover rendering it less easy to lapse into the tender subject as alison was then at home and the conversation was necessarily more general  the afternoons were spent in lady temples service instead of the orthodox dowager britchska and pair ruled over by a tyrannical coachman he had provided her with a herd of little animals for harness or saddle and a young groom for whom coombe was answerable mrs curtis groaned and feared the establishment would look flighty but for the first time rachel became the colonels ally the worst despotism practised in england she said is that of coachmen and it is well that fanny should be spared the coachman who lived here when mamma was married answered her request to go a little faster i shall drive my horses as i plazes and i really think the present one is rather worse in deed though not in word  moreover rachel smoothed down a little of mrs curtiss uneasiness at fannys change of costume at the end of her first year of widowhood on the ground that colonel keith advised her to ride with her sons and that this was incompatible with weeds and dear sir stephen did so dislike the sight of them she added in her simple innocent way as if she were still dressing to please him  on the whole mother said rachel unless there is more heartbreak than fanny professes theres more coquetry in a pretty young thing wearing a cap that says come pity me than in going about like other people  i only wish she could help looking like a girl of seventeen sighed mrs curtis if that colonel were but married or the other young man im sure she will fall into some scrape she does not know how out of sheer innocence  well mother you know i always mean to ride with her and that will be a protection  but my dear i am not sure about your riding with these gay officers you never used to do such things  at my age mother and to take care of fanny  and mrs curtis in her uncertainty whether to sanction the proceedings and qualify them or to make a protestdreadful to herself and more dreadful to fannyyielded the point when she found herself not backed up by her energetic daughter and the cavalcade almost daily set forth from myrtlewood and was watched with eyes of the greatest vexation if not by kind mrs curtis by poor mr touchett to whom lady temples change of dress had been a grievous shock he thought her so lovely so interesting at first and now though it was sacrilege to believe it of so gentle and pensive a face was not this a return to the world what had she to do with these officers how could her aunt permit it no doubt it was all the work of his great foe miss rachel  it was true that rachel heartily enjoyed these rides hitherto she had been only allowed to go out under the escort of her tyrant the coachman who kept her in very strict discipline she had not anticipated anything much more lively with fanny her boys and ponies but colonel keith had impressed on conrade and francis that they were their mothers prime protectors and they regarded her bridlerein as their post keeping watch over her as if her safety depended on them and ready to quarrel with each other if the roads were too narrow for all three to go abreast and as soon as the colonel had ascertained that she and they were quite sufficient to themselves and well guarded by coombe in the rear he ceased to regard himself as bound to their company but he and rachel extended their rides in search of objects of interest she liked doing the honours of the county and achieved expeditions which her coachman had hitherto never permitted to her in search of ruins camps churches and towers the colonel had a turn for geology though a wandering life even with an indian baggagetrain had saved him from incurring her contempt for collectors but he knew by sight the character of the conformations of rocks and when they had mounted one of the hills that surrounded avonmouth discerned by the outline whether granite gneiss limestone or slate formed the grander height beyond thus leading to schemes of more distant rides to verify the conjectures which rachel accepted with the less argument because sententious dogmatism was not always possible on the back of a skittish black mare  there was no concealing from herself that she was more interested by this frivolous military society than by any she had ever previously met the want of comprehension of her pursuits in her mothers limited range of acquaintance had greatly conduced both to her overweening manner and to her general dissatisfaction with the world and for the first time she was neither succumbed to giggled at avoided nor put down with a grave prosy reproof certainly alick keith as every one called him nettled her extremely by his murmured irony but the acuteness of it was diverting in such a mere lad and showed that if he could only once be roused he might be capable of better things there was an excitement in his unexpected manner of seeing things that was engaging as well as provoking and rachel never felt content if he were at myrtlewood without her seeing him if only because she began to consider him as more dangerous than his elder namesake and so assured of his position that he did not take any pains to assert it or to cultivate lady temples good graces he was simply at home and perfectly at ease with her  colonel keiths tone was different he was argumentative where his young cousin was sarcastic he was reading some of the books over which rachel had strained her capacities without finding any one with whom to discuss them since all her friends regarded them as poisonous and even ermine williams without being shaken in her steadfast trust was so haunted and distressed in her lonely and unvaried life by the echo of these shocks to the faith of others that absolutely as a medical precaution she abstained from dwelling on them on the other hand colin keith liked to talk and argue out his impressions and found in rachel the only person with whom the subject could be safely broached and thus she for the first time heard the subjects fairly handled hitherto she had never thought that justice was done to the argument except by a portion of the press that drew conclusions which terrified while they allured her whereas she appreciated the candour that weighed each argument distinguishing principle from prejudice and religious faith from conventional construction and in this measurement of minds she felt the strength and acuteness of powers superior to her own he was not one of the men who prefer unintellectual women perhaps clever men of a profession not necessarily requiring constant brain work are not so much inclined to rest the mind with feminine empty chatter as are those whose intellect is more on the strain at any rate though colonel keith was attentive and courteous to every one and always treated lady temple as a prime minister might treat a queen his tendency to conversation with rachel was becoming marked and she grew increasingly prone to consult him the interest of this new intercourse quite took out the sting of disappointment when again curatocult came back declined with thanks nay before making a third attempt she hazarded a question on his opinion of female authorship and much to her gratification and somewhat to her surprise heard that he thought it often highly useful and valuable  that is great candour men generally grudge whatever they think their own privilege  many things can often be felt and expressed by an able woman better than by a man and there is no reason that the utterance of anything worthy to be said should be denied provided it is worthy to be said  ah there comes the hit i wondered if you would get through without it  it was not meant as a hit men are as apt to publish what is not worth saying as women can be and some women are so conscientious as only to put forth what is of weight and value  and you are above wanting to silence them by palaver about unfeminine publicity  there is no need of publicity much of the best and most widespread writing emanates from the most quiet unsuspected quarters  that is the benefit of an anonymous press  yes the withholding of the name prevents wellmannered people from treating a woman as an authoress if she does not proclaim herself one and the difference is great between being known to write and setting up for an authoress  between fact and pretension but write or not write there is an instinctive avoidance of an intellectual woman  not always for the simple manner that goes with real superiority is generally very attractive the larger and deeper the mind the more there would be of the genuine humbleness and gentleness that a shallow nature is incapable of the very word humility presupposes depth  i see what you mean said rachel gentleness is not feebleness nor lowness lowliness there must be something held back  i see it daily said colonel keith and for a moment he seemed about to add something but checked himself and took advantage of an interruption to change the conversation  superior natures lowly and gentle said rachel to herself am i so to him then or is he deceiving himself what is to be done at my age such a contravention of my principles a soldier an honourable a title in prospect fannys major intolerable no no my property absorbed by a scotch peerage when i want it for so many things never i am sorry for him though it is hard that a man who can forgive a woman for intellect should be thrown back on poor little fanny and it is gratifying but i am untouched yet and i will take care of myself at my age a woman who loves at all loves with all the gathered force of her nature and i certainly feel no such passion no certainly not and i am resolved not to be swept along till i have made up my mind to yield to the force of the torrent let us see  grace my dear said mrs curtis in one of her most confidential moments is not dear rachel looking very well i never saw her dress so well put on  yes she is looking very handsome said grace i am glad she has consented to have her hair in that now way it is very becoming to her  ii dont know that it is all the hair said the mother faltering as if half ashamed of herself but it seemed to me that we need not have been so uneasy about dear fanny i think dont you that there may be another attraction to be sure it would be at a terrible distance from us but so good and kind as he is it would be such a thing for you and fanny as well grace gave a great start  yes my dear mrs curtis gently prosed on with her speculation she would be a dreadful loss to us but you see so clever and odd as she is and with such peculiar ideas i should be so thankful to see her in the hands of some good sensible man that would guide her  but do you really think it is so mother  mind my dear it is nothing to build on but i cannot help being struck and just thinking to myself i know youll not say anything  grace felt much distressed after this communication had opened her eyes to certain little touches of softening and consciousness that sat oddly enough on her sister from the first avowal of colonel keiths acquaintance with the williamses she had concluded him to be the nameless lover and had been disappointed that alison so far from completing the confidence had become more reserved than ever leaving her to wonder whether he were indeed the same or whether his constancy had survived the change of circumstances there were no grounds on which to found a caution yet grace felt full of discomfort and distrust a feeling shared by alison who had never forgiven herself for her half confidence and felt that it would be wiser to tell the rest but was withheld by knowing that her motive would actuate her sister to a contrary course that colin should detach himself from her love again and marry was what ermine schooled herself to think fitting but alison alternated between indignant jealousy for her sister and the desire to warn rachel that she might at best win only the reversion of his heart ermine was happy and content with his evening visits and would not take umbrage at the daily rides nor the reports of drawingroom warfare and alison often wavered between the desire of preparing her and the doubt whether it were not cruel to inflict the present pain of want of confidence if that were a happy summer to some at avonmouth it was a very trying one to those two anxious yet apparently uninterested sisters who were but lookerson at the game that affected their other selves  at length however came a new feature into the quiet summer life at avonmouth colin looked in on ermine one morning to announce with shrugged shoulders and a face almost making game of himself that his brother was coming lord keith had been called to london on business and would extend his journey to come and see what his brother was doing  this comes of being the youngest of the family observed colin meditatively one is never supposed capable of taking care of ones self with keith i shall be the gay extravagant young officer to the end of my days  you are not forgiving to your brother said ermine  you have it in your power to make me so he said eagerly  then you would have nothing to forgive she replied smiling  lady temples first thought was a renewal of her ardent wish that ermine should be at myrtlewood and that mackarel lane and the governesship should be as much as possible kept out of sight even alison was on her side not that she was ashamed of either but she wished that ermine should see and judge with her own eyes of colins conduct and also eagerly hailed all that showed him still committed to her sister she was proportionably vexed that he did not think it expedient to harass ermine with further invitations  my brother knows the whole he said and i do not wish to attempt to conceal anything  i do not mean to conceal faltered fanny only i thought it might save a shockappearanceshe might think better of it if  you thought only what was kind answered the colonel and i thank you for it most warmly but this matter does not depend on my brothers consent and even if it did ermines own true position is that which is most honourable to her  having said this he was forced to console fanny in her shame at her own kind attempt at this gentle little feminine subterfuge he gratified her however by not interfering with her hospitable instincts of doing honour to and entertaining his brother for whose sake her first approach to a dinner party was given a very small one but treated by her and her household as a far more natural occurrence than was any sort of entertainment at the homestead she even looked surprised in her quiet way at mrs curtiss proffers of assistance in the et ceteras and gratefully answered for coombes doing the right thing without troubling herself further mrs curtis was less easy in her mind her housewifely soul questioned the efficiency of her nieces establishment and she was moreover persuaded that lord keith must be bent on inspecting his brothers choice while even rachel felt as if the toils of fate were being drawn round her and let grace embellish her for the dinner party in an odd sort of mood sometimes rejecting her attempts at decoration sometimes vouchsafing a glance at the glass chiefly to judge whether her looks were really as repellently practical and intellectual as she had been in the habit of supposing the wreath of white roses which she wore for the first time certainly had a pleasing and softening effect and she was conscious that she had never looked so well then was vexed at the solicitude with which her mother looked her over and fairly blushed with annoyance at the good ladys evident satisfaction  but after all rachel at her best could not have competed with the grace of the quiet little figure that received them the rich black silk giving dignity to the slender form and a sort of compromise between veil and cap sheltering the delicate fair face and with a son on each side fanny looked so touchingly proud and well supported and the boys were so exultant and admiring at seeing her thus dressed that it was a very pretty sight and struck the first arrived of her guests mr touchett quite dumb with admiration colonel hammond the two keiths and their young kinsman completed the party lord keith of gowanbrae was best described by the said young kinsmans words a longbacked scotchman he was so intensely scottish that he made his brother look and sound the same whereas ordinarily neither air nor accent would have shown the colonels nation and there was no definable likeness between them except perhaps the baldness of the forehead but the remains of lord keiths hair were silvered red whereas colins thick beard and scanty locks were dark brown and with a far larger admixture of hoarfrost though he was the younger by twenty years and his brothers appearance gave the impression of a far greater age than fiftyeight there was the stoop of rheumatism and a worn thin look on the face with its high cheek bones narrow lips and cold eyes by no means winning on the other hand he was the most finished gentleman that grace and rachel had ever encountered he had all the gallant polish of manner that the old scottish nobility have inherited from the french of the old regimea manner that though colin possessed all its essentials had been in some degree rubbed off in the frankness of his military life but which the old nobleman retained in its full perfection mrs curtis admired it extremely as a specimen of the old school for which she had never ceased to mourn and rachel felt as if it took her breath away by the likeness to louis xiv but strange to say lady temple acted as if she were quite in her element it might be that the old mans courtesy brought back to her something of the tender chivalry of her soldier husband and that a sort of filial friendliness had become natural to her towards an elderly man for she responded at once and devoted herself to pleasing and entertaining him their civilities were something quite amusing to watch and in the evening with a complete perception of his tastes she got up a rubber for him  can you bear it you will not like to play murmured the colonel to her as he rung for the cards recollecting the many evenings of whist with her mother and sir stephen  oh i dont mind i like anything like old times and my aunt does not like playing  no for mrs curtis had grown up in a family where cards were disapproved and she felt it a sad fall in fanny to be playing with all the skill of her long training and receiving grand compliments from lord keith on joint victories over the two colonels it was a distasteful game to all but the players for rachel felt slightly hurt at the colonels defection and mr touchett with somewhat of mrs curtiss feeling that it was a backsliding in lady temple suddenly grew absent in a conversation that he was holding with young mr keith uponof all subjects in the worldlending library books and finally repaired to the piano where grace was playing her mothers favourite music in hopes of distracting her mind from fannys enormity and there he stood mechanically thanking miss curtis but all the time turning a melancholy eye upon the game alick keith meanwhile sat himself down near rachel and her mother close to an open window for it was so warm that even mrs curtis enjoyed the air and perhaps because that watching the colonel had made rachels discourses somewhat less ready than usual he actually obtained an interval in which to speak he was going the next day to bishops worthy there to attend his cousins wedding and at the end of a fortnight to bring his sister for her visit to lady temple this sister was evidently his great care and it needed but little leading to make him tell a good deal about her she had it seemed been sent home from the cape at about ten years old when the regiment went to india and her brother who had been at school then was with her for a short time before going out to join the regiment  why said rachel recovering her usual manner you have not been ten years in the army  i had my commission at sixteen he answered  you are not sixandtwenty she exclaimed  you are as right as usual was the reply with his odd little smile at least till the 1st of august  my dear said her mother more alive than rachel to his amusement at her daughters knowing his age better than he did himself but adding politely you are hardly come to the time of life for liking to hear that your looks deceived us  boys are tolerated he said with a quick glance at rachel but at that moment something manylegged and tickling flitted into the light and dashed over her face mrs curtis was by no means a strongminded woman in the matter of moths and craneflies disliking almost equally their sudden personal attentions and their suicidal propensities and rachel dutifully started up at once to give chase to the fatherlonglegs and put it out of window before it had succeeded in deranging her mothers equanimity either by bouncing into her face or suspending itself by two or three legs in the wax of the candle mr keith seconded her efforts but the insect was both lively and cunning eluding them with a dexterity wonderful in such an apparently overlimbed creature until at last it kindly rested for a moment with its wooden peg of a body sloping and most of its threadlike members prone upon a newspaper where rachel descended on it with her pockethandkerchief and mr keith tried to inclose it with his hands at the same moment to have crushed the fly would have been melancholy to have come down on the young soldiers fingers awkward but rachel did what was even more shockingher hands did descend on what should have been fingers but they gave way under hershe felt only the leather of the glove between her and the newspaper she jumped and very nearly cried out looking up with an astonishment and horror only half reassured by his extremely amused smile i beg your pardon im so sorry she gasped confused  inferior animals can dispense with a member more or less he replied giving her the other corner of the paper on which they bore their capture to the window and shook it till it took wing with various legs streaming behind it that venerable animal is apparently indifferent to having left a third of two legs behind him and as he spoke he removed the already half drawnoff lefthand glove and let rachel see for a moment that it had only covered the thumb forefinger two joints of the middle and one of the third the little finger was gone and the whole hand much scarred she was still so much dismayed that she gasped out the first question she had ever asked him  where  not under the handkerchief he answered picking it up as if he thought she wanted convincing at delhi i imagine  at that moment grace as an act of general beneficence certainly pleasing to her mother began to sing it was a stop to all conversation for mrs curtis particularly disliked talking during singing and rachel had to digest her discoveries at her leisure as soon as she could collect herself after the unnatural and strangely lasting sensation of the solid giving way so grace was right he was no boy but really older than fanny the companion of her childhood and who probably would have married her had not the general come in the way here was no doubt the real enemy while they had all been thinking of colonel keith a man only now expecting his company it would sound more absurd yet rachel was not wont to think how things would sound and this fresh intense dislike provoked her was it the unsuitability of the young widow remarrying surely surely it must not be that womanhood in its contemptible side is still so strong that i want to keep all for myself shame and this may be the true life love suppressed now able to revive i have no right to be disgusted i will watch minutely and judge if he will be a good guide and father to the boys though it may save the colonel trouble pish what have i to do with either why should i think about them yet i must care for fanny i must dislike to see her lower herself even in the eyes of the world would it really be lowering herself i cannot tell i must think it out i wish that game was over or that grace would let one speak  but songs and whist both lasted till the evening was ended by lady temple coming up to the curate with her winnings and her pretty smile please mr touchett let this go towards some treat for the school children i should not like to give it in any serious way you know but just for some little pleasure for them  if she had done it on purpose she could not have better freshly riveted his chains that pensive simplicity with the smile of heartfelt satisfaction at giving pleasure to anybody were more and more engaging as her spirits recovered their tone and the most unsatisfactory consideration which rachel carried away that evening was that alexander keith being really somewhat the senior if the improvement in fannys spirits were really owing to his presence the objection on the score of age would not hold but thought rachel colonel keith being her own what united power they should have over fanny pooh she had by no means resigned herself to have him though for fannys sake it might be well and was there not a foolish prejudice in favour of married women that impeded the usefulness of single ones however if the stiff dry old man approved of her for her fortunes sake that would be quite reason enough for repugnance  the stiff old man was the pink of courtesy and paid his respects in due order to his brothers friends the next day colin attending in his old aidedecamp fashion it was curious to see them together the old peer was not at all ungracious to his brother indeed colin had been agreeably surprised by an amount of warmth and brotherliness that he had never experienced from him before as if old age had brought a disposition to cling to the remnant of the once inconveniently large family and make much of the last survivor formerly an undesirable youngest favourite looked on with jealous eyes and thwarted and retaliated on for former petting as soon as the reins of government fell from the hands of the aged father now the elder brother was kind almost to patronizing though evidently persuaded that colin was a gay careless youth with no harm in him but needing to be looked after and as to the cape india and australia being a larger portion of the world than gowanbrae edinburgh and london his lordship would be incredulous to the day of his death  he paid his formal and gracious visits at myrtlewood and the homestead and then supposed that his brother would wish him to call upon these unfortunate ladies colin certainly would have been vexed if he had openly slighted them but alison whom the brothers overtook on their way into mackarel lane did not think the colonel looked in the most felicitous frame of mind and thought the most charitable construction might be that he shared her wishes that she could be a few minutes in advance to secure that neither roses sports nor colinettes toilette were very prominent  all was right however ermines taste for the fitness of things had trained rose into keeping the little parlour never in stiff array but also never in a state to be ashamed of and she herself was sitting in the shade in the garden whither after the first introduction colin and rose brought seats and the call on the whole went off extremely well ermine naver let any one be condescending to her and conducted the conversation with her usual graceful good breeding while the colonel with rose on his knee half talked to the child half listened and watched  as soon as he had deposited his brother at the hotel he came back again and in answer to ermines well he demanded what she thought of his brother and if he were what she expected  very much only older and feebler and did he communicate his views of mackarel lane i saw him regarding me as a species of mermaid or syren evidently thinking it a great shame that i have not a burnt face if he had only known about rose  the worst of it is that he wants me to go home with him and i am afraid i must do so for now that he and i are the last in the entail there is an opportunity of making an arrangement about the property for which he is very anxious  well you know i have long thought it would be very good for you  and when i am there i shall have to visit every one in the family and he looked into her eyes to see if she would let them show concern but she kept up their brave sparkle as she still said you know you ought  then you deliver me up to keiths tender mercies till  till you have done your dutyand forgiven him  remember ermine i cant spend a winter in scotland a cold always makes the ball remind me of its presence in my chest and i was told that if i spent a winter at home it must be on the devonshire coast  that ball is sufficient justification for ourselves i allow she said that one little word our making up for all that had gone before  and meantime you will write to meabout roses education  to be sure or what would be the use of growing old  alison felt savage all through this interview that perfect understanding and the playful fiction about waiting for rose left him a great deal too free ermine might almost be supposed to want to get rid of him and even when he took leave she only remained for a few minutes leaning her cheek on her hand and scarcely indulged in a sigh before asking to be wheeled into the house again nor would she make any remark save it has been too bright a summer to last for ever it would be very wrong to wish him to stay dangling here let what will happen he is himself  it sounded far too like a deliberate resignation of him and persuasion that if he went he would not return to be all he had been however the departure was not immediate lord keith had taken a fancy to the place and scenery and wished to see all the lions of the neighbourhood so that there were various expeditions in the carriages or on horseback in which he displayed his grand courtesy to lady temple and rachel enjoyed the colonels conversation and would have enjoyed it still more if she had not been tracing a meaning in every attention that he paid her and considering whether she was committing herself by receiving it she was glad he was going away that she might have time to face the subject and make up her mind for she was convinced that the object of his journey was to make himself certain of his prospects when he said that he should return for the winter and that he had too much to leave at avonmouth to stay long away from it there must be a meaning in his words  ermine had one more visit from lord keith and this time he came alone he was in his most gracious and courteous mood and sat talking of indifferent things for some time of his aunt lady alison and of beauchamp in the old time so that ermine enjoyed the renewal of old associations and names belonging to a world unlike her present one then he came to colin his looks and his health and his own desire to see him quit the army  ermine assented to his health being hardly fit for the army and restrained the rising indignation as she recollected what a difference the best surgical advice might have made ten years ago  and then lord keith said a man could hardly be expected to settle down without marrying he wished earnestly to see his brother married but unfortunately charges on his estate would prevent him from doing anything for him and in fact he did not see any possibility of hisof his marrying except a person with some means  i understand said ermine looking straight before her and her colour mounting  i was sure that a person of your great good sense would do so said lord keith i assure you no one can be more sensible than myself of the extreme forbearance discretion and regard for my brothers true welfare that has been shown here  ermine bowed he did not know that the vivid carmine that made her look so handsome was not caused by gratification at his praise but by the struggle to brook it patiently  and now knowing the influence over him that most deservedly you must always possess i am induced to hope that as his sincere friend you will exert it in favour of the more prudent counsels  i have no influence over his judgment said ermine a little proudly  i mean said lord keith forced to much closer quarters you will excuse me for speaking thus openlythat in the state of the case with so much depending on his making a satisfactory choice i feel convinced with every regret that you will feel it to be for his true welfareas indeed i infer that you have already endeavoured to show himto make a new beginning and to look on the past as past  there was something in the insinuating tone of this speech increased as it was by the modulation of his scottish voice that irritated his hearer unspeakably all the more because it was the very thing she had been doing  colonel keith must judge for himself she said with a cold manner but a burning heart  ii understand said lord keith that you had most honourably most consistently made him aware thatthat what once might have been desirable has unhappily become impossible  well said ermine  and thus he proceeded that the sincere friendship with which you still regard him would prevent any encouragement to continue an attachment unhappily now hopeless and obstructive to his prospects  ermines eyes flashed at the dictation lord keith she said i have never sought your brothers visits nor striven to prolong them but if he finds pleasure in them after a life of disappointment and trouble i cannot refuse nor discourage them  i am aware said lord keith rising as if to go that i have trespassed long on your time and made a suggestion only warranted by the generosity with which you have hitherto acted  one may be generous of ones own not of other peoples said ermine  he looked at her puzzled then said perhaps it will be best to speak categorically miss williams let it be distinctly understood that my brother colin in paying his addresses to you is necessarily without my sanction or future assistance  it might not be necessary my lord good morning and her courteous bow was an absolute dismissal  but when alison came home she found her more depressed than she had allowed herself to be for years and on asking what was the matter was answered  pride and perverseness ailie then in reply to the eager exclamation i believe he was justified in all he said but ailie i have preached to colin more than i had a right to do about forgiving his brother i did not know how provoking he can be i did not think it was still in me to fly out as i did  he had no business to come here interfering and tormenting you said alison hotly  i dare say he thought he had but one could not think of that when it came to threatening me with his giving no help to colin ifthere was no resisting telling him how little we cared  you have not offended him so that he will keep colin away  the more he tried the more colin would come no i am not sorry for having offended him i dont mind him but ailie how little one knows all the angry and bitter feelings that i thought burnt out for ever when i lay waiting for death are stirred up as hotly as they were long ago the old self is here as strong as ever ailie dont tell colin about this but tomorrow is a saints day and would you see mr touchett and try to arrange for me to go to the early service i think then i might better be helped to conquer this  but ermine how can you eight oclock you know  yes dearest it will give you a great deal of trouble but you never mind that you know and i am so much stronger than i used to be that you need not fear besides i want help so much and it is the day colin goes away  alison obeyed as she always obeyed her sister and lord keith taking his constitutional turn before breakfast on the esplanade was met by what he so little expected to encounter that he had not time to get out of the waya bath chair with alison walking on one side his brother on the other he bowed coldly but ermine held out her hand and he was obliged to come near  i am glad to have met you she said  i am glad to see you out so early he answered confused  this is an exception she said smiling and really looking beautiful goodbye i have thought over what passed yesterday and i believe we are more agreed than perhaps i gave you reason to think  there was a queenly air of dignified exchange of pardon in her manner of giving her hand and bending her head as she again said goodbye and signed to her driver to move on  lord keith could only say goodbye then looking after her muttered after all that is a remarkable woman     chapter viii womans mission discovered     but o unseen for three long years   dear was the garb of mountaineers   to the fair maid of lornlord of the isles   only nerves said alison williams whenever she was pushed hard as to why her sister continued unwell and her own looks betrayed an anxiety that her words would not confess rachel after a visit on the first day was of the same opinion and prescribed globules and enlivenment but after a personal administration of the latter in the shape of a discussion of lord keith she never called in the morning without hearing that miss williams was not up nor in the afternoon without alisons meeting her and being very sorry but really she thought it better for her sister to be quite quiet  in fact alison was not seriously uneasy about ermines health for these nervous attacks were not without precedent as the revenge for all excitement of the sensitive mind upon the muchtried constitution the reaction must pass off in time and calm and patience would assist in restoring her but the interview with lord keith had been a revelation to her that her affection was not the calm chastened mortified almost dead thing of the past that she had tried to believe it but a young living active feeling as vivid and as little able to brook interference as when the first harsh letter from gowanbrae had fallen like a thunderbolt on the bright hopes of youth she looked back at some verses that she had written when first perceiving that life was to be her portion where her own intended feelings were ascribed to a maiden who had taken the veil believing her crusader slain but who saw him return and lead a recluse life with the light in her cell for his guiding star she smiled sadly to find how far the imaginings of four and twenty transcended the powers of four and thirty and how the heart that had deemed itself able to resign was chafed at the appearance of compulsion she felt that the right was the same as ever but it was an increased struggle to maintain the resolute abstinence from all that could bind colin to her at the moment when he was most likely to be detached and it was a struggle rendered the more trying by the monotony of a life scarcely varied except by the brainwork which she was often obliged to relinquish  nothing however here assisted her so much as lady temples new pony carriage which by fannys desire had been built low enough to permit of her being easily lifted into it inert and almost afraid of change ermine was hard to persuade but alison guessing at the benefit was against her and fannys wistful eyes and caressing voice were not to be gainsaid so she suffered herself to be placed on the broad easy seat and driven about the lanes enjoying most intensely the new scenes the peeps of sea the distant moors the cottages with their glowing orchards the sloping harvest fields the variety that was an absolute healing to the worn spirits and moreover that quiet conversation with lady temple often about the boys but more often about colonel keith  not only ermine but other inhabitants of avonmouth found the world more flat in his absence rachels interest was lessened in her readings after she had lost the pleasure of discussion and she asked herself many times whether the tedium were indeed from love or if it were simply from the absence of an agreeable companion i will try myself she said to herself if i am heartily interested in my occupations by the end of the next week then i shall believe myself my own woman  but in going back to her occupations she was more than ordinarily sensible of their unsatisfactoriness one change had come over her in the last few months she did not so much long for a wider field as for power to do the few things within her reach more thoroughly her late discussions had as it were opened a second eye that saw two sides of questions that she had hitherto thought had only one and she was restless and undecided between them longing for some impulse from within or without and hoping for her own dignity and consistencys sake that it was not only colonel keiths presence which had rendered this summer the richest in her life  a test was coming for her she thought in the person of miss keith judging by the brother rachel expected a tall fair dreamy blonde requiring to be taught a true appreciation of life and its duties and whether the training of this young girl would again afford her food for eagerness and energy would as she said to herself show whether her affections were still her own moreover there was the great duty of deciding whether the brother were worthy of fanny  it chanced to be convenient that rachel should go to avoncester on the day of the arrival and call at the station for the traveller she recollected how five months previously she had there greeted fanny and had seen the bearded apparition since regarded with so much jealousy and now with such a strangely mixed feeling this being a far more indifferent errand she did not go on the platform but sat in the carriage reading the report of the social science congress until the travellers began to emerge and captain keith for he had had his promotion came up to her with a young lady who looked by no means like his sister she was somewhat tall and in that matter alone realized rachels anticipations for she was blackeyed and her dark hair was crepe and turned back from a face of the plump contour and slightly rosy complexion that suggested the patches of the last century as indeed nature herself seemed to have thought when planting near the corner of the mouth a little brown mole that added somehow to the piquancy of the face not exactly pretty but decidedly attractive under the little round hat and in the point device though simple and plainly coloured travelling dress  will you allow me a seat asked captain keith when he had disposed of his sisters goods and on rachels assent he placed himself on the back seat in his lazy manner  if you were good for anything you would sit outside and smoke said his sister  if privacy is required for swearing an eternal friendship i can go to sleep instead he returned closing his eyes  quite the reverse quoth bessie keith he has prepared me to hate you all miss curtis  on the mutual aversion principle murmured the brother  dont you flatter yourself have you found out miss curtis that it is the property of this species always to go by contraries  to miss curtis i always appear in the meekest state of assent said alick  then i would not be miss curtis how horribly you must differ  rachel was absolutely silenced by this cross fire something so unlike the small talk of her experience that her mind could hardly propel itself into velocity enough to follow the rapid encounter of wits however having stirred up her lightest troops into marching order she said in a puzzled doubtful way how has he prepared you to hate usby praising us  oh no that would have been too much on the surface he knew the effect of that looking in his sleepy eyes for a twinkle of response no his very reserve said i am going to take her to ground too transcendent for her to walk on but if i say one word i shall never get her there at all it was a deep refinement you see and he really meant it but i was deeper and she shook her head at him  you are always trying which can go deepest said rachel  it is a sweet fraternal sport returned alick  have you no brother asked bessie  no  then you dont know what detestable creatures they are but she looked so lovingly and saucily at her big brother that rachel spite of herself was absolutely fascinated by this novel form of endearment an answer was spared her by miss keiths rapture at the sight of some soldiers in the uniform of her fathers old regiment  have a care bessie miss curtis will despise you said her brother  why should you think so exclaimed rachel not desirous of putting on a forbidding aspect to this bright creature  have i not been withered by your scorn  ii rachel was going to say something of her change of opinion with regard to military society but a sudden consciousness set her cheeks in a flame and checked her tongue while bessie keith with ease and readiness filled up the blank  what alick you have brought the service into disrepute i am ashamed of you  oh no said rachel in spite of her intolerable blushes feeling the necessity of delivering her confession like a cannonball among skirmishers only we had been used to regard officers as necessarily empty and frivolous and our recent experience hashas been otherwise her period altogether failed her  there alick is that the effect of your weight of wisdom i shall be more impressed with it than ever it has redeemed the character of your profession captain keith and the army  i am afraid i cannot flatter myself said alick and a sort of reflection of rachels burning colour seemed to have lighted on his cheek its reputation has been in better hands  o colonel colin depend upon it he is not half as sage as you alick why he is a dozen years olderwhat dont you know miss curtis that the older people grow the less sage they get  i hope not said rachel  do you a contrary persuasion sustains me when i see people obnoxiously sage to their fellowcreatures  obnoxious sageness in youth is the token that there is stuff behind said alick with eagerness that set his sister laughing at him for fitting on the cap but rachel had a sort of odd dreamy perception that bessie keith had unconsciously described her rachels own aspect and that alick was defending her and she was silent and confused and rather surprised at the assumption of the character by one who she thought could never even exert himself to be obnoxious he evidently did not wish to dwell on the subject but began to inquire after avonmouth matters and rachel in return asked for mr clare  very well was the answer unfailing in spirits every one agreed that he was the youngest man at the wedding  having outgrown his obnoxious sageness said bessie  there is nothing he is so adroit at as guessing the fate of a croquetball by its sound  now bessie exclaimed alick  i have not transgressed have i asked bessie and in the exclamations that followed she said you see what want of confidence is this brother of mine no sooner saw you in the carriage than he laid his commands on me not to ask after your croquetground all the way home and the poor word cannot come out of my mouth without  i only told you not to bore miss curtis with the eternal subject as she would think you had no more brains than one of your mallets he said somewhat energetically  and if we had begun to talk croquet we should soon have driven him outside  but suppose i could not talk it said rachel and that we have no ground for it  why thenand she affected to turn up her eyesi can only aver that the coincidence of sentiments is no doubt the work of destiny  bessie exclaimed her brother  poor old fellow you had excuse enough lying on the sofa to the tune of tap and click but for a young lady in the advanced ranks of civilization to abstain is a mere marvel  surely it is a great waste of time said rachel  ah when i have converted you you will wonder what people did with themselves before the invention  womans mission discovered quoth her brother  also mans unless he neglects it returned miss elizabeth i wonder now if you would play if miss curtis did  wisdom never pledges itself how it will act in hypothetical circumstances was the reply  hypothetical syllabically repeated bessie keith did you teach him that word miss curtis well if i dont bring about the hypothetical circumstances you may call me hyperbolical  so they talked rachel in a state of bewilderment whether she were teased or enchanted and alexander keiths quiet nonchalance not concealing that he was in some anxiety at his sisters reckless talk but perhaps he hardly estimated the effect of the gay quaint manner that took all hearts by storm and gave a frank careless grace to her nonsense she grew graver and softer as she came nearer avonmouth and spoke tenderly of the kindness she had received at the time of her mothers death at the cape when she had been brought to the generals and had there remained like a child of the house till she had been sent home on the removal of the regiment to india  i remember she said mrs curtis kept great order in fact between ourselves she was rather a dragon and lady temple though she had one child then seemed like my companion and playfellow dear little lady temple i wonder if she is altered  not in the least returned both her companions at once and she was quite ready to agree with them when the slender form and fair young face met her in the hall amid a cloud of eager boys the meeting was a full renewal of the parting warm and fond and bessie so comported herself on her introduction to the children that they all became enamoured of her on the spot and even stephana relaxed her shyness on her behalf that sunny gay goodnature could not be withstood and rachel again sharing fannys first dinner after an arrival no longer sat apart despising the military atmosphere but listening not without amusement to the account of the humours of the wedding mingled with alick keiths touches of satire  it was very stupid said bessie of none of those girls to have uncle george to marry them my aunt fancied he would be nervous but i know he did marry a couple when mr lifford was away i mean him to marry me as i told them all  you had better wait till you know whether he will observed alick  will oh he is always pleased to feel he can do like other people returned bessie and ill undertake to see that he puts the ring on the righti mean the left finger because youll have to give me away you know alick so you can look after him  you seem to have arranged the programme pretty thoroughly said rachel  after four weddings at home one cant but lay by a little experience for the future returned bessie and after all alick need not look as if it must be for oneself he is quite welcome to profit by it if he has the good taste to want my uncle to marry him  not unless i were very clear that he liked my choice said alick gravely  oh dear have you any doubts or is that meant for a cut at poor innocent me as if i could help peoples folly or as if he was not gone to rio janeiro exclaimed bessie with a sort of meek simplicity and unconsciousness that totally removed all the unsatisfactoriness of the speech and made even her brother smile while he looked annoyed and lady temple quietly changed the conversation alick keith was obliged to go away early and the three ladies sat long in the garden outside the window in the summer twilight much relishing the frankhearted way in which this engaging girl talked of herself and her difficulties to fanny as to an old friend and to rachel as belonging to fanny  i am afraid that i was very naughty she said with a hand laid on lady temples as if to win pardon but i never can resist plaguing that dear anxious brother of mine and he did so dreadfully take to heart the absurdities of that little charlie carleton as if any one with brains could think him good for anything but a croquet partner that i could not help giving a little gentle titillation i saw you did not like it dear lady temple and i am sorry for it  i hope i did not vex you said fanny afraid of having been severe  oh no indeed a little check just makes one feel one is cared for and they kissed affectionately you see when one has a very wise brother plaguing him is irresistible how little stephana will plague hers in selfdefence with so many to keep her in order  they all spoil her  ah this is the golden age see what it will be when they think themselves responsible for her dear lady temple how could you send him home so old and so grave  i am afraid we sent him home very ill i never expected to see him so perfectly recovered i could hardly believe my eyes when colonel keith brought him to the carriage not in the least lame  yes and it was half against his will he would have been almost glad to be a lay curate to uncle george only he knew if he was fit for service my father would have been vexed at his giving up his profession  then it was not his choice said rachel  oh he was born a soldier like all the rest of us couldnt help it the th is our home and if he would only take my hint and marry i could be with him there now lady temple do pray send for all the eligible officersi dont know any of them now except the two majors and alick suspects my designs i believe for he wont tell me anything about them  my dear said fanny bewildered how you talk you know we are living a very quiet life here  oh yes so alick has told me she said with a pretty compunction in her tone you must be patient with me and she kissed fannys fingers again and spoke in a gentler way i am used to be a great chatterbox and nobody protested but alick  i wish you would tell me about his return my dear he seemed so unfit to travel when your poor father came to the hills and took him away by dak it seemed so impossible he could bear the journey he could not stand or help himself at all and had constant returns of fever but they said the long sea voyage was the only chance and that in india he could not get vigour enough to begin to recover i was very unhappy about him said fanny innocently whilst rachel felt very vigilant wondering if fanny were the cause of the change his sister spoke of  yes the voyage did him good but the tidings of papas death came two months before him and uncle georges eyes were in such a state that he had to be kept in the dark so that no one could go and meet the poor dear boy at southampton but mr lifford and the shock of the news he heard brought the fever back and it went on intermitting for weeks and weeks we had him at littleworthy at first thinking he could be better nursed and more cheerful there but there was no keeping the house quiet enough  croquet said rachel  everything returned bessie four courtships in more or less progress besides a few flirtations and a house where all the neighbours were running in and out in a sociable way our loss was not as recent there as it was to him and they were only nieces so we could not have interfered with them besides my aunt was afraid he would be dull and wanted to make the most of her conquering hero and everybody came and complimented him and catechised him whether he believed in the indian mutilations when poor fellow he had seen horrors enough never to bear to think of them except when the fever brought them all over again i am sure there was excuse enough for his being a little irritable  my dear exclaimed fanny quite hurt he was patience itself while he was with us  thats the difference between illness and recovery dear lady temple i dont blame him any one might be irritable with fresh undetected splinters of bone always working themselves out all down one side and doubts which were worse the fingers on or the fingers off and no escape from folly or politeness for he could not even use a crutch oh no i dont blame him i quite excuse the general dislike he took to everything at poor dear littleworthy he viewed it all like that child in mrs brownings poem seeing through tears the jugglers leap and we have partaken of the juggler aspect to him ever since  i dont think he could ever be very irritable said fanny taking the accusation much to heart  sister and recovery lightly said bessie they encounter what no one else does he only pined for bishopsworthy and when we let him move there after the first month he and my uncle were happy i stayed there for a little while but i was only in the way the dear good folks were always putting themselves out on my account and as to alick you cant think how the absence of his poor souffredouleur invigorated him every day i found him able to put more point into his cutting compliments and reading to my uncle with more energy till at last by the time the th came home he had not so much as a stiff leg to retire upon luckily he and my uncle both cared too much for my poor fathers wishes for him to do so without though if any unlucky chance should take mr lifford away from my uncle he threatens coming to supply the vacancy unless i should and that is past hope  your home is with your uncle affirmed rachel  yes she said mournfully dear littleworthy was too happy to last it broke itself up by its own charmsall married and gone and the last rose of summer in my poor person must float away jane wants her mother and not me and my uncle will submit to me as cheerfully as to other necessary evils it is not myself that i fear for i shall be very happy with the dear uncle but it will be a dreadful overthrow to his habits  i do not see why it need be said rachel  what two old bachelors with a young lady turned in on them and the housekeeperthink of her feelings  i do not think you need be uneasy my dear said fanny your brother is convinced that it will be the greatest pleasure and comfort to mr clare to have you and though there may be difficulties at first i am sure anybody must be the happier for having you and she caressed the upturned face which responded warmly but with a sigh  alick is no judge he is the child of the house and my uncle and mr lifford dont feel complete without him my uncle is as fond of me as can be and he and i could get on beautifully but then mr lifford is impracticable  impracticable said rachel taking up the long word he objects to your exerting yourself in the parish i know what that is  pray rachel said fanny imploringly pray dont any anything against him i am very sorry he has annoyed you but i do like him  oh does he play croquet cried bessie  i gather said rachel in her impressive tone a little disappointed that by impracticable you mean one who will not play croquet  you have hit it laughed bessie who will neither play at croquet nor let one work except in his way well there are hopes for you i cure the curates of every cure i come near except of course the cure that touches me most nearly the shoemakers wife goes the worst shod ill tame yours  my dear i cant have poor mr touchett made game of  i wont make game of him dear lady temple only make him play a game  but you said alick did not approve said fanny with the dimmest possible ideas of what croquet was and believing it a wicked flirtation trap that figured in punch  oh thats fudge on master alicks part just the remains of his old miseries poor fellow what he wants is love now hell meet his fate some of these days and as he cant meet three englishwomen without a mallet in hand love and croquet will come together  alick is very good went on lady temple not answering but arguing with herself whether this opposition could be right colonel hammond gave me such an account of him so valuable and excellent among the men and doing all that is possible for their welfare interesting himself about their library and the regimental school and all the colonel said he wished only that he was a little more easy and popular among the young officers but so many of his own standing were gone by the time he joined again that he lives almost too much to himself reads a good deal and is most exemplary but does not quite make his influence as available as it might be  thats just it cried bessie eagerly the boy is a lazy boy and wants shaking up or hell get savage and no good cant you see by the way he uses his poor little sister what an awful don captain keith must be to a schoolboy of an ensign he must be taught toleration and hunted into amiability or hell be the most terrible turk by the time he is a colonel and you are the only person that can do it dear lady temple  rachel did not much like this but it was so prettily and playfully said that the pleasing impression was quite predominant and when rachel took leave it was with a sense of vexation that a person whom she had begun to esteem should be hard upon this bright engaging sister yet it might be well if fanny took note of the admission that he could be irritable as well as stern and sometimes mistaken in his judgments what would the colonel say to all this the colonelhere he was coming back again into her imagination another symptom  the brother left the field entirely to his sister for the present he was a good deal occupied after his leave and other officers being away he was detained at avoncester and meantime bessie keith took all hearts by storm with her gay good humour and eager sympathy by the end of the first morning she had been to the stable with a swarm of boys patted and learnt the names of all the ponies she was on the warmest terms with the young spaniel that to the curtises vexation one of the officers had given conrade and which was always getting into the way she had won alison by telling her of mr clares recollections of ermines remarkable beauty and intelligence and charmed ermine herself by his kind messages and her own sunshiny brightness she had delighted mrs curtis and grace by appreciating their views and their flowers she had discussed hymnals and chants with mr touchett and promised her services she had given a brilliant object lesson at mrs kellands and received one herself in lacemaking and had proved herself to rachels satisfaction equally practical and wellread all the outer world was asking have you seen the young lady with lady temple  nothing came amiss to her from the antiquity of man to stephanas first words and whether she taught grace new stitches played cricket with conrade made boats for cyril prattled with lady temple or studied with rachel all was done with grace zest and sympathy peculiarly her own two practisings at the school removed the leaden drawl and lessened the twang of the choir and mr touchett looked quite exalted while even rachel owned that she had hardly believed her ears  rachel and she constituted themselves particular friends and grace kept almost aloof in the fear of disturbing them she had many friends and this was the first except ermine williams to whom rachel had taken since a favourite companion of her youth had disappointed her by a foolish marriage bessies confidences had a vigour in them that even rachels halfway meetings could not check and then the sharp clever things she would say in accordance with rachels views were more sympathetic than anything she had met with it was another new charm to life  one great pleasure they enjoyed together was bathing the homestead possessed a little cove of its own under the rocks where there was a bathinghouse and full perfection of arrangement for young ladies aquatic enjoyment in safety and absolute privacy rachels vigorous strength and health had been greatly promoted by her familiarity with salt water and bessie was in ecstasies at the naiad performances they shared together on the smooth bit of sandy shore where they dabbled and floated fearlessly one morning when they had been down very early to be beforehand with the tide which put a stop to their enjoyment long before the breakfast hour bessie asked if they could not profit by their leisure to climb round the edge of the cliffs instead of returning by the direct path and rachel agreed with the greater pleasure that it was an enterprise she had seldom performed  very beautiful though adventurous was the walknow on the brow of the steep cliff looking down on the water or on little bays of shingle now through bits of thicket that held out brambles to entangle the long tresses streaming on their shoulders always in the brisk morning air that filled them with strength and spirit laughing joking calling to one another and to conrades little dog that like every other creature had attached itself to bessie and had followed her from myrtlewood that morning to the vexation of rachel who had no love for dogs in their early youth  they were beyond the grounds of the homestead but had to go a little further to get into the path when they paused above a sort of dip or amphitheatre of rock around a little bay whilst rachel began telling of the smugglers traditions that haunted the placehow much brandy and silk had there been landed in the time of the great french war and how once when hard pressed a party of smugglers taking a short cut in the moonlight midnight across the homestead gardens had encountered an escaped guineapig and no doubt taking it for the very rat without a tail in whose person macbeths witch was to do and to do and to do had been nearly scared out of their wits  her story was cut short by a cry of distress from the dog and looking down they perceived that the poor fellow had been creeping about the rocks and had descended to the little cove whence he was incapable of climbing up again they called encouragingly and pretended to move away but he only moaned more despairingly and leapt in vain  he has hurt his foot exclaimed rachel i must go down after him yes don yes poor fellow im coming  my dear curtia dont leap into the gulf  oh its no great height and the tide will soon fill up this place  dont dont youll never be able to get up again  but rachel was already scrambling down and in effect she was surefooted and used to her own crags nor was the distance much above thirty foot so that she was soon safe on the shingle to the extreme relief of poor don shown by grateful whines but he was still evidently in pain and rachel thought his leg was broken and how to get up the rock with a spaniel that when she tried to lift it became apparently twice the size she had always believed it to be and where both hands as well as feet were required with the sea fast advancing too  my dear rachel you will only break your neck too it is quite vain to try  if you could just come to that first rock perhaps i could push him up to you  bessie came to it but screamed oh im not steady i couldnt do it besides it would hurt him so and i know you would fall poor fellow it is very sad but indeed rachel your life is more precious than a dogs  i cant leave him to drown said rachel making a desperate scramble and almost overbalancing herself here if you could only get him by the scrough of his neck it would not hurt him so much poor don yes poor fellow as he whined but still showed his confidence in the touching manner of a sensible dog knowing he is hurt for his good bessie made another attempt but unused to rocks she was uneasy about her footing and merely frightened herself indeed she said i had better run and call some one i wont be long and you are really quite safe  yes quite safe if you were down here and i above i am sure he could do it easily  ah but im no cragswoman ill be back instantly  that way thats the shortest call to zack or his father tried rachel as the light figure quickly disappeared leaving her a little annoyed at her predicament she was not at all alarmed for herself there was no real danger of drowning she could at any moment get up the rock herself if she chose to leave the dog to its fate but that she could not bear to think of and she even thought the stimulus of necessity might prove the mother of invention if succour should not come before that lapping flux and reflux of water should have crept up the shingly beach on which she stood but she was anxious and felt more and more drawn to the poor dog so suffering yet so patient and confiding nor did she like the awkwardness of being helped in what ought to be no difficulty at all to a native and would not have been had her companion been grace or even conrade her hope was that her ally zack would come as she had directed bessie towards the cottage but behold after a wearily long interval it was no blue jacket that appeared but a round black seahide hat and a sort of easy clericallooking dress that bessie was fluttering before  few words were required the strangers height and length of arms did all that was needful and don was placed in safety with less pain and outcry than could have been hoped rachel ascending before the polite stranger had time to offer his assistance the dogs hurt was he agreed with rachel a broken leg and his offer of carrying it home could not be refused especially as he touched it with remarkable tenderness and dexterity adding that with a splint or two he thought he had surgery enough to set the limb  they were much nearer the homestead than to myrtlewood and as it had been already agreed that bessie should breakfast there the three bent their steps up the hill as fast as might be in consideration of mrs curtiss anxieties bessie in a state of great exultation and amusement at the romantic adventure rachel somewhat put out at the untoward mishap that obliged her to be beholden to one of the casual visitors against whom her mother had such a prejudice  still the gentleman himself was far from objectionable in appearance or manner his air was that of an educated man his dress that of a clergyman at large his face keen rachel remembered to have met him once or twice in the town within the last few days and wondered if he could be a person who had called in at the lace school and asked so many questions that mrs kelland had decided that he could be after no good he must be one of the parliament folks that they sent down to take the bread out of childrens mouths by not letting them work as many hours as was good for them not quite believing in a government commission on lacemaking grievances rachel was still prepared to greet a kindred spirit of philanthropy and as she reflected more thought that perhaps it was well that an introduction had been procured on any terms  so she thawed a little and did not leave all the civility to miss keith but graciously responded to the strangers admiration of the views the exquisite framings of the summer sea and sky made by tree rock and rising ground and the walks so well laid out on the little headland now on smooth turf now bordering slopes wild with fern and mountain ash now amid luxuriant exotic shrubs that attested the mildness of avonmouth winters  when they came near the front of the house rachel took man and dog in through the open window of her own sittingroom and hastened to provide him with bandages and splints leaving bessie to reassure mrs curtis that no human limbs were broken and that no one was even wet to the skin nay bessie had even the tact to spare mrs curtis the romantic colouring that delighted herself grace had followed rachel to assist at the operation and was equally delighted with its neatness and tenderness as well as equally convinced of the necessity of asking the performer first to wash his hands and then to eat his breakfast both which kind proposals he accepted with diffident gratitude first casting a glance around the apartment which though he said nothing conveyed that he was profoundly struck with the tokens of occupation that it contained the breakfast was in the first place a very hungry one indeed bessie had been too ravenous to wait till the surgery was over and was already arrived at her second egg when the others appeared and the story had again to be told to the mother and her warm thanks given mrs curtis did not like strangers when they were only names but let her be brought in contact and her good nature made her friendly at once above all in her own house the stranger was so grave and quiet too not at all presuming and making light of his services but only afraid he had been trespassing on the homestead grounds these incursions of the season visitors were so great a grievance at the homestead that mrs curtis highly approved his forbearance whilst she was pleased with his tribute to her scenery which he evidently admired with an artistic eye love of sketching had brought him to avonmouth and before he took leave mrs curtis had accorded him that permission to draw in her little peninsula for which many a young lady below was sighing and murmuring he thanked her with a melancholy look confessing that in his circumstances his pencil was his toy and his solace  once again that landscape painter exclaimed bessie with uplifted hands as soon as both he and mrs curtis were out of earshot an adventure at last  not at all said rachel gravely there was neither alarm nor danger  precisely the romance minus the disagreeables only the sea monster wanting young alcides and rockyou stood there for sacrifice i was the weeping dardanian dames  even grace could not help laughing at the mischief of the one and the earnest seriousness of the other  now bessie i entreat that you will not make a ridiculous story of a most simple affair implored rachel  i promise not to make one but dont blame me if it makes itself  it cannot unless some of us tell the story  what do you expect the young alcides to hold his tongue that is more than can be hoped of mortal landscape painter  i wish you would not call him so i am sure he is a clergyman  landscape painter i would lay you anything you please  nay said grace according to you that is just what he ought not to be  i do not understand what diverts you so much said rachel growing lofty in her displeasure what matters it what the man may be  that is exactly what we want to see returned bessie  poor rachel a grave and earnest person like her had little chance with one so full of playful wit and fun as bessie keith to whom her very dignity and susceptibility of annoyance made her the better game to have involved the grave rachel in such a parody of an adventure was perfectly irresistible to her and to expect absolute indifference to it would as grace felt have been requiring mere stupidity indeed there was forbearance in not pushing rachel further at the moment but proceeding to tell the tale at myrtlewood whither grace accompanied bessie as a guard against possible madcap versions capable of misconstruction  yes said rachel to herself i see now what captain keith regrets his sister with all her fine powers and abilities has had her tone lowered to the hateful conventional style of wit that would put me to the blush for the smallest mishap i hope he will not come over till it is forgotten for the very sight of his disapproval would incite her further i am glad the colonel is not here here of course he is in my imagination why should i be referring everything to him i who used to be so independent suppose this nonsense gave him umbrage let it i might then have light thrown on his feelings and my own at any rate i will not be conscious if this stranger be really worth notice as i think he is i will trample on her ridicule and show how little i esteem it     chapter ix the new sport     sire i replied joys prove cloudlets    men are the merest ixions    here the king whistled aloud lets    heigho go look at our lions    such are the sorrowful chances    if you talk fine to king francisr browning   the day after rachels adventure with don a card came into the drawingroom and therewith a message that the gentleman had availed himself of mrs curtiss kind permission and was sketching the spinsters needles two sharp points of red rock that stood out in the sea at the end of the peninsula and were specially appropriated by rachel and grace  the card was written not engraved the name rd r h c l mauleverer and a discussion ensued whether the first letters stood for richard or for reverend and if he could be unconscionable enough to have five initials the sisters had some business to transact at villarss the avonmouth deposit of literature and stationery which was in the hands of a somewhat aspiring genius who edited the weekly paper and respected miss rachel curtis in proportion to the number of periodicals she took in and the abstruseness of the publications she inquired after the paper in its saturdays dampness lay fresh on the counter and glancing at the new arrivals grace had the desired opportunity of pointing to mr mauleverers name and asking when he had come about a week since said the obliging mr villars he appeared to be a gentleman of highly literary and artistic tastes a philanthropist indeed mr villars understood him to be a clerical gentlemen who had opinions  oh rachel i am very sorry said grace  sorry what for  why you and mamma seemed quite inclined to like him  well and what have we heard  not much that is rational certainly said grace smiling but we know what was meant  granting that we do what is proved against him no i will not say proved but alleged he is one of the many who have thought for themselves upon the perplexing problems of faith and practice and has been sincere uncompromising selfsacrificing in avowing that his mind is still in that state of solution in which all earnest and original minds must be ere the crystallizing process sets in observe grace i am not saying for an instant that he is in the right all i do say is that when depth of thought and candour have brought misfortune upon a man it is ungenerous therefore to treat him as if he had the leprosy  indeed rachel i think you have made more out of his opinions than i did  i was only arguing on your construction of his opinions  take care for they were at this moment reaching a gate of myrtlewood and the sound of hoofs came close behind them they were those of the very handsome chestnut ridden by alexander keith who jumped off his horse with more alacrity than usual as they were opening the gate for him and holding out his hand eagerly said  then i conclude there is nothing the matter  nothing at all said grace what did you hear  only a little drowning and a compound fracture or two said he relapsing into his languid ease as he gave his bridle to a groom and walked with them towards the house  there how very annoying exclaimed rachel though of course the smallest adventure does travel  i may venture to hope that neither are you drowned nor my sisters leg broken nor a celebrated professor and essayist in a high fever wi pulling any of you out of the sea  there grace exclaimed rachel i told you he was something distinguished  my dear rachel if his celebrity be in proportion to the rest of the story  then there really was a rescue exclaimed captain keith now with much more genuine anxiety and rachel recollecting her desire that the right version should have the precedence quickly answered there was no danger only don slipped down into that curved cove where we walked one day with the boys i went down after him but he had broken his leg i could not get up with him in my arms and bessie called some one to help me  and why could not bessie help you herself  oh strangers can never climb on our slippery rocks as we can  moreover it would have spoilt the predicament muttered the brother to himself then turning round with a smile and is the child behaving herself  grace and rachel answered in a eager duet how she was charming every one so helpful so kind so everything  ah he said with real satisfaction apparent in the eyes that were so pleasant when open wide enough to be visible i knew she always did better when i was not there  they were by this time entering the hall which in the confident fashion of the seaside stood open and at the moment fanny came tripping downstairs with her dress looped up and a shady hat on her head looking fearfully girlish thought her cousins though her attire was still rigidly black  oh i am so glad to see you don is so much better rachel and conrade wants to thank you he went up yesterday and was so sorry you were out might it not have been dreadful alick i have been so wanting to tell you how very delightful that dear sister of yours is all the boys are distracted about her come out please she has been teaching the boys such a delightful game so much nicer than cricket for i can play with them  alick and rachel could not but exchange a glance and at the same moment emerging through the screen of shrubs on the lawn bessie keith conrade francis and leoline were seen each with a mallet in hand and a gay ball in readiness to be impelled through the hoops that beset the lawn  and you really are learning croquet exclaimed innocent grace well it makes a beautiful ground  croquet exclaimed poor lady temple with startled eyes you dont really mean that it is croquet o bessie bessie  ah i didnt mean you to have come so soon said the much amused bessie as she gave her hand in greeting i meant the prejudice to be first conquered see dear lady temple im not ashamed this whitey brown moustache is going to kiss me nevertheless and notwithstanding  and so it certainly did and smiled into the bargain while the boys came clamouring up and after thanks for dons preservation began loudly to beg mamma would come they could not make up their sides without her but mamma was distressed and unhappy  not now my dearsi musti must indeed i did not know  now alick i trust to your generosity said bessie finding that they must be pacified coming concome grace come and convince lady temple that the pastime is not too wicked for you  indeed alick lady temple was saying i am very sorry i wont allow it one moment if you think it is objectionable  but i dont said alick smiling far from it it is a capital game for you and your boys  i thoughti thought you disapproved and could not bear it said lady temple wondering and wistful  cant bear is not disapprove indeed seeing that gentle earnest alone could console her there is no harm in the game itself it is a wholly personal distaste arising from my having been bored with it when i was ill and out of spirits  but is not there something about it in punch she still asked so anxiously that it was impossible not to smile but there was not a particle of that subdued mockery that was often so perplexing in him as he replied certainly there is about its abuse as an engine for flirtation which to tell you the truth was what sickened me with the sight at littleworthy but that is not the line con and francie will take just yet why my uncle is specially addicted to listening to croquet and knows by the step and sound how each player is getting on till he is quite an oracle in disputed hits  so bessie told me said fanny still feeling that she had been taken in and the brother unkindly used but i cant think how she could when you dont like it  nobody is bound to respect foolish prejudices said alick still quite in earnest it would have been very absurd not to introduce it  come alick said bessie advancing have you absolved her and may we begin would it not be a generous act of amnesty if all the present company united in a match  too many said alick odd numbers i shall go down and call on miss williams may i come back lady temple and have a holiday from the mess  i shall be very glad only i am afraid there is no dinner  so much the better only let me see you begin or i shall never dare to express an opinion for the future  mamma do pray pray begin the afternoon is wasting like nothing cried conrade of the muchtried patience and aunt rachel he added in his magnanimity you shall be my partner and ill teach you  thank you conrade but i cant i promised to be at home at four said rachel who had all this time been watching with curious interest which influence would prevailwhether alick would play for fannys sake or fanny abstain for alicks sake she was best satisfied as it was but she had still to parry bessie keiths persuasive determination why would she go home it certainly was to inspect the sketches of the landscapepainter you heard alick of the interesting individual who acted the part of rachels preserver she added  the very force of rachels resolution not to be put out of countenance served to cover her with the most uncomfortable blushes all the more at the thought of her own unlucky exclamation i came here said alick coolly to assist in recovering the beloved remains from a watery grave and then as bessie insisted on hearing the avoncester version he gave it while grace added the intelligence that the hero was a clergyman sinking the opinions as too vague to be mentioned even had not the company been too flighty for a subject she thought serious and painful and he is at this moment sketching the spinsters needles said bessie well i am consoled with all your resolve to flatten down an adventure fate is too strong for you something will come of it is not the very resolve that it shall not be an adventure a token  if any one should wish to forget it it is you i think bessie said alick your admirable sagacity seems to have been at fault i thought you prided yourself on your climbing  up a slippery perpendicular  i know the place he gravely answered  well exclaimed bessie recovering herself i am not a mermaid nor even a dear gazelle and in my humble opinion there was far more grace in preventing heroism from being unwept unnoticed and unsung than in perilling my own neck craning down and strangling the miserable beast by pulling him up by the scrough of his neck what an introduction would have been lost  if you are going to play bessie said her brother it would be kind to take pity upon those boys  one achievement is mine she said dancing away backwards her bright eyes beaming with saucy merriment the great alexander has bidden me to croquet  i am afraid said her brother turning to rachel as she departed that it was all her fault pray be patient with her she has had many disadvantages  his incomprehensible irony had so often perplexed rachel that she did not know whether his serious apologetic tone were making game of her annoyance and she answered not very graciously oh never mind it did not signify and at the same time came another urgent entreaty from the boys that the two aunts would join the game conrade evidently considering that partnership with him would seal the forgiveness aunt rachel had won by the rescue of don  grace readily yielded but rachel pleaded her engagement and when the incorrigible bessie declared that they perfectly understood that nothing could compete with the sketch of the spinsters needles she answered i promised to write a letter for my mother on business before post time the burnaby bargain she explained to add further conviction  a businesslike transaction indeed exclaimed bessie much diverted with the name  only a bit of land in trust for apprenticing poor children said rachel it was left by a curtis many generations ago in trust to the rector of the parish and the lord of the manor and poor mr linton is so entirely effete that it is virtually in our hands it is one of the vexations of my life that more good cannot be done with it for the fees are too small for superior tradespeople and we can only bind them to the misery of lacemaking the system belongs to a wornout state of things  the word system in rachels mouth was quite sufficient to send bessie to her croquet and the poor boys were at length rewarded for their unusual patience their mother had been enduring almost as much as they did in her dislike to see them tantalised and she now threw herself into the game with a relish that proved that as yet at least conrades approbation was more to her than captain keiths it was very pretty to see her so pleased with her instructions so eager about her own game and yet so delighted with every hit of her boys while bessie was an admirable general playing everybodys game as well as her own and with such life and spirit such readiness and good nature that a far duller sport would have been delicious under her management  poor alick said she meeting him when he again strolled into the garden while the boys were collecting the mallets and balls he did think he had one lawn in the world undefiled by those horrible hoops then as she met his smile of amusement and pardon but it was so exactly what they wanted here it is so good for lady temple and her boys to have something they can do together  the pleased affectionate smile was gone  i object to nothing but its being for her good he said gravely  but now does not it make her very happy and suit her excellently  may be so but that is not the reason you introduced it  you have a shocking habit of driving one up into corners alick but it shall be purely purely for my own selfish delight and she clasped her hands in so droll an affectation of remorse that the muscles round his eyes quivered with diversion though the hair on his lip veiled what the corners of his mouth were about if only she proceeded you wont let it banish you you must come over to take care of this wicked little sister or who knows what may be the consequences  i kept away partly because i was busy and partly because i believe you are such a little ape as always to behave worse when you have the semblance of a keeper he said with his arm fondly on her shoulder as they walked  and in the mean time fell out the adventure of the distinguished essayist  i am afraid he returned that was a gratuitous piece of mischief particularly annoying to so serious and thoughtful a person as miss rachel curtis  jealousy exclaimed bessie in an ecstatic tone you see what you lost by not trusting me to behave myself under the provocation of your presence  what the pleasure of boxing your ears for a coward  of seizing the happy opening i am very much afraid for you now alick she proceeded with mock gravity what hope can a poor captain of highlanders even if he does happen to be a wounded hero or two have against a distinguished essayist and landscape painter if it were a common case indeed but where wisdom herself is concerned  military frivolity cannot hope returned alick with a shake of his head and a calm matteroffact acquiescent tone  ah poor alick pursued his sister you always were a discreet youth but to be connected with such a union of learning social science and homeaopathy soared beyond my utmost ambition i suppose the wedding toursupposing the happy event to take placewill be through a series of model schools and hospitals ending in hanwell  no said alick equally coolly to the dutch reformatory and the swiss cretin asylum  she was exceedingly tickled at his readiness and proceeded in a pretended sentimental tone i am glad you have revealed the secrets of your breast i saw there was a powerful attraction and that you were no longer your own but my views were humbler i thought the profound respect with which you breathed the name of avonmouth was due to the revival of the old predilection for our sweet little  hush bessie said her brother roused for the first time into sternness this is more than nonsense one word more of this and you will cut me off from my greatest rest and pleasure  from the lawn where croquet waits his approbation was on bessies tongue but she did not say it there were moments when she stood in fear of her brother he paused and as if perceiving that his vehemence was in itself suspicious added remember i never met her from seven years old till after her marriage she has been the kindest of friends in right of our fathers old friendship you know how her mother nursed me and the sister she was to me and bessie if your selfishnessi wish i could call it thoughtlessnessinvolves her innocent simplicity in any scrape derogatory to what is becoming her situation i shall find it very hard to forgive you and harder still to forgive myself for letting you come here  bessie pouted for a moment but her sweetness and good humour were never away there you have given your wicked little sister a screed she said looking insinuatingly up at him just as if i did not think her a darling and would not for the world do anything to spoil her have not i been leading the most exemplary life talking systems and visiting cottages with rachel and playing with the boys and singing with the clergyman and here am i pounced on as if i were come to be the serpent in this anticroquet paradise  only a warning bessie  youll be better now you have had it out ive seen you suppressing it all this time for fear of frightening me away  every one knows how the afternoon croquet match on the myrtlewood lawn became an institution though with some variation in the observers thereof owing to the exigencies of calls rides and ermine williamss drive which lady temple took care should happen at least twice a week the most constant votaries of the mallet and hoop were of course the two elder boys the next pair being distant worshippers only now and then admitted by special favour but the ardour of their mother even exceeded that of bessie keith and it was always a disappointment to her if she were prevented from playing grace and alison williams frequently took their share with enjoyment though not with the same devotion and visitors civil and military also often did their part but the most fervent of all these was mr touchett ever since that call of his when after long impatience of his shy jerks of conversation and incapacity of taking leave miss keith had exclaimed did you ever play at croquet do come and we will teach you he had been its most assiduous student the first instructions led to an appointment for more one contest to another and the curate was becoming almost as regular a croquet player as conrade himself not conversing much but sure to be in his place and showing a dexterity and precision that always made lady temple pleased to have him on her side and exclaim with delight at his hits as a public benefit to the cause or thank him with real gratitude when he croqued her or one of her sons out of a difficulty  indeed that little lawn at myrtlewood was a battlefield of which alison used to carry her sister amusing and characteristic sketches the two leading players were miss keith and mr touchett who alone had any idea of tactics but what she did by intuition sleight of hand or experience he effected by calculation and generalship and even when conrade claimed the command of his own side the suggestions of the curate really guided the party conrade was a sort of murat on the croquet field bold dashing often making wonderful hits but uncertain and only gradually learning to act in combination alison was a surehanded skilful hitter but did not aspire to leadership mamma tried to do whatever her boys commanded and often did it by a sort of dainty dexterity when her exultation was a very pretty sight nor was graces ladylike skill contemptible but having francis as an ally was like giving a castle and he was always placed on the other side from conrade as it was quite certain that he would do the very reverse of whatever his brother advised now and then invitations were given for rose williams to join the game but her aunts never accepted them ermine had long ago made up her mind against intimacies between her niece and any pupils of alisons sure that though starts of pleasure might result they would be at the cost of ruffling and perhaps perturbing the childs even stream of happinesseven girlfriendships might have been of doubtful effect where circumstances were so unequal but lady temples household of boys appeared to ermine by no means a desirable sphere for her child to be either teased or courted in violetta colinette and augustus were safer comrades and rose continued to find them sufficient varied with the rare delight of now and then sharing her aunts drive and brightened by many a kind message in colonel keiths letters to her aunt nay occasionally a small letter to herself or an enclosure of some pretty photograph for her muchloved scrap book or some article for colinettes use sometimes even a new book she was never forgotten in his letters and ermine smiled her strange pensive smile of amusement at his wooing of the unconscious rose     chapter x the philanthropist     scorn not the smallness of daily endeavour   let the great meaning ennoble it ever   droop not oer efforts expended in vain   work as believing that labour is gain                               queen isabel c by s m   the sturdy recusant against myrtlewood croquet continued to be rachel curtis and yet it was not a testimony against the game so much as real want of time for it she was always full of occupation even while her active mind craved for more definite and extended labour and when she came upon the field of strategy it was always either with some business before her or else so late that the champions were only assisting their several lags to bring the battle to an end  if there had been a will there would have been a way but as she said she saw enough to perceive that proficiency could only be attained at the cost of much time and study and she did not choose to be inferior and mediocre also she found occupations open to her elsewhere that had long been closed or rendered unpleasant mr touchett had become wonderfully pacific and obliging of late as if the lawn tactics absorbed his propensities for offence and defence he really seemed obliged for one or two bits of parish work that she attended to finding that between him and his staff of young ladies they were getting omitted somehow too an unaccountable blight was passing over the activity of those curatolatresses as rachel had been wont to call them they were less frequently to be met with popping out of the schools and cottages and rachel who knew well all the real poor though refusing the bonds of a district was continually detecting omissions which she more often supplied than reported there was even a smaller sprinkling at the weekly services and the odd thing was that the curate never seemed to remark or be distressed by the change or if any one spoke of the thin congregation he would say winter was the avonmouth season which was true enough but the defaulters were mostly his own peculiar followers the female youth of the professional and mercantile population  rachel did not trouble herself about the cause of all this indeed she was too much occupied with the gradual gliding into somewhat of her original activity and importance in the field thus left open to her none the less however did she feel the burden of lifes problems the intercourse she had enjoyed with colonel keith had excited her for a time but in the reaction the old feelings returned painfully that the times were out of joint the heavens above became obscure and misty as before the dark places of the earth looked darker than ever and those who lived at ease seemed to be employed either in sport upon the outside of the dungeon where the captives groaned or in obstructing the way of those who would fain have plunged in to the rescue  her new acquaintance mr mauleverer was an example of such prevention which weighed much on her mind he had been perfectly unobtrusive but mrs curtis meeting him on the second day of his sketching had naturally looked at his drawing and admired it so much that she brought her daughters to see it when in course of completion the next day he had then asked whether there would be any objection to his making use of the sketches in the way of remunerative sale mrs curtis looked rather taken aback it hardly agreed with her exclusive notions of privacy and he at once apologized with such humility that she was touched and felt herself doing him a wrong whilst rachel was angry at her scruple yet uncomfortably thought of that landscape painter then said in her decided way you did not mean to object mother  oh not for a moment pray dont think of it returned mr mauleverer in haste i would not think of the intrusion it is only that these poor trifles are steps to one of the few means by which i can still hope to do even a little for my fellow creatures the greatest solace that remains to me  my mother did not mean to prevent anything said rachel eagerly least of all any means of doing good  indeed i cannot but be aware that miss curtis is the last individual who would do so except indeed by the good works she herself absorbs  you are too good sir returned mrs curtis i am sure i did not mean to object to anything for good if it is for a charity i am sure some of our friends would be very glad to take some sketches of our scenery they have been begging me this long time to have it photographed i should like to have that drawing myself it would please your aunt so much my dear if we sent it to her  mr mauleverer bowed but rachel was not sure whether he had not been insulted  next day he left at the door the drawing handsomely mounted and looking so grand and meritorious that poor mrs curtis became much troubled in mind whether its proper price might not be five or even ten guineas instead of the one for which she had mentally bargained or if this might not be the beginning of a series which would be quite another thing you know my dear  rachel offered to go and talk to the artist who was sketching in full view from the windows and find out what value he set upon it  perhaps but i dont know my dear wont it be odd had you not better wait till grace comes in or till i can come down with you  no need at all mother i can do it much better alone and at my age  so rachel took a parasol and stepped out looked at the outline newly produced thanked and praised the drawing that had been received adding that her mother would be glad to know what price mr mauleverer set upon it she was met by a profession of ignorance of its value and of readiness to be contented with whatever might be conferred upon his project the one way in which he still hoped to be of service to his fellow creatures the one longing of his life  ah said rachel greatly delighted with this congenial spirit and as usual preferring the affirmative to the interrogative i heard you had been interesting yourself about mrs kellands lace school what a miserable system it is  my inquiries have betrayed me then it is indeed a trying spectacle  and to be helpless to alleviate it continued rachel over work low prices and middlemen perfectly batten on the lives of our poor girls here i have thought it over again and again and it is a constant burden on my mind  yes indeed the effects of modern civilization are a constant burden on the compassion of every highly constituted nature  the only means that seems to me likely to mitigate the evil continued rachel charmed at having the most patient listener who had ever fallen to her lot would be to commence an establishment where some fresh trades might be taught so as to lessen the glut of the market and to remove the workers that are forced to undersell one another and thus oblige the buyers to give a fairly remunerative price  precisely my own views to commence an establishment that would drain off the superfluous labour and relieve the oppressed raising the whole tone of female employment  and this is the project you meant  and in which for the first time i begin to hope for success if it can only receive the patronage of some person of influence  oh anything i can do exclaimed rachel infinitely rejoiced it is the very thing i have been longing for for years what you would form a sort of industrial school where the children could be taught some remunerative labour and it might soon be almost selfsupporting  exactly the first establishment is the difficulty for which i have been endeavouring to put a few mites together  every one would subscribe for such a purpose exclaimed rachel  you speak from your own generous nature miss curtis but the world would require patronesses to recommend  there could be no difficulty about that exclaimed rachel but at this moment she saw the myrtlewood pony carriage coming to the door and remembering that she had undertaken to drive out ermine williams in it she was obliged to break off the conversation with an eager entreaty that mr mauleverer would draw up an account of his plan and bring it to her the next day when she would give her opinion on it and consider of the means  my dear said her mother on her return how long you have been and what am i to give for the watercolour  oh i forgot all about the watercolour but never mind what we give mamma it is all to go to an asylum for educating poor girls and giving them some resource beyond that weary lacemakingthe very thing i have always longed for he is coming to settle it all with me tomorrow and then we will arrange what to give  indeed my dear i hope it will be something well managed i think if it were not for those middlemen lacemaking would not be so bad but you must not keep poor miss williams waiting  ermine had never seen rachael in such high spirits as when they set out through the network of lanes describing her own exceeding delight in the door thus opening for the relief of the suffering over which she had long grieved and launching out into the details of the future good that was to be achieved at last ermine asked what rachel knew of the proposer  captain keith heard he was a distinguished professor and essayist  then i wonder we have not heard his name said ermine it is a remarkable one one might look in the clergy list at villarss  villars called him a clerical gentleman mused rachel  then you would be sure to be able to find out something about him before committing yourself  i can see what he is said rachel a very sensible accomplished man and a great deal more not exactly a finished gentleman but that is no objection to his doing a great work  none at all said ermine smiling but please forgive me we have suffered so much from trusting too implicitly that i never can think it safe to be satisfied without thorough knowledge of a persons antecedents  of course said rachel i shall do nothing without inquiry i will find out all about him but i cannot see any opening for distrust schemes of charity are not compatible with selfseeking and dishonesty  but did i not hear something about opinions  oh as to that it was only villars besides you are a clergymans daughter and your views have a different colouring from mine modern research has introduced so many variations of thought that no good work would be done at all if we required of our fellowlabourers perfect similarity of speculative belief  yet suppose he undertook to teach others  the simple outlines of universal doctrine and morality which are required by poor children are not affected by the variations to which investigation conducts minds of more scope  i am afraid such variations may often reach the foundation  now miss williams i am sure you must often have heard it observed how when it comes to real practical simple teaching of uninstructed people villagers or may be heathens the details of party difference melt away and people find themselves in accordance  true but there i think party differences in the church and even the variations between christian sects are concerned both being different ways of viewing the same truth these may like the knights in the old fable find that both were right about the shield both have the same foundation but where the foundation is not the same the results of the teaching will not agree  every one agrees as to morality  yes but do all give a motive sufficient to enforce the selfdenial that morality entails nay do they show the way to the spiritual strength needful to the very power of being moral  that is begging the question the full argument is whether the full church say christian system exactly as you as we hold it is needful to the perfection of moral observance i dont say whether i assent but the present question is whether the childs present belief and practice need be affected by its teachers dogmatic or undogmatic system  the system for life is generally formed in childhood harvest depends on seed time  and after all added rachel we have no notion whether this poor man be not precisely of your own opinions and from their fruits i am sure you ought to claim them  their blossoms if you please laughed ermine we have not seen their fruits yet  and i shall take care the fruits are not nipped with the blight of suspicion said rachel goodhumouredly  however after driving ermine home and seeing her lifted out and carried into the house by her sister rachel did send the carriage back by the groom and betake herself to villarss shop where she asked for a sight of the clergy list the name of mauleverer caught her eye but only one instance of it appeared and he was a cathedral canon his presentation dated in 1832 the time at which judging from appearances the object of her search might have been born besides he rejoiced in the simple name of thomas but rachels search was brought to an abrupt conclusion by the issue of mr mauleverer himself from the readingroom within the shop he bowed and passed by but rachel for the life of her could not hinder a burning colour from spreading to the very tips of her ears so certain did she feel that she was insulting him by her researches and that he perceived them she felt absolutely ashamed to see him the next day and even in her dreams was revolving speeches that might prove that though cautious and clearsighted she was neither suspicious nor narrowminded  he came when some morning visitors were at the homestead prosy neighbours whose calls were always a penance to rachel and the butler either from the manner of the inquiry or not regarding him as drawingroom company put him into the diningroom and announced mr mauleverer to see miss rachel up jumped miss rachel with youll excuse me it is on business and went off highly satisfied that the mother was hindered by politeness from making any attempt at chaperonage either personally or through grace so unnecessary at her age for since colonel keiths departure rachels age had begun to grow on her again she held out her hand as if to atone for her search but she found at once that it had been remarked  you were doing me the honour to look for my name in the clergy list miss curtis he said  yes one is apt faltered rachel decidedly out of countenance  i quite appreciate the motive it is exactly in accord with miss curtiss prudence and good sense i should wish to be fully explicit before any arrangements are made i am unhappily not in orders miss curtis i know your liberality will regard the cause with leniency  indeed said rachel sufficiently restored to recall one of her premeditated reassurances i can fully appreciate any reluctance to become stringently bound to dogmatic enunciations before the full powers of the intellect have examined into them  you have expressed it exactly miss curtis without denying an iota of them i may be allowed to regret that our formularies are too technical for a thoughtful mind in the present age  many have found it so returned rachel thoughtfully who only needed patience to permit their convictions to ripen then i understand you it was a rejection on negative not positive grounds  precisely i do not murmur but it has been the blight of my life  and yet said rachel consolingly it may enable you to work with more freedom  since you encourage me to believe so miss curtis i will hope it but i have met with much suspicion  i can well believe it said rachel even some of the most superior persons refuse to lay their hands to any task unless they are certified of the religious opinions of their coadjutors which seems to me like a masons refusing to work at a wall with a man who liked greek architecture when he preferred gothic  if rachel had been talking to ermine she might have been asked whether the dissimilarity might not be in the foundations or in the tempering of the mortar but mr mauleverer only commended her liberal spirit and she thought it high time to turn from this subject to the immediate one in hand he had wished to discuss the plan with her he said before drawing it up and in effect she had cogitated so much upon it that her ideas came forth with more than her usual fluency and sententiousness the scheme was that an asylum should be opened under the superintendence of mr mauleverer himself in which young girls might be placed to learn handicrafts that might secure their livelihood in especial perhaps wood engraving and printing it might even be possible in time to render the whole selfsupporting suppose by the publication of a little illustrated periodical the materials for which might be supplied by those interested in the institution  if anything could add to rachels delight it was this last proposition in all truth and candour the relief to the victims to lacemaking was her primary object far before all besides and the longing desire of her heart for years seemed about to be fulfilled but a domestic magazine an outlet to all the essays on curatocult on helplessness on female folly and female rights was a development of the plan beyond her wildest hopes no dull editor to hamper reject or curtail she should be as happy and as well able to expand as the invalid herself  mr mauleverer had brought a large packet of letters with him in all manner of hands there were some testimonials from a german university and letters from german professors in a compromise between english and german hand looking impossible to read also the neat writing and thin wavy watermarked paper of american professors and philanthropists in high commendation of his ability and his scheme and a few others that he said were of too private a nature to do more than show miss curtis in confidence but on which she recognised some distinguished names of persons interested in social science she would not wound his feelings by too close an inquiry but she felt armed at all points against cavillers really she began to think it was a great pity colonel keith should cross her path again she had so much on her hands that it would be a public misfortune if any one mans private domestic love should monopolize her and yet such was this foolish world the honourable mrs colin keith would be a more esteemed lady patroness than miss rachel curtis though the curtises had been lords of the soil for many generations and colonel keith was a mere soldier of fortune  one disappointment rachel had namely that mr mauleverer announced that he was about to return to st herberts the very large and fashionable wateringplace in the next indentation of the coast he had duties there he said and he had only come to avonmouth for a brief holiday a holiday that was to result in such happy effects he lived in an exceedingly retired way he said being desirous of saving his small private means for his great object and he gave rachel his address at the chief printsellers of the place where his letters were left for him while he made excursions from time to time to study the picturesque and to give lectures on behalf of philanthropical subjects he offered such a lecture at avonmouth but mr touchett would not lend either schoolroom and space was nowhere else available in the meantime a prospectus was drawn up which rachel undertook to get printed at villarss and to send about to all her friends since a subscription in hand was the first desideratum  never since she had grown up to be a thinking woman had rachel been so happy as with this outlet to her activity and powers of managing the good time coming at last eagerly she claimed sympathy names and subscriptions her own immediate circle was always easily under her influence and lady temple and mrs curtis supplied the dignity of lady patronesses bessie keith was immensely diverted at the development of that landscape painter and took every opportunity of impressing on rachel that all was the result of her summons to the rescue ermine wished rachel had found out who was the bishops chaplain who rejected him but allowed that it would have been an awkward question to ask and also she wondered if he were a university man but mr touchett had been at a hall and never knew anybody besides being so firmly convinced that mr mauleverer was a pestiferous heretic that no one except lady temple could have obtained a patient answer from him on that headand even with her he went the length of a regret that she had given the sanction of her name to an undertaking by a person of whose history and principles nothing satisfactory was known oh said fanny with her sweet look of asking pardon i am so sorry you think so rachel wished it so much and it seems such a nice thing for the poor children  indeed said mr touchett well nigh disarmed by the look i am quite sensible of the kindness of all you do i only ventured to wish there had been a little more delay that we were more certain about this person  when colonel keith comes back he will find out all about him i am sure said fanny and mr touchett to whom seemed to have been transferred rachels dislike to the constant quoting of colonel keith said no more  the immediate neighbourhood did not very readily respond to the appeal to it in behalf of the lacemakers people who did not look into the circumstances of their neighbours thought lace furnished a good trade and by no means wished to enhance its price people who did care for the poor had charities of their own nor was rachel curtis popular enough to obtain support for her own sake a few fivepound notes and a scanty supply of guineas and halfguineas from people who were ready at any cost to buy off her vehement eyes and voice was all she could obtain and with a subscription of twenty pounds each from her mother lady temple and grace and all that she could scrape together of her own hardly seemed sufficient to meet the first expenses and how would the future be provided for she calculated how much she could spare out of her yearly income and actually to the great horror of her mother and the coachman sold her horse  bessie keith was the purchaser it was an expense that she could quite afford for she and her brother had been left very well off by their fathera prudent man who having been a widower during his indian service had been able to live inexpensively besides having had a large amount of prize money she had always had her own horse at littleworthy and now when rachel was one day lamenting to her the difficulty of raising money for the industrial asylum and declaring that she would part with her horse if she was sure of its falling into good hands bessie volunteered to buy it it was exactly what would suit her and she should delight in it as a reminder of dear avonmouth it was a pang rachel loved the pretty spirited creature and thought of her rides with the colonel but how weigh the pleasure of riding against the welfare of one of those hardworked halfstifled little girls and besides it might be best to have done with colonel keith now that her mission had come to find her so the coachman set a purposely unreasonable value upon poor meg and rachel reduced the sum to what had been given for it three years before but bessie begged her brother to look at the animal and give his opinion  is that what you are after he exclaimed  indeed alick i thought it was the greatest kindness i could do her she is so very eager about this plan and so anxious to find poor meg a good home  purely to oblige her  of course alick it was much more convenient to her than if she had had to send about to horsedealers or to advertise i doubt if she could have done it at all and it is for her asylum you know  then give the coachmans sixty guineas at once  ah alick thats your infatuation and she put on a droll gesture of pity but excuse me where would be the fine edge of delicacy in giving a manifestly fancy price come and look at her  i never meddle with horsedealing  stuff as if you werent the bestmounted man in the regiment i shall send a note to captain sykes if you wont he knows how to drive a bargain  and give a fancy price the other way well bessie on one condition ill go and that is that meg goes to bishopsworthy the day she is yours i wont have her eating lady temples corn and giving her servants trouble  as if i should think of such a thing  captain keiths estimate of the value of the steed precisely agreed with rachels demand of the original price bessie laughed and said there was collusion  now seriously alick do you think her worth so much isnt it a pity when you know what a humbug poor rachel is going to give it to and she looked half comical half saucy  if she were going to throw it into the sea i dont see what difference that would make  ah you are far too much interested nothing belonging to her can bear a vulgar price  nothing belonging to me is to gain profit by her selfdenial said alick gravely you cannot do less than give her what she gave for it if you enter on the transaction at all  you mean that it would look shabby you see we womankind never quite know the code of the world on such matters she said candidly  there is something that makes codes unnecessary bessie he said  ah i can make allowances it is a cruel stroke i dont wonder you cant bear to see any one else on her palfrey above all as a sacrifice to the landscape painter  then spare my feelings and send the mare to bishopsworthy said alick as usual too careless of the imputation to take the trouble to rebut it or to be disconcerted  bessie was much tickled at his acceptance and laughed heartily  to be sure she said it is past concealment now you must have been very far gone indeed to have been taken in to suppose me to be making capital of her charitable purposes  your acting is too like life he said not yet induced to laugh and she rattled on with her droll sham sentimental air is it the long words alick or is it the great eyes my dear or is itoh yes i know what is the great attractionthat the homestead doesnt possess a single spot where one could play at croquet  quite irresistible replied alick and bessie retreated from the colloquy still not laughing at but with him that is if the odd quaint inward mirth which only visibly lengthened his sleepy eyes could be called a laugh  next time captain keith rode to avonmouth he met the riding party on the road bessie upon rachels mare and it appeared that lady temple had considered it so dreadful that meg should not share her hospitality that it had been quite impossible to send her away so alick your feelings must endure the dreadful spectacle  meanwhile rachel was hard at work with the subscribers to the christian knowledge society beginning with the as and working down a page a day she sent every member a statement of the wrongs of the lacemakers and the plans of the industrial establishment at a vast expense of stamps but then as she calculated one pound thus gained paid for two hundred and forty fruitless letters  and pray said alick who had ridden on to call at the homestead how do you reconcile yourself to the temptation to the postmen  they dont see what my letters are about  they must be dull postmen if they dont remark on the shower of envelopes that pass through their handsominous moneyletters all with the same address and no detection remember you dont know who will answer and who will not  i never thought of that said rachel but risks must be run when any great purpose is in hand  the corruption of one postman versus the rescue ofhow many children make a postman asked captain keith with his grave considering look  the postman would be corrupt already said grace as rachel thought the last speech too mocking to be worthy of reply and went on picking up her letters  there is another objection added captain keith as he watched her busy fingers have you considered how you are frightening people out of the society it is enough to make one only subscribe as michael miserly or as simon skinflint or something equally uninviting to applications  i shall ask you to subscribe by both names said rachel readily how much for simon skinflint  ten pounds stopwhen mr mauleverer gives him a reference  thats ungenerous will michael miserly make up for it  yes when the first years accounts have been audited  ah those who have no faith to make a venture can never effect any good  you evidently build on a great amount of faith from the public how do you induce them to believedo you write in your own name  no it makes mamma unhappy i was going to put r c but grace said people would think it meant roman catholic your sister thought i had better put the initials of female union for lacemakers employment  you dont mean that bessie persuaded you to put that exclaimed alick keith more nearly starting up than rachel had ever seen him  yes there is no objection is there  oh rachel rachel how could we have helped thinking of it cried grace nearly in a state of suffocation  rachel held up her printed appeal where subscriptions were invited to the address of f u l e the homestead avonmouth  miss curtis though you are not scottish you ought to be well read in walter scott  i have thought it waste of time to read incorrect pictures of pseudochivalry since i have been grown up said rachel but that has nothing to do with it  ah rachel if we had been more up in our scotch we should have known what f u l e spells sighed grace  a light broke in upon rachel i am sure bessie never could have recollected it was her first exclamation but there she continued too earnest to see or stumble at straws never mind it cannot be helped and i dare say not one person in ten will be struck by it  stay said grace let it be englishwomans employment see i can very easily alter the l into an e  rachel would hardly have consented but was forced to yield to her mothers entreaties however the diligent transformation at ls did not last long for three days after a parcel was left at the homestead containing five thousand printed copies of the appeal with the e rightly inserted bessie laughed and did not disavow the half reluctant thanks for this compensation for her inadvertence or mischief whichever it might be laughing the more at rachels somewhat ungrateful confession that she had rather the cost had gone into a subscription for the f u e e as bessie said to herself it was much better and more agreeable for all parties that it should so stand and she would consider herself in debt to alick for the amount indeed she fully expected him to send her in the bill but in the meantime not one word was uttered between the brother and sister on the subject they understood one another too well to spend useless words  contrary to most expectation there was result enough from rachels solicitations to serve as justification for the outlay in stamps the very number of such missives that fly about the world proves that there must be a great amount of uninquiring benevolence to render the speculation anything but desperate and rachel met with very tolerable success mr mauleverer called about once a week to report progress on his side and in his character of treasurer to take charge of the sums that began to accumulate but rachel had heard so much on all sides of the need of caution in dealing with one so entirely a stranger that she resolved that no one should blame her for imprudence and therefore retained in her own name in the avoncester bank all the sums that she received mr mauleverer declared himself quite contented with this arrangement and eagerly anticipated the apologies that rachel was ashamed even to make to him  enough was collected to justify a beginning on a small scale a house was to be taken where mr mauleverer and a matron would receive the first pupils teach them wood engraving and prepare the earlier numbers of the magazine when a little more progress had been made the purchase of a printingpress might be afforded and it might be struck off by the girls themselves but in the meantime they must be dependent on the regular printer on this account mr mauleverer thought it best to open the establishment not at avonmouth but at st herberts where he had acquaintance that would facilitate the undertaking  rachel was much disappointed to be in and out constantly daily teaching and watching the girls and encouraging them by learning the employment herself had been an essential portion of her vision she had even in one of her most generous moods proposed to share the delight with the williamses and asked ermine if she would not if all things suited become the resident matron however mr mauleverer said that there was an individual of humbler rank the widow of a national schoolmaster so anxious to devote herself to the work that he had promised she should share it whenever he was in a condition to set the asylum on foot and he assured rachel that she would find this person perfectly amenable to all her views and ready to work under her he brought letters in high praise of the late school master and recommendations of his widow from the clergyman of the parish where they had lived and place and name being both in the clergy list even ermine and alison began to feel ashamed of their incredulity whilst as to grace she had surrendered herself completely to the eager delight of finding a happy home for the little children in whom she was interested grace might laugh a little at rachel but in the main her trust in her sisters superiority always led her judgment and in the absence of colonel keith fanny was equally willing to let rachel think for her when her own children were not concerned  rachel did not give up her hopes of fixing the asylum near her till after a considerable effort to get a house for it at avonmouth but this was far from easy the curtises unwillingness to part with land for building purposes enhanced the price of houses and in autumn and winter the place was at its fullest so that she could not even rent a house but at a ruinous price it would be the best way to build on homestead land but this would be impracticable until spring even if means were forthcoming as rachel resolved they should be and in the meantime she was obliged to acquiesce in mr mauleverers assurance that a small house in an overbuilt portion of st norberts would be more eligible than one in some inland parish anything was better than delay mr mauleverer was to superintend from his lodgings  rachel went with grace and her mother to st norberts and inspected the house an ordinary cheap one built to supply lodgings for the more economical class of visitors it was not altogether what rachel wished but must serve till she could build and perhaps it would be best to form her experience before her plans mr mauleverers own lodgings were near at hand and he could inspect progress the furniture was determined uponneat little iron beds for the dormitories and all that could serve for comfort and even pleasure for both mr mauleverer and rachel were strong against making the place bare and workhouselike insulting poverty and dulling the spirit  grace suggested communication with the clergyman of the parish but the north hill turned out not to belong to st norberts proper being a part of a great moorland parish whose focus was twelve miles off a district was in course of formation and a church was to be built but in the meantime the new houses were practically almost pastorless and the children and their matron must take their chance on the free seats of one of the churches of st norberts the staff of clergy there were so busy that no one liked to add extra parochial work to their necessary duties and there was not sufficient acquaintance with them to judge how they would view mr mauleverers peculiarities clerical interference was just what rachel said she did not want it was an escape that she did not call it meddling  one bit of patronage at least she could exercise a married pair of former homestead servants had set up a fuel store at st norberts receiving coal from the ships and retailing it they were to supply the f u e e with wood coal and potatoes and this was a great ingredient in mrs curtiss toleration the mother liked anything that brought custom to rossitur and susan  the establishment was at present to consist of three children the funds were not sufficient for more one was the child of the matron and the other two were lovedy kelland and the daughter of a widow in ill health whose family were looking very lean and ill cared for mrs kelland was very unwilling to give lovedy up she had always looked to receiving the apprentice fee from the burnaby bargain for her as soon as the child was fourteen and she had a strong prejudice against any possible disturbance to the lace trade but winter would soon come and her sale was uncertain her best profit was so dependent on homestead agency that it was impolitic to offend miss curtis and moreover lovedy was so excited by the idea of learning to make pictures to books that she forgot all the lace dexterity she had ever learnt and spoilt more than she made so that mrs kelland was reduced to accept the kind proposal that lovedy should be lady temples nominee and be maintained by her at the f u e e at seven shillings a week  fanny however asked the clergymans consent first telling him with her sweet earnest smile how sorry she was for the little girl and showing him the high testimonials to mrs rawlins he owned that they were all that could be wished and even said at her request that he would talk to mr mauleverer what the talk amounted to they never knew but when fanny said she hoped he had found nothing unsatisfactory the poor man must be so glad to be of use mr touchett replied with indeed it is an unfortunate situation and his opposition might therefore be considered as suspended  of course cried bessie we know by what witchery but alison williams her listener turned on her such great eyes of wilful want of comprehension that she held her peace  rachel and grace united in sending mary morris the other child they really could do nothing more so heavily had their means been drawn upon for the first expenses but rachel trusted to do more for the future and resolved that her dress should henceforth cost no more than alison williamss indeed she went through a series of assertions by way of examining alison on the expenses of her wardrobe  the house was taken from michaelmas and a few days after the two little victims as bessie laughingly called them were taken over to st norberts in the homestead carriage lady temple chaperoning the three young ladies to see the inauguration and the height of rachels glory  they were received by mr mauleverer at the door and slightly in the rear saw the matron mrs rawlins a handsome pale woman younger than they expected but whose weeds made fanny warm to her directly but she was shy and retiring and could not be drawn into conversation and her little alice was only three years old much younger than rachel had expected as a pupil but a very pretty creature with great black eyes  tea and cake were provided by way of an inauguration feast and the three little girls sat up in an atmosphere of good cheer strongly suggestive of school feasts and were left in the midst with many promises of being good a matter that lovedy seemed to think would be very easy in this happy place with no lace to make  mrs rawlins whose husband had been a trained schoolmaster was to take the children to church and attend to their religious instruction indeed mr mauleverer was most anxious on this head and as rachel already knew the scruples that withheld him from ordination were only upon the absolute binding himself to positive belief in minor technical points that would never come in the way of young children  altogether the neat freshness of the room the urbanity of mr mauleverer the shy grief of the matron all left a most pleasant impression rachel was full of delight and triumph and grace and fanny quite enthusiastic the latter even to the being sure that the colonel would be delighted for the colonel was already beginning to dawn on the horizon and not alone he had written in the name of his brother to secure a cottage of gentility of about the same calibre as myrtlewood newly completed by a speculator on one of the few bits of ground available for building purposes a name was yet wanting to it but the day after the negotiation was concluded the landlord paid the delicate compliment to his first tenant by painting gowanbrae upon the gateposts in letters of green go and bray read bessie keith as she passed by for the sake of the chief of my name i hope that it is not an omen of his occupations here  the two elder boys were with her and while francis slowly apprehending her meaning in part began to bristle up with the assurance that colonel keith never brayed in his life conrade caught the point with dangerous relish and dwelt with colonial disrespect that alarmed his mother on the opinion expressed by some unguarded person in his hearing that lord keith was little better than an old donkey he is worse than aunt rachel said conrade meditatively now she has saved don and keeps away from the croquet  meantime rachel studied her own feelings a few weeks ago her heart would have leapt at the announcement but now her mission had found her out and she did not want to be drawn aside from it colonel keith might have many perfections but alike as scotsman soldier and highchurchman he was likely to be critical of the head of the f u e e and matters had gone too far now for her to afford to doubt or to receive a doubting master moreover it would be despicable to be diverted from a great purpose by a courtship like any ordinary woman nor must marriage settlements come to interfere with her building and endowment of the asylum and ultimate devotion of her property thereunto no she would school herself into a system of quiet discouragement and reserve herself and her means as the nucleus of the great future establishment for maintaining female rights of labour     chapter xi lady temples troubles     the pheasant in the falcons claw   he scarce will yield to please a dawscott   early in the afternoon of a warm october day the brothers arrived at avomnouth and ten minutes after both were upon the lawn at myrtlewood where croquet was still in progress shouts of delight greeted the colonel and very gracefully did bessie keith come to meet him with the frank confiding sweetness befitting his recent ward the daughter of his friend a reassuring smile and monosyllable had scarcely time to pass between him and the governess before a flood of tidings was poured on him by the four elder boys while their mother was obliged to be mannerly and to pace leisurely along with the elder guest and poor mr touchett waited a little aloof hammering his own boot with his mallet as if he found the enchanted ground failing him but the boys had no notion of losing their game and vociferated an inquiry whether the colonel knew croquet yes he had several times played with his cousins in scotland then insisted conrade he must take mammas place whilst she was being devoured and how surprised she would be at being so helped on  not now not today he answered i may go to your sister ailie yes boys you must close up your ranks without me  then please entreated hubert take him away pointing to the engrosser of their mother  do you find elder brothers so easily disposed of hubert said the colonel do you take conrade away when you please  i should punch him returned francis  he knows better quoth conrade in the same breath both with infinite contempt for hubert  and i know better returned colonel keith never mind boys ill come back inin reasonable time to carry him off and he waved a gay farewell  surely you wish to go too said bessie to alison if only to relieve them of the little girl ill take care of the boys pray go  thank you said alison surprised at her knowledge of the state of things but they are quite hardened to roses presence and i think would rather miss her  and in fact alison did not feel at all sure that when stimulated by bessies appreciation of their mischief her flock might not in her absence do something that might put their mother in despair and make their character for naughtiness irretrievable so leoline and hubert were summoned the one from speculations whether lord keith would have punched his brother the other from amaze that there was anything our military secretary could not do and conrade and francis were arrested in the midst of a significant contraction of the nostrils and opening of the mouth which would have exploded in an eehaw but for bessies valiant undertaking to be herself and lady temple both at once  soon colonel keith was knocking at ermines door and rose was clinging to him glowing and sparkling with shy ecstasy while without sitting down again after her greeting rachel resolutely took leave and walked away with firm steps ruminating on her determination not to encourage meetings in mackarel lane  better than i expected exclaimed colonel keith after having ushered her to the door in the fulness of his gratitude i knew it was inevitable that she should be here but that she should depart so fast was beyond hope  yes said ermine laughing i woke with such a certainty that she would be here and spend the first half hour in the f u e e that i wasted a great deal of resignation but how are you colin you are much thinner i am sure by mrs tibbies account you were much more ill than you told me  only ill enough to convince me that the need of avoiding a northern winter was not a fallacy and likewise to make tibbie insist on coming here for fear maister colin should not be looked after it is rather a responsibility to have let her come for she has never been farther south than edinburgh but she would not be denied so she has been to see you i told her you would help her to find her underlings i thought it might be an opening for that nice little girl who was so oppressed with lacemaking  ah she has gone to learn woodcutting at the f u e e but i hope we have comfortably provided tibbie with a damsel she made us a long visit and told us all about master colins nursery days only i am afraid we did not understand half  good old body said the colonel in tones almost as national as tibbies own she was nursery girl when i was the spoilt child of the house and hers was the most homelike face that met me i wish she may be happy here and you are well ermine  very well those drives are so pleasant and lady temple so kind it is wonderful to think how many unlookedfor delights have come to us how good every one is and her eyes shone with happy tears as she looked up at him and felt that he was as much her own as ever and you have brought your brother she said you have been too useful to him to be spared is he come to look after you or to be looked after  a little of both i fancy said the colonel but i suspect he is giving me up as a bad job ermine there are ominous revivifications going on at home and he has got himself rigged out in london and had his hair cut so that he looks ten years younger  do you think he has any special views  he took such pains to show me the charms of the benorchie property that i should have thought it would have been jessie douglas the heiress thereof only coming here does not seem the way to set about it unless be regards this place as a bath of youth and fashion i fancy he has learnt enough about my health to make him think me a precarious kind of heir and that his views are general i hope he may not be made a fool of otherwise it is the best thing that could happen to us  it has been a dreary uncomfortable visit i much fear said ermine  less so than you think i am glad to have been able to be of use to him and to have lived on something like brotherly terms we know and like each other much better than we had a chance of doing before and we made some pleasant visits together but at home there are many things on which we can never be of one mind and i never was well enough at gowanbrae to think of living there permanently  i was sure you had been very unwell you are better though  well since i came into avonmouth air said he i fear nothing but cold i am glad to have brought him with me since he could not stay there for it is very lonely for him  yet you said his daughter was settled close by  yes but that makes it the worse in fact ermine i did not know before what a wretched affair he had made of his daughters marriages isabel he married when she was almost a child to this comyn menteith very young too at the time and who has turned out a goodnatured reckless dissipated fellow who is making away with his property as fast as he can and to whom keiths advice is like water on a ducks back it is all rack and ruin and extravagance a set of illregulated children and isabel smiling and looking pretty in the midst of them and perfectly impervious to remonstrance he is better out of sight of them for it is only pain and vexation an example of the sort of match he likes to make mary the other daughter was the favourite and used to her own way and she took it keith was obliged to consent so as to prevent an absolute runaway wedding but he has by no means forgiven her husband and they are living on very small means on a government appointment in trinidad i believe it would be the bitterest pill to him that either soninlaw should come in for any part of the estate  i thought it was entailed  gowanbrae is but as things stand at present that ends with me and the other estates are at his disposal  then it would be very hard on the daughters not to have them  so hard that the death of young alexander may have been one of the greatest disasters of my life as well as of poor keiths however this is riding out to meet perplexities he is most likely to outlive me and moreover may marry and put an end to the difficulty meantime till my charge is relieved i must go and see after him and try if i can fulfil huberts polite request that i would take him away rosie my woman i have hardly spoken to you i have some hyacinth roots to bring you tomorrow  in spite of these suspicions colonel keith was not prepared for what met him on his return to myrtlewood on opening the drawingroom door he found lady temple in a low armchair in an agony of crying so that she did not hear his approach till he stood before her in consternation often had he comforted her before and now convinced that something dreadful must have befallen one of the children he hastily though tenderly entreated her to tell him which and what he could do  oh no no she exclaimed starting up and removing her handkerchief so that he saw her usually pale cheeks were crimsonoh no she cried with panting breath and heaving chest it is all well with them as yet butbutits your brother  he was at no loss now as to what his brother could have done but he stood confounded with a sense of personal share in the offence and his first words werei am very sorry i never thought of this  no indeed she exclaimed who could it was too preposterous to be dreamt of by any one at his age too one would have thought he might have known better  a secret sense of amusement crossed the colonel as he recollected that the disparity between fanny curtis and sir stephen temple had been far greater than that between lady temple and lord keith but the little gentle lady was just at present more like a fury than he had thought possible evidently regarding what had just passed as an insult to her husband and an attack on the freedom of all her sons in answer to a few sympathising words on the haste of his brothers proceeding she burst out again with indignation almost amusing in one so softhaste yes i did think that people would have had some respect for dear dear sir stephen and her gush of tears came with more of grief and less of violence as if she for the first time felt herself unprotected by her husbands name  i am very much concerned he repeated feeling sympathy safer than reasoning if i could have guessed his intentions i would have tried to spare you this at least the suddenness of it i could not have guessed at such presumptuous expectations on so short an acquaintance  he did not expect me to answer at once said fanny he said he only meant to let me know his hopes in coming here and oh thats the worst of it he wont believe me though i said more to him than i thought i could have said to anybody i told him said fanny with her hands clasped over her knee to still her trembling that i cared for my dear dear husband and always shallalwaysand then he talked about waiting just as if anybody could leave off loving ones husband and then when he wanted me to consider about my children why then i told himand her voice grew passionate againthe more i considered the worse it would be for him as if i would have my boys know me without their fathers name and besides he had not been so kind to you that i should wish to let him have anything to do with them i am afraid i ought not to have said that she added returning to something of her meek softness but indeed i was so angry i did not know what i was about i hope it will not make him angry with you  never mind me said colonel keith kindly indeed lady temple it is a wonderful compliment to you that he should have been ready to undertake such a family  i dont want such compliments and oh and here her eyes widened with fright what shall i do he only said my feelings did me honour and he would be patient and convince me oh colonel keith what shall i do and she looked almost afraid that fate and perseverance would master her after all and that she should be married against her will  you need do nothing but go on your own way and persist in your refusal he said in the calm voice that always reassured her  oh but pray pray never let him speak to me about it again  not if i can help it and i will do my best you are quite right lady temple i do not think it would be at all advisable for yourself or the children and hardly for himself he added smiling i think the mischief must all have been done by that game at whist  then ill never play again in my life i only thought he was an old man that wanted amusing then as one of the children peeped in at the window and was called backo dear how shall i ever look at conrade again now any one has thought i could forget his father  if conrade knew it which i trust he never will he ought to esteem it a testimony to his mother  oh no for it must have been my fault i always was so childish and when ive got my boys with me i cant help being happy and the tears swelled again in her eyes i know i have not been as sad and serious as my aunt thought i ought to be and now this comes of it  you have been true have acted nothing said colonel keith and that is best of all no one who really knew you could mistake your feelings no doubt that your conduct agrees better with what would please our dear sir stephen than if you drooped and depressed the children  oh i am glad you say that she said looking up flushed with pleasure now and her sweet eyes brimming over i have tried to think what he would like in all i have done and you know i cant help being proud and glad of belonging to him still and he always told me not to be shy and creeping into the nursery out of every ones way  the tears were so happy now that he felt that the wound was healed and that he might venture to leave her only asking first and now what would you like me to do shall i try to persuade my brother to come away from this place  oh but then every one would find out why and that would be dreadful besides you are only just come and miss williams  do not let that stand in your way  no no you will be here to take care of me and his going now would make people guess and that would be worse than anything  it would the less disturbance the better and if you upset his plans now he might plead a sort of right to renew the attempt later quiet indifference will be more dignified and discouraging indeed i little thought to what i was exposing you now i hope you are going to rest i am sure your head is aching terribly  she faintly smiled and let him give her his arm to the foot of the stairs  at first he was too indignant for any relief save walking up and down the esplanade endeavouring to digest the unfairness towards himself of his brothers silence upon views that would have put their joint residence at avonmouth on so different a footing above all when the temple family were his own peculiar charge and when he remembered how unsuspiciously he had answered all questions on the money matters and told how all was left in the widows own power it was the more irritating as he knew that his displeasure would be ascribed to interested motives and regarded somewhat as he had seen huberts resentment treated when francis teased his favourite rabbit yet not only on principle but to avoid a quarrel and to reserve to himself such influence as might best shield lady temple from further annoyance he must school himself to meet his brother with coolness and patience it was not however without strong effort that he was able to perceive that from the outer point of view one who when a mere child had become the wife of an aged general might in her early widowhood be supposed open to the addresses of a man of higher rank and fewer years and the more as it was not in her nature to look crushed and pathetic he who had known her intimately throughout her married life and in her sorrow was aware of the quiet force of the love that had grown up with her so entirely a thread in her being as to crave little expression and too reverent to be violent even in her grief the nature always gentle had recovered its balance and the difference in years had no doubt told in the readiness with which her spirits had recovered their cheerfulness though her heart remained unchanged still retired as her habits were and becoming as was her whole conduct colin began to see that there had been enough of liveliness about her to lead to lord keiths mistake though not to justify his want of delicacy in the precipitation of his suit  these reflections enabled him at length to encounter his brother with temper and to find that after all it had been more like the declaration of an intended siege than an actual summons to surrender lord keith was a less foolish and more courteous man than might have been gathered from poor fannys terrified account and all he had done was to intimate his intention of recommending himself to her and the view with which he had placed himself at avonmouth nor was he in the slightest degree disconcerted by her vehemence but rather entertained by it accepting her faithfulness to her first husbands memory as the best augury of her affection for a second he did not even own that he had been precipitate  let her get accustomed to the idea he said with a shrewd smile the very outcry she makes against it will be all in my favour when the turn comes  i doubt whether you will find it so  all the world does not live on romance like you man look on and you will see that a pretty young widow like her cannot fail to get into scrapes have offers made to her or at least the credit of them id lay you ten pounds that you are said to be engaged to her yourself by this time and it is no ones fault but your own that you are not it is in the very nature of things that she will be driven to shelter herself from the persecution with whoever has bided his time  oh if you prefer being accepted on such terms  he smiled as if the romance of the exclamation were beneath contempt and proceededa pretty gracious ladylike woman who has seen enough of the world to know how to take her place and yet will be content with a quiet home it is an introduction i thank you for colin  and pray said colin the more inwardly nettled because he knew that his elder brother enjoyed his annoyance what do you think of those seven slight encumbrances  oh they are your charge returned lord keith with a twinkle in his eye besides most of them are lads and what with school sea and india they will be easily disposed of  certainly it has been so in our family said colin rather hoarsely as he thought of the four goodly brothers who had once risen in steps between him and the master  and added lord keith still without direct answer she is so handsomely provided for that you see colin i could afford to give you up the auchinvar property that should have been poor archies and what with the farms and the moor it would bring you in towards three hundred a year for your housekeeping  colin restrained himself with difficulty but made quiet answer i had rather see it settled as a provision on mary and her children  lord keith growled something about minding his own concerns  that is all i desire responded the colonel and therewith the conference ended nor was the subject recurred to it was observable however that lord keith was polite and even attentive to ermine he called on her sent her grouse and though saying nothing seemed to wish to make it evident that his opposition was withdrawn perhaps as no longer considering his brothers affairs as his own or else wishing to conciliate him lady temple was not molested by any alarming attentions from him but for the proclamation the state of siege might have been unsuspected he settled himself at the southern gowanbrae as if he had no conquest to achieve but that of the rheumatism and fell rapidly into seaside habitshis morning stroll to see the fishingboats come in his afternoon ride and evenings dinner party or whistclub which latter institution disposed of him greatly to colins relief the brothers lived together very amicably and the younger often made himself helpful and useful to the elder but evidently did not feel bound to be exclusively devoted to his service and companionship all the winter residents and most of the neighbouring gentry quickly called at gowanbrae and lord keith in the leisure of his present life liked society where he was the man of most consequence and readily accepted and gave invitations colin whose chest would not permit him to venture out after sunset was a most courteous assistant host but necessarily made fewer acquaintances and often went his own way sometimes riding with his brother but more frequently scarcely seeing him between breakfast and twilight and then often spending a solitary evening which he much preferred either to ecarte or to making talk  the summer life had been very different from the winter one there was much less intercourse with the homestead partly from rachel being much engrossed with the f u e e driving over whenever the coachman would let her to inspect progress and spending much of her time in sending out circulars answering letters and writing a tale on the distresses of woman and how to help them entitled am i not a sister tales were not much in bachels line she despised reading them and did not love writing them but she knew that she must sugar the cup for the world and so she diligently applied herself to the piece de resistance for the destined magazine heavily weighting her slender thread of story with disquisitions on economy and charity and meaning to land her heroines upon various industrial asylums where their lot should be far more beatific than marriage which was reserved for the naughty one to live unhappy in ever after in fact rachel in her stern consistency had made up her mind to avoid and discourage the colonel and to prevent her own heart from relenting in his favour or him from having any opportunity of asking an explanation and with this determination she absented herself both from ermines parlour and lady temples croquet ground and if they met on the esplanade or in a morning call took care never to give the chance of a teteatete which he was evidently seeking  the croquet practice still survived in truth fanny was afraid to ride lest lord keith should join her and was glad to surround herself with companions she could not see the enemy without a nervous trepidation and was eager to engross herself with anybody or thing that came to hand so as to avoid the necessity of attending to him more than once did she linger among her boys to speak to mr touchett that she might avoid a ten minutes walk with his lordship and for nothing was she more grateful than for the quiet and ever ready tact with which bessie keith threw herself into the breach that bright damsel was claimed by lord keith as a kinswoman and accepting the relationship treated him with the pretty playfulness and coquetry that elderly men enjoy from lively young girls and thus often effected a diversion in her friends favour to the admiration both of the colonel and of lady temple herself all however by intuition for not a word had been hinted to her of what had passed during that game at croquet she certainly was a most winning creature the colonel was charmed with her conversation in its shades between archness and good sense and there was no one who did not look forward with dread to the end of her visit when after a short stay with one of her married cousins she must begin her residence with the blind uncle to whose establishment she in her humility declared she should be such a nuisance it was the stranger that she should think so as she had evidently served her apprenticeship to parish work at bishopsworthy she knew exactly how to talk to poor people and was not only at home in clerical details herself but infused them into lady temple so that to the extreme satisfaction of mr touchett the latter organized a treat for the schoolchildren offered prizes for needlework and once or twice even came to listen to the singing practice when anything memorable was going forward she was much pleased at being helped to do what she felt to be right and kind though hitherto she had hardly known how to set about it and had been puzzled and perplexed by rachels disapproval and semicontempt of scratching the surface by the commonplace sundayschool system     chapter xii a change at the parsonage    what could presumptuous hope inspirerokeby   there had been the usual foretaste of winter rather sharp for avonmouth and though a trifle to what it was in less sheltered places quite enough to make the heliotropes sorrowful strip the figtrees and shut colonel keith up in the library then came the rain and the result was that the lawn of myrtlewood became too sloppy for the most ardent devotees of croquet indeed as bessie said the great charm of the sport was that one could not play it above eight months in the year  the sun came back again and reasserted the claim of avonmouth to be a sort of english mentone but drying the lawn was past its power and conrade and francis were obliged to console themselves by the glory of taking bessie keith for a long ride they could not persuade their mother to go with them perhaps because she had from her nurserywindow sympathized with cyrils admiration of the great white horse that was being led round to the door of gowanbrae  she said she must stay at home and make the morning calls that the charms of croquet had led her to neglect and in about half an hour from that time she was announced in miss williams little parlour and entered with a hurried panting almost pursued look a frightened glance in her eyes and a flush on her cheek such as to startle both ermine and the colonel  oh she exclaimed as if still too much perturbed to know quite what she was saying ii did not mean to interrupt you  im only helping rose to change the water of her hyacinths said colonel keith withdrawing his eyes and attention to the accommodation of the forest of white roots within the purple glass  i did not know you were out today said lady temple recovering herself a little  yes i came to claim my walking companion wheres your hat rosie  and as the child who was already equipped all but the little brown hat stood by her aunt for the few last touches to the throat of her jacket he leant down and murmured i thought he was safe out riding  oh no no it is not that hastily answered lady temple a fresh suffusion of crimson colour rustling over her face and inspiring an amount of curiosity that rendered a considerable effort of attention necessary to be as supremely charming a companion as rose generally found him in the walks that he made it his business to take with her  he turned about long before rose thought they had gone far enough and when he reentered the parlour there was such an expectant look on his face that ermines bright eyes glittered with merry mischief when she sent rose to take off her walking dress well he said  well colin have you so low an opinion of the dignity of your charge as to expect her to pour out her secrets to the first ear in her way  oh if she has told you in confidence  no she has not told me in confidence she knew better  she has told you nothing  nothing and ermine indulged in a fit of laughter at his discomfiture so comical that he could not but laugh himself as he said ah the pleasure of disappointing me quite consoles you  no the proof of the discretion of womanhood does that you thought because she tells all her troubles to you that she must needs do so to the rest of the world  there is little difference between telling you and me  thats the fault of your discretion not of hers  i should like to know who has been annoying her i suspect  so do i and when you get the confidence at first hand you will receive it with a better grace than if you had had a contraband foretaste  he smiled i thought yours a more confidencewinning face ermine  that depends on my respect for the individual now i thought lady temple would much prefer my looking another way and talking about conrades latin grammar to my holding out my arms and inviting her to pour into my tender breast what another time she had rather not know that i knew  that is being an honourable woman he said and roses return ended the exchange of speculations but it must be confessed that at their next meeting ermines look of suppressed inquiry quite compensated for her previous banter more especially as neither had he any confidence to reveal or conceal only the tidings that the riders whose coalition had justified lady temples prudence had met mr touchett wandering in the lanes in the twilight apparently without a clear idea of what he was doing there and on the next evening there was quite an excitement the curate looked so ill and had broken quite down when he was practising with the choir boys before church he had indeed gone safely through the services but at school he had been entirely at a loss as to what sunday it was and had still more unfortunately forgotten that to be extra civil to miss villars was the only hope of retaining her services for he had walked by her with less attention than if she had been the meanest scholar nay when his most faithful curatolatress had offered to submit to him a design for an illumination for christmas he had escaped from her with a desperate and mysterious answer that he had nothing to do with illumination he hoped it would be as sombre as possible  no wonder avonmouth was astonished and that guesses were not confined to mackarel lane  well colin said ermine on the tuesday i have had a firsthand confidence though from a different quarter poor mr touchett came to announce his going away  going  yes in the very nick of time it seems alick keith has had a letter from his uncles curate asking him to see if he could meet with a southern clergyman to exchange duties for the winter with a london incumbent who has a delicate wife and of course mr touchett jumped at it  a very good thinga great relief  yes he said he was very anxious for work but he had lost ground in this place within the last few months and he thought that he should do better in a fresh place and that a fresh person would answer better here at least for a time i am very sorry for him i have a great regard for him  yes but he is quite right to make a fresh beginning poor man he has been quite lifted off his feet and entranced all this time and his recovery will be much easier elsewhere it was all that unlucky croquet  i believe it was i think there was at first a reverential sort of distant admiration too hopeless to do any one any harm and that really might have refined him and given him a little of the gentlemanlike tone he has always wanted but then came the croquet and when it grew to be a passion it was an excuse for intimacy that it would have taken a stronger head than his to resist  under the infection of croquet fever  it is what my father used to say of amusementsthe instant they become passions they grow unclerical and do mischief now he used though not getting on with the curtises to be most successful with the secondrate people but he has managed to offend half of them during this unhappy mania which of course they all resent as mercenary and how he is ever to win them back i dont know after all curatocult is a shallow motiverachel curtis might triumph  the higher style of clergyman does not govern by curatocult i hope this one may be of that description as he comes through mr clare i wonder if this poor man will return  perhaps said ermine with a shade of mimicry in her voice when lady temple is married to the colonel there now i have gone and told you i did try to resolve i would not  and what did you say  i thought it due to lady temple to tell him exactly how she regarded you  yes ermine and it is due to tell others also i cannot go on on these terms either here or at myrtlewood unless the true state of the case is known if you will not let me be a married man i must be an engaged one either to you or to the little banksia  this periphrasis was needful because rose was curled up in a corner with a book and her accessibility to outward impressions was dubious it might be partly for that reason partly from the tone of fixed resolve in his voice that ermine made answer as you please  it was calmly said with the sweet grave confiding smile that told how she trusted to his judgment and accepted his will the look and tone brought his hand at once to press hers in eager gratitude but still she would not pursue this branch of the subject she looked up to him and said gently but firmly yes it may be better that the true state of the case should be known and he felt that she thus conveyed that he must not press her further so he let her continue at first i thought it would do him good he began pitying us so vehemently but when he found i did not pity myself he was as ready to forget our troubles asyou are to forget his she added catching colins fixed eye more intent on herself than on her narrative  i beg his pardon but there are things that come more home  so thought he said ermine  did you find out said colin now quite recalled what made him take courage  when he had once come to the subject it seemed to be a relief to tell it all out but he was so faltering and agitated that i did not always follow what he said i gather though that lady temple has used him a little as a defence from other perils  yes i have seen that  and miss keiths fun has been more encouragement than she knew constantly summoning him to the croquetground and giving him to understand that lady temple liked to have him there then came that unlucky day it seems when he found bessie mounting her horse at the door and she called out that it was too wet for croquet but lady temple was in the garden and would be glad to see him she was going to make visits and he walked down with her and somehow in regretting the end of the croquet season he was surprised into saying how much it had been to him he says she was exceedingly kind and regretted extremely that anything should have inspired the hope said she should never marry again and entreated him to forget it then i imagine she fled in here to put an end to it  she must have been much more gentle this time than she was with keith i had never conceived her capable of being so furious as she was then i am very sorry i wish we could spare her these things  i am afraid that can only be done in one way which you are not likely at present to take said ermine with a serious mouth but with light dancing in her eyes  i know no one less likely to marry again he continued yet no one of whom the world is so unlikely to believe it her very gentle simplicity and tenderness tell against her well the only hope now is that the poor man has not made his disappointment conspicuous enough for her to know that it is attributed to her it is the beginning of the fulfilment of keiths prediction that offers and reports will harass her into the deed  there is nothing so fallacious as prophecies against second marriages but i dont believe they will she is too quietly dignified for the full brunt of reports to reach her and too much concentrated on her children to care about them  well i have to see her tomorrow to make her sign some papers about her pension so i shall perhaps find out how she takes it  he found fanny quite her gentle composed self as usual uncomprehending and helpless about her business affairs and throwing the whole burthen on him of deciding on her investments but in such a gracious dependent grateful way that he could not but take pleasure in the office and had no heart for the lesson he had been meditating on the need of learning to act for herself if she wished to do without a protector it was not till she had obediently written her frances grace temple wherever her prime minister directed that she said with a crimson blush is it true that poor mr touchett is going away for the winter  i believe he is even going before sunday  i am very gladi mean i am very sorry do you think any one knows why it is  very few are intimate enough to guess and those who are know you too well to think it was otherwise than very foolish on his part  i dont know said fanny i think i must have been foolish too or he never could have thought of it and i was so sorry for him he seemed so much distressed  i do not wonder at that when he had once allowed himself to admit the thought  yes that is the thing i am afraid i cant be what i ought to be or people would never think of such nonsense said fanny with large tears welling into her eyes i cant be guarding that dear memory as i ought to have two such things happening so soon  perhaps they have made you cherish it all the more  as if i wanted that please will you tell me how i could have been more guarded i dont mind your knowing about this indeed you ought for sir stephen trusted me to you but i cant ask my aunt or any one else i cant talk about it and i would not have them know that sir stephens wife cant get his memory more respected  she did not speak with anger as the first time but with most touching sadness  i dont think any one could answer he said  i did take my aunts advice about the officers being here i have not had them nearly as much as bessie would have liked not even alick i have been sorry it was so dull for her but i thought it could not be wrong to be intimate with ones clergyman and rachel was always so hard upon him  you did nothing but what was kind and right the only possible thing that could have been wished otherwise was the making a regular habit of his playing croquet here  ah but the boys and bessie liked it so much however i dare say it was wrong alick never did like it  not wrong only a little overdone you ladies want sometimes to be put in mind that because a clergyman has to manage his own time he is not a whit more really at liberty than a soldier or a lawyer whose hours are fixed for him you do not do him or his parish any kindness by engrossing him constantly in pastimes that are all very well once in a way but which he cannot make habitual without detriment to his higher duties  but i thought he would have known when he had time  i am afraid curates are but bits of human nature after all  and what ought i to have done  if you had been an exceedingly prudent woman who knew the world you would have done just as you did about the officers been friendly and fairly intimate but instead of ratifying the daily appointments for croquet have given a special invitation now and then and so shown that you did not expect him without one  i see oh if i had only thought in time i need not have driven him away from his parish i hope he wont go on being unhappy long oh i wish there may be some very nice young lady where he is going if he only would come back married  we would give him a vote of thanks  what a wedding present i would make her proceeded fanny brightening perceptibly i would give her my best indian table only i always meant that for ermine i think she must have the emus egg set in australian gold  if she were to be induced by the bribe said colonel keith laughing i think ermine would be sufficiently provided for by the emus egg do you know he added after a pause i think i have made a great step in that direction  she clasped her hands with delighted sympathy she has given me leave to mention the matter he continued and i take that as a sign that her resistance will give way  oh i am very glad said fanny i have so wished them to know at the homestead and her deepened colour revealed against her will that she had not been insensible to the awkwardness of the secrecy  i should rather like to tell your cousin rachel myself said the colonel she has always been very kind to ermine and appreciated her more than i should have expected but she is not easily to be seen now  her whole heart is in her orphan asylum said fanny i hope you will soon go with us and see it the little girls look so nice  the brightening of his prospects seemed to have quite consoled her for her own perplexities  that avonmouth should have no suspicion of the cause of the sudden change of pastor could hardly be hoped but at least lady temple did not know how much talk was expended upon her how quietly lord keith hugged himself how many comical stories bessie detailed in her letters to her clare cousins nor how mrs curtis resented the presumption and while she shrank from a lecture more especially as she did not see how dear fanny was to blame flattered herself and grace that for the future colonel keith and rachel would take better care of her  rachel did not dwell much on the subject it was only the climax of conceit croquet and mere womanhood and she was chiefly anxious to know whether mr mitchell the temporary clergyman would support the f u e e and be liberal enough to tolerate mr mauleverer she had great hopes from a london incumbent and besides bessie keith knew him and spoke of him as a very sensible agreeable earnest man  earnest enough for you rachel she said laughing  is he a party man  oh parties are getting obsolete he works too hard for fighting battles outside  the sunday showed a spare vigorous face and a voice and pronunciation far more refined than poor mr touchetts also the sermons were far more interesting and even rachel granted that there were ideas in it the change was effected with unusual celerity for it was as needful to mrs mitchell to be speedily established in a warm climate as it was desirable to mr touchett to throw himself into other scenes and the little parsonage soon had the unusual ornaments of tiny children with small spades and wheelbarrows  the father and mother were evidently very shy people with a great deal beneath their timidity and were much delighted to have an old acquaintance like miss keith to help them through their introductions an office which she managed with all her usual bright tact the discovery that stephana temple and lucy mitchell had been born within two days of one another was the first link of a warm friendship between the two mammas and mr mitchell fell at once into friendly intercourse with ermine williams to whom bessie herself conducted him for his first visit when they at once discovered all manner of mutual acquaintance among his college friends and his next step was to make the very arrangement for ermines churchgoing for which she had long been wishing in secret but which never having occurred to poor mr touchett she had not dared to propose lest there should be some great inconvenience in the way  colonel keith was the person however with whom the new comers chiefly fraternized and he was amused with their sense of the space for breathing compared with the lanes and alleys of their own district the schools and cottages seemed to them so wonderfully large the children so clean even their fishiness a form of poetical purity the people ridiculously well off and even mrs kellands laceschool a palace of the free maids that weave their thread with bones mr mitchell seemed almost to grudge the elbow room as he talked of the number of cubic feet that held a dozen of his own parishioners and needful as the change had been for the health of both husband and wife they almost reproached themselves for having fled and left so many pining for want of pure air dwelling upon impossible castles for the importation of favourite patients to enjoy the balmy breezes of avonmouth  rachel talked to them about the f u e e and was delighted by the flush of eager interest on mrs mitchells thin face objects swarmed in their parish but where were the seven shillings per week to come from at any rate mr mitchell would the first leisure day come over to st herberts with her and inspect he did not fly off at the first hint of mr mauleverers opinions but said he would talk to him and thereby rose steps untold in rachels estimation the fact of change is dangerously pleasant to the human mind mr mitchell walked at once into popularity and lady temple had almost conferred a public benefit by what she so little liked to remember at any rate she had secured an unexceptionable companion and many a time resorted to his wing leaving bessie to amuse lord keith who seemed to be reduced to carry on his courtship to the widow by attentions to her guest     chapter xiii the fox and the crow     she just gave one squall   when the cheese she let fall   and the fox ran away with his prize                                jane taylor   my dear said mrs curtis one monday morning i offered colonel keith a seat in the carriage to go to the annual bookclub meeting with us mr spicer is going to propose him as a member of the club you know and i thought the close carriage would be better for him i suppose you will be ready by eleven we ought to set out by that time not to hurry the horses  i am not going returned rachel an announcement that electrified her auditors for the family quota of books being quite insufficient for her insatiable appetite she was a subscriber on her own account and besides this was the grand annual gathering for disposing of old books when she was relied on for purchasing all the nuts that nobody else would crack the whole affair was one of the few social gatherings that she really tolerated and enjoyed and her mother gazed at her in amazement  i wrote to mrs spicer a month ago to take my name off i have no superfluous money to spend on my selfish amusement  but rachel said grace did you not particularly wantoh that fat red book which came to us uncut  i did but i must do without it  poor mr spicer he reckoned on you to take it indeed he thought you had promised him  if there is anything like a promise i suppose it must be done but i do not believe there is i trust to you grace you know i have nothing to waste  you had better go yourself my dear and then you would be able to judge it would be more civil by the society too  no matter indeed i cannot in fact mr mauleverer is coming this morning to give his report and arrange our building plans i want to introduce him to mr mitchell and fix a day for going over  mrs curtis gave up in despair and consulted her eldest daughter in private whether there could have been any misunderstanding with colonel keith to lead rachel to avoid him in a manner that was becoming pointed grace deemed it nothing but absorption into the f u e e and poor mrs curtis sighed over this fleeting away of her sole chance of seeing rachel like other people of mr mauleverer personally she had no fears he was in her eyes like a drawing or musicmaster and had never pretended to be on equal terms in society with her daughters and she had no doubts or scruples in leaving rachel to her business interview with him though she much regretted this further lapse from the ordinary paths of sociability  rachel on the other hand felt calmly magnanimous in the completion of a veritable sacrifice for those books had afforded her much enjoyment and she would much like to have possessed many of those that would be tossed aside at a cheap rate but the constant small expenses entailed by the first setting on foot such an establishment as the f u e e were a heavy drain on her private purse as she insisted on all accounts being brought to her and then could not bear that these small nondescript matters should be charged upon the general fund which having already paid the first halfyears rent in advance and furnished the house must be recruited by some extraordinary supply before she could build the thing could not be done at all but by rigid economy and she was ready to exercise it and happy in so doing and the colonel she thought the pain of her resolution was passing after all it was not so dreadful as people would have one believe it was no such wrench as novels described to make up ones mind to prefer a systematically useful life to an agreeable man  mr mauleverer came with a good report of the childrens progress and talking quite enthusiastically of lovedys sweetness and intelligence perhaps she would turn out a superior artist now that chill penury no longer repressed her noble rage and he further brought a small demand for drawing materials and blocks for engraving to the amount of five pounds which rachel defrayed from the general fund but sighed over its diminution  if i could only make the barnaby bargain available she said it is cruel to have it tied up to mere apprenticeships which in the present state of things are absolutely useless or worse  can nothing be done  you shall hear dame rachel curtis in 1605 just when this place was taking up lacemaking an art learnt i believe from some poor nuns that were turned out of st marys at avoncester thought she did an immense benefit to the place by buying the bit of land known as burnabys bargain and making the rents go yearly to apprentice two poor girls born of honest parents the rent is fourteen pounds and so the fees are so small that only the small lacemakers here will accept them i cannot get the girls apprenticed to anything better in the towns except for a much larger premium  do i understand you that such a premium is at present to be bestowed  no not till next june the two victims for this year have been sacrificed but perhaps another time it might be possible to bind them to you as a wood engraver or printer cried rachel joyfully  i should be most happy but who would be the persons concerned  the trustees are the representative of our family and the rector of the parishnot mr touchett this is only a district but poor old mr linton at avonbridge who is barely able to sign the papers so that practically it all comes to me  extremely fortunate for the objects of the charity  i wish it were so but if it could only be made available in such a cause as ours i am sure my good namesakes intentions would be much better carried out than by binding these poor girls down to their cushions i did once ask about it but i was told it could only be altered by act of parliament  great facilities have of late been given said mr mauleverer many old endowments have most beneficially extended their scope may i ask where the land in question is  it is the level bit of meadow just by the river and all the slope down to the mouth it has always been in our hands and paid rent as part of the farm you know how well it looks from the gardenseat but it always grieves me when people admire it for i feel as if it were thrown away  ah i understand perhaps if i could see the papers i could judge of the feasibility of some change  rachel gladly assented and knowing where to find the keys of the strong box she returned in a short space with a parcel tied up with red tape and labelled barnabys bargain  i have been thinking she exclaimed as she came in that that piece of land must have grown much more valuable since this rent was set on it fourteen pounds a year why we never thought of it but surely in such a situation it would be worth very much more for building purposes  there can be no doubt but your approach miss curtis  if it is a matter of justice to the charity of course that could not be weighed a moment but we must consider what is to be done get the land valued and pay rent for it accordingly i would give it up to its fate and let it for what it would bring but it would break my mothers heart to see it built on  perhaps i had better take the papers and look over them i see they will need much consideration  very well that will be the best way but we will say nothing about it till we have come to some conclusion or we shall only startle and distress my mother after all then i do believe we have the real income of the f u e e within our very hands it might be ten times what it is now  rachel was in higher spirits than ever to oblige the estate to pay £140 a year to the f u e e was beyond measure delightful and though it would be in fact only taking out of the family pocket yet that was a pocket she could not otherwise get at the only thing for which she was sorry was that mr mauleverer had an appointment and could not come with her to call on mr mitchell but instead of this introduction as she had sworn herself to secrecy rather than worry her mother till the ways and means were matured she resolved by way of compensation upon going down to impart to ermine williams this grave reformation of abuses since this was an afternoon when there was no chance of meeting the colonel  very happy did she feel in the hope that had come to crown her efforts at the very moment when she had actually and tangibly given up a pleasure and closed a door opening into worldly life and she was walking along with a sense of almost consecrated usefulness to seek her companion in the path of maiden devotion when in passing the gates of myrtlewood she was greeted by captain keith and his brighteyed sister just coming forth together  a few words told that they were all bound for mackarel lane actuated by the same probability of finding miss williams alone the colonel being absent  wonderfully kind to her he is said rachel glad to praise him to convince herself that she did not feel bitter he takes that little girl out walking with him every morning  i wonder if his constancy will ever be rewarded said bessie lightly then as rachel looked at her in wonder and almost rebuke for so direct and impertinent a jest she exclaimed surely you are not in ignorance what have i done i thought all the world knewall the inner world that is that revels in a secret  knew what said rachel unavoidable intolerable colour rushing into her face  why the romance of colin and ermine to live on the verge of such aa tragicomedy is it and not be aware of it i do pity you  the only wonder is how you knew it said her brother in a tone of repression  i oh it is a fine thing to be a longeared little pitcher when ones elders imagine one hears nothing but what is addressed to oneself there i sat supposed to be at my lessons when the english letters came in and i heard papa communicating to mamma how he had a letter from old lord keithnot this one but one older stillthe father of himabout his sons exchangewanted papa to know that he was exemplary and all that and hoped he would be kind to him but just insinuated that leave was not desirablein fact it was to break off an affair at home and then while i was all on fire to see what a lover looked like comes another letter this time to mamma from lady alison something who could not help recommending to her kindness her dear nephew colin going out brokenhearted at what was feared would prove a fatal accident to the dearest noblest girl in the world for so she must call ermine williams ermine was a name to stick in ones memory if williams was not and so i assumed sufficient certainty to draw it all out of dear lady temple  she knows then said rachel breathlessly but on her guard  know yes or she could hardly make such a brother of the colonel in fact i think it is a bit of treachery to us all to keep such an affair concealed dont you with a vivid flash out of the corner of her eyes  treachery not to post up a list of all ones  ones conquests said bessie snatching the word out of her brothers mouth did you ever hear a more ingenious intimation of the number one has to boast  only in character calmly returned alick  but do not laugh said rachel who had by this time collected herself if this is so it must be far too sad and melancholy to be laughed about  so it is said alick with a tone of feeling it has been a mournful business from the first and i do not see how it is to end  why i suppose colonel colin is his own master now said bessie and if he has no objection i do not see who else can make any  there are people in the world who are what tennyson calls selfless returned alick  then the objection comes from her said rachel anxiously  so saith lady temple returned bessie  they were by this time in mackarel lane rachel would have given much to have been able to turn back and look this strange news in the face but consciousness and fear of the construction that might be put on her change of purpose forced her on and in a few moments the three were in the little parlour where ermines station was now by the fire there could be no doubt as rachel owned to herself instantly that there was a change since she first had studied that face the bright colouring and far more the active intellect and lively spirit had always obviated any expression of pining or invalidism but to the air of cheerfulness was added a look of freshened health and thorough happiness that rendered the always striking features absolutely beautiful more so perhaps than in their earliest bloom and the hair and dress though always neat and still as simply arranged as possible had an indescribable air of care and taste that added to the effect of grace and pleasantness and made rachel feel convinced in a moment that the wonder would have been not in constancy to such a creature but in inconstancy the notion that any one could turn from that brilliant beaming refined face to her own struck her with a sudden humiliation there was plenty of conversation and her voice was not immediately wanted indeed she hardly attended to what was passing and really dreaded outstaying the brother and sister when ermine turned to her and asked after lovedy kelland in her new home she replied like one in a dream then gathered herself up and answered to the point but feeling the restraint intolerable soon rose to take leave  so soon said ermine i have not seen you for a long time  ii was afraid of being in the way said rachel the first time probably that such a fear had ever suggested itself to her and blushing as ermine did not blush  we are sure to be alone after twilight said ermine if that is not too late for you but i know you are much occupied now  somehow that invalid in her chair had the dignity of a queen appointing her levee and rachel followed the impulse of thanking and promising but then quickly made her escape to her own thoughts  her whole soul is in that asylum said ermine smiling as she went i should like to hear that it is going on satisfactorily but she does not seem to have time even to talk  the most wonderful consummation of all observed bessie  no said ermine the previous talk was not chatter but real effervescence from the unsatisfied craving for something to do  and has she anything to do now said bessie  that is exactly what i want to know it would be a great pity if all this real selfdevotion were thrown away  it cannot be thrown away said alick  not on herself said ermine but one would not see it misdirected both for the waste of good energy and the bitter disappointment  well said bessie i cant bear people to be so dreadfully in earnest  you are accountable for the introduction are not you said ermine  im quite willing i think a good downfall plump would be the most wholesome thing that could happen to her and besides i never told her to take the man for her almoner and counsellor i may have pointed to the gulf but i never bade curtia leap into it  i wish there were any one to make inquiries about this person said ermine but when colonel keith came it was too late i hoped she might consult him but she has been so much absorbed that she really has never come in his way  she would never consult any one said bessie  i am not sure of that replied ermine i think that her real simplicity is what makes her appear so opinionated i verily believe that there is a great capability of humility at the bottom  of the gulf laughed bessie but her brother said quite true she has always been told she is the clever woman of the family and what can she do but accept the position  exactly said ermine every one has given way to her and of course she walks over their bodies but there is something so noble about her that i cannot but believe that she will one day shake herself clear of her little absurdities  that is contrary to the usual destiny of strongminded women said bessie  she is not a strongminded woman she only has been made to believe herself one said ermine warmly  with this last encounter bessie and her brother took leave and the last at once exclaimed in sentimental tones generous rivals i never saw so good a comedy in all my days to disclose the fatal truth and then bring the rival fair ones face to face  if that were your belief bessie the demon of teasing has fuller possession of you than i knew  ah i forgot exclaimed bessie it is tender ground with you likewise alas alick sisterly affection cannot blind me to the fact of that unrequited admiration for your honourable rival  what from the strongminded curtia  ah but have we not just heard that this is not the genuine article only a countrymade imitation no wonder it was not proof against an honourable colonel in a brown beard  so much the better only unluckily there has been a marked avoidance of him  yes the colonel was sacrificed with all other trivial incidents at the shrine of the f u l ee e i mean and only think of finding out that one has been sacrificing empty air after alland to empty air  better than to sacrifice everything to oneself said alick  not at all the latter practice is the only way to be agreeable bythebye alick i wonder if she will deign to come to the ball  what ball  your ball at avoncester it is what i am staying on for major mcdonald all but promised me one and you know you must give one before you leave this place  dont you know that poor fraser has just been sent for home on his sisters death  but i conclude the whole regiment does not go into mourning  no but fraser is the one fellow to whom this would be real enjoyment indeed i particularly wish no hints may be given about it dont deny i know you have ways of bringing about what you wish and i will not have them used here i know something of the kind must be done before we leave avoncester but to give one this autumn would be much sooner than needful i believe there is hardly an officer but myself and fraser to whom the expense would not be a serious consideration and when i tell you my father had strong opinions about overdoing reciprocities of gaiety and drawing heavily on the officers purses for them i do not think you will allow their regard for him to take that manifestation towards you  of course not said bessie warmly i will not think of it again only when the fate does overtake you you will have me here for it alick  he readily promised feeling gratified at the effect of having spoken to his sister with full recognition of her good sense  meantime rachel was feeling something of what bessie ascribed to her as if her sacrifice had been snatched away and a cloud placed in its stead mortification was certainly present and a pained feeling of having been made a fool of whether by the colonel or herself her candid mind could hardly decide but she was afraid it was by herself she knew she had never felt sure enough of his attentions to do more than speculate on what she would do if they should become more pointed and yet she felt angry and sore at having been exposed to so absurd a blunder by the silence of the parties concerned after all she said to herself there can be no great harm done i have not been weak enough to commit my heart to the error i am unscathed and i will show it by sympathy for ermine onlyonly why could not she have told me  an ordeal was coming for which rachel was thus in some degree prepared on the return of the party from the book club mrs curtis came into rachels sittingroom and hung lingering over the fire as if she had something to say but did not know how to begin at last however she said i do really think it is very unfair but it was not his fault he says  who said rachel dreamily  why colonel keith my dear said good mrs curtis conceiving that her pronominal speech had broken her intelligence it seems we were mistaken in him all this time  what about miss williams said rachel perceiving how the land lay how did you hear it  you knew it my dear child cried her mother in accents of extreme relief  only this afternoon from bessie keith  and fanny knew it all this time continued mrs curtis i cannot imagine how she could keep it from me but it seems miss williams was resolved it should not be known colonel keith said he felt it was wrong to go on longer without mentioning it and i could not but say that it would have been a great relief to have known it earlier  as far as fanny was concerned it would said rachel looking into the fire but not without a sense of rehabilitating satisfaction as the wistful looks and tone of her mother convinced her that this semidelusion had not been confined to herself  i could not help being extremely sorry for him when he was telling me continued mrs curtis as much resolved against uttering the idea as rachel herself could be it has been such a very long attachment and now he says he has not yet been able to overcome her scruples about accepting him in her state it is quite right of her i cant say but it is but it is a very awkward situation  i do not see that said rachel feeling the need of decision in order to reassure her mother it is very sad and distressing in some ways but no one can look at miss williams without seeing that his return has done her a great deal of good and whether they marry or not one can only be full of admiration and respect for them  yes yes faltered mrs curtis only i must say i think it was due to us to have mentioned it sooner  not at all mother fanny knew it and it was nobodys concern but hers pray am i to have owens palaeontology  no colonel keith bought that and some more of the solid books my dear he is going to settle here he tells me he has actually bought that house he and his brother are in  bought it  yes he says any way his object is to be near miss williams well i cannot think how it is to end so near the title as he is and her sister a governess and then that dreadful business about her brother and the little girl upon her hands dear me i wish fanny had any one else for a governess  so do not i said rachel i have the greatest possible admiration for ermine williams and i do not know which i esteem most her for her brave cheerful unrepining unselfishness or him for his constancy and superiority to all those trumpery considerations i am glad to have the watching of them i honour them both  yes and rachel honoured herself still more for being able to speak all this freely and truly out of the innermost depths of her candid heart     chapter xiv the gowanbrae ball                  your honours pardon  id rather have my wounds to heal again  than hear say how i got themcoriolanus   yes i go the week after next  so soon i thought you were to stay for our ball  till this time next year no no i cant quite do that thank you  this very winter  oh nono such thing why half the beauty and fashion of the neighbourhood is not come into winter quarters yet besides the very essence of a military ball is that it should be a partingthe brightest and the last good morning  and megs head nothing loth was turned away from the wide view of the broad vale of the avon with the avoncester cathedral towers in the midst and the moors rising beyond in purple distance the two young lieutenants could only wave their farewells as bessie cantered merrily over the soft smooth turf of the racecourse in company with lord keith the colonel and conrade  do you not like dancing inquired lord keith when the canter was over and they were splashing through a lane with high hedges  im not so unnatural returned bessie with a merry smile but it would never do to let the highlanders give one now alick has been telling me that the expense would fall seriously on a good many of them  true said colonel keith too many fetes come to be a heavy tax  that is more consideration than is common in so young a lad added lord keith  yes but dear alick is so full of consideration said the sister eagerly he does not get half the credit for it that he deserves because you know he is so quiet and reserved and has that unlucky ironical way with him that people dont like especially rattlepates like those pointing with her whip in the direction of the two young officers  it is a pity said the colonel it lessens his influence and it is strange i never perceived it before his return to england  oh theres much owing to the habitual languor of that long illness that satirical mumble is the only trouble he will take to lift up his testimony except when a thing is most decidedly his duty and then he does it as england expects  and he considered it his duty to make you decline this ball said lord keith  oh not his more than mine said bessie i dont forget that i am the colonels daughter  no more was said on that occasion but three days after cards were going about the county with invitations from lord keith to an evening party with dancing lord keith averred with the full concurrence of his brother that he owed many civilities to the ladies of the neighbourhood and it was a good time to return them when he could gratify the young kinswoman who had showed such generous forbearance about the regimental ball it was no unfavourable moment either when he had his brother to help him for the ordering of balls had been so much a part of colins staff duties that it came quite naturally to him especially with coombe within reach to assist there was some question whether the place should be the public rooms or gowanbrae but bessies vote decided on the latter in consideration of the colonels chest she was rather shocked while very grateful at the consequences of the little conversation on the hill top but she threw herself into all the counsels with bright ardent pleasure though carefully refraining from any presumption that she was queen of the evening  lady temple received an invitation but never for one moment thought of going or even supposed that any one could imagine she could indeed if she had accepted it it would have been a decisive encouragement to her ancient suitor and colin saw that he regarded her refusal in its broad black edges as a further clenching of the reply to his addresses  bessie was to be chaperoned by mrs curtis as to rachel she had resolved against youthful gaieties for this winter and all others but she felt that to show any reluctance to accept the keith invitation might be a contradiction to her indifference to the colonel and so construed by her mother grace and bessie so all she held out for was that as she had no money to spend upon adornments her blue silk dinner dress and her birthday wreath should and must do duty and as to her mothers giving her finery she was far too impressive and decided for mrs curtis to venture upon such presumption she was willing to walk through her part for an evening and indeed the county was pretty well accustomed to miss rachel curtiss ballroom ways and took them as a matter of course  gowanbrae had two drawingrooms with folding doors between quite practicable for dancing and the further one ending in a conservatory that likewise extended along the end of the entrance hall and diningroom the small library where colonel keith usually sat became the cloakroom and contained when mrs curtis and her daughters arrived so large a number of bright cashmere cloaklets scarlet white and blue that they began to sigh prospectively at the crowd which mrs curtis would have encountered with such joyful valour save for that confidence on the way home from the book club  they were little prepared for the resources of a practised staffofficer never had a ball even to them looked so well arranged or in such thorough style as a little dexterous arrangement of flowers lights and sofas and rendered those two rooms the two hosts worked extremely well lord keith had shaken off much of his careless stoop and air of age and there was something in his oldworld polish and his scotch accent that gave a sort of romance to the manner of his reception his brother with his fine brow and thoughtful eyes certainly appeared to rachel rather thrown away as master of the ceremonies but whatever he did he always did in the quietest and best way and receptions had been a part of his vocation so that he infused a wonderful sense of ease and supplied a certain oil of good breeding that made everything move suavely young ladies in white and mothers in all the colours of the rainbow were there in plenty and by bessies special command the scene was enlivened by the highland uniform with the graceful tartan scarf fastened across the shoulder with the bruce brooch  rachel had not been long in the room before she was seized on by emily grey an enthusiastic young lady of the st norberts neighbourhood whom she met seldom but was supposed to know intimately  and they say you have the hero herethe victoria cross manand that you know him you must show him to me and get me introduced  there is no victoria cross man here said rachel coldly colonel keith did not have one  oh no i dont mean colonel keith but captain alexander keith quite a young man oh i am sure you remember the storyyou were quite wild about itof his carrying the lighted shell out of the hospital tent and they told me he was always over here and his sister staying with lady temple  i know captain alexander keith said rachel slowly but you must be mistaken i am certain i should know if he had a victoria cross  it is very odd charlie told me it was the same said miss grey who like all others was forced to bend to rachels decisive manner  scottish names are very common said rachel and at that moment a partner came and carried emily off  but as rachel stood still an odd misgiving seized her a certain doubt whether upon the tall lazy figure that was leaning against a wall nearly opposite to her talking to another officer she did not see something suspiciously bronze and eightpointed that all did not wear there was clearly a medal though with fewer clasps than some owned but what else was there she thought of the lecture on heroism she had given to him and felt hot all over behold he was skirting the line of chaperons and making his way towards their party the thing grew more visible and she felt more disconcerted than ever had been her lot before but escape there was none here he was shaking hands  you dont polk he said to her in fact you regard all this as a delusion of weak minds then will you come and have some tea  rachel took his arm still bewildered and when standing before him with the teacup in her hand she interrupted something he was saying she knew not what with that is not the victoria cross  then it is like all the rest a delusion he answered in his usual impassive manner  and gained she continued by saving the lives of all those officers the very thing i told you about  you told me that man was killed  then it was not you  perhaps they picked up the pieces of the wrong one  but if you would only tell me how you gained it  by the pursuit of conchology  then it was yourself again said rachel in her confusion  if i be i as i suppose i be he replied giving her his arm again and as they turned towards the conservatory adding many such things have happened and i did not know whether you meant this  that was the reason you made so light of it  what because i thought it was somebody else  no the contrary reason but i cannot understand why you let me go on without telling me  i never interfere when a story is so perfect in itself  but is my story perfect in itself said rachel or is it the contrary  no one knows less of the particulars than i do he answered i think your version was that it was an hospital tent that the shell came into it was not that but a bungalow which was supposed to be out of range it stood on a bit of a slope and i thought i should have been able to kick the shell down before it had time to do mischief  but you picked it up and took it to the doori mean did you said rachel who was beginning to discover that she must ask alick keith a direct question if she wished to get an answer and she received a gesture of assent  i was very blind she said humbly and now i have gone and insisted to poor emily grey that you never did any such thing  thank you he said it was the greatest kindness you could do me  ah your sister said you had the greatest dislike to hero worship  a natural sense of humbug he said i dont know why they gave me this he added touching his cross unless it was that one of the party in the bungalow had a turn for glorifying whatever happened to himself plenty of more really gallant things happened every day and were never heard of and i who absolutely saw next to nothing of the campaign have little right to be decorated  ah said rachel thoughtfully i have always wondered whether one would be happier for having accomplished an act of heroism  i do not know said alick thoughtfully then as rachel looked up with a smile of amazement oh you mean this but it was mere selfpreservation i could hardly even have bolted for i was laid up with fever and was very shaky on my legs  i suppose however said rachel that the vision of ones life in entering the army would be to win that sort of distinction and so young  win it as some have done said alick and deserve what is far better worth than distinction that may be the dream but after all it is the discipline and constant duty that make the soldier and are far more really valuable than exceptional doings  people must always be ready for them though said rachel  and they are said alick with grave exultation in his tone  then after a pause she led back the conversation to its personal character by saying do you mean that the reception of this cross was no gratification to you  no i am not so absurd he replied but he added sadly that was damped quite otherwise the news that i was named for it came almost in the same breath with that of my fathers death and he had not heard i was to receive it  ah i can understand  and you can see how intolerable was the fuss my good relations made with me just when the loss was fresh on me and with that of my two chief friends among my brother officers fellows beside whom i was nobody and there was my uncles blindness getting confirmed was not that enough to sicken one with being stuck up for a lion and constantly poked up by the showwoman under pretext of keeping up ones spirits  and you werei mean were youtoo ill to escape  i was less able to help myself than miss williams is there had been a general smash of all the locomotive machinery on this side and the wretched monster could do nothing but growl at his visitors  should you growl very much if i introduced you to emily grey you see it is a matter of justice and truth to tell her now after having contradicted her so flatly i will wait to let you get out of the way first if you like but i think that would be unkind to her and if you ever do dance i wish you would dance with her  with all my heart he answered  oh thank you said rachel warmly  he observed with some amusement rachels utter absence of small dexterities and of even the effort to avoid the humiliation of a confession of her error miss grey and a boy partner had wandered into the conservatory and were rather dismally trying to seem occupied with the camellias when rachel made her way to them and though he could not actually hear the words he knew pretty well what they were emily you were right after all and i was mistaken and then as he drew near miss grey captain keith wishes to be introduced to you  it had been a great shock to rachels infallibility and as she slowly began working her way in search of her mother after observing the felicity of emilys bright eyes she fell into a musing on the advantages of early youth in its indiscriminating powers of enthusiasm for anything distinguished for anything and that sense of selfexaltation in any sort of contact with a person who had been publicly spoken of there is genuine heroism in him thought rachel but it is just in what emily would never appreciateit is in the feeling that he could not help doing as he did the halfgrudging his reward to himself because other deeds have passed unspoken i wonder whether his ironical humour would allow him to see that mr mauleverer is as veritable a hero in yielding hopes of consideration prospects honours to his sense of truth and uprightness if he would only look with an unprejudiced eye i know he would be candid  are you looking for mrs curtis said colonel keith i think she is in the other room  not particularly thank you said rachel and she was surprised to find how glad she was to look up freely at him  would it be contrary to your principles or practice to dance with me  to my practice she said smilingly so let us find my mother is miss alison williams here i never heard whether it was settled that she should come she added resolved both to show him her knowledge of his situation and to let her mother see her at her ease with him  no she was obstinate though her sister and i did our utmost to persuade her and the boys were crazy to make her go  i cant understand your wishing it  not as an experience of life alison never went to anything in her girlhood but devoted herself solely to her sister and it would be pleasant to see her begin her youth  not as a mere young lady exclaimed rachel  that is happily not possible  an answer that somewhat puzzled rachel whose regard for him was likely to be a good deal dependent upon his contentment with alisons station in life  i must say young ladyhood looks to the greatest advantage there rachel could not help exclaiming as at that moment elizabeth keith smiled at them as she floated past her airy white draperies looped with scarlet ribbons her dark hair turned back and fastened by a snood of the same an eagles feather clasped in it by a large emerald a memory of her fathers last siegethat of lucknow  she is a very pretty creature said the colonel under the sparkle of her bright eyes  i never saw any one make the pursuits of young ladyhood have so much spirit and meaning added rachel here you see she has managed to make herself sufficiently like other people yet full of individual character and meaning  that is the theory of dress i suppose said the colonel  if one chooses to cultivate it  did you ever see lady temple in full dress  no we were not out when we parted as girls  then you have had a loss i think it was at our last melbourne ball that when she went to the nursery to wish the children good night one of themhubert i believetold her to wear that dress when she went to heaven and dear old sir stephen was so delighted that he went straight upstairs to kiss the boy for it  was that lady temple said alick keith who having found miss grey engaged many deep joined them again and at his words came back a thrill of rachels old fear and doubt as to the possible future  yes said the colonel i was recollecting the gracious vision she used to be at all our chiefs parties  vision you call her who lived in the house with her what do you think she was to uspoor wretchescoming up from barracks where mrs oshaughnessy was our cynosure there was not one of us to whom she was not queen of the east and more with that innocent soft helpless dignity of hers  and sir stephen for the first of her vassals said the colonel  what a change it has been said alick  yes but a change that has shown her to have been unspoilable we were just agreeing on the ballroom perfections of her and your sister in their several lines  very different lines said alick smiling  i cant judge of fannys said rachel but your sister is almost enough to make one believe there can be some soul in young lady life  i did not bring bessie here to convert you was the somewhat perplexing answer  nor has she said rachel except so far as i see that she can follow ordinary girls pursuits without being frivolous in them alick bowed at the compliment  and she has been a sunbeam added rachel we shall all feel graver and cloudier without her  yes said colonel keith and i am glad mr clare has such a sunbeam for his parsonage what a blessing she will be there he added as he watched bessies graceful way of explaining to his brother some little matter in behalf of the shy mother of a shy girl thinking he might be wanted colonel keith went forward to assist and rachel continued i do envy that power of saying the right thing to everybody  dontit is the greatest snare was his answer much amazing her for she had her mind full of the two direct personal blunders she had made towards him  it prevents many difficulties and embarrassments  very desirable things  yes for those that like to laugh but not for those that are laughed at said rachel  more so the worst of all misfortunes is to wriggle too smoothly through life  this was to rachel the most remarkable part of the evening as to the rest it was like all other balls a weariness grace enjoying herself and her universal popularity always either talking or dancing and her mother comfortable and dutiful among other mothers the brilliant figure and ready grace of bessie keith being the one vision that perpetually flitted in her dreams and the one everrecurring recollection that captain keith the veritable hero of the shell had been lectured by her on his own deed in effect rachel had never felt so beaten down and ashamed of herself so doubtful of her own most positive convictions and yet not utterly dissatisfied and the worst of it was that emily grey was after all carried off without dancing with the hero and rachel felt as if her own opinionativeness had defrauded the poor girl  other balls sent her home in a state of weariness disgust and contempt towards every one but this one had resulted in displeasure with herself yet in much interest and excitement and oh passing strange through that same frivolous military society  indeed the military society was soon in better odour with her than the clerical she had been making strenuous efforts to get to st herberts with mr mitchell for some time past but the road was in a state of being repaired and the coachman was determined against taking his horses there as to going by train that was equally impossible since he would still less have driven her to the station finally rachel took the resolute stop of borrowing fannys pony carriage and driving herself and the clergyman to the station where she was met by mrs morris the mother of one of the girls to whom she had promised such a visit as it had been agreed that it would be wisest not to unsettle the scholars by christmas holidays  the f u e e was in perfect order the little girls sat upon a bench with their copies before them mrs rawlins in the whitest of caps presided over them and mr mauleverer was very urbane conducting the visitors over the house himself and expatiating on his views of cleanliness ventilation refinement and equality of cultivation while mrs rawlins remained to entertain mrs morris nothing could be more practical and satisfactory some admirable drawings of the childrens were exhibited and their conduct was said to be excellent except mr mauleverer remarked unwillingly that there was a tendency about little mary to fancy herself injured and he feared that she was not always truthful but these were childish faults that he hoped would pass away with further refinement and removal from the lower influences of her home  after this rachel was not surprised that poor ignorant and always deplorable mrs morris did not seem in raptures with the state of her child but more inclined to lament not having seen more of her and not having her at home that was quite in accordance with peasant shortsightedness and ingratitude but it was much more disappointing that mr mitchell said little or nothing of approbation asked her a few questions about her previous knowledge of mr mauleverer and mrs rawlins and when she began to talk of arranging for some one or two of his london orphans thanked her rather shortly but said there was no way of managing it it was evident that he was quite as prejudiced as others of his clerical brethren and the more rachel read of current literature the more she became convinced of their bondage to views into which they durst not examine for fear honesty should compel them to assert their conclusions  she had hoped better things from the stranger but she began to be persuaded that all her former concessions to the principles infused in her early days were vain entanglements and that it was merely weakness and unwillingness to pain her mother that prevented her from breaking through them  she could not talk this out with anybody except now and then an utterance to the consenting mr mauleverer but in general she would have been shocked to put these surging thoughts into words and bessie was her only intimate who would avow that there could be anything to be found fault with in a clergyman when alone together bessie would sometimes regretfully sometimes in a tone of amusement go over bits of narrowminded folly that had struck her in the clergy and more especially in her uncles curate mr lifford whose dryness was she owned very repulsive to her  he is a good creature she said and most necessary to my uncle but how he and i are to get through life together i cannot tell it must soon be tried though after my visit at bath will come my home at bishopsworthy and then she confided to rachel all the parish ways and took counsel on the means of usefulness that would not clash with the curate and pain her uncle she even talked of a possible orphan for the f u e e only that unlucky prejudice against mr mauleverer was sure to stand in the way  so acceptable had bessie keith made herself everywhere that all avonmouth was grieved at her engagement to spend the winter at bath with her married cousin to whom she was imperatively necessary in the getting up of a musical party  and i must go some time or other she said to colonel keith so it had better be when you are all here to make myrtlewood cheerful and i can be of most use to poor jane i do think dear lady temple is much more full of life and brightness now  everybody seemed to consider bessies departure as their own personal loss the boys were in despair for their playfellow ermine would miss those sunny visits colonel keith many a pleasant discussion replete with delicate compliments to ermine veiled by tact and lord keith the pretty young clanswoman who had kept up a graceful little coquetry with him and even to the last evening went on walking on the esplanade with him in the sunset so as to set his brother free to avoid the evening chill  and above all lady temple regretted the loss of the cheery companion of her evenings true bessie had lately had a good many small evening gaieties but she always came back from them so fresh and bright and so full of entertaining description and anecdote that fanny felt as if she had been there herself and said bessie it was much better for her than staying at home with her and bringing in no novelty  pray come to me again dearest your stay has been the greatest treat it is very kind in you to be so good to me  it is you who are good to me dearest lady temple  i am afraid i shall hardly get you again your poor uncle will never be able to part with you so i wont ask you to promise but if ever you can  if ever i can this has been a very happy time dear lady temple a confidence seemed trembling on her lips but she suppressed it i shall always think of you as the kindest friend a motherless girl ever had i will write to you from bath goodbye  and there were all the boys in a row little affectionate hubert absolutely tearful and conrade holding up a bouquet on which he had spent all his money having persuaded coombe to ride with him to the nursery garden at avoncester to procure it he looked absolutely shy and blushing when bessie kissed him and promised to dry the leaves and keep them for ever     chapter xv go and bray     come come elder brother you are too young in this                                               as you like it   alick i have something to say to you  captain keith did not choose to let his sister travel alone when he could help it and therefore was going to bath with her intending to return to avoncester by the next down train he made no secret that he thought it a great deal of trouble and had been for some time asleep when at about two stations from bath bessie having shut the little door in the middle of the carriage thus addressed him alick i have something to say to you and i suppose i may as well say it now  she pressed upon his knee and with an affected laziness he drew his eyes wide open  ah well ive been a sore plague to you but i shall be off your hands now  eh whose head have you been turning  alick what do you think of lord keith  alick was awake enough now the old ass he exclaimed but at least you are out of his way now  not at all he is coming to bath tomorrow to see my aunt  and you want me to go out tomorrow and stop him  no alick not exactly i have been cast about the world too long not to be thankful  elizabeth  do not look so very much surprised she said in her sweet pleading way may i not be supposed able to feel that noble kindness and gracious manner and be glad to have some one to look up to  and how about charlie carleton demanded alick turning round full on her  for shame alick she exclaimed hotly you who were the one to persecute me about him and tell me all sorts of things about his being shallow and unprincipled and not to be thought of you to bring him up against me now  i might think all you allege returned alick gravely and yet be much amazed at the new project  bessie laughed in fact you made a little romance in which you acted the part of sapient brother and the poor little sister broke her heart ever after you wanted such an entertainment when you were lying on the sofa so you created a heroine and a villain and thundered down to the rescue  very pretty bessie but it will not do it was long after i was well again and had joined  then it was the wellconsidered effect of the musings of your convalescence when you have a sister to take care of it is as well to feel that you are doing it  now elizabeth said her brother with seriousness not to be laughed aside and laying his hand on hers before i hear another word on this matter look me in the face and tell me deliberately that you never cared for carleton  i never thought for one moment of marrying him said bessie haughtily if i ever had any sort of mercy on him it was all to tease you there are you satisfied  i must be i suppose he replied and he sighed heavily when was this settled  yesterday walking up and down the esplanade he will tell his brother today and i shall write to lady temple oh alick he is so kind he spoke so highly of you  i must say returned alick in the same grave tone that if you wished for the care of an old man i should have thought my uncle the more agreeable of the two  he is little past fifty you are very hard on him  on the contrary i am sorry for him you will always find it good for him to do whatever suits yourself  alick said his sister mournfully you have never forgotten or forgiven my girlish bits of neglect after your wound  no bessie he said holding her hand kindly it is not the neglect or the girlishness but the excuses to me still more to my uncle and most of all to yourself they are what make me afraid for you in what you are going to take upon yourself  she did not answer immediately and he pursuedare you driven to this by dislike to living at bishopsworthy if so do not be afraid to tell me i will make any arrangement if you would prefer living with jane we agreed once that it would be too expensive but now i could let you have another hundred a year  as if i would allow that alick no indeed lord keith means you to have all my share  does he there are more words than one to that question and pray is he going to provide properly for his poor daughter in the west indies  i hope to induce him to take her into favour  eh and to make him give up to colin keith that auchinvar estate that he ought to have had when archie keith died  you may be sure i shall do my best for the colonel indeed i do think lord keith will consent to the marriage now  you have sacrificed yourself on that account he said with irony in his tone that he could have repented the next moment so goodhumoured was her reply that is understood so give me the merit  the merit of for his sake becoming a grandmother you have thought of the daughters mrs comyn menteith must be older than yourself  three years said bessie in his own tone of acceptance of startling facts and i shall have seven grandchildren in all so you see you must respect me  do you know her sentiments  i know what they will be when we have met never fear alick if she were not married it might be serious being so i have no fears  then came a silence till a halt at the last station before bath roused alick again  bessie he said in the low voice the stoppage permitted dont think me unkind i believe you have waited on purpose to leave me no time for expostulation and what i have said has sounded the more harsh in consequence  no alick she said you are a kind brother in all but the constructions you put upon my doings i think it would be better if there were more difference between our ages you are a young guardian over anxious and often morbidly fanciful about me during your illness i think we shall be happier together when you no longer feel yourself responsible  the tables turned muttered alick  i am prepared for misconstruction added bessie i know it will be supposed to be the title the estate it cannot be for you know how poor a property it is but i do not mean to care for the world your opinion is a different thing and i thought you would have seen that i could not be insensible to such dignified kindness and the warmth of a nature that many people think cold  i dont like set speeches bessie  then believe me alick may i not love the fine old man that has been so kind to me  i hope you do said alick slowly  and you cant believe it not with lady temple before you and hers was really an old man  do not talk of her or sir stephen either no bessie he added more calmly after a time i may be doing great injustice to you both but i must speak what it is my duty to say lord keith is a hard selfseeking man who has been harsh and grasping towards his family and i verily believe came here bent on marriage only because his brother was no longer under his tyranny he may not be harsh to you because he is past his vigour and if he really loves you you have a power of governing but from what i know of you i cannot believe in your loving him enough to make such management much better than selfish manoeuvring therefore i cannot think this marriage for your real welfare or be other than bitterly grieved at it do not answer bessie but think this over and if at any time this evening you feel the least doubt of your happiness in this matter telegraph to me and i will stop him  indeed alick she answered without anger i believe you are very anxious for my good  it will readily be believed that captain keith received no telegram  nevertheless as soon as his time was his own the next morning he rode to avonmouth and sought out the colonel not perhaps with very defined hopes of making any change in his sisters intentions but feeling that some attempt on his own part must be made if only to free himself from acquiescence and thinking that colin as late guardian to the one party and brother to the other was the most proper medium  colonel keith was taken by surprise at the manner in which his cordial greeting was met he himself had been far from displeased at his brothers communication it was a great relief to him personally as well as on lady temples account and he had been much charmed at bessies good sense and engaging graces as to disparity of years lord keith had really made himself much younger of late and there was much to excite a girls romance in the courtesy of an elderly man the chief of her clan moreover the perfect affection and happiness colin had been used to witness in his generals family disposed him to make light of that objection and he perceived that his brother was sufficiently bewitched to be likely to be kind and indulgent to his bride  he had not expected alexander keith to be as well pleased as he was himself but he was not prepared for his strong disapprobation and earnest desire to find some means of prevention and he began to reassure him upon the placability of mrs comyn menteith the daughter as well as upon his brothers kindness to the objects of his real affection  oh i am not afraid of that she will manage him fast enough  very likely and for his good nor need you question his being a safe guide for her in higher matters perhaps you are prejudiced against him because his relations with me have not been happy but candidly in them you know the worst of him and no doubt he thought himself purely acting for my welfare i know much more of him now that i have been at home with him and i was greatly struck with his real consideration for the good of all concerned with him  no i am not thinking of lord keith to speak it out i cannot believe that my sister has heart enough in this to justify her  young girls often are more attracted by elderly men than by lads  you do not know bessie as i am sorry to say i do said alick speaking slowly and sadly and with a flush of shame on his cheek i do not say that she says anything untrue but the truth is not in her she is one of those selfish people who are infinitely better liked than those five hundred times their worth because they take care to be always pleased  they give as much pleasure as they take  yes they take every one in i wish to my heart i could be taken in too but i have seen too much of her avoidance of every service to my uncle that she did not like i verily believe at this moment that one great inducement with her is to elude the care of him  stern judgments alick i know you would not speak thus without warrant but take it into account that marriage makes many a girls selfishness dual and at last drowns the self  yes when it is a marriage of affection but the truth must be told colonel there was a trumpery idle fellow always loitering at littleworthy and playing croquet i set my face against it with all my might and she always laughed to scorn the notion that there was anything in it nor do i believe that she has heart enough to wish to marry him i could almost say i wish she had but i never saw her show the same pleasure in any ones attentions and i believe he is gone out to rio in hopes of earning means to justify his addresses  colonel keith sat gravely considering what he knew would not be spoken lightly do you mean that there was attachment enough to make it desirable that you should tell my brother  no i could say nothing that she could not instantly contradict with perfect truth though not with perfect sincerity  let me ask you one question alicknot a flattering one may not some of these private impressions of yours have been coloured by your long illness  that is what bessie gives every one to understand said alick calmly she is right to a certain degree that suffering sharpened my perceptions and helplessness gave me time to draw conclusions if i had been well i might have been as much enchanted as other people and if my uncle had not needed her care and been neglected i could have thought that i was rendered exacting by illness but i imagine all i have said is not of the slightest use only if you think it right to tell your brother to talk to me i would rather stand all the vituperation that would fall on me than allow this to take place  colonel keith walked up and down the room considering whilst alick sat in a dejected attitude shading his face and not uttering how very bitter it had been to him to make the accusation nor how dear the sister really was  i see no purpose that would be answered said colonel keith coming to a pause at last you have nothing tangible to mention even as to the former affair that you suspect i see a great deal in your view of her to make you uneasy but nothing that would not be capable of explanation above all to such a man as my brother it would appear like mere malevolence  never mind what it would appear said alick who was evidently in such a ferment as his usually passive demeanour would have seemed incapable of  if the appearance would entirely baffle the purpose it must be considered said the colonel and in this case it could only lead to estrangement which would be a lasting evil i conclude that you have remonstrated with your sister  as much as she gave me time for but of course that is breath spent in vain  your uncle had the same means of judging as yourself  no colonel he could do nothing in the first place there can be no correspondence with him and next he is so devotedly fond of bessie that he would no more believe anything against her than lady temple would i have tried that more than once  then alick there is nothing for it but to let it take its course and even upon your own view your sister will be much safer married than single  i had very little expectation of your saying anything else but in common honesty i felt bound to let you know  and now the best thing to be done is to forget all you have said  which you will do the more easily as you think it an amiable delusion of mine well so much the better i dare say you will never think otherwise and i would willingly believe that my senses went after my fingers ends  the colonel almost believed so himself he was aware of the miserably sensitive condition of shattered nerve in which alick had been sent home and of the depression of spirits that had ensued on the news of his fathers death and he thought it extremely probable that his weary hours and solicitude for his gay young sister might have made molehills into mountains and that these now weighed on his memory and conscience at least this seemed the only way of accounting for an impression so contrary to that which bessie keith made on every one else and by his own avowal on the uncle whom he so much revered every other voice proclaimed her winning amiable obliging considerate and devoted to the service of her friends with much drollery and shrewdness of perception tempered by kindness of heart and unwillingness to give pain and on that sore point of residence with the blind uncle it was quite possibly a bit of alicks exaggerated feeling to imagine the arrangement so desirablethe young lady might be the better judge  on the whole the expostulation left colonel keith more uncomfortable on alicks account than on that of his brother     chapter xvi an apparition     and there will be auld geordie tanner   who coft a young wife wi his gowd                            joanna baillie   mamma quoth leoline i thought a woman must not marry her grandfather and she called him the patriarch of her clan  he is a cross old man added hubert he said children ought not to be allowed on the esplanade because he got into the way as i was pushing the perambulator  this was the reason said francis gravely that she stopped me from braying at him i shall know what people are at when they talk of disrespect another time  dont talk of her cried conrade flinging himself round women have no truth in them  except the dear darling delightful mammy and the larger proportion of boys precipitated themselves headlong upon her so that any one but a mother would have been buffeted out of breath in their struggles for embracing ground and even lady temple found it a relief when hubert having been squeezed out bethought himself of extending the honourable exception to miss williams and thus effected a diversion what would have been the young gentlemens reception of his lordships previous proposal  yet in the fulness of her gladness the inconsistent widow who had thought lord keith so much too old for herself gave her younger friend heartfelt congratulations upon the blessing of being under fatherly direction and guidance she was entrusted with the announcement to rachel who received it with a simple indeed and left her cousin unmolested in her satisfaction having long relegated fanny to the class of women who think having a friend about to be married the next best thing to being married themselves no matter to whom  aspirations in women are mere delusions was her compensating sigh to grace there is no truer saying than that a woman will receive every man  i have always been glad that is aprocryphal said grace and eastern women have no choice  nor are western women better than eastern said rachel it is all circumstances no mental power or acuteness has in any instance that i have yet seen been able to balance the propensity to bondage the utmost flight is that the attachment should not be unworthy  i own that i am very much surprised said grace  i am not at all said rachel i have given up hoping better things i was beginning to have a high opinion of bessie keiths capabilities but womanhood was at the root all the time and as her brother says she has had great disadvantages and i can make excuses for her she had not her heart filled with one definite scheme of work and usefulness such as deters the trifling and designing  like the f u e e  yes the more i see of the fate of other women the more thankful i am that my vocation has taken a formed and developed shape  and thus rachel could afford to speak without severity of the match though she abstained from congratulation she did not see captain keith for the next few days but at last the two sisters met him at the cathedral door as they were getting into the carriage after a days shopping at avoncester and grace offered her congratulations in accordance with her mothers old fashioned code  thank you he said then turning to rachel did she write to you  no  i thought not  there was something marked in his tone but his sisters silence was not of long duration for a letter arrived containing orders for lace entreating that a high pressure might be put on mrs kelland and containing beauteous devices for the veil which was to be completed in a fearfully short time since the wedding was to be immediate in order that lord keith might spend christmas and the ensuing cold months abroad it was to take place at bath and was to be as quiet as possible or else wrote miss keith i should have been enchanted to have overcome your reluctance to witness the base surrender of female rights i am afraid you are only too glad to be let off only dont thank me but circumstances  rachels principles revolted at the quantity of work demanded of the victims to lace and grace could hardly obtain leave to consult mrs kelland but she snapped at the order for the honour and glory of the thing and undertook through the ramifications of her connexion to obtain the whole bridal array complete for such a pleasantspoken lady as miss keith she would sit up all night rather than disappoint her  the most implacable person of all was the old housekeeper tibbie she had been warmly attached to lady keith and resented her having a successor and one younger than her daughters and above all ever since the son and heir had died she had reckoned on her own master colin coming to the honours of the family and regarded this new marriage as a crossing of providence she vainly endeavoured to stir up master colin to remonstrate on his brothers makin siccan a fules

present to ermines suggestion that her appellation hardly suited the dignity of her station he replied that isabel was too romantic for southern ears and that her surname being the same as his own he was hardly prepared to have the title of mrs keith preoccupied so after mrs curtiss example the world for the most part knew the colonels housekeeper as mrs tibbs  she might be a tyrant but liberties were taken with her territory for almost the first use that the colonel made of his house was to ask a rheumatic sergeant who had lately been invalided to come and benefit by the avonmouth climate scottish hospitality softened tibbies heart and when she learnt that sergeant obrien had helped to carry master colin into camp after his wound she thought nothing too good for him the colonel then ventured to add to the party an exemplary consumptive tailor from mr mitchells parish who might yet be saved by good living and good air some growls were elicited but he proved to be so deplorably the ninetieth rather than the ninth part of a man that tibbie made it her point of honour to fatten him and the sergeant found him such an intelligent auditor of the indian exploits of the th highlanders that mutual respect was fully established and high politeness reigned supreme even though the tailor could never be induced to delight in the porridge on which the sergeant daily complimented the housekeeper in original and magnificent metaphors  nor had the colonel any anxieties in leaving the representatives of the three nations together while he went to attend his brothers wedding he proposed that tibbie should conduct rose for the daily walk of which he had made a great point thinking that the child did not get exercise enough since she was so averse to going alone upon the esplanade that her aunt forbore to press it she manifested the same reluctance to going out with tibbie and this the colonel ascribed to her fancying herself too old to be under the charge of a nurse it was trying to laugh her out of her dignity but without eliciting an answer when one afternoon just as they were entering together upon the esplanade he felt her hand tighten upon his own with a nervous frightened clutch as she pressed tremulously to his side  what is it my dear that dog is not barking at you he only wants to have a stick thrown into the sea for him  oh not the dog it was  was what  him gasped rose  who inquired the colonel far from prepared for the reply in a terrified whisper  mr maddox  my dear child which where  he is gone he is past oh dont turn back dont let me see him again  you dont suppose he could hurt you my dear  no hesitated rose not with you  nor with any one  i suppose not said rose common sense reviving though her grasp was not relaxed  would it distress you very much to try to point him out to me said the colonel in his irresistibly sweet tone  i will only keep hold of my hand pray and the little hand trembled so much that he felt himself committing a cruel action in leading her along the esplanade but there was no fresh start of recognition and when they had gone the whole length she breathed more freely and said no he was not there  recollecting how young she had been at the time of maddoxs treason the colonel began to doubt if her imagination had not raised a bugbear and he questioned her my dear why are you so much afraid of this person what do you know about him  he told wicked stories of my papa said rose very low  true but he could not hurt you you dont think he goes about like red ridinghoods wolf  no i am not so silly now  are you sure you know him did you often see him in your papas house  no he was always in the laboratory and i might not go there  then you see rose it must be mere fancy that you saw him for you could not even know him by sight  it was not fancy said rose gentle and timid as ever but still obviously injured at the tone of reproof  my dear child said colonel keith with some exertion of patience you must try to be reasonable how can you possibly recognise a man that you tell me you never saw  i said i never saw him in the house said rose with a shudder but they said if ever i told they would give me to the lions in the zoological gardens  who said so  he mr maddox and maria she answered in such trepidation that he could scarcely hear her  but you are old and wise enough now to know what a foolish and wicked threat that was my dear  yes i was a little girl then and knew no better and once i did tell a lie when mamma asked me and now she is dead and i can never tell her the truth  colin dreaded a public outbreak of the sobs that heaved in the poor childs throat but she had selfcontrol enough to restrain them till he had led her into his own library where he let her weep out her repentance for the untruth which wrested from her by terror had weighed so long on her conscience he felt that he was sparing ermine something by receiving the first tempest of tears in the absolute terror and anguish of revealing the secret that had preyed on her with mysterious horror  now tell me all about it my dear little girl who was this maria  maria was my nurse when i lived at home she used to take me out walking said rose pressing closer to his protecting breast and pausing as though still afraid of her own words  well he said beginning to perceive and was it than that you saw this maddox  yes he used to come and walk with us and sit under the trees in kensington gardens with her and sometimes he gave me lemondrops but they said if ever i told the lions should have me i used to think i might be saved like daniel but after i told the lie i knew i should not mamma asked me why my fingers were sticky and i did say it was from a lemondrop but there were marias eyes looking at me oh so dreadful and when mamma asked who gave it to me and maria said i did did not i miss rose oh i did not seem able to help saying yes  poor child and you never dared to speak of it again  oh no i did long to tell but oh one night it was written up in letters of fire beware of the lions  terror must have set you dreaming my dear  no said rose earnestly i was quite awake papa and mamma were gone out to dine and sleep and maria would put me to bed half an hour too soon she read me to sleep but byandby i woke up as i always did at mammas bed time and the candle was gone and there were those dreadful letters in light over the door  she spoke with such conviction that he became persuaded that all was not delusion and asked what she did  i jumped up and screamed and opened the door but there they were growling in papas dressingroom  they the lions oh rose you must know that was impossible  no i did not see any lions but i heard the growl and mr maddox coughed and said here they come and growled again  and you  i tumbled into bed again and rolled up my head in the clothes and prayed that it might be day and it was at last  poor child indeed rose i do not wonder at your terror i never heard of a more barbarous trick  was it a trick said rose raising a wonderfully relieved and hopeful face  did you never hear of writing in phosphorus a substance that shines at night as the sea sometimes does  aunt ailie has a book with a story about writing in fiery letters but it frightened me so much that i never read to the end  bring it to me and we will read it together and then you will see that such a cruel use can be made of phosphorus  it was unkind of them said rose sadly i wonder if they did it for fun  where did you sleep  i had a little room that opened into mammas  and where was all this growling  in papas room the door was just opposite to mine and was open all the light was there you know mammas room was dark but there was a candle in the dressingroom  did you see anything  only the light it was such a moment i dont think i saw mr maddox but i am quite certain i heard him for he had an odd little cough  then rose i have little doubt that all this cruelty to you poor inoffensive little being was to hide some plots against your father  she caught his meaning with the quickness of a mind precocious on some points though childish on others then if i had been brave and told the truth he might never have hurt papa  mind i do not know and i never thought of blaming you the chief sufferer no dont begin to cry again  ah but i did tell a lie and i never can confess it to mamma she said recurring to the sad lament so long suppressed  she found a kind comforter who led her to the higher sources of consolation feeling all the time the deep selfaccusation with which the sight of sweet childish penitence must always inspire a grown person  and now you will not fear to tell your aunt he added only it should be when you can mention it without such sad crying  telling you is almost as good as telling her said rose and i feel safe with you she added caressingly drawing his arm round her please tell aunt ermine for my crying does give her such a headache  i will then and i think when we all know it the terrors will leave you  not when i see mr maddox oh please now you know why dont make me walk without you i do know now that he could not do anything to me but i cant help feeling the fright and oh if he was to speak to me  you have not seen him here before  yes i have at least i think so once when aunt ermine sent me to the postoffice and another time on the esplanade that is why i cant bear going out without you or aunt ailie indeed it is not disliking tibbie  i see it is not my dear and we will say no more about it till you have conquered your alarm but remember that he is not likely to know you again you must be more changed in these three years than he is  this consideration seemed to reassure rose greatly and her next inquiry was please are my eyes very red for going home  somewhat mottledsomething of the york and lancaster rose shall i leave you under tibbies care till the maiden blush complexion returns and come back and fetch you when you have had a grand exhibition of my indian curiosities  have you indian curiosities i thought they were only for ladies  perhaps they are is tibbie guard enough you know theres an irish sergeant in the house taller than i am if you want a garrison  oh i am not afraid only these eyes  i will tell her you have been frightened and she shall take no notice  tibbie was an admirer of rose and gladly made her welcome while the colonel repaired to ermine and greatly startled her by the disclosure of the miseries that had been inflicted on the sensitive child  it had indeed been known that there had been tyranny in the nursery and to this cause the aunts imputed the startled wistful expression in roses eyes but they had never questioned her thinking that silence would best wear out the recollection the only wonder was that her senses had not been permanently injured by that night of terror which accounted for her unconquerable dread of sleeping in the dark and a still more inexplicable horror of the zoological gardens together with many a nervous misery that ermine had found it vain to combat the colonel asked if the nurses cruelty had been the cause of her dismissal  no it was not discovered till after her departure her fate has always been a great grief to us though we little thought her capable of using rose in this way she was one of the hathertons you must remember the name and the pretty picturesque hovel on the heath  the squatters that were such a grievance to my uncle always suspected of poaching and never caught  exactly most of the girls turned out ill but this one the youngest was remarkably intelligent and attractive at school i remember making an excuse for calling her into the garden for you to see and confess that english beauty exceeded scottish and you called her a gipsy and said we had no right to her  so it was those big black eyes that had that fiendish malice in them  ah if she fell into maddoxs hands i wonder the less she showed an amount of feeling about my illness that won ailies heart and we had her for a little handmaid to help my nurse then when we broke up from home we still kept her and every one used to be struck with her looks and manner she went on as well as possible and lucy set her heart on having her in the nursery and when the upper nurse went away she had the whole care of rose we heard only of her praises till to our horror we found she had been sent away in disgrace at a moments warning poor lucy was young and so much shocked as only to think of getting her out of the house not of what was to become of her and all we could learn was that she never went home  how long was this before the crash  it was only a few weeks before the going abroad but they had been absent nearly a year no doubt maddox must have made her aid in his schemes you say rose saw him  so she declares and there is an accuracy of memory about her that i should trust to should you or alison know him  no we used to think it a bad sign that edward never showed him to us i remember alison being disappointed that he was not at the factory the only time she saw it  i do not like going away while he may be lurking about i could send a note tonight explaining my absence  no no exclaimed ermine that would be making me as bad as poor little rose if he be here ever so much he has done his worst and edward is out of his reach what could he do to us the affairs were wound up long ago and we have literally nothing to be bullied out of no i dont think he could make me believe in lions in any shape  you strongminded woman you want to emulate the rachel  you have brought her laughed ermine at the sound of the wellknown knock and rachel entered bag in hand  i was in hopes of meeting you she said to the colonel i wanted to ask you to take charge of some of these and she produced a packet of prospectuses of a journal of female industry an illustrated monthly magazine destined to contain essays correspondence reviews history tales etc to be printed and illustrated in the f u e e  i hoped said rachel to have begun with the year but we are not forward enough and indeed some of the expenses require a subscription in advance a subscriber in advance will have the years numbers for ten shillings instead of twelve and i should be much obliged if you would distribute a few of these at bath and ask bessie to do the same i shall set her name down at the head of the list as soon as she has qualified it for a decoy  are these printed at the f u e e  no we have not funds as yet mr mauleverer had them done at bristol where he has a large connexion as a lecturer and expects to get many subscribers i brought these down as soon as he had left them with me in hopes that you would kindly distribute them at the wedding and i wished added she to ermine to ask you to contribute to our first number  thank you and the doubtful tone induced rachel to encourage her diffidence  i know you write a great deal and i am sure you must produce something worthy to see the light i have no scruple in making the request as i know colonel keith agrees with me that womanhood need not be an extinguisher for talent  i am not afraid of him ermine managed to say without more smile than rachel took for gratification  then if you would only entrust me with some of your fugitive reflections i have no doubt that something might be made of them a practised hand she added with a certain editorial dignity can always polish away any little roughnesses from inexperience  ermine was choking with laughter at the savage pulls that colin was inflicting on his moustache and feeling silence no longer honest she answered in an odd under tone i cant plead inexperience  no cried rachel you have written you have not published  i was forced to do whatever brought grist to the mill said ermine indeed she added with a look as if to ask pardon our secrets have been hardly fair towards you but we made it a rule not to spoil our breadwinners trade by confessing my enormities  i assure you said the colonel touched by rachels appalled look i dont know how long this cautious person would have kept me in the dark if she had not betrayed herself in the paper we discussed the first day i met you  the traveller said rachel her eyes widening like those of a child she is the invalid  there i am glad to have made a clean breast of it said ermine  the invalid repeated rachel it is as bad as the victoria cross  there is a compliment ermine for which you should make your bow said colin  oh i did not mean that said rachel but that it was as great a mistake as i made about captain keith when i told him his own story and denied his being the hero till i actually saw his cross and she spoke with a genuine simplicity that almost looked like humour ending with i wonder why i am fated to make such mistakes  preconceived notions said ermine smiling your theory suffices you and you dont see small indications  there may be something in that said rachel thoughtfully it accounts for grace always seeing things faster than i did  did mr your philanthropist bring you this today said the colonel taking up the paper again as if to point a practical moral to her confession of misjudgments  mr mauleverer yes i came down as soon as he had left me only calling first upon fanny i am very anxious for contributions if you would only give me a paper signed by the invalid it would be a fortune to the institution  ermine made a vague answer that she doubted whether the invalid was separable from the traveller and rachel presently departed with her prospectus but without having elicited a promise  intolerable exclaimed the colonel she was improving under bessies influence but she has broken out worse than ever journal of female industry journal of a knight of industry might be a better title you will have nothing to do with it ermine  certainly not as the invalid but i owe her something for having let her run into this scrape before you  as if you could have hindered her come dont waste time and brains on a companion for curatocult  you make me so idle and frivolous that i shall be expelled from the traveller and obliged to take refuge in the female industry journal shall you distribute the prospectuses  i shall give one to bessie that is if i go at all  no no there is no valid reason for staying away even if we were sure that rose was right nothing could well come of it and your absence would be most invidious  i believe i am wanted to keep master alick in order but if you have the least feeling that you would be more at ease with me at home  that is not a fair question said ermine smiling you know very well that you ought to go  and i shall try to bring back harry beauchamp added the colonel he would be able to identify the fellow  i do not know what would be gained by that  i should know whom to watch  ermine had seen so much of roses nervous timidity and had known so many phantoms raised by it that she attached little importance to the recognition and when she went over the matter with her little niece it was with far more thought of the effect of the terror and of the long suppressed secret upon the childs moral and physical nature than with any curiosity as to the subject of her last alarm she was surprised to observe that alison was evidently in a state of much more restlessness and suspense than she was conscious of in herself during colins absence and attributed this to her sisters fear of maddoxs making some inroad upon her in her long solitary hours in which case she tried to reassure her by promises to send at once for mr mitchell or for coombe  alison let these assurances be given to her and felt hypocritical for receiving them in silence her grave set features had tutored themselves to conceal for ever one page in the life that ermine thought was entirely revealed to her never had ermine known that brotherly companionship had once suddenly assumed the unwelcome aspect of an affection against which alisons heart had been steeled by devotion to the sister whose life she had blighted her resolution had been unswerving but its full cost had been unknown to her till her adherence to it had slackened the old tie of hereditary friendship towards others of her family and even when marriage should have obliterated the past she still traced resentment in the hard judgment of her brothers conduct and even in the one act of consideration that it galled her to accept  there had been no meeting since the one decisive interview just before she had left her original home and there were many more bitter feelings than could be easily assuaged in looking forward to a renewal of intercourse when all too late she knew that she should soon be no longer needed by her sister she tried to feel it all just retribution she tried to rejoice in ermines coming happiness she tried to believe that the sight of harry beauchamp as a married man would be the best cure for her she blamed and struggled with herself and after all her distress was wasted harry beauchamp had not chosen to come home with his cousin who took his unwillingness to miss a huntingday rather angrily and scornfully alison put her private interpretation on the refusal and held aloof while colin owned to ermine his vexation and surprise at the displeasure that harry beauchamp maintained against his old schoolfellow and his absolute refusal to listen to any arguments as to his innocence  this seemed to have been colins prominent interest in his expedition to bath the particulars of the wedding were less easily drawn from him the bride had indeed been perfection all was charming wherever she brought her ready grace and sweetness and she had gratified the colonel by her affectionate messages to ermine and her evident intention to make all straight between lord keith and his daughter mary but the clare relations had not made a favourable impression the favourite blind uncle had not been present in spite of bessies boast and it was suspected that alick had not chosen to forward his coming alick had devolved the office of giving his sister away upon the colonel as her guardian and had altogether comported himself with more than his usual lazy irony especially towards the clare cousinhood who constantly buzzed round him and received his rebuffs as delightful jests and compliments making the colonel wonder all the more at the perfect good taste and good breeding of his new sisterinlaw who had spent among them all the most critical years of her life  she had been much amused with the prospectus of the journal of female industry but she sent word to rachel that she advised her not to publish any list of subscribersthe vague was far more impressive than the certain the first number must be sent to her at paris and trust her for spreading its fame  the colonel did not add to his message her recommendation that the frontispiece should represent the spinsters needles with the rescue of don as the type of female heroism nor did he tell how carefully he had questioned both her and rachel as to the date of that interesting adventure     chapter xvii the siege    the counterfeit presentmenthamlet   christmas came and rachel agreed with mr mauleverer that it was better not to unsettle the children at the f u e e by permitting them to come home for holidays a decision which produced much discontent in their respective families alison going to mrs morris with her pupils to take her a share of christmas good cheer was made the receptacle of a great lamentation over the childs absence and moreover that the mother had not been allowed to see her alone when taken by miss rachel to the f u e e  some one ought to take it up said alison as she came home in her indignation who knows what may be done to those poor children cant mr mitchell do something  but mr mitchell was not sufficiently at home to interfere he was indeed negotiating an exchange with mr touchett but until this was effected he could hardly meddle in the matter and he was besides a reserved prudent man slow to commit himself so that his own impression of the asylum could not be extracted from him here however colonel keith put himself forward he had often been asked by rachel to visit the f u e e and he surprised and relieved alison by announcing his intention of going over to st norberts alone and without notice so as to satisfy himself as far as might be as to the treatment of the inmates and the genuineness of mauleverers pretensions he had however to wait for weather that would not make the adventure one of danger to him and he regarded the cold and rain with unusual impatience until near the end of january he was able to undertake his expedition  after much knocking and ringing the door was opened to him by a rude slatternly halfwitted looking charwoman or rather girl who said master was not in and nearly shut the door in his face however he succeeded in sending in his card backed by the mention of lady temple and miss curtis and this brought out mrs rawlins her white streamers floating stiff behind her full of curtsies and regrets at having to refuse any friend of miss curtis but mr mauleverers orders were precise and could not be infringed he was gone to lecture at bristol but if the gentleman would call at any hour he would fix to morrow or next day mr mauleverer would be proud to wait on him  when he came at the appointed time all was in the normal state of the institution the two little girls in white pinafores sat upon their bench with their books before them and their matron presiding over them mr mauleverer stood near benignantly attentive to the children and obligingly so to the visitor volunteering information and answering all questions colonel keith tried to talk to the children but when he asked one of them whether she liked drawing better than lacemaking her lips quivered and mrs rawlins replied for her that she was never happy except with a pencil in her hand show the gentleman my dear and out came a book of studios of cubes globes posts etc while mr mauleverer talked artistically of drawing from models next he observed on a certain suspicious blackness of little marys eye and asked her what she had done to herself but the child hung her head and mrs rawlins answered for her ah mary is ashamed to tell but the gentleman will think nothing of it my dear he knows that children will be children and i cannot bear to check them the dears  more briefly mr mauleverer explained that mary had fallen while playing on the stairs and with this superficial inspection he must needs content himself though on making inquiry at the principal shops he convinced himself that neither mr mauleverer nor the f u e e were as well known at st norberts as at avonmouth he told rachel of his expedition and his interest in her work gratified her though she would have preferred being his cicerone she assured him that he must have been very much pleased especially with the matron  she is a handsome woman and reminds me strongly of a face i saw in india  there are some classes of beauty and character that have a remarkable sameness of feature began rachel  dont push that theory for your matrons likeness was a very handsome sepoy havildar whom we took at lucknow a capital soldier before the mutiny and then an ineffable ruffian  the mutiny was an infectious frenzy so that you establish nothing against that cast of countenance  never indeed was there more occasion for perseverance in rachels championship hitherto mrs kelland had been nailed to her pillow by the exigencies of lady keiths outfit and she and her minions had toiled unremittingly without a thought beyond their bobbins but as soon as the postponed orders were in train and the cash for the wedding veil and flounces had been transmitted the good woman treated herself and her daughters to a holiday at st norberts without intimating her intention to her patronesses and the consequence was a formal complaint of her ungrateful and violent language to mrs rawlins on being refused admission to the asylum without authority from mr mauleverer or miss curtis  rachel much displeased went down charged with reproof and representation but failed to produce the desired effect upon the aunt  it was not right mrs kelland reiterated that the poor lone orphan should not see her that was as good as a mother when she had no one else to look to they that kept her from her didnt do it for no good end  but mrs kelland rules are rules  dont tell me of no rules miss rachel as would cut a poor child off from her friends as her mother gave her to on her deathbed sally says she i know you will do a mothers part by that poor little maid and so i did till i was over persuaded to let her go to that there place  indeed you have nothing to regret there mrs kelland you know that with the kindest intentions you could not make the child happy  and why was that maam but because her mother was a poor creature from town that had never broke her to her work i never had the trouble with a girl of my own i had with her its all for your good lovedy i says to her and poor child maybe she wishes herself back again  i assure you i always find the children well and happy and it is very unfair on the matron to be angry with her for being bound by rules to which she must submit or she would transgress the regulations under which we have laid her it is not her choice to exclude you but her duty  please maam was it her duty to be coming out of the house in a genta coloured silk dress and a drab bonnet with a pink feather in it said mrs kelland with a certain air of simplicity that provoked rachel to answer sharply  you dont know what you are talking about mrs kelland  well maam it was a very decent woman as told me an old lady of the name of drinkwater as keeps a bakers shop on the other side of the way and she never sees bread enough go in for a cat to make use of let alone three poor hungry children she says all is not right there maam  oh that must be mere gossip and spite at not having the custom it quite accounts for what she may say and indeed you brought it all on yourself by not having asked me for a note you must restrain yourself what you may say to me is of no importance but you must not go and attack those who are doing the very best for your niece  rachel made a dignified exit but before she had gone many steps she was assailed by tearful mrs morris oh miss rachel if it would not be displeasing to you would you give me an order for my child to come home ours is a poor place but i would rather make any shift for us to live than that she should be sent away to some place beyond sea  some place beyond sea  yes maam i beg your pardon maam but they do say that mr mawandliver is a kidnapper maam and that he gets them poor children to send out to botany bay to be wives to the convicts as are transported miss rachel if youll excuse it they say theres a whole shipload of them at plymouth and id rather my poor mary came to the union at home than to the like of that miss rachel  this alarm being less reasonable was even more difficult to talk down than mrs kellands and rachel felt as if there wore a general conspiracy to drive her distracted when on going home she found the drawingroom occupied by a pair of plump paddylooking old friends who had evidently talked her mother into a state of nervous alarm on her entrance mrs curtis begged the gentleman to tell dear rachel what he had been saying but this he contrived to avoid and only on his departure was rachel made aware that he and his wife had come fraught with tidings that she was fostering a jesuit in disguise that mrs rawlins was a lady abbess of a new order rachel herself in danger of being entrapped and the whole family likely to be entangled in the mysterious meshes which as good mrs curtis more than once repeated would be such a dreadful thing for poor fanny and the boys  her daughters by soothing and argument allayed the alarm though the impression was not easily done away with and they feared that it might yet cost her a nights rest these attacksabsurd as they wereinduced rachel to take measures for their confutation by writing to mr mauleverer that she thought it would be well to allow the pupils to pay a short visit to their homes so as to satisfy their friends  she did not receive an immediate answer and was beginning to feel vexed and anxious though not doubtful when mr mauleverer arrived bringing two beautiful little woodcuts as illustrations for the journal of female industry they were entitled the free maids that weave their thread with bones and one called the ideal represented a latticed cottage window with roses honeysuckles cat beehives and all conventional rural delights around a pretty maiden singing at her lacepillow while the other yclept the real showed a den of thin wizened halfstarved girls cramped over their cushions in a laceschool the design was mr mauleverers the execution the childrens and neatly mounted on cards the performance did them great credit and there was great justice in mr manleverers view that while they were making such progress it would be a great pity to interrupt the preparation of the first number by sending the children home even for a few hours rachel consented the more readily to the postponement of the holiday as she had now something to show in evidence of the reality of their doings and she laid hands upon the cuts in spite of mr mauleverers unwillingness that such mere essays should be displayed as specimens of the art of the f u e e when the twenty pounds which she advanced should have been laid out in blocks ink and paper there was little doubt that the illustrations of the journal would be a triumphant instance of female energy well directed  meantime she repaired to ermine williams to persuade her to write an article upon the two pictures a paper in the lively style in which rachel herself could not excel pointing out the selfishness of wilfully sentimental illusions she found ermine alone but her usual fate pursued her in the shape of first lady temple then both colonel and captain keith and little rose who all came in before she had had time to do more than explain her intentions rose had had another fright and again the colonel had been vainly trying to distinguish the bugbear of her fancy and she was clinging all the more closely to him because he was the only person of her aquaintance who did not treat her alarms as absolutely imaginary  rachel held her ground well pleased to have so many spectators of this triumphant specimen of the skill of her asylum and lady temple gave much admiration declaring that no one ought to wear lace again without being sure that no one was tortured in making it and that when she ordered her new black lace shawl of mrs kelland it should be on condition that the poor girls were not kept so very hard at work  you will think me looking for another sepoy likeness said the colonel but i am sure i have met this young lady or her twin sister somewhere in my travels  it is a satire on conventional pictures said rachel  now i remember he continued it was when i was laid up with my wound at a dutch boers till i could get to cape town my sole reading was one number of the illustrated news and i made too good acquaintance with that ladys head to forget her easily  of course said rachel it is a reminiscence of the painting there represented  what was the date asked alick keith  the colonel was able to give it with some precision  you are all against me said rachel i see you are perfectly determined that there shall be something wrong about every performance of the f u e e  no dont say so began fanny with gentle argument but alick keith put in with a smile it is a satisfaction to miss curtis  athanasius against the world she answered  athanasius should take care that his own foot is firm his position incontrovertible said ermine  well  then said ermine will you allow these little pictures to be examined into  i dont know what you mean  look here and the colonel lifted on the table a scrapbook that rose had been quietly opening on his knee and which contained an etching of a child playing with a dog much resembling the style of the drawing  who did that my dear he asked  mamma had it was roses reply it was always in my old nursery scraphook  every one knows said rachel that a woodcut is often like an etching and an etching like a woodcut i do not know what you are driving at  the little dogs and all muttered alick as rachel glanced rather indignantly at rose and her book so attentively examined by the colonel  i know repeated rachel that there is a strong prejudice against mr mauleverer and that it is entertained by many whom i should have hoped to see above such weakness but when i brought these tangible productions of his system as evidence of his success i did not expect to see them received with a covert distrust which i own i do not understand i perceive now why good works find so much difficulty in prospering  i believe said alick keith that i am to have the honour of dining at the homestead on monday  yes the greys spend the day with us and it is emilys due to have a good sight of you  then will you let me in the meantime take my own measures with regard to these designs i will not hurt or injure them in any way they shall be deposited here in miss williams hands and i promise you that if i have been able to satisfy myself as to the means of their production simon skinflint shall become a subscriber to the f u e e is it a bargain  i never made such a bargain said rachel puzzled  is that a reason for not doing so  i dont know what you mean to do not to molest that poor mrs rawlins i will not have that done  certainly not all i ask of you is that these works of art should remain here with miss williams as a safe neutral and that you should meet me here on monday when i will undertake to convince myself  not me cried rachel  who would make it part of his terms to convince a lady  you mean to say exclaimed rachel considerably nettled that as a woman i am incapable of being rationally convinced  the proverb does not only apply to women said ermine coming to her rescue but rachel stung by the arch smile and slight bow of captain keith continuedlet the proof be convincing and i will meet it as candidly as it is the duty of all reasonable beings to do only let me first know what you mean to prove  the terms are these then are they not miss williams i am to come on monday february the 5th prepared to test whether these designs are what they profess to be and miss curtis undertakes to be convinced by that proof provided it be one that should carry conviction to a clear unbiassed mind i undertake on the other hand that if the said proof should be effectual a mythical personage called simon skinflint shall become a supporter of the female union for englishwomens employment  ho spoke with his own peculiar slowness and gravity and rachel uncertain whether he were making game of her or not looked perplexed half on the defence half gratified the others were greatly amused and a great deal surprised at alicks unwonted willingness to take trouble in the matter after a few moments deliberation rachel said well i consent provided that my candour be met by equal candour on the other side and you will promise that if this ordeal succeeds you will lay aside all prejudice against mauleverer  a little demur as to the reasonableness of this stipulation followed but the terms finally were established mr and mrs grey old family friends had long been engaged to spend the ensuing monday at the homestead the elder daughter an old intimate of graces had married an indian civil servant whom colonel keith was invited to meet at luncheon and captain keith at dinner and alick was further to sleep at gowanbrae lady temple who was to have been of the party was called away much to her own regret by an appointment with the dentist of st norberts who was very popular and proportionately despotic being only visible at his own times after long appointment she would therefore be obliged to miss alicks ordeal though as she said when rachelfinding it vain to try to outstay so manyhad taken her leave i should much like to see how it will turn out i do believe that there is some difference in the colour of the ink in the middle and at the edge and if those people are deceiving rachel who knows what they may be doing to the poor children  it was exactly what every one was thinking but it seemed to have fresh force when it struck the milder and slower imagination and lady temple seeing that her observation told upon those around her became more impressed with its weight  it really is dreadful to have sent those little girls there without any one knowing what anybody does to them she repeated  it makes even alick come out in a new character said the colonel turning round on him  why returned alick my sister had so much to do with letting the young lady in for the scrape that it is just as well to try to get her out of it in fact i think we have all sat with our hands before us in a shamefully cool manner till we are all accountable for the humbuggery  when it comes to your reproaching us with coolness captain keith the matter becomes serious returned colin  it does become serious was the answer it is hard that a person without any natural adviser should have been allowed to run headlong by force of her own best qualities into the hands of a sharper i do not see how a man of any proper feeling can stand by without doing something to prevent the predicament from becoming any worse  if you can said colonel keith  i verily believe said alick turning round upon him that the worse it is for her the more you enjoy it  quite true said ermine in her mischievous way it is a true case of mans detestation of clever women look here alick we will not have him here at the great ordeal of the woodcuts you and i are much more candid and unprejudiced people and shall manage her much better  i have no desire to be present returned the colonel i have no satisfaction in seeing my friend alick baffled i shall see how they both appear at luncheon afterwards  how will that be asked fanny anxiously  the lady will be sententious and glorious and will recommend the f u e e more than ever and alick will cover the downfall of his crest by doubleedged assents to all her propositions  you will not have that pleasure said alick i only go to dinner there  at any rate said the colonel supposing your test takes effect by some extraordinary chance dont take any further steps without letting me know  the inference was drawn that he expected great results but he continued to laugh at alicks expectations of producing any effect on the clever woman and the debate of the woodcuts was adjourned to the monday  in good time rachel made her appearance in miss williamss little sittingroom i am ready to submit to any test that captain keith may require to confute himself she said to ermine and i do so the more readily that with all his mocking language there is a genuine candour and honesty beneath that would be quite worth convincing i believe that if once persuaded of the injustice of his suspicions he would in the reaction become a fervent supporter of mr mauleverer and of the institution and though i should prefer carrying on our work entirely through women yet this interest would be so good a thing for him that i should by no means reject his assistance  rachel had however long to wait as she said captain keith was one of those inborn loiterers who made punctual by military duty revenge themselves by double tardiness in the common affairs of life impatience had nearly made her revoke her good opinion of him and augur that knowing himself vanquished he had left the field to her when at last a sound of wheels was heard a dogcart stopped at the door and captain keith entered with an enormous blue and gold volume under his arm  i am sorry to be so late he said but i have only now succeeded in procuring my ally  an ally  yes in this book i had to make interest at the avoncester library before i could take it away with me as he spoke he placed the book deskfashion on a chair and turned it so that ermine might see it and she perceived that it was a boundup volume of the illustrated london news two marks were in it and he silently parted the leaves at the first  it revealed the lacemaking beauty in all her rural charms  i see said rachel it is the same figure but not the same shaped picture  without another word alick keith opened the pages at the laceschool and here again the figures were identical though the margin had been differently finished off  i perceive a great resemblance again said rachel but none that is not fully explained by mr mauleverers accurate resemblance and desire to satirize foolish sentiment  alick keith took up the woodcut i should say he observed holding it up to the light that it was unusual to mount a proof engraving so elaborately on a card  oh i see what your distrust is driving at you suspect the designs of being pasted on  there is such a test as water suggested alick  i should be ashamed to return the proof to its master bearing traces of unjust suspicion  if the suspicion you impute to me be unjust the water will produce no effect at all  and you engage to retract all your distrust and contempt if you are convinced that this engraving is genuine  i do he answered steadily  with irritated magnanimity rachel dipped her finger into the vase of flowers on the table and let a heavy drop of water fall upon the cottage scene the centre remained unaltered and she looked round in exultation saying there now i suppose i may wipe it off  neither spoke and she applied her pocket handkerchief what came peeling away under her pressure it was the soft paper and as she was passing the edge of the figure of the girl she found a large smear following her finger the peculiar brown of indian ink was seen upon her handkerchief and when she took it up a narrow hem of white had become apparent between the girls head and its surroundings neither spectator spoke they scarcely looked at her when she took another drop from the vase and using it more boldly found the pasted figure curling up and rending under her hand lines of newspaper type becoming apparent and the dark cloud spreading around  what does it mean was her first exclamation then suddenly turning on ermine well do you triumph  i am very very sorry said ermine  i do not know that it is come to that yet said rachel trying to collect herself i may have been pressing too hard for results then looking at the mangled picture again as they wisely left her to herself but it is a deception a deception oh he need not have done it or with a lightened look and tone of relief suppose he did it to see whether i should find it out  he is hardly on terms with you for that said ermine while alick could not refrain from saying then he would be a more insolent scoundrel than he has shown himself yet  i know he is not quite a gentleman said rachel and nothing else gives the instinct of the becoming you have conquered captain keith if it be any pleasure to you to have given my trust and hope a cruel shock  with little satisfaction to myself he began to say but she continued a shock a shock i say no more i do not know what conclusion i ought to draw i do not expect you to believe in this person till he has cleared up the deceit if it be only a joke in bad taste he deserves the distrust that is the penalty for it if you have been opening my eyes to a deception perhaps i shall thank you for it some day i must think it over  she rose gathered her papers together and took her leave gravely while alick much to ermines satisfaction showed no elation in his victory all he said was there is a great deal of dignity in the strict justice of a mind slow to condemn or to withdraw the trust once given  there is said ermine much pleased with his whole part in the affair there has been full and real candour not flying into the other extreme i am afraid she has a great deal to suffer  it was very wrong to have stood so still when the rascal began his machinations repeated alick bessie absolutely helping it on but for her the fellow would have had no chance even of acquaintance with her  your sister hardly deserves blame for that  not exactly blame but the responsibility remains he replied gravely and indeed he was altogether much graver than his wont entirely free from irony and evidently too sorry for rachel and feeling himself through his sister too guilty of her entanglement to have any of that amused satisfaction that even colin evidently felt in her discomfiture in fact ermine did not fully enter into colins present tactics she saw that he was more than usually excited and interested about the f u e e but he had not explained his views to her and she could only attribute his desire to defer the investigation to a wish that mr mitchell should have time to return from london whither he had gone to conclude his arrangements with mr touchett leaving the duty in commission between three delicate winter visitors  rachel walked home in a kind of dreamy bewilderment the first stone in her castle had been loosened and her heart was beginning to fail her though the tenacity of her will produced a certain incapacity of believing that she had been absolutely deceived her whole fabric was so compact and had been so much solidified by her own intensity of purpose that any hollowness of foundation was utterly beyond present credence she was ready to be affronted with mauleverer for perilling all for a bad joke but wildly impossible as this explanation would have seemed to others she preferred taking refuge in it to accepting the full brunt of the blow upon her cherished hopes  she had just reentered the house on her return when grace met her saying oh rachel dear mrs rossitur is here  i think old servants have a peculiar propensity for turning up when the house is in a state of turmoil returned rachel  i have been walking round the garden with her and doing my best to suffice for her entertainment said grace goodnaturedly but she really wants to see you on business she has a bill for the f u e e which she wants you to pay  a bill for the f u e e  yes she makes many apologies for troubling you but tom is to be apprenticed to a grocer and they want this fifteen pounds to make up the fee  but i tell you grace there cant have been fifteen pounds worth of things had in this month and they were paid on the 1st  she says they have never been paid at all since the 1st of december  i assure you grace it is in the books i made a point of having all the accounts brought to me on the 1st of every month and giving out the money i gave out £3 10s for the rossiturs last friday the 1st of february when mr mauleverer was over here he said coals were dearer and they had to keep more fires  there must be some mistake said grace ill show you the books mr mauleverer keeps one himself and leaves one with me oh botheration theres the grey carriage well you go and receive them and ill try to pacify mrs rossitur and then come down  neatly kept were these account books of the f u e e and sure enough for every month were entered the sums for coals wood and potatoes tallying exactly with mrs rossiturs account and each month mr mauleverers signature attested the receipt of the sum paid over to him by rachel for household expenses rachel carried them down to mrs rossitur but this evidence utterly failed to convince that worthy personage that she had ever received a farthing after the 1st of december she was profuse in her apologies for troubling miss rachel and had only been led to do so by the exigencies of her sons apprentice fee and she reposed full confidence in rachels eager assurance that she should not be a loser and that in another day the matter should be investigated  and miss rachel added the old servant youll excuse me but they do say very odd things of the matron at that place and i doubt you are deceived in her our lads went to the theater the other night and i checked them well for it but mother says they we had more call to be there than the governess up to miss rachels schule in nichol street dressed out in pink feathers  well mrs rossitur i will make every inquiry and i do not think you will find anything wrong there must be some one about very like mrs rawlins i have heard of those pink feathers before but i know who the matron is and all about her goodbye ill see you again before you go i suppose it wont be till the seven oclock train  mrs rossitur remained expressing her opinion to the butler that dear miss rachel was too innocent and then proceeded to lose all past cares in a happy return to melting day in the regions of her past glories as cook and housekeeper  rachel repaired to her room to cool her glowing cheeks and repeat to herself a mistake an error it must be a blunder that boy that went to the theatre may have cheated them mrs rawlins may have deceived mr mauleverer anything must be true rather thanno no such a tissue of deception is impossible in a man of such sentiments persecuted as he has been shall appearances make meme his only friendturn against him oh me here come the whole posse purring upstairs to take off their things i shall be invaded in a moment  and in came grace and the two younger ladies and rachel was no more her own from that moment     chapter xviii the forlorn hope     she whipped two female prentices to death   and hid them in the coalhole  for her mind   shaped strictest plans of discipline sage schemes   such as lycurgus taughtcanning and frere   the favourite dentist of the neighbourhood dwelt in a grand mansion at st norberts and thither were conducted conrade and francis as victims to the symmetry of their mouths their mother accompanied them to supply the element of tenderness alison that of firmness and in fact lady temple was in a state of much greater trepidation than either of her sons who had been promised five shillings each as the reward of fortitude and did nothing but discuss what they should buy with it  they escaped with a reprieve to conrade and the loss of one tooth of franciss and when the rewards had been laid out and presents chosen for all the stayathome children including rose lady temple became able to think about other matters the whole party were in a little den at the pastrycooks the boys consuming mutton pies and the ladies oxtail soup while waiting to be taken up by the waggonette which had of late been added to the myrtlewood establishment when the little lady thus spoke  if you dont object miss williams we will go to rachels asylum on our way home  miss williams asked if she had made the appointment  no said lady temple but you see i cant be satisfied about those woodcuts and that poor woman mrs kelland came to me yesterday about my lace shawl and she is sadly distressed about the little girl she was not allowed to see her you know and she heard such odd things about the place that i told her that i did not wonder she was in trouble and that i would try to bring the child home or at any rate see and talk to her  i hope we may be able to see her but you know colonel keith could not get in without making an appointment  i pay for her said lady temple and i cannot bear its going on in this way without some one seeing about it the colonel was quite sure those woodcuts were mere fabrications to deceive rachel and there must be something very wrong about those people  did she know that you were going  no i did not see her before we went i do not think she will mind it much and i promised lady temple faltered a little but gathered courage the next moment and indeed after what mrs kelland said i could not sleep while i thought i had been the means of putting any poor child into such hands  yes said alison it is very shocking to leave them there without inquiry and it is an excellent thing to make the attempt  and so the order was given to drive to the asylum alison marvelling at the courage which prompted this most unexpected assault upon the fortress that had repulsed two such warriors as colonel keith and mrs kelland but timid and tender as she might be it was not for nothing that fanny temple had been a vicequeen so much accustomed to be welcomed wherever she penetrated that the notion of a rebuff never suggested itself  coombe rang and his lady made him let herself and miss williams out so that she was on the step when the rough charwoman opened the door and made the usual reply that mr mauleverer was not within lady temple answered that it was mrs rawlins the matron that she wished to see and with more audacity than alison thought her capable of inserted herself within the doorway so as to prevent herself from being shut out as the girl took her message the next moment the girl came back saying this way maam opened the door of a small dreary dusty cold parlour where she shut them in and disappeared before a word could be said  there they remained so long that in spite of such encouragement as could be derived from peeping over the blinds at coombe standing sentinel over his two young masters at the carriage window lady temple began to feel some dismay though no repentance and with anxious iteration conjured miss williams to guess what could be the cause of delay  making ready for our reception was alisons answer in various forms and lady temple repeated by turns i do not like it and it is very unsatisfactory no i dont like it at all the at all always growing more emphatic  the climax was things must be very sad or they would never take so much preparation ill tell you miss williams she added in a low confidential tone there are two of us and the woman cannot be in two places at once now if you go up and see the rooms and all which i saw long ago i could stay and talk to the poor children  alison was the more surprised at the simple statecraft of the generals widow but it was prompted by the pitiful heart yearning over the mysterious wrongs of the poor little ones  at last mrs rawlins sailed in crape streamers and all with the lowest of curtsies and fullest of apologies for having detained her ladyship but she had been sending out in pursuit of mr mauleverer he would be so disappointed lady temple begged to see the children and especially lovedy whom she said she should like to take home for a holiday  why my lady you see mr mauleverer is very particular i hardly know that i could answer it to him to have one of his little darlings out of his sight it unsettles a child so to be going home and lovedy has a bad cold my lady and i am afraid it will run through the house my little alice is beginning of it  however lady temple kept to her desire of seeing lovedy and of letting her companion see the rest of the establishment and they were at last ushered into the room already known to the visitors of the f u e e where the two children sat as usual in white pinafores but it struck the ladies that all looked ill and lovedy was wrapped in a shawl and sat cowering in a dull stupified way unlike the bright responsive manner for which she had been noted even in her laceschool days mary morris gazed for a moment at alison with a wistful appealing glance then with a start as of fright put on a sullen stolid look and kept her eyes on her book the little alice looking very heavy and feverish leant against her and mrs rawlins went on talking of the colds the gruel she had made and her care for her pupils ailments and lady temple listened so graciously that alison feared she was succumbing to the palaver and by way of reminder asked to see the dormitory  oh yes maam certainly though we are rather in confusion and she tried to make both ladies precede her but lady temple for once assuming the uncomprehending nonchalance of a fine lady seated herself languidly and motioned alison on the matron was evidently perplexed she looked daggers at the children or ailie fancied so but she was forced to follow the governess lady temple breathed more freely and rose my poor child she said to lovedy you seem very poorly have you any message to your aunt  please please began lovedy with a hoarse sob  lovedy dont dont be a bad girl or you know interposed the little one in a warning whisper  she is not naughty said lady temple gently only not well  please my lady look eagerly though with a fugitive action of terror lovedy cried unpinning the thin coarse shawl on her neck and revealing the terrible stripes and weals of recent beating such as nearly sickened lady temple  oh lovedy entreated alice shell take the big stick  she could not do her work interposed mary with furtive eagerness she is so poorly and missus said she would have the twenty sprigs if she sat up all night  sprigs  yes maam we makes lace more than ever we did to home day and night and if we dont she takes the stick  oh mary implored the child she said if you said one word  mary said lady temple trembling all over where are your bonnets  we havent none maam returned mary she pawned them but oh maam please take us away we are used dreadful bad and no one knows it  lady temple took lovedy in one hand and mary in the other then looked at the other little girl who stood as if petrified she handed the pair to the astonished coombe bidding him put them into the carriage and let master temple go outside and then faced about to defend the rear her rustling black silk and velvet filling up the passage just as alison and the matron were coming down stairs  mrs rawlins she said in her gentle dignity i think lovedy is so poorly that she ought to go home to her aunt to be nursed and i have taken little mary that she may not be left behind alone please to tell mr mauleverer that i take it all upon myself the other little girl is not at all to blame and i hope you will take care of her for she looks very ill  so much for being a governors widow a woman of thrice fannys energy and capacity would not have effected her purpose so simply and made the virago in the matron so entirely quail she swept forth with such a consciousness of power and ease that few could have had assurance enough to gainsay her but no sooner was she in the carriage than she seized marys hand exclaiming my poor poor little dear francis dear boy the wicked people have been beating her oh miss williams look at her poor neck  alison lifting lovedy on her knee glanced under the shawl and saw indeed a sad spectacle and she felt such a sharpness of bone as proved that there was far from being the proper amount of clothing or of flesh to protect them lady temple looked at marys attenuated hand and fairly sobbed oh you have been cruelly treated  please dont let her get us cried the frightened mary  never never my dear we are taking you home to your mother  mary morris was the spokeswoman and volunteered the exhibition of bruises rather older but no less severe than those of her companion all had been inflicted by the woman mr mauleverer had seldom or never been seen by the children except alice who used often to be called into mrs rawlinss parlour when he was there to be played with and petted a charwoman was occasionally called in but otherwise the entire work of the house was exacted from the two girls and they had been besides kept perpetually to their lace pillows and severely beaten if they failed in the required amount of work the ample wardrobe with which their patronesses had provided them had been gradually taken from them and their fare had latterly become exceedingly coarse and very scanty it was a sad story and this last clause evoked from franciss pocket a large currant bun which mary devoured with a famished appetite but lovedy held her portion untasted in her hand and presently gave it to mary saying that her throat was so bad that she could not make use of anything she had already been wrapped in lady temples cloak and francis was desired to watch for a chemists shop that something might be done for her relief but the region of shops was already left behind and even the villas were becoming scantier so that nothing was to be done but to drive on obtaining from time to time further doleful narratives from mary and perceiving more and more how ill and suffering was the other poor child  moreover lady temples mind became extremely uneasy as to the manner in which rachel might accept her exploit all her valour departed as she figured to herself that young lady discrediting the alarm and resenting her interference she did not repent she knew she could not have helped it and she had rather have been tortured by rachel than have left the victims another hour to the f u e e but she was full of nervous anxiety little as she yet guessed at the full price of her courage and she uttered more than once the fervent wish that the colonel had been there for he would have known what to do and alison each time replied i wish it with all my heart  wrought up at last to the pitch of nervousness that must rush on the crisis at once and take the bull by the horns this valiant piece of cowardice declared that she could not even return the girls to their homes till rachel knew all about it and gave the word to drive to the homestead further cheered by the recollection that colonel keith would probably be there having been asked to luncheon as he could not dine out to meet mr grey moreover mr grey was a magistrate and would know what was to be done  thus the whole party at the homestead were assembled near the door when discerning them too late to avoid them lady temples equipage drew up in the peculiarly ungraceful fashion of waggonettes when they prepare to shoot their passengers out behind  conrade the only person who had the advantage of a previous view stood up on the box and before making his descent shouted out oh aunt rachel your f u thing is as bad as the sepoys but we have saved the two little girls that they were whipping to death and have got them in the carriage  while this announcement was being delivered alison williams the nearest to the door had emerged she lifted out the little muffled figure of lovedy set her on her feet and then looking neither to the right nor left as if she saw and thought of no one else made but one bound towards colonel keith clasped both hands round his arm turned him away from the rest and with her black brows drawn close together gasped under her breath o colin colin it is maria hatherton  what the matron  yes the woman that has used these poor children like a savage o colin it is frightful  you should sit down you are almost ready to faint  nothing nothing but the poor girls are in such a state and that maria whom we taught and alison stopped  did she know you  i cant tell perhaps but i did not know her till the last moment  i have long believed that the man that rose recognised was mauleverer but i thought the uncertainty would be bad for ermine what is all this  you will hear there listen i cant tell you lady temple did it all said alison trying to draw away her arm from him and to assume the staid governess but he felt her trembling and did not release her from his support as they fanned back to the astonished group to which while these few words were passing francis the little bareheaded whiteaproned mary morris and lastly lady temple had by this time been added and fanny with quick but courteous acknowledgment of all was singling out her cousin  oh rachel dear i did not mean it to have been so sudden or before them all but indeed i could not help it she said in her gentle imploring voice if you only saw that poor dear childs neck  rachel had little choice what she should say or do what fanny was saying tenderly and privately the two boys were communicating openmouthed and mrs curtis came at once with her nervous what is it my dear is it something very sad those poor children look very cold and half starved  indeed said fanny they have been starved and beaten and cruelly used i am very sorry rachel but indeed that was a dreadful woman and i thought colonel keith and mr grey would tell us what ought to be done  mr grey and mrs curtis turned round eagerly with the comfort of having some one to support her will you tell us what is to be done here has poor dear rachel been taken in by this wicked scheme and these poor  mother mother muttered rachel lashed up to desperation please not out here before the servants and every one  this appeal and graces opening of the door had the effect of directing every one into the hall mr grey asking mrs curtis by the way eh then this is rachels new female asylum is it  yes i always feared there was something odd about it i never liked that man and nowfanny my love what is the matter  in a few simple words fanny answered that she had contrived to be left alone with the children and had then found signs of such shocking illtreatment of them that she had thought it right to bring them away at once  and you will commit those wretches you will send them to prison at once mr grey they have been deceiving my poor rachel ever so long and getting sums upon sums of money out of her said mrs curtis becoming quite bloodthirsty  if there is sufficient occasion i will summon the persons concerned to the bench on wednesday said mr grey a practical active squire  not till wednesday said mrs curtis as if she thought the course of justice very tardy but the remembrance of mr curtiss magisterial days came to her aid and she continued but you can take all the examinations here at once you know and grace can find you a summons paper if you will just go into the study  it might save the having the children over tomorrow certainly said mr grey and he was inducted almost passively into the leathern chair before the library table where mr curtis had been wont to administer justice and grace was diving deep into a bureau for the printed forms long treasured there her mother directing her though mr grey vainly protested that any foolscap would do as well it was a curious scene mrs grey with her daughters had the discretion to remove themselves but every one else was in a state of excitement and pressed into the room the two boys disputing under their breath whether the civilians called it a court martial and with some confusion between mutineers and englishwomen hoping the woman would be blown from the mouth of a cannon for hadnt she gone and worn a cap like mammas they would have referred the question to miss williams but she had been deposited by the colonel on one of the chairs in the furthest corner of the room and he stood sheltering her agitation and watching the proceedings lady temple still held a hand of each of her rescued victims as if she feared they were still in danger and all the time rachel stood and looked like a statue unable to collect her convictions in the hubbub and the trust that would have enabled her to defy all this swept away from her by the mornings transactions yet still there was a hope that appearances might be delusive and an habitual low estimate of mr greys powers that made her set on looking with her own eyes not with his  his first question was about the childrens names and their friends and this led to the despatching of a message to the mother and aunt he then inquired about the terms on which they had been placed at st norberts and rachel who was obliged to reply felt under his clear stringent questions keeping close to the point a good deal more respect for his powers than she had hitherto entertained that dry way of his was rather overwhelming when it came to the children themselves rachel watched not without a hope that the clear masculine intellect would detect fanny in a more frightened womans fancy and bring the f u e e off with flying colours  little mary morris stood forth valiant and excited she was eleven years old and intelligent enough to make it evident that she knew what she was about the replies were full the blows were described with terrible detail of the occasions and implements still rachel remembered the accusation of marys truth she tried to doubt  i saw her with a bruised eye said the colonels unexpected voice in a pause how was that  please sir mrs rawlins hit me with her fist because i had only done seven sprigs she knocked me down and i did not come to for ever so long  and not only this and the like sad narratives but each child bore the marks in corroboration of the words which were more reluctant and more hoarse from lovedy but even more effective rachel doubted no more after the piteous sight of those scarred shoulders and the pinched feeble face but one thing was plain namely that mr mauleverer had no share in the cruelties even such severities as had been perpetrated while he was in the house had mary thought been protested against by him but she had seldom seen him he paid all his visits in the little parlour and took no notice of the children except to prepare the tableau for public inspection mr grey looking at his notes said that there was full evidence to justify issuing a summons against the woman for assaulting the children and proceeded to ask her name then while there was a question whether her christian name was known the colonel again said i believe her name to be maria hatherton miss williams has recognised her as a servant who once lived in her family and who came from her fathers parish at beauchamp  alison on inquiry corroborated the statement and the charge was made against maria rawlins alias hatherton the depositions were read over to the children and signed by them with very trembling fingers by poor little lovedy and mr grey said he would send a policeman with the summons early next day  but mr grey burst out mrs curtis you dont mean that you are not going to do anything to that man why he has been worse than the woman it was he that entrapped the poor children and my poor rachel here with his stories of magazines and illustrations and i dont know what all  very true mrs curtis said the magistrate but wheres the charge against him  it may be conceived how pleasant it was to the clever woman of the family to hear her mother declaiming on the arts by which she had been duped by this adventurer appealing continually to grace and fanny and sometimes to herself and all before mr grey on whose oldworld prejudices she had bestowed much more antagonism than he had thought it worth while to bestow on her new lights yet at the moment this operation of being written down an ass was less acutely painful to her than the perception that was simultaneously growing on her of the miserable condition of poor little lovedy whose burning hand she held and whose gasping breath she heard as the child rested feebly in the chair in which she had been placed rachel had nothing vindictive or selfish in her mood and her longing was above all to get away and minister to the poor childs present sufferings but she found herself hemmed in and pinned down by the investigation pushed on by her mother involving answers and explanations that she alone could make  mr grey rubbed his forehead and looked freshly annoyed at each revelation of the state of things it had not been mauleverer but rachel who had asked subscriptions for the education of the children he had but acted as her servant the counterfeit of the woodcuts which lady temple suggested could not be construed into an offence and it looked very much as if thanks to his cleverness and rachels incaution there was really no case to be made out against him as if the fox had carried off the bait without even leaving his brush behind him sooth to say the failure was a relief to rachel she had thrown so much of her will and entire self into the upholding him that she could not yet detach herself or sympathize with those gentle souls the mother and fanny in keenly hunting him down might he not have been as much deceived in mrs rawlins as herself at any rate she hoped for time to face the subject and kneeling on the ground so as to support little lovedys sinking head on her shoulder made the briefest replies in her power when referred to at last grace recollected the mornings affair of mrs rossiturs bills mr grey looked as if he saw daylight grace volunteered to fetch both the accountbook and mrs rossitur and rachel found the statement being extracted from her of the monthly production of the bills with the entries in the book and of her having given the money for their payment mr grey began to write and she perceived that he was taking down her deposition she beckoned mary to support her poor little companion and rising to her feet said to the horror and consternation of her mother mr grey pray let me speak to you  he rose at once and followed her to the hall where he looked prepared to be kind but firm  must this be done today she said  why not he answered  i want time to think about it the woman has acted like a fiend and i have not a word to say for her but i cannot feel that it is fair after such long and entire trust of this man to turn on him suddenly without notice  do you mean that you will not prosecute said mr grey with a dozen notes of interjection in his voice  i have not said so i want time to make up my mind and to hear what he has to say for himself  you will hear that at the bench on wednesday  it will not be the same thing  i should hope not  you see said rachel perplexed and grievously wanting time to rally her forces i cannot but feel that i have trusted too easily and perhaps been to blame myself for my implicit confidence and after that it revolts me to throw the whole blame on another  if you have been a simpleton does that make him an honest man said mr grey impatiently  no said rachel but  what  my credulity may have caused his dishonesty she said bringing at last the words to serve the idea  look you here rachel said mr grey constraining himself to argue patiently with his old friends daughter it does not simply lie between you and hima silly girl who has let herself be taken in by a sharper that would be no more than giving a sixpence to a fellow that tells me he lost his arm at sebastopol when he has got it sewn up in a bag but you have been getting subscriptions from all the world making yourself answerable to them for having these children educated and then for want of proper superintendence or the merest rational precaution leaving them to this barbarous usage i dont want to be hard upon you but you are accountable for all this you have made yourself so and unless you wish to be regarded as a sharer in the iniquity the least you can do by way of compensation is not to make yourself an obstruction to the course of justice  i dont much care how i am regarded said rachel with subdued tone and sunken head i only want to do right and not act spitefully and vindictively before he has had warning to defend himself  or to set off to delude as many equal foomistaken people as he can find elsewhere eh rachel dont you see it this friend of yours be innocent a summons will not hurt him it will only give him the opportunity of clearing himself  yes i see owned rachel and overpowered though far from satisfied she allowed herself to be brought back and did what was required of her to the intense relief of her mother during her three minute conference no one in the study had ventured on speaking or stirring and mrs curtis would not thank her biographer for recording the wild alarms that careered through her brain as to the object of her daughters teteatete with the magistrate  it was over at last and the hall of justice broke up mary morris was at once in her mothers arms and in a few minutes more making up for all past privations by a substantial meal in the kitchen but mrs kelland had gone to avoncester to purchase thread and only her daughter susan had come up the girl who was supposed to be a sort of spider with no capacities beyond her web nor did rachel think lovedy capable of walking down to mackarel lane nor well enough for the comfortless chairs and the third part of a bed no mr greys words that rachel was accountable for the childrens sufferings had gone to her heart pity was there and indignation but these had brought such an anguish of selfaccusation as she could only appease by lavishing personal care upon the chief sufferer she carried the child to her own sittingroom and made a couch for her before the fire sending susan away with the assurance that lovedy should stay at the homestead and be nursed and fed till she was well and strong again fanny who had accompanied her thought the child very ill and was urgent that the doctor should be sent for but between rachel and the faculty of avonmouth there was a deadly feud and the proposal was scouted hunger and a bad cold were easily treated and maybe there was a spark of consolation in having a patient all to herself and her homoeopathic book  so fanny and her two boys walked down the hill together in the dark colonel keith and alison williams had already taken the same road anxiously discussing the future alison asked why colin had not given mauleverers alias i had no proof he said you were sure of the woman but so far it is only guess work with him though each time rose spoke of seeing maddox coincided with one of mauleverers visits besides alison on the back of that etching in roses book is written mrs williams from her humble and obliged servant r maddox  and you said nothing about it  no i wished to make myself secure and to see my way before speaking out  what shall you do can you trust to roses identifying him  i shall ride in tomorrow to see what is going on and judge if it will be well to let her see this man if he have not gone off as i should fear was only too likely poor little lady temple her exploit has precipitated matters  and you will let every one dr long and all know what a wretch they have believed and then  stay alison i am afraid they will not take maddoxs subsequent guilt as a proof of edwards innocence  it is a proof that his stories were not worth credit  to you and me it is who do not need such proof it is possible that among his papers something may be found that may implicate him and clear edward but we can only hold off and watch and i greatly fear both man and woman will have slipped through our fingers especially if she knew you  poor maria who could have thought of such frightful barbarity sighed alison i knew she was a passionate girl but this is worse than one can bear to believe  she ceased for she had been inexpressibly shocked and her heart still yearned towards every beauchamp school child  i suppose we must tell ermine she added indeed i know i could not help it  nor i he said smiling though there is only too much fear that nothing will come of it but disappointment at least she will tell us how to meet that     chapter xix the brewst she brewed     unwisely not ignobly have i given                             timon of athens   under the circumstances of the curtis family no greater penance could have been devised than the solemn dinner party which had to take place only an hour after the investigation was closed grace in especial was nearly distracted between her desire to calm her mother and to comfort her sister and the necessity of attending to the grey family who repaid themselves for their absence from the scene of action by a torrent of condolences and questions whence poor grace gathered to her horror and consternation that the neighbourhood already believed that a tenderer sentiment than philanthropy had begun to mingle in rachels relations with the secretary of the f u e e feeling it incumbent on the whole family to be as lively and indifferent as possible grace having shut her friends into their rooms to perform their toilette hurried to her sister to find her so entirely engrossed with her patient as absolutely to have forgotten the dinner party no wonder she had had to hunt up a housemaid to make up a bed for lovedy in a little room within her own and the undressing and bathing of the poor child had revealed injuries even in a more painful state than those which had been shown to mr grey shocking emaciation and most scanty garments the child was almost torpid and spoke very little she was most unwilling to attempt to swallow however rachel thought that some of her globules had gone down and put much faith in them and in warmth and sleep but incessantly occupied and absolutely sickened by the sight of the childs hurts she looked up with loathing at graces entreaty that she would dress for the dinner  impossible she said  you must rachel dear indeed you must  as if i could leave her  nay rachel but if you would only send  nonsense grace if i can stay with her i can restore her far better than could an allopathist who would not leave nature to herself o grace why cant you leave me in peace is it not bad enough without this  dear rachel i am very sorry but if you did not come down to dinner think of the talk it would make  let them talk  ah rachel but the mother think how dreadful the days work has been to her and how can she ever get through the evening if she is in a fright at your not coming down  dinner parties are one of the most barbarous institutions of past stupidity said rachel and grace was reassured she hovered over rachel while rachel hovered over the sick child and between her own exertions and those of two maids had put her sister into an evening dress by the time the first carriage arrived she then rushed to her own room made her own toilette and returned to find rachel in conference with mrs kelland who had come home at last and was to sit with her niece during the dinner perhaps it was as well for all parties that this first interview was cut very short but rachels burning cheeks did not promise much for the impression of ease and indifference she was to make as graces whispered reminders of the mothers distress dragged her down stairs among the all too curious glances of the assembled party  all had been bustle not one moment for recollection had yet been rachels mr greys words accountable for all throbbed in her ears and echoed in her brainthe purple bruises the red stripes verging upon sores were before her eyes and the lights the flowers the people and their greetings were like a dizzy mist the space before dinner was happily but brief and then as last lady she came in as a supernumerary on the other arm of graces cavalier and taking the only vacant chair found herself between a squire and captain keith who had duly been bestowed on emily grey  here there was a moments interval of quiet for the squire was slightly deaf and moreover regarded her as a little pert girl not to be encouraged while captain keith was resigned to the implied homage of the adorer of his cross so that though the buzz of talk and the clatter of knives and forks roared louder than it had ever seemed to do since she had been a child listening from the outside the immediate sense of hurry and confusion and the impossibility of seeing or hearing anything plainly began to diminish she could not think but she began to wonder whether any one knew what had happened and above all she perfectly dreaded the quiet sting of her neighbours word and eye in this consummation of his victory if he glanced at her she knew she could not bear it and if he never spoke to her at all it would be marked reprehension which would be far better than sarcasm he was evidently conscious of her presence for when in her insatiable thirst she had drained her own supply of water she found the little bottle quietly exchanged for that before him it was far on in the dinner before emilys attention was claimed by the gentleman on her other hand and then there was a space of silence before captain keith almost made rachel start by saying  this has come about far more painfully than could have been expected  i thought you would have triumphed she said  no indeed i feel accountable for the introduction that my sister brought upon you  it was no fault of hers said rachel sadly  i wish i could feel it so  that was a mere chance the rest was my own doing  aided and abetted by more than one lookeron  no it is i who am accountable she said repeating mr greys words  you accept the whole  it was his usual cool dry tone but as she replied i must she involuntarily looked up with a glance of entreaty to be spared and she met those dark grey heavylidded eyes fixed on her with so much concern as almost to unnerve her  you cannot he answered every bystander must rue the apathy that let you be so cruelly deceived for want of exertion on their part  nay she said you tried to open my eyes i think this would have come worse but for this mornings stroke  thank you he said earnestly  i daresay you know more than i have been able to understand she presently added it is like being in the middle of an explosion without knowing what stands or falls  and lobster salad as an aggravation said he as the dish successively persecuted them this dinner is hard on you  very but my mother would have been unhappy if i had stayed away it is the leaving the poor child that grieves me she is in a fearful state between sore throat starvation and blows  the picture of the effect of the blows coming before rachel at that moment perilled her ability even to sit through the dinner but her companion saw the suddening whitening of her cheek and by a dexterous signal at once caused her glass to be filled habit was framing her lips to say something about never drinking wine but somehow she felt a certain compulsion in his look and her compliance restored her she returned to the subject saying but it was only the woman that was cruel  she had not her sepoy face for nothing  did i hear that miss williams knew her  yes it seems she was a maid who had once been very cruel to little rose williams the colonel seems to think the discovery may have important consequences i hardly know how  this conversation sent rachel out of the diningroom more like herself than she had entered it but she ran upstairs at once to lovedy and remained with her till disinterred by the desperate grace who could not see three people talking together without blushing with indignation at the construction they were certainly putting on her sisters scarlet cheeks and absence from the drawingroom with all graces efforts however she could not bring her truant back before the gentlemen had come in captain keith had seen their entrance and soon came up to rachel  how is your patient he asked  she is very ill and the worst of it is that it seems such agony to her to attempt to swallow  have you had advice for her  no i have often treated colds and i thought this a case aggravated by that wicked treatment  have you looked into her mouth  yes the skin is frightfully brown and dry  he leant towards her and asked in an under tone  did you ever see diphtheria  noher brow contractingdid you  yes we had it through all the children of the regiment at woolwich  you think this is it  he asked a few more questions and his impression was evidently confirmed  i must send for mr frampton said rachel homeopathy succumbing to her terror but then with a despairing glance she beheld all the male part of the establishment handing tea  where does he live ill send him up  thank you oh thank you the house with the rails under the east cliff  he was gone and rachel endured the reeling of the lights and the surges of talk and the musical performances that seemed to burst the drum of her ear and after all people went away saying to each other that there was something very much amiss and that poor dear mrs curtis was very much to blame for not having controlled her daughters  they departed at last and grace without uttering the terrible word was explaining to the wornout mother that little lovedy was more unwell and that captain keith had kindly offered to fetch the doctor when the captain himself returned  i am sorry to say that mr frampton is out not likely to be at home till morning and his partner is with a bad accident at avonford the best plan will be for me to ride back to avoncester and send out macvicar our doctor he is a kindhearted man of much experience in this kind of thing  but you are not going back said polite mrs curtis far from taking in the urgency of the case you were to sleep at colonel keiths i could not think of your taking the trouble  i have settled that with the colonel thank you my dogcart will be here directly  i can only say thank you said rachel earnestly but is there nothing to be done in the meantime do you know the treatment  he knew enough to give a few directions which revealed to poor mrs curtis the character of the disease  that horrible new sore throat oh rachel and you have been hanging over her all this time  indeed said alick keith coming to her i think you need not be alarmed the complaint seems to me to depend on the air and locality i have been often with people who had it  and not caught it  no though one poor little fellow our pipers son would not try to take food from any one else and died at last on my knee i do not believe it is infectious in that way  and hearing his carriage at the door he shook hands and hurried off mrs curtis observing  he really is a very good young man but oh rachel my dear how could you bring her here  i did not know mother any way it is better than her being in mrs kellands hive of children  you are not going back to her rachel i entreat  mother i must you heard what captain keith said let that comfort you it would be brutal cruelty and cowardice to stay away from her to night good night grace make mother see that it must be so  she went for poor mrs curtis could not withstand her and only turned with tearful eyes to her elder daughter to say you do not go into the room again grace i insist  grace could not bear to leave rachel to the misery of such a vigil and greatly reproached herself for the hurry that had prevented her from paying any heed to the condition of the child in her anxiety to make her sister presentable but mrs curtis was in a state of agitation that demanded all the care and tenderness of this mothers child and the sharing her room and bed made it impossible to elude the watchfulness that nervously guarded the remaining daughter  it was eleven oclock when alexander keith drove from the door it was a moonlight night and he was sure to spare no speed but he could hardly be at avoncester within an hour and a half and the doctor would take at least two in coming out mrs kelland was the companion of rachels watch the woman was a good deal subdued the strangeness of the great house tamed her and she was shocked and frightened by the little girls state as well as by the young ladys grave awestruck and silent manner  they tried all that captain keith had suggested but the child was too weak and spent to inhale the steam of vinegar and the attempts to make her swallow produced fruitless anguish they could not discover how long it was since she had taken any nourishment and they already knew what a miserable pittance hers had been at the best mrs kelland gave her up at once and protested that she was following her mother and that there was death in her face rachel made an imperious gesture of silence and was obeyed so far as voice went but longdrawn sighs and shakes of the head continued to impress on her the aunts hopelessness throughout the endeavours to change the position the moistening of the lips the attempts at relief in answer to the choked effort to cough the weary faint moan the increasing faintness and exhaustion  one oclock struck and mrs kelland said in a low ominous voice it is the turn of the night miss rachel you bad best leave her to me  i will never leave her said rachel impatiently  you are a young lady miss rachel you aint used to the like of this  hark rachel held up her finger  wheels were crashing up the hill the horrible responsibility was over the immediate terror gone help seemed to be coming at the utmost speed and tears of relief rushed into rachels eyes tears that lovedy must have perceived for she spoke the first articulate words she had uttered since the nightwatch had begun please maam dont fret im going to poor mother  you will be better now lovedy here is the doctor said rachel though conscious that this was not the right thing and then she hastened out on the stairs to meet the gaunt old scotsman and bring him in he made mrs kelland raise the child examined her mouth felt her feet and hands which were fast becoming chill and desired the warm flannels still to be applied to them  cannot her throat be operated on said rachel a tremor within her heart i think we could both be depended on if you wanted us  she is too far gone poor lassie was the answer it would be mere cruelty to torment her you had better go and lie down miss curtis her mother and i can do all she is like to need  is she dying  i doubt if she can last an hour longer the disease is in an advanced state and she was in too reduced a state to have battled with it even had it been met earlier  as it should have been twice her destroyer sighed rachel with a bursting heart and again the kind doctor would have persuaded her to leave the room but she turned from him and came back to lovedy who had been roused by what had been passing and had been murmuring something which had set her aunt off into sobs  shes saying sheve been a bad girl to me poor lamb and i tell her not to think of it she knows it was for her good if she had not been set against her work  dr macvicar authoritatively hushed the woman but lovedy looked up with flushed cheeks and the blue eyes that had been so often noticed for their beauty the last flush of fever had come to finish the work  dont fret she said theres no one to beat me up there please the verse about the tears  dr macvicar and the child both looked towards rachel but her whole memory seemed scared away and it was the old scotch army surgeon that repeated  the lord god shall wipe off tears from all eyes ah poor little one you are going from a world that has been full of woe to you  oh forgive me forgive me my poor child said rachel kneeling by her the tears streaming down silently  please maam dont cry said the little girl feebly you were very good to me please tell me of my saviour she added to rachel it sounded like set phraseology and she knew not how to begin but dr macvicars answer made the lightened look come back and the child was again heard to whisperah i knew they scourged himfor me  this was the last they did hear except the sobbing breaths ever more convulsive rachel had never before been present with death and awe and dismay seemed to paralyse her whole frame even the words of hope and prayer for which the childs eyes craved from both her fellowwatchers seemed to her a strange tongue inefficient to reach the misery of this untimely mortal agony this work of neglect and crueltyand she the cause  three oclock had struck before the last painful gasp had been drawn and mrs kellands sobbing cry broke forth dr macvicar told rachel that the child was at rest she shivered from head to foot her teeth chattered and she murmured accountable for all  dr macvicar at once made her swallow some of the cordial brought for the poor child and then summoning the maid whom grace had stationed in the outer room he desired her to put her young mistress to bed without loss of time the sole remaining desire of which she was conscious was to be alone and in the dark and she passively submitted     chapter xx the saracens head     alas he thought how changed that mien   how changed those timid looks have been   since years of guilt and of disguise   have steeled her brow and armed her eyes                                         marmion   are you sleepy rose what a yawn  not sleepy aunt ailie only it is such a tiresome long day when the colonel does not come in  take care rosie i dont know what we shall be good for at this rate  we o aunt ermine then you think it tiresome too i know you do  whats that rose  it is it is ill open the door for him  the next moment rose led her colonel in triumph into the lamplight there was a bright light in his eye and yet he looked pale grave and worn and ermines first observation was  how came tibbie to let you out at this time of night  i have not ventured to encounter tibbie at all i drove up to your door  you have been at st norberts all this time exclaimed alison  do you think no one can carry on a campaign at st norberts but yourself and your generalissima miss ailie he said stroking down roses brown hair  then if you have not gone home you have had nothing to eat and that is the reason you look so tired said ermine  yes i had some luncheon at the abbey  then at any rate you shall have some tea rosie run and fetch the little kettle  and the beauchamp cup and saucer added rose proudly producing the single relic of a wellremembered set of olden times and please please aunt ermine let me sit up to make it for him i have not seen him all day you know and it is the first time he ever drank tea in our house except makebelieve with violetta and colinette  no rose your aunt says i spoil that child and i am going to have my revenge upon you you must see the wild beast at his meals another time for it just happens that i have a good deal to say to your aunts and it is not intended for your ears  rose showed no signs of being spoilt for she only entreated to be allowed just to put the teathings in order and then winking very hard she said she would go  here rose if you please said ermine clearing the space of table before her  why aunt ermine i did not know you could make tea  there are such things as extraordinary occasions rose now good night my sweet one  good night my lady discretion we will make up for it one of these days dont stay away pray ailie as alison was following the child i have nothing to say till you come back  i know it is good news said ermine but it has cost you something colin  instead of answering he received his cup from her filled up her teapot and said  how long is it since you poured out tea for me ermine  thirteen years next june when you and harry used to come in from the cricket field so late and hot that you were ashamed to present yourself in civilized society at the great house  as if nobody from the parsonage ever came down to look on at the cricket  yes being summoned by all the boys to see that nothing would teach a scotchman cricket  ah you have got the last word for here comes ailie  of course said alison coming in ermine has had the pith of the story so i had better ask at once what it is  that the beauchamp eleven beat her majestys th foot on midsummer day 1846 is the pith of what i have as yet heard said ermine  and that beauchamp ladies are every whit as full of mischief as they used to be in those days is the sum of what i have told added colin  yes said ermine he has most loyally kept his word of reserving all for you he has not even said whether mauleverer is taken  my story is grave and sad enough said colin laying aside all his playfulness and a serious expression coming over his features but at the same time the landladys sandy cat which like all other animals was very fond of him and had established herself on his knee as soon as rose had left it vacant was receiving a certain firm hard caressing stroking which resulted in vehement purrs on her part and was evidently an outlet of suppressed exaltation  is he the same asked alison  all in due time unless like miss rachel you wish to tell me my story yourselves bythebye how is that poor girl today  thoroughly knocked down there is a sort of feverish lassitude about her that makes them very anxious they were hoping to persuade her to see mr frampton when lady temple heard last  poor thing it has been a sad affair for her well i told you i should go over this morning and see mr grey and judge if anything could be done i got to the abbey at about eleven oclock and found the policeman had just come back after serving the summons with the news that mauleverer was gone  gone  clean gone absconded from his lodgings and left no traces behind him but as to the poor woman the policeman reported that she had been left in terrible distress with the child extremely ill and not a penny not a thing to eat in the house he came back to ask mr grey what was to be done and as the suspicion of diphtheria made every one inclined to fight shy of the house i thought i had better go down and see what was to be done i knocked a good while in vain but at last she looked out of window and i told her i only wanted to know what could be done for her child and would send a doctor then she told me how to open the door poor thing i found her the picture of desolation in the midst of the dreary kitchen with the child gasping on her lap all the pretence of widowhood gone and her hair hanging loose about her face which was quite white with hunger and her great eyes looked wild like the glare of a wild beasts in a den i spoke to her by her own name and she started and trembled and said did miss alison tell you i said yes and explained who i was and she caught me up half way o yes yes my ladys nephew that was engaged to miss ermine and she looked me full and searchingly in the face ermine when i answered yes then she almost sobbed and you are true to her and put her hands over her face in an agony it was a very strange examination on ones constancy and i put an end to it by asking if she had any friends at home that i could write to for her but she cast that notion from her fiercely and said she had no friend no one he had left her to her fate because the child was too ill to be moved and indeed the poor child was in such a state that there was no thinking of anything else and i went at once to find a doctor and a nurse  diphtheria again  yes and she poor thing was in no state to give it the resolute care that is the only chance doctors could be easily found but i was at my wits end for a nurse till i remembered that mr mitchell had told me of a sisterhood that have a home at st norberts with a nursing establishment attached to it so in despair i went there and begged to see the superior and a most kind and sensible lady i found her ready to do anything helpful she lent me a nice little sister rather young i thought but who turned out thoroughly efficient nearly as good as a doctor still whether the child lives is very doubtful though the mother was full of hope when i went in last she insisted that i had saved it when both she and it had been deserted by maddox for whom she had given up everything  then she owned that he was maddox  she called him so without my even putting the question to her she had played his game long enough and now his desertion has evidently put an end to all her regard for him it was confusedly and shortly told the child was in a state that prevented attention being given to anything else but she knows that she had been made a tool of to ruin her master and you and the sight of you ailie had evidently stirred up much old affection and remembrance of better days  is she his wife  no or the evidence she promises could not be used against him do you know this ermine as he gave her a cover with a seal upon it  the saracen the saracens head colin it was made with the lost sealring  the ring was taken from edwards dressingroom the night when rose was frightened with the phosphorus maria declares that she did not suspect the theft or maddoxs purpose till long after she had left her place he effected his practices under pretence of attachment to her and then could not shake her off she went abroad with him after the settlement of affairs but he could not keep out of gambling speculation and lost everything then he seems to have larked about obtaining means she knew not howas artist lecturer and what nottill the notable f u e e was started most likely he would have collected the subscriptions and made off with them if rachel curtis had not had just sense enough to trust him with nothing without seeing some result so that he was forced to set the affair going with maria at its head as the only person who could cooperate with him they kept themselves ready for a start whenever there should be symptoms of a discovery but in the meantime he gambled away all that he got into his hands and never gave her enough to feed the children thus she was absolutely driven to force work from them for subsistence and she is a passionate creature whom jealousy embittered more and more so that she became more savage than she knew poor thing she has her punishment maddox only came home yesterday too late for any train before the mail and by that time the child was too ill to be moved he must have thought it all up with him and wished to be rid of both for they quarrelled and he left her to her misery  what gone  yes but she told us of his hauntshaunts that he thought she did not knowa fancy shop kept by a mrs dench at bristol where it seems that he plays the philanthropical lecturer and probably has been trying to secure a snug berth for himself unknown as he thought to maria but she pried into his letters and kept a keen watch upon him he was to be inquired for there by his mauleverer name and i have little doubt will be captured  and then  he will be committed for trial at the sessions and in the meantime i must see beauchamp and dr long and arrange that he should be prosecuted for the forgery even though he should slip through our fingers at the sessions  oh could that be  this clever woman has managed matters so sweetly that they might just as well try her as him for obtaining money on false pretences and the man seems to have been wonderfully sharp in avoiding committing himself mrs curtiss man of business has been trying all day to get up the case but he has made out nothing but a few more debts such as that which turned up yesterday and it is very doubtful how far a case can be made out against him  and then we should lose him  that is exactly what i wish to avoid i want to bring up my forces at once and have him laid hold of at once for the forgery of those letters of edwards how long would it take to hear from ekaterinburg i suppose edward could travel as fast as a letter  alison fairly sprang to her feet  o colin colin you do not think that edward would be here by the next sessions  he ought said colin i hope to induce dr long and harry to write him such letters as to bring him home at once  selfrestrained alison was fairly overcome she stretched out both hands pressed colins convulsively then turned away her face and bursting into tears ran out of the room  poor dear ailie said ermine she has suffered terribly her heart is full of edward oh i hope he will come  he must he cannot be so senseless as to stay away  there is that unfortunate promise to his wife and i fear that he is become so much estranged from english ways that he will hardly care to set himself straight here after the pain that the universal suspicion gave him  he cannot but care for the sake of all he must care vehemently repeated colin with the punctilious honour of the noblyborn soldier for his childs sake this would be enough to bring him from his grave if he refused to return to the investigation it would be almost enough to make me doubt him  i am glad you said almost said ermine trying to smile but he had absolutely brought tears into her eyes  dear ermine he said gently you need not fear my not trusting him to the utmost i know that he has been too much crushed to revive easily and that it may not be easy to make him appreciate our hopes from such a distance but i think such a summons as this must bring him  i hope it will said ermine otherwise we should not deserve that you should have any more to do with us  ermine ermine do you not know that nothing can make any difference between us  ermine had collected herself while he spoke  i know she said that all you are doing makes me thank and bless youoh more than i can speak  he looked wistfully at her but tearful as were her eyes there was a resolution about her face that impressed upon him that she trusted to his promise of recurring no more within the year to the subject so near his heart and he could say no more than you forgive me ermine you know i trust him as you do  i look to your setting him above being only trusted said ermine trying to smile oh if you knew what this ray of hope is in the dreary darkness that has lasted so long  therewith he was obliged to leave her and she only saw him for a few minutes in the morning when he hurried in to take leave since if matters went right at the magistrates bench he intended to proceed at once to make such representations in person to mr beauchamp and dr long as might induce them to send an urgent recall to edward in time for the spring sessions and for this no time must be lost ermine remained then alone with rose feeling the day strangely long and lonely and that perhaps its flatness might be a preparation for the extinction of all the brightness that had of late come into her life colin had said he would trust as she did but those words had made her aware that she must trust as he did if he with his clear sense and kindly insight into edwards character became convinced that his absence proceeded from anything worse than the mere fainthearted indifference that would not wipe off a blot then ermine felt that his judgment would carry her own along with it and that she should lose her undoubting faith in her brothers perfect innocence and in that case her mind was made up colin might say and do what he would but she would never connect him through herself with deserved disgrace the parting after these months of intercourse and increased knowlege of one another would be infinitely more wretched than the first but cost her what it wouldher life perhapsthe break should be made rather than let his untainted name be linked with one where dishonour justly rested but with her constant principle of abstinence from dwelling on contingencies she strove to turn away her mind and to exert herself though this was no easy task especially on so solitary a day as this while alison was in charge at myrtlewood in lady temples absence and rachel curtis was reported far too ill to leave her room so that ermine saw no one all day except her constant little companion nor was it till towards evening that alison at length made her appearance bringing a note which colin had sent home by lady temple  all had so far gone well maria hatherton had been committed to take her trial at the quarter sessions for the assault upon the children but as her own little girl was still living though in extreme danger and the sisters promised to take charge of both for the present colonel keith had thought it only common humanity to offer bail and this had been accepted later in the day mauleverer himself had been brought down having been taken up at a grand meeting of his bristol friends who had all rallied round him expressing strong indignation at the accusation and offering evidence as to character he denied any knowledge of the name of maddox and declared that he was able to prove that his own account of himself as a popular philanthropical lecturer was perfectly correct and he professed to be much amazed at the charges brought against him which could only have arisen from some sudden alarm in the young ladys mind excited by her friends whom he had always observed to be prejudiced against him he appealed strongly against the hardship of being imprisoned on so slight a charge but as he could find no one to take his part he reserved his defence for the quarter sessions for which he was fully committed colin thought however that it was so doubtful whether the charges against him could be substantiated that it was highly necessary to be fully prepared to press the former forgery against him and had therefore decided upon sleeping at st norberts and going on by an early train to obtain legal advice in london and then to see harry beauchamp meantime ermine must write to her brother as urgently as possible backing up colins own representations of the necessity of his return  ermine read eagerly but alison seemed hardly able to command her attention to listen and scarcely waited for the end of the letter before her own disclosure was made francis was sickening with diphtheria he had been left behind in the morning on account of some outbreak of peevishness and alison soon becoming convinced that temper was not solely in fault had kept him apart from his brothers and at last had sent for the doctor who had at once pronounced it to be the same deadly complaint which had already declared itself in rachel curtis alison had of course devoted herself to the little boy till his mothers return from st norberts when she had been obliged to give the first intimation of what the price of the loving little widows exploit might be i dont think she realizes the extent of the illness said alison say what i would she would keep on thanking me breathlessly and only wanting to escape to him i asked if we should send to let colin know and she answered in her dear unselfish way by no means it would be safer for him to be out of the way and besides she knew how much depended on his going  she is right said ermine i am thankful that he is out of reach of trying to take a share in the nursing it is bad enough to have one in the midst  yes said alison lady temple cannot be left to bear this grievous trouble alone and when the homestead cannot help her yet ermine what can be done is it safe for you and rose  certainly not safe that you should come backwards and forwards said ermine rose must not be put in danger so dear dear ailie you had better take your things up and only look in on us now and then at the window  alison entirely broke down oh ermine ermine since you began to mend not one night have we been apart  silly child said ermine straining her quivering voice to be cheerful i am strong and rose is my best little handmaid  i know it is right said alison i could not keep from my boys and indeed now colin is gone i do not think any one at myrtlewood will have the heart to carry out the treatment it will almost kill that dear young mother to see it no they cannot be left but oh ermine it is like choosing between you and them  not at all it is choosing between right and wrong  and ermine ifif i should be ill you must not think of coming near me rose must not be left alone  there is no use in talking of such things said ermine resolutely let us think of what must be thought of not of what is in the only wise hands what has been done about the other children  i have kept them away from the first i am afraid for none of them but conrade  it would be the wisest way to send them nurses and all to gowanbrae  wise but cool said alison  i will settle that returned ermine tibbie shall come and invite them and you must make lady temple consent  the sisters durst not embrace but gazed at one another feeling that it might be their last look their hearts swelling with unspoken prayer but their features so restrained that neither might unnerve the other then it was that alison for the first time felt absolute relief in the knowledge once so bitter that she had ceased to be the whole world to her sister and ermine for one moment felt as if it would be a way out of all troubles and perplexities if the two sisters could die together and leave little rose to be moulded by colin to be all he wished but she resolutely put aside the future and roused herself to send a few words in pencil requesting tibbie to step in and speak to her  that worthy personage had fully adopted her and entering tall and stately in her evening black silk and white apron began by professing her anxiety to be any assistance in her power saying shed be wonerfu proud to serve miss williams while her sister was sae thrang waitin on her young scholar in his sair trouble  emmie thanked her and rejoiced that the colonel was out of harms way  deed aye maam hes weel awa he has sic a wark wi thae laddies an their bit bairn o a mither ill no say hed been easy keepit out o the thick o the distress an its may be no surprisin after a thats come and gane that he seeks to take siccan a lift of the concern ive mony a time heard tell that the auld general sir stephen was as good as a faither to him when he was sick an lonesome puir lad in yon far awa land o wild beasts an savages  would it not be what he might like to take in the children out of the way of infection  deed miss ermine with a significant curtsey im thinkin ye ken my maister colin amaist as weel as i do hes the true son of his forbears an gowanbrae used to be always open in the auld lords time thats his grandfather foreby that he owes so much kindness to the general  ermine further suggested that it was a pity to wait for a letter from the colonel and tibbie quite agreed she liked the nurse as an extraordinar douce woman not like the fine english madams that miss isabelthats mrs comyn menteithput about her bairns and as to room the sergeant and the tailor bodie did not need much and the masons were only busy in the front parlour  masons asked ermine  on aye didna ye ken its for the new room that is to be built out frae the further parlour and what they ca the bay to the drawinroom just to mak the house more conformable like wi his name and forbears i never thocht but that yed surely seen the plans and a miss ermine an if so be it was maister colins pleasure the thing suld be private im real vext to hae said a word but yell may be no let on to him maam that ye ken onything about it  those downstairs rooms so silently begun thought ermine how fixed his intention must be oh how will it end what would be best for him and how can i think of myseif while all even my ailie are in distress and danger  ermine had however a good deal to think of for not only had she colins daily letter to answer but she had conrade leoline and hubert with her for several hours every day and could not help being amused by roses ways with them little grownup lady as she was compared to them luckily girls were such uncommon beings with them as to be rather courted than despised and rose having nothing of the tomboy did not forfeit the privileges of her sex she did not think they compensated for her colonels absence and never durst introduce violetta to them but she enjoyed and profited by the contact with childhood and was a very nice little comforter to conrade when he was taken with a fit of anxiety for the brother whom he missed every moment  quarantine weighed however most heavily upon poor grace curtis rachel had from the first insisted that she should be kept out of her room and the mothers piteous entreaty always implied that saddest argument why should i be deprived of you both in one day so grace found herself condemned to uselessness almost as complete as ermines she could only answer notes respond to inquiries without even venturing far enough from the house to see ermine or take out the temple children for a walk for indeed rachels state was extremely critical  the feverish misery that succeeded lovedys death had been utterly crushing the one load of selfaccusation had prostrated her but with a restlessness of agony that kept her writhing as it were in her wretchedness and then came the gradual increase of physical suffering bearing in upon her that she had caught the fatal disorder to her sense of justice and her desire to wreak vengeance on herself the notion might be grateful but the instinct of selfpreservation was far stronger she could not die the world here the world to come were all too dark too confused to enable her to bear such a doom she saw her peril in her mothers face in the reiterated visits of the medical man whom she no longer spurned in the calling in of the avoncester physician in the introduction of a professional nurse and the strong and agonizing measures to which she had to submit every time with the sensation that the suffering could not possibly be greater without exceeding the powers of endurance  then arose the thought that with weakness she should lose all chance of expressing a wish and obtaining pencil and paper she began to write a charge to her mother and sister to provide for mary morris but in the midst there came over her the remembrance of the papers that she had placed in mauleverers handsthe titledeeds of the burnaby bargain an estate that perhaps ought to be bringing in as much as half the rental of the property it must be made good to the poor if the titledeeds had been sold to any one who could claim the property what would be the consequence she felt herself in a mist of ignorance and perplexity dreading the consequences yet feeling as if her own removal might leave her fortune free to make up for them she tried to scrawl an explanation but mind and fingers were alike unequal to the task and she desisted just as fresh torture began at the doctors handstorture from which they sent her mother away and that left her exhausted and despairing of holding out through a repetition  and thenand then tell me of my saviour the dying child had said and the drawn face had lightened at the words to which rachels oracles declared that people attached crude or arbitrary meanings and now she hardly knew what they conveyed to her and longed as for something far away for the reality of those simple teachingsonce realities now all by rote saved by faith what was faith could all depend on a last sensation and as to her life failure failure through headstrong blindness and selfwill resulting in the agony of the innocent was this ground of hope she tried to think of progress and purification beyond the grave but this was the most speculative insecure fabric of all there was no habit of trust to itno inward conviction no outward testimony and even when the extreme danger subsided and francis temple was known to be better rachel found that her sorrow was not yet ended for conrade had been brought home with the symptoms of the complaintconrade the most beloved and loving of fannys little ones the only one who really remembered his father was in exceeding almost hopeless peril watched day and night by his mother and miss williams  the little alice maria hathertons own child had lingered and struggled long but all the care and kindness of the good sisters at st norberts had been unavailing she had sunk at last and the mother remained in a dull silent tearless misery quietly doing all that was required of her but never speaking nor giving the ladies any opening to try to make an impression upon her  rachel gleaned more intelligence than her mother meant her to obtain and brooded over it in her weakness and her silence  recovery is often more trying than illness and rachel suffered greatly indeed she was not sure that she ought to have recovered at all and perhaps the shock to her nerves and spirits was more serious than the effect of the sharp passing disorder which had however so much weakened her that she succumbed entirely to the blow accountable for all the words still rang in her ears and the all for which she was accountable continually magnified itself she had tied a dreadful knot which fanny meek contemned fanny had cut but at the cost of grievous suffering and danger to her boys and too late to prevent that death which continually haunted rachel those looks of convulsive agony came before her in all her waking and sleeping intervals nothing put them aside occupation in her weakness only bewildered and distracted her and even though she was advancing daily towards convalescence leaving her room and being again restored to her sister she still continued listless dejected cast down and unable to turn her mind from this one dreary contemplation of fanny and her sons it was hardly possible to think and one of the strange perturbations of the mind in illness caused her to dwell far less on them than on the minor misery of the fate of the titledeeds of the burnaby bargain which she had put into mauleverers hand she fancied their falling into the hands of some speculator who if he did not break the mothers heart by putting up a gasometer would certainly wring it by building hideous cottages or desirable marine residences the value would be enhanced so as to be equal to more than half that of the homestead the poor would have been cheated of it and what compensation could be made give up all her own share nay she had nothing absolutely her own while her mother lived only £5000 was settled on her if she married and she tortured herself with devising plans that she knew to be impracticable of stripping herself and going forth to suffer the poverty she merited yes but how would she have lived not like the williamses she had tried teaching like the one and writing like the other but had failed in both the clever woman had no marketable or available talent she knew very well that nothing would induce her mother and sister to let her despoil herself but to have injured them would be even more intolerable and more than all was the sickening uncertainty whether any harm had been done or what would be its extent  ignorant of such subjects at the best her brain was devoid of force even to reason out her own conjectures or to decide what must be impossible she felt compelled to keep all to herself to alarm her mother was out of the question when mrs curtis was distressed and shaken enough already and to have told grace would only have brought her soothing promises of sharing the burthenexactly what she did not wantand would have led to the fact being known to the family man of business mr cox the very last person to whom rachel wished to confess the proceeding it was not so much the humiliation of owning to him such a fatal act of piracy upon his province as because she believed him to have been the cause that the poor had all this time been cheated of the full value of the estate he had complacently consulted the welfare of the curtis family by charging them with the rent of the fields as ordinary grass land and it had never dawned on him that it would be only just to increase the rent rachel had found him an antagonist to every scheme she had hatched ever since she was fifteen years old her mother obeyed him with implicit faith and it was certain that if the question were once in his hands he would regard it as his duty to save the curtis funds and let the charity sink or swim and he was the only person out of the house whom rachel had seen  as soon asor rather beforeshe could bear it the first day that her presence was supposed not to be perilous to others she was obliged to have an interview with him to enable him to prepare the case for the quarter sessions nothing could be much worse for her nerves and spirits but even the mother was absolutely convinced of the necessity and rachel was forced to tax her enfeebled powers to enable her to give accurate details of her relations with mauleverer and enable him to judge of the form of the indictment once or twice she almost sunk back from the exceeding distastefulness of the task but she found herself urged on and when she even asked what would happen if she were not well enough to appear she was gravely told that she must beit would be very serious if she did not make a great effort and even her mother shook her head looked unhappy but confirmed the admonition a little revenge or hatred would have been a great help to her but she could not feel them as impulses if it had been the woman she could have gladly aided in visiting such cruelty upon her but this had not been directly chargeable upon mauleverer and though rachel felt acutely that he had bitterly abused her confidence she drooped too much to feel the spirit of retort the notion of being confronted with him before all the world at avoncester and being made to bring about his punishment was simply dreadful to her but when she murmured some word of this to her mother mrs curtis fairly started and said quite fiercely my dear dont let me hear you say any such thing he is a very wicked man and you ought to be glad to have him punished  she really spoke as if she had been rebuking some infringement of decorum and rachel was quite startled she asked grace why the mother was so bent on making her vindictive but grace only answered that every one must be very much shocked and turned away the subject  prudent grace her whole soul was in a tumult of wrath and shame at what she knew to be the county gossip but she was aware that rachels total ignorance of it was the only chance of her so comporting herself in court as to silence the rumour and she and her mother were resolutely discreet  mrs curtis between nursing anxiety and worry looked lamentably knocked up and at last grace and rachel prevailed on her to take a drive leaving rachel on a sofa in her sittingroom to what was no small luxury to her just at presentthat of being miserable alonewithout meeting any ones anxious eyes or knowing that her listlessness was wounding the mothers heart yet the privilege only resulted in a fresh perturbation about the titledeeds and longing to consult some one who could advise and sympathize ermine williams would have understood and made her colonel give help but ermine seemed as unattainable as nova zembla and she only heard that the colonel was absent her head as aching with the weary load of doubt and she tried to cheat her woe by a restless movement to the windows she saw captain keith riding to the door it suddenly darted into her mind that here was one who could and would help her he could see mauleverer and ascertain what had become of the deeds he could guess at the amount of danger she could not forget his kindness on the night of lovedys illness or the gentleness of his manner about the woodcuts and with a sudden impulse she rang the bell and desired that captain keith might be shown in she was still standing leaning on the table when he entered  this is very good in you he said i met your mother and sister on my way up and they asked me to leave word of conrade being better but they did not tell me i should see you  conrade is better said rachel sitting down unable to stand longer  yes his throat is better miss williamss firmness saved him they think him quite out of danger  thank heaven oh i could never have seen his mother again oh she has been the heroine  in the truest sense of the word he answered and rachel looked up with one moments brightening at the old allusion but her oppression was too great for cheerfulness and she answered  dear fanny yes she will be a rebuke to me for ever but she added before he had time to inquire for her health i wantedi wanted to beg you to do me a service you were so kind the other night  his reply was to lean earnestly forward awaiting her words and she told him briefly of her grievous perplexity about the titledeeds  then he said you would wish for me to see the man and ascertain how he has disposed of them  i should be most grateful  i will do my utmost perhaps i may not succeed immediately as i believe visitors are not admitted every day and he is said to be busy preparing his defence but i will try and let you know  thanks thanks the doubt is terrible for i know worry about it would distract my mother  i do not imagine he said that much worse consequences than worry could ensue but there are none more trying  oh not none  do not let worry about this increase other ills he said kindly do not think about this again till you hear from me  is that possible  i should not have thought so if i had not watched my uncle cast off troubles about his eyesight and the keeping his living  ah but those were not of his own making  there is a sparkle even in the darkest water that was a saying of his said alick looking anxiously at her pale cheek and downcast eye  not when they are turbid  they will clear he said and smiled with a look of encouraging hope that again cheered her in spite of herself meantime remember that in any way i can help you it will be the greatest favour he checked himself as he observed the exceeding languor and lassitude apparent in her whole person and only said my sister is too much at the bottom of it for me not to feel it the greatest kindness to me to let me try to be of the slightest use i believe i had better go now as he rose and looked at her wistfully you are too much tired to talk  i believe i am she said almost reluctantly but thank you this has done me good  and you are really getting better  yes i believe so perhaps i may feel it when this terrible day is over  what a comfort it would be she said to herself when he was gone if we had but a near relation like him who would act for the mother instead of our being delivered up bound hand and foot to mr cox it would have been refreshing to have kept him now if i could have done it without talking it really seemed to keep the horrible thoughts in abeyance to hear that wonderfully gentle tone and how kind and soft the look was i do feel stronger for it will it really be better after next week alas that will have undone nothing  yet even this perception of a possibility of hope that there would be relief after the ordeal was new to rachel and it soon gave way to that trying feature of illness the insurmountable dread of the mere physical fatigue the dean of avoncester a kind old friend of mrs curtis had insisted on the mother and daughters coming to sleep at the deanery on the tuesday night and remaining till the day after the trial but rachels imagination was not even as yet equal to the endurance of the long drive far less of the formality of a visit lady temple was likewise asked to the deanery but conrade was still too ill for her to think of leaving him for more than the few needful hours of the trial nor had alison been able to do more than pay an occasional visit at her sisters window to exchange reports and so absorbed was she in her boys and their mother that it was quite an effort of recollection to keep up to ermines accounts of colonel keiths doings  it was on the monday afternoon the first time she had ventured into the room taking advantage of rose having condescended to go out with the temple nursery establishment when she found ermines transparent face all alive with expectation he may come any time now she said his coming today or tomorrow was to depend on his getting his business done on saturday or not  and in a few minutes time the wellknown knock was heard and ermine with a look half arch half gay surprised her sister by rising with the aid of the arm of her chair and adjusting a crutch that had been leaning against it  why ermine you could not bear the jarring of that crutch  five or six years ago ailie when i was a much poorer creature then as the door opened i would make you a curtsey colonel keith but i am afraid i cant quite do that though still she moved nearer to meet him but perhaps there was a look of helplessness which made her exultation piteous for he responded with an exclamation of alarm put out his arm to support her and did not relax a frown of anxiety till he had placed her safe in her chair again while she laughed perhaps a little less freely and said see what it is to have had to shift for oneself  you met me with your eyes the first time ermine and i never missed anything  well i think it is hard not to have been more congratulated on my great achievement i thought i should have had at least as much credit as widdrington my favourite hero and model  when you have an arm to support you it may be all very well and i shall never stand it without then as ermine subsided unprepared with a reply well ailie how are your boys  both much better francis nearly well  you have had a terrible time and their mother  dearer and sweeter than ever said alison with her voice trembling no one who has not seen her now can guess half what she is  i hope she has not missed me if this matter had not been so pressing i could not have stayed away  the one message she always gave me was that you were not to think of coming home and indeed those dear boys were so good that we managed very well without you  yes i had faith in your discipline and i think that matters are in train against edward comes of course there is no letter or you would have told me  he will be coming himself said ermine resolved against again expressing a doubt while alison added that he hated letterwriting  nothing could be more satisfactory than beauchamps letter added colin he was so thoroughly convinced that he immediately began to believe that he had trusted edward all along and had only been overruled  i dare say said ermine laughing i can quite fancy honest harry completely persuaded that he was edwards champion while maddox was turning him round his finger  and such is his good faith that i hope he will make edward believe the same i told you of his sending his love to you and of his hopes that you would some day come and see the old place he made his wife quite cordial  alison did not feel herself obliged to accept the message and ermine could freely say poor harry i should like to see him again he would be exactly the same i dare say and how does the old place look  just what i do not want you to see they have found out that the rectory is unhealthy and stuck up a new bald house on the top of the hill and the hall is new furnished in colours that set ones teeth on edge nothing is like itself but harry and he only when you get him off dutywithout his wife i was glad to get away to belfast  and there judging from julias letter they must have nearly devoured you  they were very hospitable your sister is not so very unlike you ermine  oh colin exclaimed alison with an indignation of which she became ashamed and added by way of making it better perhaps not so very  she was very gracious to me said colin smiling and we had much pleasant talk of you  yes said ermine it will be a great pleasure to poor julia to be allowed to take us up again and you thought the doctor sufficiently convinced  more satisfactorily so than harry for he reasoned out the matter and seems to me to have gone more by his impression that a man could not be so imprudent as edward in good faith than by maddoxs representation  that is true said alison he held out till edward refused to come home and then nothing would make him listen to a word on his behalf  and it will be so again thought ermine with a throb at her heart then she asked did you see whether there was a letter for you at home  yes i looked in and found only this which i have only glanced at from bessie  from paris  yes they come home immediately after easter your brother is resolved i should be presented and submit to the whole season in style after which he says i may judge for myself what people will do for pretty young wives poor marys most brilliant season was a winter at edinburgh and it must be his doing more than hers for she goes on is it not very hard to be precluded all this time from playing the chieftainess in the halls of my forefathers i shall have to run down to your gowanbrae to refresh myself and see what you are all about for i cannot get the fragment of a letter from alick and i met an avoncestrian the other day who told me that the whole county was in a state of excitement about the f u etc that every one believed that the fascinating landscapepainter was on the high road to winning one of the jointheiresses but that lady templethe most incredible part of the storyhad blown up the whole affair made her way into the penetralia of the asylum and rescued two female prentices so nearly whipped to death that it took an infinitesimal quantity of rachels homoeopathy to demolish one entirely and that the virtuous public was highly indignant that there was no inquest nor trial for manslaughter but that it was certain that rachel had been extremely ill ever since poor rachel there must be some grain of truth in all this but one would like to be able to contradict it i wrote to ask alick the rights of the story but he has not vouchsafed me a line of reply and i should take it as very kind in you to let me know whether he is in the land of the living or gone to edinburghas i hear is to be the lot of the highlandersor pining for the uncroquetable lawn to which i always told him he had an eye  she may think herself lucky he has not answered said ermine he has always been rather unreasonably angry with her for making the introduction  that is the reason he has not added alison for he is certainly not far off he has been over almost every day to inquire and played german tactics all saturday afternoon with francis to our great relief but i have stayed away long enough  i will walk back with you ailie i must see the good little heroine of the most incredible part of the story  lady temple looked a good deal paler than when he had last seen her and her eyelids still showed that they had long arrears of sleep to make up but she came down with outstretched hands and a sunny smile they are so much better and i am so glad you were not at home in the worst of it  and i am sorry to have deserted you  oh no no it was much better that you should be away we should all have wanted you and that would have been dangerous and dear dear miss williams did all that could be done do you know it taught me that you were right when you told me i ought never to rest till the boys learnt to obey for obedience sake at a word it showed what a bad mother i am for i am sure if dear conrade had been like what he was last year even she could not have saved him said fanny her eyes full of tears  then came her details to which he listened as ever like the brotherly friend he was and there was a good deal said about restoring the little ones who were still at gowanbrae to which he would by no means as yet consent though fanny owned herself to have time now to pine for her stephana and to hear how dismal it is to have a silent nursery  yes it has been a fearful time we little guessed how much risk you ran when you went to the rescue  dear con when he thoughtwhen we thought he could not get better said i was not to mind that and i dont said fanny i thought it was right and though i did not know this would come of it yet you see god has been very merciful and brought both of my boys out of this dreadful illness and i dare say it will do them good all their lives now it is over i am sure it will to me for i shall always be more thankful  everything does you good he said  and another thing she added eagerly it has made me know that dear miss williams so much better she was so good so wonderfully good to come away from her sister to us i thought she was quite gone the first day and that i was alone with my poor francie and presently there she was by my side giving me strength and hope by her very look i want to have her for good i want to make her my sister she would teach the boys still for nobody else could make them good but if ever her sister could spare her she must never go away again  you had better see what she says replied the colonel with suppressed emotion  that night when conrade and francis were both fast asleep their mother and their governess sat over the fire together languid but happy and told out their hearts to one anothertold out more than alison had ever put into words even to ermine for her heart was softer and more unreserved now than ever it had been since her sisters accident had crushed her youth there was thenceforth a bond between her and lady temple that gave the young widow the stronghearted sympathizing sisterly friend she had looked for in rachel and that filled up those yearnings of the affection that had at first made alison feel that colins return made the world dreary to her her life had a purpose though that purpose was not ermine but where were edward and his letter     chapter xxi the quarter sessions    is it so nominated in the bondmerchant of venice   malgre her disinclination rachel had reached the point of recovery in which the fresh air and change of scene of the drive to avoncester could not fail to act as restoratives and the first evening with the dean and his gentle old sister was refreshing and comfortable to her spirits  it was in the afternoon of the ensuing day that mr grey came to tell her that her presence would soon be required and both her mother and sister drove to the court with her poor mrs curtis too anxious to go away yet too nervous to go into court chose in spite of all mr greys advice to remain in the carriage with the blinds closed far too miserable for grace to leave her  rachel though very white called up a heroic smile and declared that she should get on very well her spirit had risen to the occasion so as to brace her nerves to go becomingly through what was inevitable and she replied with a ready yes to mr greys repetition of the advice for ever dinned into her ears not to say a word more than needful feeling indeed little disposed to utter anything that she could avoid  she emerged from the dark passage into full view of faces which were far more familiar than she could have wished she would have greatly preferred appearing before a judge robed wigged and a stranger to coming thus before a country gentleman slightly known to herself but an old friend of her father and looking only like his ordinary self  all the world indeed was curious to see the encounter between rachel curtis and her impostor and every one who had contributed so much as a dozen stamps to the f u e e felt as if under a personal wrong and grievance while many hoped to detect other elements of excitement so that though all did not overtly stare at the witness not even the most considerate could resist the impulse to glance at her reception of the bow with which he greeted her entrance  she bent her head instinctively but there was no change of colour on her cheek her faculties were concentrated and her resolute will had closed all avenues to sensations that might impair her powers she would not give way either to shame and remorse for herself or to pity or indignation against the prisoner she would attend only to the accuracy of the testimony that was required of her as an expiation of her credulous incaution but such was the tension of her nerves that impassive as she looked she heard every cough every rustle of paper each voice that addressed her seemed to cut her ears like a knife and the chair that was given to her after the administration of the oath was indeed much needed  she was examined upon her arrangement that the prisoner should provide for the asylum at st herberts and on her monthly payment to him of the sums entered in the accountbook in some cases she knew he had shown her the bills unreceipted in others he had simply made the charge in the book and she had given to him the amount that he estimated as requisite for the materials for woodengraving so far she felt satisfied that she was making herself distinctly understood but the prisoner acting as his own counsel now turned to her and asked the question she had expected and was prepared for whether she could refer to any written agreement  no it was a viva voce agreement  could she mention what passed at the time of making the arrangement that she had stated as existing between himself and her  i described my plans and you consented  an answer at which some of the audience could have smiled so well did it accord with her habits the prisoner again insisted on her defining the mode of his becoming bound to the agreement rachel took time for consideration and alison williams sitting between lady temple and colonel keith felt dizzy with anxiety for the answer it came at last  i do not remember the exact words but you acquiesced in the appearance of your name as secretary and treasurer  the prospectus was here brought forward and mauleverer asked her to define the duties he had been supposed to undertake in the character in which he had there figured it of course came out that she had been her own treasurer only entrusting the nominal one with the amount required for current expenses and again in reply to his deferential questions she was obliged to acknowledge that he had never in so many words declared the sums entered in the book to have been actually paid and not merely estimates for monthly expenditure to be paid to the tradesmen at the usual seasons  i understood that they were paid said rachel with some resentment  will you oblige me by mentioning on what that understanding was founded said the prisoner blandly  there was a pause rachel knew she must say something but memory utterly failed to recall any definite assurance that these debts had been discharged time passed all eyes were upon her there was a dire necessity of reply and though perfectly conscious of the weakness and folly of her utterance she could only falter forth i thought so the being the clever woman of the family only rendered her the more sensible both of the utter futility of her answer and of the effect it must be producing  alison hung her head and frowned in absolute shame and despair already perceiving how matters must go and feeling as if the hope of her brothers vindication were slipping awayreft from her by rachels folly colin gave an indignant sigh and whispering to her come out when lady temple does i will meet you he made his way out of court  there had been a moments pause after rachels i thought so and then the chairman spoke to the counsel for the prosecution mr murray can you carry the case any further by other witnesses at present i see no case to go to the jury you will see that the witness not only does not set up any case of embezzlement but rather loads to an inference in the contrary direction  no sir was the answer i am afraid that i can add nothing to the case already presented to you  upon this the chairman said  gentlemen of the jurythe case for the prosecution does not sustain the indictment or require me to call on the prisoner for his defence and it is your duty to find him not guilty you will observe that we are not trying a civil action in respect of the large sum which he has received from the young lady and for which he is still accountable to her nor by acquitting him are you pronouncing that he has not shown himself a man of very questionable honesty but only that the evidence will not bring him within the grasp of the criminal law as guilty of embezzlement under the statute and this because of the looseness of the arrange ments that had been implied instead of expressed it is exceedingly to be regretted that with the best intentions and kindest purposes want of caution and experience on her part should have enabled the prisoner thus to secure himself from the possibility of a conviction but there can be no doubt that the evidence before us is such as to leave no alternative but a verdict of not guilty  the very tenderness and consideration of the greyhaired sir edward mordens tone were more crushing to rachel than severe animadversions on her folly would have been from a stranger here was she the clever woman of the family shown in open court to have been so egregious a dupe that the deceiver could not even be punished but must go scotfree leaving all her wrongs unredressed to her excited morbid apprehension magnified by past selfsufficiency it was as though all eyes were looking in triumph at that object of general scorn and aversion a woman who had stepped out of her place she turned with a longing to rush into darkness and retirement when she was called to return to her mother and even had she still been present little would she have recked that when the jury had without many moments delay returned a verdict of not guilty the prisoner received a strong stem reprimand from sir edward to whom he replied with a bow that had in it more of triumph than of acceptance  burning tears of disappointment were upon alisons cheek the old hopeless blank was returning and her brother might come back in vain to find his enemy beyond his reach here was an end alike of his restoration and of ermines happiness  oh whispered lady temple is it not horrid is nothing to be done to that dreadful man i always thought people came here to do justice i shall never like sir edward morden again but oh what can that be where is the colonel  it was a loud frightful roar and yell a sound of concentrated fury that once heard could never be forgotten it was from the crowd outside many of them from avonmouth and all frantic with indignation at the cruelty that had been perpetrated upon the helpless children their groans and execrations were pursuing the prison van from which maria hatherton was at that moment making her exit and so fearful was the outcry that penetrated the court that fanny trembled with recollections of indian horrors looked wistfully for her protector the colonel and murmured fears that her aunt must have been very much terrified  at that moment however a summons came for lady temple as this was the case in which she was to bear witness alison followed and was no sooner past the spectators who gladly made way than she found her arm drawn into colonel keiths is he come she asked no was rather signed than spoken oh colin she sighed but still there was no reply only she was dragged on downstairs and along dark passages into a room furnished with a table chairs pens ink and paper and lighted with gas which revealed to her not only mr grey but one who though eight years had made him stouter redder and rougher had one of the moat familiar faces of her youthful days her senses almost reeled with her as he held out his hand saying heartily well ailie how are you and how is ermine where can this brother of yours be  harry mr beauchamp you here she exclaimed in the extremity of amazement  here is colin seeming to think that something may be done towards nailing this scoundrel for the present so i am come at his call we shall have the fellow in a moment and then by way of getting rid of embarrassment he began talking to mr grey about the county hall and the room which mr grey explained to be that of the clerk of the peace lent for this occasion while the usual justice room was occupied alison heard all as in a dream and presently mauleverer entered as usual spruce artistlike and selfpossessed and was accosted by harry beauchamp good evening mr maddox i am sorry to trouble you  i hope there is no misunderstanding sir was the reply i have not the pleasure of knowing for whom you take me  without regarding this reply however mr beauchamp requested mr grey to take his deposition stating his own belief in the identity of the person before him with richard maddox whom he charged with having delivered to him a letter falsely purporting to come from edward williams demanding three hundred pounds which upon this he had delivered to the accused to be forwarded to the said mr williams  alisons heart beat violently at the ordeal before her of speaking to the genuineness of the letter she had seen and suspected that to her brotherinlaw but she could not guess whether the flaws in that to mr beauchamp would be equally palpable and doubt and anxiety made her scarcely able to look at it steadily to her great relief however she was able to detect sufficient variations to justify her assertion that it was not authentic and she was able to confirm her statement by comparison of the writing with that of a short indignant denial of all knowledge of the transaction which harry beauchamp had happily preserved though little regarding it at the time she also showed the wrong direction with the name of the place misspelt according to her own copy of her sisterinlaws address at the request of maddox himself and pointed out that a letter to ermine from her brother bore the right form the seal upon that to mr beauchamp she likewise asserted to be the impression of one which her brother had lost more than a year before the date of the letter  indeed sir said the accused fuming to mr grey this is an exceedingly hard case here am i newly acquitted after nearly six weeks imprisonment on so frivolous a charge that it has been dismissed without my even having occasion to defend myself or to call my own most respectable witnesses as to character when another charge is brought forward against me in a name that there has been an unaccountable desire to impose on me even if i were the person that this gentleman supposes there is nothing proved he may very possibly have received a forged letter but i perceive nothing to fix the charge upon the party he calls maddox let me call in my own witnesses who had volunteered to come down from bristol and you will be convinced how completely mistaken the gentleman is  to this mr grey replied that the case against him was not yet closed and cautioning him to keep his own witnesses back but he was urgent to be allowed to call them at once as it was already late and they were to go by the six oclock train mr grey consented and a messenger was sent in search of them mr beauchamp looked disturbed what say you to this colin he asked uneasily that mans audacity is enough to stagger one and i only saw him three times at the utmost  never fear said colin delay is all in our favour at the same time colin left them and with him went some hope and confidence leaving all to feel awkward and distressed during the delay that ensued the accused expatiating all the time on the unreasonableness of bringing up an offence committed so many years ago in the absence of the only witness who could prove the whole story insisting moreover on his entire ignorance of the names of either maddox or williams  the sight of his witnesses was almost welcome they were a dissenting minister and a neat portly respectable widow the owner of a fancy shop and both knew mr mauleverer as a popular lecturer upon philanthropical subjects who came periodically to bristol and made himself very acceptable their faith in him was genuine and he had even interested them in the f u e e and the ladies that patronized it the widow was tearfully indignant about the persecution that had been got up against him and evidently intended to return with him in triumph and endow him with the fancy shop if he would condescend so far the minister too spoke highly of his gifts and graces but neither of them could carry back their testimony to his character for more than three years  mr grey looked at his watch harry beauchamp was restless and alison felt almost faint with suspense but at last the tramp of feet was heard in the passage colonel keith came first and leaning over alisons chair said lady temple will wait for me at the inn it will soon be all right  at that moment a tall figure in mourning entered attended by a policeman for the first time mauleverers coolness gave way though not his readiness and turning to mr grey he exclaimed sir you do not intend to be misled by the malignity of a person of this description  worse than a murderess gasped the scandalized widow dench well i never  mr grey was obliged to be peremptory in order to obtain silence and enforce that let the new witness be what she might her evidence must be heard  she had come in with the habitual village curtsey to mr beauchamp and putting back her veil disclosed to alison the piteous sight of the wellremembered features once so bright with intelligence and innocence and now sunk and haggard with the worst sorrows of womanhood her large glittering eyes did not seem to recognise alison but they glared upon mauleverer with a strange terrible fixedness as if unable to see any one else to alison the sight was inexpressibly painful and she shrank back as it were in dread of meeting the eyes once so responsive to her own  mr grey asked the woman the name of the person before her and looking at him with the same fearful steadiness she pronounced it to be richard maddox though he had of late called himself mauleverer  the man quailed for a moment then collecting himself said i now understand the incredible ingratitude and malignity that have pointed out against me these hitherto unaccountable slanders it is a punishment for insufficient inquiry into character but you sir in common justice will protect me from the aspersions of one who wishes to drag me down in her justly merited fall  sentenced for three years to take her examination muttered mrs dench and with some difficulty these exclamations were silenced and maria hatherton called on for her evidence  concise but terrible in its clear brevity was the story of the agent tampering with her the nursemaid until she had given him access to the private rooms where he had turned over the papers on the following day mr williams had been inquiring for his sealring but she herself had not seen it again till some months after when she had left her place and was living in lodgings provided for her by maddox when she had found the ring in the drawer of his desk her suspicion had then been first excited by his displeasure at her proposing to him to return it thinking it merely there by accident and she had afterwards observed him endeavouring to copy fragments of mr williamss writing these he had crushed up and thrown aside but she had preserved them owning that she did not know what might come of them and the family had been very kind to her  the seal and the scraps of paper were here produced by the policeman who had them in charge the seal perfectly coincided with that which had closed the letter to harry beauchamp and was moreover identified by both alison and colonel keith it was noticeable too that one of these fragments was the beginning of a note to mr beauchamp as dear h and this though not edwards most usual style of addressing his friend was repeated in the demand for the £300  sir said the accused of course i have no intention of intimating that a gentleman like the honourable colonel keith has been in any collusion with this unhappy woman but it must be obvious to you that his wish to exonerate his friend has induced him to give too easy credence to this persons malignant attempts to fasten upon one whom she might have had reason to regard as a benefactor the odium of the transactions that she acknowledges to have taken place between herself and this maddox thereto incited no doubt by some resemblance which must be strong since it has likewise deceived mr beauchamp  mr grey looked perplexed and vexed and asked mr beauchamp if he could suggest any other person able to identify maddox he frowned said there must have been workmen at the factory but knew not where they were looked at colin keith asked alison if she or her sister had ever seen maddox then declared he could lay his hands on no one but dr long at belfast  mauleverer vehemently exclaimed against the injustice of detaining him till a witness could be summoned from that distance mr grey evidently had his doubts and began to think of calling in some fresh opinion whether he had sufficient grounds for committal and alisons hopes were only unstained by colins undaunted looks when there came a knock at the door and as much to the surprise of alison as of every one else there entered an elderly maidservant leading a little girl by the hand and colonel keith going to meet the latter said do not be frightened my dear you have only to answer a few questions as plainly and clearly as you can  awed silent and dazzled by the sudden gaslight she clung to his hand but evidently distinguished no one else and he placed her close to the magistrate saying this is mr grey rose tell him your name  and mr grey taking her hand and repeating the question the clear little silvery voice answered  i am rose ermine williams  and how old are you my dear  i was eight on the last of june  she knows the nature of an oath asked mr grey of the colonel  certainly you can soon satisfy yourself of that  my dear then said mr grey taking her by the hand again and looking into the brown intelligent eyes i am sure you have been well taught can you tell me what is meant by taking an oath before a magistrate  yes said rose colour flushing into her face it is calling upon almighty god to hear one speak the truth she spoke so low that she could hardly be heard and she looked full of startled fear and distress turning her face up to colonel keith with a terrified exclamation  oh please why am i here what am i to say  he was sorry for her but her manifest want of preparation was all in favour of the cause and he soothed her by saying only answer just what you are asked as clearly as you can and mr grey will soon let you go he knows you would try any way to speak the truth but as he is going to examine you as a magistrate he must ask you to take the oath first  rose repeated the oath in her innocent tones and perhaps their solemnity or the fatherly gentleness of mr grey reassured her for her voice trembled much less when she answered his next inquiry who her parents were  my mother is dead she said my father is mr williams he is away at ekaterinburg  do you remember any time before he was at ekaterinburg  oh yes when we lived at kensington and he had the patent glass works  now turn round and say if there is any one here whom you know  rose who had hitherto stood facing mr grey with her back to the rest of the room obeyed and at once exclaimed aunt alison then suddenly recoiled and grasped at the colonel  what is it my dear  it isit is mr maddox and with another gasp of fright and maria oh let me go  but mr grey put his arm round her and assured her that no one could harm her colonel keith let his fingers be very hard pinched and her aunt came nearer all telling her that she had only to make her answers distinctly and though still shrinking she could reply to mr greys question whom she meant by mr maddox  the agent for the glassmy fathers agent  and who is maria  she was my nurse  when did you last see the person you call mr maddox  last time i was sure of it was when i was walking on the esplanade at avoncester with colonel keith said rose very anxious to turn aside and render her words inaudible  i suppose you can hardly tell when that was  yes it was the day before you went away to lord keiths wedding said rose looking to the colonel  had you seen him before  twice when i was out by myself but it frightened me so that i never looked again  can you give me any guide to the time  she was clear that it had been after colonel keiths first stay at avonmouth but that was all and being asked if she had ever mentioned these meetings only when colonel keith saw how frightened i was and asked me  why were you frightened asked mr grey on a hint from the colonel  because i could not quite leave off believing the dreadful things mr maddox and maria said they would do to me if i told  told what  about mr maddox coming and walking with maria when she was out with me gasped rose trying to avert her head and not comforted by hearing mr grey repeat her words to those tormentors of her infancy  a little encouragement however brought out the story of the phosphoric letters the lions and the vision of maddox growling in the dressingroom the date of the apparition could hardly be hoped for but fortunately rose remembered that it was two days before her mammas birthday because she had felt it so bard to be eaten up before the fete and this date tallied with that given by maria of her admitting her treacherous admirer into the private rooms  the young lady may be precocious no doubt sir here said the accused but i hardly see why she has been brought here you can attach no weight to the confused recollections of so young a child of matters that took place so long ago  the question will be what weight the jury will attach to them at the assizes said mr grey  you will permit me to make one inquiry of the young lady sir who told her whom she might expect to see here  mr grey repeated the query and rose answered nobody i knew my aunt and the colonel and lady temple were gone in to avoncester and aunt ermine got a note from the colonel to say that i was to come in to him with tibbie in a fly  did you know what you were wanted for  no i could not think i only knew they came to get the woman punished for being so cruel to the poor little girls  do you know who that person was  mrs rawlins was the ready answer  i think said mr grey to the accused that you must perceive that with such coincidence of testimony as i have here i have no alternative but to commit you for the summer assizes  mauleverer murmured something about an action for false imprisonment but he did not make it clear and he was evidently greatly crestfallen he had no doubt hoped to brazen out his assumed character sufficiently to disconcert mr beauchamps faith in his own memory and though he had carried on the same game after being confronted with maria it was already becoming desperate he had not reckoned upon her deserting his cause even for her own sake and the last chance of employing her antecedents to discredit her testimony had been overthrown by roses innocent witness to their mutual relations a remembrance which had been burnt in on her childish memory by the very means taken to secure her silence when the depositions were read over their remarkable and independent accordance was most striking mrs dench had already been led away by the minister in time to catch her train just when her sobs of indignation at the deception were growing too demonstrative and the policeman resumed the charge of maria hatherton  little rose looked up to her saying please aunt ailie may i speak to her  alison had been sitting restless and perplexed between impulses of pity and repulsion and doubts about the etiquette of the justice room but her heart yearned over the girl she had cherished and she signed permission to rose whose timidity had given way amid excitement and encouragement  please maria she said dont be angry with me for telling i never did till colonel keith asked me and i could not help it will you kiss me and forgive me as you used  the hard fierce eyes that had not wept over the childs coffin filled with tears  oh miss rose miss rose do not come near me oh if i had minded youand your aunts and the pentup misery of the life that had fallen lower and lower since the first step in evil found its course in a convulsive sob and shriek so grievous that alison was thankful for colins promptitude in laying hold of rose and leading her out of the room before him alison felt obliged to follow yet could not bear to leave maria to policemen and prison warders  maria poor maria i am so sorry for you i will try to come and see you  but her hand was seized with an imperative ailie you must come they are all waiting for you  how little had she thought her arm would ever be drawn into that arm so unheeded by both  so that is edwards little girl why she is the sweetest little clearheaded thing i have seen a long time she was the saving of us  it was well thought of by colin  colin is a lawyer spoiltthats a fact a firstrate getup of a case  and you think it safe now  nothing safer so edward turns up how he can keep away from such a child as that i cant imagine where is she oh here as they came into the porch in fuller light where the colonel and rose waited for them ha my little ailie i must make better friends with you  my name is rose not ailie replied the little girl  oh aye well it ought to have been what dye call herthat was a daniel come to judgment  portia returned rose but i dont think that is pretty at all  and where is lady temple anxiously asked alison she must be grieved to be detained so long  oh lady temple is well provided for said the colonel all the magistrates and half the bar are at her feet they say the grace and simplicity of her manner of giving her evidence were the greatest contrast to poor rachels  but where is she still persisted alison  at the hotel marias was the last case of the day and she went away directly after it with such a choice of escorts that i only just spoke to her  and at the hotel they found the waggonette at the gateway and lady temple in the parlour with sir edward morden who late as it was would not leave her till he had seen her with the rest of the party she sprang up to meet them and was much relieved to hear that mauleverer was again secured otherwise she said it would have been all my fault for having acted without asking advice i hope i shall never do so again  she insisted that all should go home together in the waggonette and rose found herself upon mr beauchamps knee serving as usual as a safety valve for the feelings of her aunts admirers there was no inconstancy on her part she would much have preferred falling to the lot of her own colonel but the open carriage drive was rather a risk for him in the night air and though he had undertaken it in the excitement he soon found it requisite to muffle himself up and speak as little as possible harry beauchamp talked enough for both he was in high spirits partly as colin suspected with the escape from a dull formal home and partly with the undoing of a wrong that had rankled in his conscience more than he had allowed to himself lady temple her heart light at the convalescence of her sons was pleased with everything liked him extremely and answered gaily and alison enjoyed the resumption of pleasant habits of days gone by yet delightful as it all was there was a sense of disenchantment she was marvelling all the time how she could have suffered so much on harry beauchamps account the rejection of him had weighed like a stone upon her heart but now it seemed like freedom to have escaped his companionship for a lifetime  presently a horses feet were heard on the road before them there was a meeting and a halt and alick keiths voice called outhow has it gone  why were you not in court  what i go to hear my friends baited  where were you then  at avonmouth  oh then you have seen the boys cried lady temple how is conrade  quite himself up to a prodigious amount of indoor croquet but how has it gone  such a shame returned lady temple they acquitted the dreadful man and the poor woman whom he drove to it has a years imprisonment and hard labour  acquitted what is he off  oh no no he is safe and waiting for the assizes all owing to the colonel and little rose  he is committed for the former offence said colonel keith the important one  thats right good night and how he added reining back his horse did your cousin get through it  oh they were so hard on her cried lady temple i could hardly bring myself to speak to sir edward after it it was as if he thought it all her fault  her evidence broke down completely said colonel keith sir edward spared her as much as he could but the absurdity of her whole conduct was palpable i hope she has had a lesson  alicks impatient horse flew on with him and colin muttered to alison under his mufflersi never could make out whether that is the coolest or the most sensitive fellow living     chapter xxii the after clap     i have read in the marvellous heart of man   that strange and mystic scroll   that an army of phantoms vast and wan   beleaguer the human soul   encamped beside lifes rushing stream   in fancys misty light   gigantic shapes and shadows gleam   portentous through the night                 the beleaguered city longfellow   a dinner party at the deanery in the sessions week was an institution but rachel lying on the sofa in a cool room had thought herself exempt from it and was conscious for the time of but one wish namely to be let alone and to be able to shut her eyes without finding the lids as it were lined with tiers of gazing faces and curious looks turned on her and her ears from the echo of the roar of fury that had dreadfully terrified both her and her mother and she felt herself to have merited the crush of public censure was not at the moment so overwhelming as the strange morbid effect of having been the focus of those many many glances and if she reflected at all it was with a weary speculating wonder whether one pair of dark grey eyes had been among those levelled at her she thought that if they had she could not have missed either their ironical sting or perchance some kindly gleam of sympathy such as had sometimes surprised her from under the flaxen lashes  there she had lain unmolested and conscious of a certain relief in the exceeding calm the grey pinnacle of the cathedral and a few branches of an elmtree alone meeting her eye through the open window and the sole sound the cawing of the rooks whose sailing flight amused and attracted her glance from time to time with dreamy interest grace had gone into court to hear maria hathertons trial and all was still  the first break was when her mother and miss wellwood came in after having wandered gently together round the warm walled deanery garden comparing notes about their myrtles and geraniums then it was that amid all their tender inquiries after her headache and their administration of afternoon tea it first broke upon rachel that they expected her to go down to dinner  pray excuse me she said imploringly looking at her mother for support indeed i dont know that i could sit out a dinner a number of people together make me so dizzy and confused  poor child said miss wellwood kindly but looking to mrs curtis in her turn perhaps as she has been so ill the evening might be enough  oh exclaimed rachel i hope to be in bed before you have finished dinner indeed i am not good company for any one  dont say that my dear and miss wellwood looked puzzled  indeed my dear said mrs curtis evidently distressed i think the exertion would be good for you if you could only think so  yes indeed said miss wellwood catching at the notion it is your mind that needs the distraction my dear  i am distracted enough already poor rachel said putting her hand up indeed i do not want to be disobliging she said interpreting her mothers anxious gestures to mean that she was wanting in civility it is very kind in you miss wellwood but this has been a very trying day and i am sure i can give no pleasure to anybody so if i might only be let off  it is not so much began miss wellwood getting into a puzzle and starting afresh indeed my dear my brother and i could not bear that you should do anything you did not like only you see it would never do for you to seem to want to shut yourself up  i should think all the world must feel as if i ought to be shut up for life said rachel dejectedly  ah but that is the very thing if you do not show yourself it will make such a talk  rachel had nearly said let them talk but though she felt tormented to death habitual respect to these two gentle nervous elderly women made her try to be courteous and she said indeed i cannot much care provided i dont hear them  ah but you dont know my dear said mrs curtis seeing her friend looked dismayed at this indifference indeed dear miss wellwood she does not know we thought it would be so awkward for her in court  know what exclaimed rachel sitting upright and putting down her feet what have you been keeping from me  onlyonly my dear people will say such things and nobody could think it that knew you  what demanded rachel  yes said mrs curtis perhaps since her daughter was to have the shock rather glad to have a witness to the surprise it caused her you know people will gossip and some one has put it about thatthat this horrid man was  mrs curtis paused miss wellwood was as pink as her cap strings rachel grasped the meaning at last oh she said with less reticence than her elders there must needs be a spice of flirtation to give piquancy to the mess of gossip i dont wonder there are plenty of people who judge others by themselves and think that motive must underlie everything i wonder who imagines that i am fallen so low  there i knew she would take it in that way said mrs curtis and so you understand us my dear we could not bear to ask you to do anything so distressing except for your own sake  i am far past caring for my own sake said rachel but for yours and graces mother i will give as much ocular demonstration as i can that i am not pining for this hero with a norman name i own i should have thought none of the deans friends would have needed to be convinced  oh no no but miss wellwood made a great confusion of noes buts and my dears and mrs curtis came to the rescue after all my love one cant so much wonder you have always been very peculiar you know and so clever and you took up this so eagerly and then the greys saw you so unwilling to prosecute andand i have always allowed you too much libertyever since your poor dear papa was takenand now it has come upon you my poor child oh i hope dear fanny will take warning by me and off went poor mrs curtis into a fit of sobs  mothermother this is worse than anything exclaimed rachel in an agony springing to her feet and flying after sal volatile but feeling frightfully helpless without grace the manager of all mrs curtiss ailments and troubles grace would have let her quietly cry it out rachels remedies and incoherent protestations of all being her own fault only made things worse and perhaps those ten minutes were the most overwhelming of all the griefs that rachel had brought on herself however what with miss wellwoods soothing and her own sense of the becoming mrs curtis struggled herself into composure again by the time the maid came to dress them for dinner rachel all the while longing for graces return not so much for the sake of hearing the verdict as of knowing whether the mother ought to be allowed to go down to dinner so shaken did she look for indeed besides her distress for her daughter no small ingredient in her agitation was this recurrence to a stated custom of her husbands magisterial days  persuasion was unavailing at any cost the curtis family must present an unassailable front to the public eye and if mrs curtis had forced forward her much tried and suffering daughter far more would she persist in devoting herself to gaiety and indifference but her nervousness was exceeding and betrayed itself in a continual wearying for grace without whom neither her own dress nor rachels could be arranged to her satisfaction and she was absolutely incapable of not worrying rachel about every fold every plait every bow in a manner that from any one else would have been unbearable but those tears had frightened rachel into a penitent submission that endured with an absolute semblance of cheerfulness each of these torments the languor and exhaustion had been driven away and feverish excitement had set in not so much from the spirit of defiance that the two elder ladies had expected to excite as from the having been goaded into a reckless determination to sustain her part no matter for the rest  it often happened in these parties that the ladies would come in from the country in reasonable time while their lords would be detained much later in court so when the cathedral clock had given notice of the halfhour mrs curtis began to pick up fan and handkerchief and prepare to descend rachel suggested there would be no occasion so to do till graces return since it was plain that no one could yet be released  yes my dear but perhapsdont you think it might be remarked as if you chose to keep out of sight  oh very well  rachel followed her mother down sustained by one hope that captain keith would be there no the deanery did not greatly patronize the barracks there was not much chance of any gentleman under forty except perhaps in the evening and at present the dean himself and one canon were the entire gentleman element among some dozen ladies everybody knew that the cause of delay was the trial of the cruel matron and added to the account of rachels iniquities their famished and weary state of expectation the good dean gyrating among the groups trying to make conversation which every one felt too fretful and too hungry to sustain with spirit rachel sat it out trying to talk whenever she saw her mothers anxious eyes upon her but failing in finding anything to say and much doubting whether her neighbours liked talking to her  at last gentlemen began to appear in twos and threes and each made some confidence to the womankind that first absorbed him but no one came in rachels way and the girl beside her became too unfeignedly curious to support even the semblance of conversation but listened for scraps of intelligence something was flying about respecting a gentleman who came down by the train and something about lady temple and admirable and the young lady seized the first opportunity of deserting rachel and plunging into the melee rachel sat on sick with suspense feeling utterly unable to quit her seat still they waited the whole of the party were not arrived and here was the curfew ringing and that at the deanery which always felt injured if it were seven oclock before people were in the diningroom grace must be upstairs dressing but to reach her was impossible  at last mr grey was announced and he had mercy upon rachel he came up to her as soon as he could without making her remarkable and told her the cause of his delay had been the necessity of committing mauleverer upon an accusation by a relation of colonel keith of very extensive frauds upon miss williamss brother rachels illness and the caution of the williamses had prevented her from being fully aware of the complication of their affairs with her own and she became paler and paler as she listened to the partial explanation though she was hardly able as yet to understand it  the woman she asked  sentenced to a years imprisonment with hard labour and let me tell you rachel you had a most narrow escape there if that army doctor had not come in time to see the child alive they could not have chosen but have an inquest and no mortal can tell what might have been the decision about your homoeopathy you might have been looking forward to a worse business than this at the next assizes  mr grey had done his work at last the long waiting the weary constraint and at last the recurrence of lovedys sufferings and her own share in them entirely overcame her mists danced before her eyes and the very sensation that had been so studiously avoided was produced by her fainting helplessly away in her chair while mr grey was talking to her  to be sure it brought deliverance from the multitude and she awoke in the quiet of her room upon her bed in the midst of the despairing compunction of the mother and the tender cares of grace but she was too utterly overdone for even this to be much relief to her and downstairs poor miss wellwoods one desire was to hinder the spread of the report that her swoon had been caused by the tidings of mauleverers apprehension it seemed as if nothing else had been wanting to make the humiliation and exposure complete rachel had despised fainting ladies and had really hitherto been so superabundant in strength that she had no experience of the symptoms or she might have escaped in time but there she lay publicly censured before the dignitaries of her county for moral folly and entirely conquered before the rest of the world by the physical weakness she had most contemned  then the mother was so terrified and distressed that all sorts of comforting reassurances were required and the chief object soon became to persuade her to go downstairs and leave rachel to her bed and at last the thought of civility and of the many mrs grundys prevailed and sent her downstairs but there was little more comfort for rachel even in being left to herselfthat for which she had a few minutes before most ardently longed  that night was perhaps the most painful one of her whole life the earnest desire to keep her mother from uneasiness and the longing to be unmolested made her play her part well when the mother and grace came up to see her before going to bed and they thought she would sleep off her overfatigue and excitement and yielded to her desire that they should bid her good night and leave her to rest  but what sort of rest was it sometimes even her own personal identity was gone and she would live over again in the poor children the hunger and the blows or she would become mrs rawlins and hear herself sentenced for the savage cruelty or she would actually stand in court under sentence for manslaughter her pulses throbbed up to fever pitch head and cheeks burnt the very power to lie still was gone and whether she commanded her thoughts or lapsed into the land of dreams they worked her equal woe  now it was the world of gazing faces feverishly magnified multiplied and pressing closer and closer on her till she could have screamed to dispel them now it was her mother weeping over the reports to which she had given occasion and accusing herself of her daughters errors and now it was lovedy kellands mortal agony now the mob thirsting for vengeance were shouting for justice on her as the childs murderer and she was shrieking to alick keith to leave her to her fate and only save her mother  it would hardly be too much to say that the positive wretchedness of actually witnessing the childs death was doubled in these its imaginary repetitions on that still more suffering night of waking dreams when every solemn note of the cathedral clock every resolute proclamation from its fellow in the town hall every sharp reply from the domestic timepiece in the deanery fell on her ears generally recalling her at least to full consciousness of her identity and whereabouts and dispelling the delusion  but then what comfort was there veritably she had caused suffering and death she had led to the peril of fannys children she had covered her mother with shame and grief nay in her exaggerated tone of feeling she imagined that distress and poverty might have been entailed on that beloved mother those title deedsno intelligence captain keith had taken no notice perhaps he heard and believed those degrading reports he had soul enough to pity and sympathize with the failure of extended views of beneficence he despised the hypocrisy that had made charity a cloak for a credulous debasing attachment and to such an object he might well avoid her his sister had always bantered her on what had seemed too absurd to be rebutted and at any rate this fainting fit would clench his belief no doubt he believed it and if he did why should not every one else whose opinion she cared for ermine her colonel even gentle fannyno she would never believe any harm she had suffered too much in her cause  oh for simple genuine charity like fannys with eyes clear with innocence and humility and now what was before her should she ever be allowed to hide her head or should she be forced again to brave that manyeyed world perhaps the titledeed business would prove utter ruin it would have been acceptable to herself but her mother and sister  chastisement yes it was just chastisement for headstrong folly and conceit she had heard of bending to the rod and finding it a cross but here came the dreadful confusion of unreality and of the broken habit of religious meditation except as matter of debate she did not know till her time of need how deeply sneers had eaten into her heart the only text that would come to her mind was and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof every effort at prayer or at calm recall of old thoughts still ended in that desolate verse the first relief to these miserable dreams was the cool clear morning light and byandby the early cathedral bells then graces kind greeting made her quite herself no longer feverish but full of lassitude and depression she would not listen to graces entreaties that she would remain in bed no place was so hateful to her she said and she came down apparently not more unwell than had been the case for many days past so that after breakfast her mother saw no reason against leaving her on the sofa while going out to perform some commissions in the town attended of course by grace miss wellwood promised that she should not be disturbed and she found that she must have been asleep for she was taken by surprise by the opening of the door and the apologetic face of the butler who told her that a gentleman had asked if she would see him and presented the card of captain alexander keith  eagerly she desired that he should be admitted tremulously she awaited his sentence upon her mothers peace and as she thought of all he must have heard all he must believe she felt as if she must flee or if that were impossible cower in shrinking dread of the glance of his satirical eye  here he was and she could not look or speak nor did he she only felt that his clasp of greeting was kind was anxious and he put forward the easychair into which she sank unable to stand he said i saw your mother and sister going into the town i thought you would like to hear of this business at once  oh yes thank you  i could not see the man till the day before yesterday he said and i could get nothing satisfactory from him he said he had taken the papers to a legal friend but was not authorized to give his name perhaps his views may be changed by his present condition i will try him again if you like  thank you thank you do you think this is true  he is too cunning a scoundrel to tell unnecessary lies and very likely he may have disposed of them to some jew attorney but i think nothing is to be feared but some annoyance  and annoyance to my mother is the one thing i most fear sighed rachel helplessly  there might be a mode of much lessening it to her he said  oh what tell me and i would do it at any cost  will you and he came nearer at the cost of yourself  she thrilled all over and convulsively grasped the arm of her chair  would not a son be the best person to shield her from annoyance he added trying for his usual tone but failing he exclaimed rachel rachel let me  she put her hands over her face and cried oh oh i never thought of this  no he said and i know what you do think of it but indeed you need not be wasted our women and children want so much done for them and none of our ladies are able or willing will you not come and help me  dont talk to me of helping i do nothing but spoil and ruin  not now that is all gone and past come and begin afresh  no no i am too disagreeable  may not i judge for myself he said drawing nearer and his voice falling into tremulous tenderness  headstrongoverbearing  try and his smile overbore her  oh no no nobody can bear me this is more than youyou ought to dothan any one should she faltered not knowing what she said  than any one to whom you were not most dear was the answer and he was now standing over her with the dew upon his eyelashes  oh that cant be bessie said you always took up whatever other people hated and i know it is only that  dont let bessies sayings come between us now rachel this goes too deep and he had almost taken her hand when with a start she drew it back saying but you know what they say  have they been stupid enough to tell you he exclaimed confute them then racheldolts that cant believe in selfdevotion laugh at their beards this is the way to put an end to it  oh no they would only detest you for my sake i cant she said again bowed down again with shame and dejection  ill take care of that he said with the dry tone that perhaps was above all reassurance and conquered her far enough to enable him to take possession of the thin and still listless hand  then he said you will let me take this whole matter in hand and if the worst comes to the worst we will make up to the charity out of the indian money without vexing the mother  i cant let you suffer for my miserable folly  too late to say that he answered and as her eyes were raised to him in startled inquiry he said gravely these last weeks have shown me that your troubles must be mine  a hand was on the door and rachel fled in time to screen her flight from miss wellwood whom alick met with his usual undisturbed front and inquiries for mrs curtis  that good lady was in the town more worried than flattered by the numerous inquiries after rachels health and conscious of having gone rather near the wind in making the best of it she had begun to dread being accosted by any acquaintance and captain keith sauntering near the archway of the close was no welcome spectacle she would have passed him with a curt salutation but he grasped her hand saying may i have a few words with you  not fannynot the children cried mrs curtis in dismay  no indeed only myself and a gleam of intelligence under his eyelashes and judicious pressure of his hand conveyed volumes to grace who had seen him often during rachels illness and was not unprepared she merely said that she would see how her sister was substituted captain keiths arm for her own as her mothers support and hurried away to encounter miss wellwoods regrets that in spite of all her precautions dear rachel had been disturbed by a young officer i believe we see him often at the cathedral and somebody said it was his sister whom lord keith married  yes we know him well and he is a victoria cross man said grace beginning to assume his reflected glory  so some one said but the dean never calls on the officers unless there is some introduction or there would be no end to it it was a mistake letting him in to disturb rachel is your mother gone up to her my dear  no i think she is in the cathedral yard i just came in to see about rachel said grace escaping  miss wellwood intended going out to join her old friend but on going to put on her bonnet she saw from the window mrs curtis leaning on the intruders arm conversing so confidentially that the deans sister flushed with amazement and only hoped she had mentioned him with due respect and under that southern cathedral wall good mrs curtis took the longest walk she had indulged in for the last twenty years so that grace and even rachel beholding from the window began to fear that the mother would be walked to death  but then she had that supporting arm and the moral support that was infinitely more that daughter the spoilt pet of her husband the subject of her pride even when an enigma and an anxiety whom she had lately been forced to think of as          a maid whom there were few to praise         and very few to love   she now found loved by one at least and praised in terms that thrilled through and through the mothers heart in their truth and simplicity for that sincerity generosity and unselfishness it was her own daughter her real rachel no illusion that she heard described in those grave earnest words only while the whole world saw the errors and exaggerated them here was one who sank them all in the sterling worth that so few would recognise the dear old lady forgot all her prudence and would hardly let him speak of his means but she soon saw that rachels present portion would be more than met on his side and that no one could find fault with her on the score of inequality of fortune he would have been quite able to retire and live at ease but this he said at once and with decision he did not intend his regiment was his hereditary home and his father had expressed such strong wishes that he should not lightly desert his profession that he felt bound to it by filial duty as well as by other motives moreover he thought the change of life and occupation would be the best thing for rachel and mrs curtis could not but acquiesce little as she had even dreamt that a daughter of hers would marry into a marching regiment her surrender of judgment was curiously complete dear alexinder as thenceforth she called him had assumed the mastery over her from the first turn they took under the cathedral and when at length he reminded her that the clock was on the stroke of one she accepted it on his infallible judgment for her own sensations would have made her believe it not a quarter of an hour since the interview had begun  not a word had been granted on either side to the conventional vows of secrecy always made to be broken and perhaps each tacitly felt that the less secrecy the better for rachel certain it is that mrs curtis went into the deanery with her head considerably higher kissed rachel vehemently and assuring her she knew all about it and was happier than she had ever thought to be again excused her from appearing at luncheon and hurried down thereto without giving any attention to a feeble entreaty that she would not go so fast and when at three oclock rachel crept downstairs to get into the carriage for her return home the good old dean lay in wait for her told her she must allow him an old friends privilege kissed her congratulated her and said he would beg to perform the ceremony  oh mr dean it is nothing like that  he laughed and handed her in  mother mother how could you sighed rachel as they drove on  my dear they were so kind they could not help knowing  but it cant be  rachel my child you like him  he does not know half about me yet mother dont tell fanny or any one till i have seen him again  and the voice was so imperious with the wayward vehemence of illness that mrs curtis durst not gainsay it she did not know how alick keith was already silencing those who asked if he had heard of the great event at the deans party still less did she guess at the letter at that moment in writing   my dear bessiewish me joy i have gone in for the uncroquetable lawn and won ityour affectionate brother                                                   a c keith     chapter xxiii dear alexander    i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with memuch ado about nothing   alick is this all chivalry inquired colonel keith sitting by his fire suffering considerably from his late drive and hearing reports that troubled him  very chivalrous indeed when theres an old county property to the fore  for that matter you have all been canny enough to have means enough to balance all that barren moorland you are a richer man than i shall ever be  without heiresshunting said alick as though weighing his words  come alick you need not put on a mask that does not fit you if it is not too late take the risk into consideration for i own i think the price of your championship somewhat severe  ask miss williams  ermine is grateful for much kindness and isyesreally fond of her  then colonel you ought to know that a sensible womans favourable estimate of one of her own sex outweighs the opinion men can form of her  i grant that there are fine qualities but alick regarding you as i must necessarily do from our former relations you must let me speak if there is still time to warn you lest your pity and sense of injustice should be entangling you in a connexion that would hardly conduce to make you happy or popular  popularity is not my line said alick looking composedly into the fire  tell me first said the puzzled colonel are you committed  no one can be more so  engaged  i thought you would have known it from themselves but i find she has forbidden her mother to mention it till she has seen me again and they talk of quiet and shut me out gloomily added alick  the colonel conceived a hope that the lady would abjure matrimony and release this devoted knight but in a few moments alick burst out  absurd she cannot mend with anything on her mind if i could have seen mrs curtis or grace alone they might have heard reason but that old woman of a doctor was prosing about quiet and strain on the nerves i know that sort of quiet the best receipt for distraction  well alick said his friend smiling you have at least convinced me that your heart is in the matter  how should it not be returned alick  i was afraid it was only with the object of unjust vituperation  no such thing let me tell you colonel my heart has been in it ever since i felt the relief of meeting real truth and unselfishness i liked her that first evening when she was manfully chasing us off for frivolous danglers round her cousin i liked her for having no conventionalities fast or slow and especially for hating heroes and when my sister had helped to let her get into this intolerable web how could i look on without feeling the nobleness that has never shifted blame from herself but bowed owned all sufferedsufferedoh how grievously  the colonel was moved with such genuine affection you should surely lead her and work upon her i trust you will be able  it is less that said alick rather resentfully than sympathy that she wants nobody ever gave her that except your ermine bythebye is there any news of the brother  colonel keith shook his head i believe i shall have to go to russia he said with some dejection  after that reproach one with chivalry said alick lightly nay i beg your pardon shall i take any message down to mackarel lane  are you going  well yes though i hardly ought to venture there till this embargo is taken off for she is the one person there will be some pleasure in talking to perhaps i may reckon you as the same in effect  the colonel responded with a less cheerful look than usual adding i dont know whether to congratulate you alick on having to ask no ones consent but your own at your age  especially not my guardians said alick with the desired effect of making him laugh  no if you were my son i would not interfere he added gravely i only feared your not knowing what you were about i see you do know it and it merely becomes a question of every man to his tasteexcept for one point alick i am afraid there may have been much disturbance of her opinions  surface work said alick some of the effects of the literature that paints contradiction as truth it is only skin deep and makes me wish all the more to have her with my uncle for a time i wonder whether grace would let me in if i went back again  no grace was obdurate mr frampton had spoken of a nervous fever and commanded perfect quiescence and grace was the less tempted to transgress the order because she really thought her mother was more in love with dear alexander than rachel was rachel was exceedingly depressed restless and feverish and shrank from her mothers rejoicing declaring that she was mistaken and that nothing more must be said she had never consented and he must not make such a sacrifice he would not when he knew better nay in some moods rachel seemed to think even the undefined result of the interview an additional humiliation and to feel herself falling if not fallen from her supreme contempt of love and marriage the hurry and the consent taken for granted had certainly been no small elements in her present disturbed and overwhelmed state and grace though understanding the motive was disposed to resent the overhaste calm and time to think were promised to rachel but the more she had of both the more they hurt her she tossed restlessly all night and was depressed to the lowest ebb by day but on the second day ill as she evidently was she insisted on seeing captain keith declaring that she should never be better till she had made him understand her her nurses saw that she was right and besides mrs curtiss pity was greatly touched by dear alexanders entreaties so as a desperate experiment he was at last allowed to go into the dressingroom where she was lying on the sofa he begged to enter alone only announced by a soft knock to which she replied with a listless come in and did not look up till she suddenly became conscious of a footfall firmer though softer than those she was used to she turned and saw who it was who stood at a window opposite to her feet drawing up the venetian blind from whose teasing divisions of glare and shade she had been hiding her eyes from the time she had come in fretted by the low continuous tap of its laths upon the shutters her first involuntary exclamation was a sigh of relief  oh thank you i did not know what it was that was such a nuisance  this is too much glare let me turn your sofa a little way round from it  and as he did so and she raised herself he shook out her cushions and substituted a cool chintz covered one for the hot crimson damask on which her head had been resting thank you how do you know so well she said with a long breath of satisfaction  by long trial he said very quietly seating himself beside her couch with a stillness of manner that strangely hushed all her throbbings and the very pleasure of lying really still was such that she did not at once break it the lull of these few moments was inexpressibly sweet but the pang that had crossed her so many times in the last two days and nights could not but return she moved restlessly and he leant towards her with a softtoned inquiry what it was she wanted  dont she said raising herself no dont i have thought more over what you said she continued as if repeating the sentence she had conned over to herself you have been most generous most noble butbut with an effort of memory it would be wrong in me to accept suchoh such a sacrifice and when i tell you all you will think it a duty to turn from me she added pressing her hands to her temples and mind you are not committedyou are free  tell me he said bending towards her  i know you cannot overlook it my faithit is all confusion she said in a low awestruck voice i do believei do wish to believe but my grasp seems gone i cannot rest or trust for thinking of the questions that have been raised there she added in a strange interrogative tone  it is a cruel thing to represent doubt as the sign of intellect alick said sadly but you will shake off the tormentors when the power of thinking and reasoning is come back  oh if i could think so the misery of darkness herethereeverywherethe old implicit reliance gone and all observance seeming like hypocrisy and unreality there is no thinking no enduring the intolerable maze  do not try to think now you cannot bear it we will try to face what difficulties remain when you are stronger  she turned her eyes full on him you do not turn away you know you are free  turn from the sincerity that i prize  you dont i thought your views were exactly what would make you hate and loathe such bewilderment and call it wilful there was something piteous in the way her eye sought his face  it was not wilful he said it came of honest truthseeking and rachel i think the one thing is now gone that kept that honesty from finding its way  selfsufficiency she said with a groan but with a sudden turn she exclaimed you dont trust to my surrendering my judgment i dont think i am that kind of woman  nor i that kind of man he answered in his natural tone then affectionately no indeed i want you to aid mine  she lay back wearied with the effort and disinclined to break the stillness there was a move at the door mrs curtis in an agony of restless anxiety could not help coming to see that the interview was doing no harm  dont go exclaimed rachel holding out her hand as he turned at the opening of the door oh mother and there was an evident sound of disappointment  mrs curtis was infinitely rejoiced to find her entrance thus inopportune i only wished just to be sure it was not too much she said  oh mother it is the first peace i have known for weeks cant you stay looking up to him as her mother retreated to tell grace that it was indeed all right  this brought him to a footstool close beside her thank you he murmured i was wondering just then if it would hurt you or agitate you to give me some little satisfaction in going on with this i know you are too true not to have told me at once if your objections were more personal than those you have made but rachel it is true as you say that you have never consented  the tone of these words made rachel raise herself turn towards him and hold out both her hands oh she said as he took them into his own it wasit could be only that i cannot bear so much more than i deserve  what such an infliction in his own dry way  such rest such kindness such generosity  no rachel there is something that makes it neither kindness nor generosity you know what i mean  and that is what overpowers me more than all she sighed in the full surrender of herself i ought not to be so very happy  that is all i want to hear he said as he replaced her on her cushions and sat by her holding her hand but not speaking till the next interruption by one of the numerous convalescent meals brought in by grace who looked doubtful whether she would be allowed to come in and then was edified by the little arrangements he made quietly taking all into his own hands and wonderfully lessening a sort of fidget that mrs curtiss anxiety had attached to all that was done for rachel it was not for nothing that he had spent a year upon the sofa in the irritably sensitive state of nerves that bessie had described and when he could speak to grace alone he gave her a lecture on those little refinements of unobtrusive care that more demonstrative ailments had not availed to inculcate and which mrs curtiss present restless anxiety rendered almost impossible to hinder her from constantly aggravating the fever on the nerves by her fidgeting solicitude was beyond all power save his own and that when he was actually in the house  morning after morning he rode to the homestead to hear that rachel had had a very bad night and was very low then was admitted to find mrs curtiss fluttering flurried attentions exasperating every wearied fibre with the very effort to force down fretfulness and impatience till when she was left to him a long space of the lull impressed on her by his presence was needful before he could attempt any of the quiet talk or brief readings of poetry by which he tried further to soothe and rest her spirits he would leave her so calm and full of repose as to make him augur well for the next day but the moment his back was turned something would always happen that set all the pulses in agitation again and consigned her to a fresh night of feverish phantoms of the past he even grew distracted enough to scold grace fraternally as the only person he could scold  you seem to nurse her on the principle of old morris the biggest officer among us who kindly insisted on sitting up with me and began by taking his seat upon my hand as it was lying spread out upon a pillow  indeed alick said grace with tears in her eyes i hardly know what to do when you are not in the house the mother is almost as much in a nervous fever as rachel and it is hardly in her power to keep from fretting her it is all well when you are here  then grace there is only one thing to be done the sooner i take rachel away the better for both her and the mother  oh alick you will drive them both wild if you hurry it on  look here i believe i can get leave from saturday till tuesday if i can get a hearing in those two days i shall try and depend upon it grace this place is the worst that rachel can be in  can you come out here for three whole days oh what a comfort  and what a comfort was reechoed by mrs curtis who had erected dear alexander to a pedestal of infallibility and was always treated by him with a considerate kindness that made her pity fanny for the number of years that must pass before stephana could give her the supreme blessing of a soninlaw fanny on her side had sufficient present blessing in collecting her brood around her after the long famine she had suffered and regretted only that this month had rendered stephanas babyhood more perceptibly a matter of the past and that in the distance school days were advancing towards conrade though it was at least a comfort that his diphtheria had secured him at home for another half year and the colonel had so much to think about that he had not begun his promised researches into schools  the longlookedfor letters came after a weary interval of expectation the more trying to ermine because the weather had been so bitter that colin could not shake off his cold nor venture beyond his own fireside where rose daily visited him and brought home accounts that did not cheer her aunt  edward wrote shortly to his sister as if almost annoyed at the shower of letters that had by every post begun to recall his attention from some new invention on the means of assaying metals  i am sorry you have stirred up keith to the renewal of this painful subject you know i considered that page in my life as closed for ever and i see nothing that would compensate for what it costs me even to think of it to redeem my name before the world would be of no avail to me now for all my english habits are broken and all that made life valuable to me is gone if long and beauchamp could reject my solemn affirmation three years ago what would a retractation slowly wrung from them be worth to me now it might once have been but that is all over now even the desire to take care of you would no longer actuate me since you have keith again and in a few years i hope to make my child independent in money mattersindependent of your love and care you would not wish her to be forget the troubles of your life ermine and be happy with your faithful keith without further efforts on behalf of one whom they only harass and grieve  ermine shed some bitter tears over this letter the more sorrowful because the refusal was a shock to her own reliance on his honour and she felt like a traitress to his cause and colin would give him up after this ungrateful indifference if nothing worse surely it betrayed a consciousness that the whole of his conduct would not bear inquiry and she thought of the representations that she had so indignantly rejected that the accounts even without the last fatal demand were in a state that it required an excess of charity to ascribe to mere carelessness on the part of the principal  she was glad that alison was absent and rose in the garden she laid her head on her little table and drew long sobs of keen suffering the reaction from the enjoyment and hope of the last few months and so little knew she what she ought to ask that she could only strive to say thy will be done  ermine my ermine this is not a thing to be so much taken to heart this foolish philosopher has not even read his letters i never saw any one more consistently like himself  ermine looked up and colin was standing over her muffled up to the eyes and a letter of his own in his hand her first impulse was to cry out against his imprudence glad as she was to see him my cough is nearly gone he said unwinding his wrappings and i could not stay at home after this wonderful letterthree pages about chemical analysis which he does me the honour to think i can understand two of commissions for villainous compounds and one of protestations that i will be drowned nobody shall help me  ermines laugh had come even amid her tears his tone was so great a relief to her she did not know that he had spent some minutes in cooling down his vexation lest he should speak ungently of her brothers indifference poor edward she said you dont mean that this is all the reply you have  see for yourself and he pointed to the divisions of the letter he had described there is all he vouchsafes to his own proper affairs you see he misapprehends the whole indeed i dont believe he has even read our letters  we often thought he did not attend to all we wrote said ermine it is very disheartening  nay ermine you disheartened with the end in view  there are certainly the letters about maddoxs committal still to reach him but who knows if they will have more effect oh colin this was such a hope thatperhaps i have dwelt too much upon it  it is such a hope he repeated there is no reason for laying it aside because edward is his old self  colin you still think so  i think so more than ever if he will not read reason he must hear it and if he takes no notice of the letters we sent after the sessions i shall go and bring him back in time for the assizes  oh colin it cannot be think of the risk you who are still looking so thin and ill i cannot let you  it will be warm enough by the time i get there  the distance you are doing too much for us  no ermine with a smile that i will never do  she tried to answer his smile but leant back and shed tears not like the first full of pain but of affectionate gratitude and yet of reluctance at his going she had ever been the strength and stay of the family but there seemed to be a source of weakness in his nearness and this period of his indisposition and of suspense had been a strain on her spirits that told in this gentle weeping this is a poor welcome after you have been laid up so long she said when she could speak again if i behave so ill you will only want to run from the sight of me  it will be july when i come back  i do not think you ought to go  nor i if edward deigns to read the account of roses examination  in that calm smiling resolution ermine read the needlessness of present argument and spoke again of his health and his solitary hours  mitchel has been very kind in coming to sit with me and we have indulged in two or three castles in the airhospitals in the air perhaps i should say i told him he might bring me down another guest instead of the tailor and he has brought a poor young pupil teacher whom tibbie calls a winsome gallant but i am afraid she wont save him did you ever read the lady of la garaye  not the poem but i know her story  as soon as that parcel comes in which villars is always expecting i propose to myself to read that poem with you whats that it cant be rachel as usual  if it was not rachel it was the next thing to her namely alick keith this was the last day of those that he had spent at the homestead and he was leaving rachel certainly better she had not fallen back on any evening that he had been there but to his great regret he would not be able to come out the next day regimental duty would take him up nearly all the day and then he was invited to a party at the deanery which the mother would never have forgiven me for refusing he said just as if the mothers desires had the very same power over him as over her daughters i came to make a desperate request miss williams he said would it be any way possible for you to be so kind as to go up and see rachel she comes downstairs now and there are no steps if you go in by the glass doors do you think you could manage it  she wishes it said ermine  very much there are thorns in her mind that no one knows how to deal with so well as you do and she told me yesterday how she longed to get to you  it is very good in her i have sometimes feared she might think we had dealt unfairly by her if she did not know how very late in the business we suspected that our impostors were the same said ermine  it is not her way to blame any one but herself said alick and in fact our showing her the woodcut deception was a preparation for the rest of it but i have said very little to her about all that matter she required to be led away rather than back to it brooding over it is fatal work and yet her spirits are too much weakened and shattered to bear overamusement that is the reason that i thought you would be so very welcome tomorrow she has seen no one yet but lady temple and shrinks from the very idea  i do not see why i should not manage it very well said ermine cheerfully if miss curtis will let me know in time whether she is equal to seeing me you know i can walk into the house now  alick thanked her earnestly his listless manner was greatly enlivened by his anxiety and colonel keith was obliged to own that marriage would be a good thing for him but such a marriage if from sheer indolence he should leave the government to his wife thencolin could only shrug his shoulders in dismay  nevertheless when ermines wheeled chair came to the door the next afternoon he came with it and walked by her side up the hill talking of what had been absolutely the last call she had madea visit when they had both been riding with the young beauchamps  suppose any one had told me then i should make my next visit with you to take care of me how pleased i should have been said ermine laughing and taking as usual an invalids pleasure in all the little novelties only remarked after long seclusion that steep winding pebbly road with the ferns and creeping plants on its rocky sides was a wonderful panorama to her and she entreated for a stop at the summit to look down on the sea and the town but here grace came out to them full of thanks and hopes little knowing that to them the event was a very great one when at the glass doors of the garden entrance ermine trusted herself to the colonels arm and between him and her crutch crossed the short space to the morning room where rachel rose from her sofa but wisely did not come forward till her guest was safely placed in a large easy chair  rachel then held out her hand to the colonel and quietly said thank you in a subdued manner that really touched him as he retreated quickly and left them together then rachel sat down on a footstool close to ermine and looked up to her oh it is so good of you to come to me i would not have dared to think of it but i just said i wished to get out for nothing but to go to you and then hecaptain keithwould go and fetch you  as the nearest approach to fetching the moon i suppose said ermine brightly it was very kind to me for i was longing to see you and i am glad to find you looking better than i expected  for in truth rachels complexion had been little altered by her illness and the subdued dejected expression was the chief change visible except in the feebleness and tremulousness of all her movements yes i am better she said i ought to be for he is so good to me  dear rachel i was so very glad to hear of this said ermine bending down to kiss her  were you i thought no one could be that cared for him said rachel  i cared more for him the week that you were ill than ever i had done before  grace tells me of that said rachel and when he is here i believe it but miss williams please look full at me and tell me whether everybody would not thinki dont say that i could do itbut if every one would not think it a great escape for him if i gave him up  no one that could really judge  because listen said rachel quickly the regiment is going to scotland and he and the mother have taken it into their heads that i shall get well faster somewhere away from home andand they want to have the wedding as soon as i am better and they are going to write about settlements and all that i have never said i would and i dont feel as ifas if i ought to let him do it and if ever the thing is to be stopped at all this is the only time  but why you do not wish  dont talk of what i wish said rachel talk of what is good for him  ermine was struck with the still resolute determination of judging for herselfthe selfsufficiency almost redeemed by the unselfishness and the face was most piteously in earnest  my dear surely he can be trusted to judge he is no boy in spite of his looks the colonel always says that he is as much older than his age in character as he is younger in appearance  i know that said rachel but i dont think he ought to be trusted here for you see and she looked down all the blindness ofof his affection is enhanced by his nobleness and generosity and he has nobody to check or stop him and it does seem to me a shame for us all to catch at such compassion and encumber him with me just because i am marked for scorn and dislike i cant get any one to help me look at it so my own people would fancy it was only that i did not care for him and hei cant even think about it when he is here but i get quite distracted with doubts if it can be right whenever he goes away and you are the only person who can help me bessie wrote very kindly to me and i asked to see what she said to him i thought i might guess her feeling from it and he said he knew i should fancy it worse than it was if he did not let me see it was droll and just like hernot unkind but i could see it is the property that makes her like it and his uncle is blind you know and could only send a blessing and kind hopes and all that oh if i could guess whether that uncle thinks he ought what does colonel keith think i know you will tell me truly  he thinks said ermine with a shaken voice that real trustworthy affection outweighs all the world could say  but he thinks it is a strange misplaced liking exaggerated by pity for one sunk so low said rachel in an excited manner  rachel said ermine you must take my beginning as a pledge of my speaking the whole truth colonel keith is certainly not fond of you personally and rather wonders at alick but he has never doubted that this is the genuine feeling that is for life and that it is capable of making you both better and happier indeed rachel we do both feel that you suit alick much more than many people who have been far better liked  rachel looked cheered yet you she faltered you have been an instance of resolute withstanding  i dont think i shall be long murmured ermine a vivid colour flashing forth upon her cheek and leading the question from herself just suppose you did carry out this fierce act of selfabnegation what do you think could come next  i dont know i would not break down or die if i could help it added rachel faintly after her brave beginning  and for him do you think being cast off would be so very pleasant to him  rachel hung her head and her lips made a half murmur of would not it be good for him  no rachel it is the very sorest trial there can be when even in the course of providence kind intentions are coldly requited and it would be incalculably harder when therewith there would be rejection of love  ah i never said i could do it i could not tell him i did not care for him and short of that nothing would stop it sobbed rachel only i wished to feel it was not very meanvery wrong she laid her weary head on ermines lap and ermine bent down and kissed her  so happy so bright and free and capable his life seems now proceeded rachel i cant understand his joining it to mine and if people shunned and disliked him for my sake  surely that will depend on yourself i have never seen you in society but if you have the fear of making him unpopular or remarkable before your eyes you will avoid it  oh yes i know said rachel impatiently i did think i should not have been a commonplace woman and she shed a few tears  ermine was provoked with her and began to think that she had been arguing on a wrong tack and that it would be better after all for alick to be free rachel looked up presently it must be very odd to you to hear me say so but i cant help feeling the difference i used to think it so poor and weak to be in love or to want any one to take care of one i thought marriage such ordinary drudgery and ordinary opinions so contemptible and had such schemes for myself and thisand this is such a break down my blunders and their consequences have been so unspeakably dreadful and now instead of suffering dyingas i felt i oughtit has only made me just like other women for i know i could not live without him and then all the rest of it must come for his sake  and will make you much more really useful and effective than ever you could have been alone said ermine  he does talk of doing things together but oh i feel as if i could never dare put out my hand again  not alone perhaps  i like to hear him tell me about the soldiers children and what he wants to have done for them  you and i little thought what lady temple was to bring us said ermine cheerfully but you see we are not the strongest creatures in the world so we must resign ourselves to our fate and make the best of it they must judge how many imperfections they choose to endure and we can only make the said drawbacks as little troublesome as may be now i think i see miss curtis watching in fear that i am overtalking you  oh must you go you have really comforted me i wanted an external opinion very much and i do trust yours only tell me she added holding ermines hand is this indeed so with you  not yet said ermine softly do not speak about it but i think you will be comforted to hear that this matter of yours by leading to the matrons confession may have removed an obstacle that was far more serious in my eyes than even my own helplessness willing as colin was to cast both aside oh rachel there is a great deal to be thankful for  rachel lay down on her sofa and fell asleep nor did alick find any occasion for blaming grace when he returned the next day the effect of the conversation had been to bring rachel to a meek submission very touching in its passiveness and weary peacefulness she was growing stronger walked out leaning on alicks arm and was even taken out by him in a boat a wonderful innovation for a dangerous accident to mr curtis had given the mother such a horror of the sea that no boating excursions had ever taken place during her solitary reign and the present were only achieved by a wonderful stretch of dear alexanders influence perhaps she trusted him the more because his maimed hand prevented him from being himself an oarsman though he had once been devoted to rowing at any rate with an old fisherman at the oar many hours were spent upon the waters of the bay in a tranquillity that was balm to the harassed spirit with very little talking now and then some reading aloud but often nothing but a dreamy repose the novelty and absence of old association was one secret of the benefit that rachel thus derived any bustle or resumption of former habits was a trial to her shattered nerves and brought back the dreadful haunted nights the first sight of conrade still looking thin and delicate quite overset her a drive on the avoncester road renewed all she had felt on the way thither three or four morning visitors coming in on her unexpectedly made the whole morbid sense of eyes staring at her recur all night and when the london solicitor came down about the settlements she shrank in such a painful though still submissive way from the sight of a stranger far more from the semblance of a dinner party that the mother yielded and let her remain in her sittingroom  may i come in said alick knocking at the door i have something to tell you  what alick not mr williams come  nothing so good in fact i doubt if you will think it good at all i have been consulting this same solicitor about the titledeeds that cheese you let fall you know he added stroking her hand and speaking so gently that the very irony was rather pleasant  oh it is very bad  now wouldnt you like to hear it was so bad that i should have to sell out and go to the diggings to make it up  now alick if it were not for your sake you know i should like  i know you would but you see unfortunately it was not a cheese at all only a wooden block that the fox ran away with lawyers dont put peoples titledeeds into such dangerous keeping the true cheese is safe locked up in a tinbox in mr martins chambers in london  then what did i give mauleverer  a copy kept for reference down here rachel hid her face  there i knew you would think it no good news and it is just a thunderclap to me all you wanted me for was to defend the mother and make up to the charity and now theres no use in me he said in a disconsolate tone  oh alick alick why am i so foolish  never mind i took care martin should not know it nobody is aware of the little affair but our two selves and i will take care the fox learns the worth of his prize only now rachel answer me is there any use left for me still  you should not ask me such things alick you know it all too well  not so well that i dont want to hear it but i had more to say this martin is a man of very different calibre from old cox with a head and heart in london charities and churches and it had struck him as it did you that the homestead had an easier bargain of it than that good namesake of yours had ever contemplated if it paid treble or quadruple rent the dear mother would never find it out nor grow a geranium the less  no she would not but after all the lace apprenticeships are poor work  so they are but martin says there would be very little difficulty in getting a private bill to enable the trustees to apply the sum otherwise for the benefit of the avonmouth girls  then if i had written to him it would have been all right oh my perverseness  and rachel now that money has been once so intended suppose it kept its destination about £500 would put up a tidy little industrial school and you might not object to have a scholarship or two for some of our little th highlander lassies whose fathers wont make orphans of them for the regular military charities what crying rachel dont you like it  it is my dream the very thing i wished and managed so vilely if lovedy were alive though perhaps that is not the thing to wish but i cant bear taking your  hush you cant do worse than separate your own from mine this is no part of the means i laid before mr martin by way of proving myself a responsible individual i took care of that part of this is prizemoney and the rest was a legacy that a rich old merchant put me down for in a transport of gratitude because his son was one of the sick in the bungalow where the shell came i have had it these three or four months and wondered what to do with it  this will be very beautiful very excellent and we can give the ground  i have thought of another thing i never heard of an industrial school where the great want was not food for industry now i know the colonel and mr mitchell have some notion floating in their minds about getting a house for convalescents down here and it strikes me that this might supply the work in cooking washing and so on i think i might try what they thought of it  rachel could only weep out her shame and thankfulness and when alick reverently added that it was a scheme that would require much thought and much prayer the pang struck her to the hearthow little she had prayed over the f u e e the prayer of her life had been for action and usefulness but when she had seen the shadow in the stream her hot and eager haste her unconscious detachment from all that was not visible and material had made her adhere too literally to that misinterpreted motto laborare est orare how should then her eyes be clear to discern between substance and shadow     chapter xxiv the honeymoon     around the very place doth brood   a calm and holy quietuderev isaac williams   the level beams of a summer sun ending one of his longest careers were tipping a mountain peak with an ineffable rosy purple contrasting with the deep shades of narrow ravines that cleft the rugged sides and gradually expanded into valleys sloping with green pasture or clothed with wood the whole picture with its clear soft sky was retraced on the waters of the little lake set in emerald meadows which lay before the eyes of rachel keith as she reclined in a garden chair before the windows of a pretty rusticlooking hotel but there was no admiration no peaceful contemplation on her countenance only the same weary air of depression too wistful and startled even to be melancholy repose and the same bewildered distressed look that had been as it were stamped on her by the gaze of the many unfriendly eyes at the quarter sessions and by her two unfortunate dinner parties  the wedding was to have been quietness itself but though the bridegroom had refused to contribute sister brotherinlaw or even uncle to the numbers conventionalities had been too strong for mrs curtis and just one more had been added to the guests till a sufficient multitude had been collected to renew all rachels morbid sensations of distress and bewilderment with their accompanying feverish symptoms and she had been only able to proceed on her journey by very short stages taken late in the day  alick had not forgotten her original views as to travelling and as they were eventually to go to scotland had proposed beginning with dutch reformatories and swiss cretins but she was so plainly unfit for extra fatigue and bustle that the first few weeks were to be spent in wales where the enjoyment of fine scenery might it was hoped be beneficial to the jaded spirits and they had been going through a course of passes and glens as thoroughly as rachels powers would permit for any overfatigue renewed feverishness and its delusive miseries and the slightest alarm told upon the shattered nerves  she did not easily give way at the moment but the shock always took revenge in subsequent suffering which all alicks care could not prevent though the exceeding charm of his tenderness rendered even the indisposition almost precious to her  what a lovely sunset he said coming to lean over the back of her chair have you been watching it  i dont know  are you very much tired  no it is very quiet here  very but i must take you in before that curling mist mounts into your throat  this is a very nice place alick the only really quiet one we have found  i am afraid that it will be so no longer the landlord tells me he has letters from three parties to order rooms  oh then pray let us go on said rachel looking alarmed  tomorrow afternoon then for i find theres another waterfall  very well said rachel resignedly  or shall we cut the waterfall and get on to llansomething  if you dont think we ought to see it  ought he said smiling what is the ought in the case why are we going through all this is it a duty to society or to ourselves  a little of both i suppose said rachel  and rachel from the bottom of your heart is it not a trying duty  i want to like what you are showing me said rachel  and you are more worried than delighted eh  ii dont know i see it is grand and beautiful i did love my own moors and the spinsters needles butdont think me very ungrateful but i cant enter into all this all i really do care for is your kindness and helping me about and she was really crying like a child unable to learn a lesson  well he said with his own languor of acquiescence we are perfectly agreed waterfalls are an uncommon bore if one is not in a concatenation accordingly  rachel was beguiled into a smile  come he said let us be strong minded if life should ever become painful to us because of our neglect of the waterfalls we will set out and fulfil our tale of them meantime let me take you where you shall be really quiet home to bishopsworthy  but your uncle does not expect you so soon  my uncle is always ready for me and a week or two of real rest there would make you ready for the further journey  rachel made no opposition she was glad to have her mind relieved from the waterfalls but she had rather have been quite alone with her husband she knew that lord and lady keith had taken a house at littleworthy while gowanbrae was under repair and she dreaded the return to the bewildering world before even the first month was over but alick made the proposal so eagerly that she could not help assenting with all the cordiality she could muster thinking that it must be a wretched disappointing wedding tour for him and she would at least not prevent his being happy with his uncle as happy as he could be with a person tied to him of whom all his kindred must disapprove and especially that paragon of an uncle whom she heard of like an intensification of all that class of clergy who had of late been most alien to her  alick did not press for her real wishes but wrote his letter and followed it as fast as she could bear to travel so when the train a succession of ovens for living bodies disguised in dust drew up at the littleworthy station there was a ready response to the smart footmans inquiry captain and mrs keith this personage by no means accorded with rachels preconceived notions of the rectory establishment but she next heard the peculiar clatter by which a grand equipage announces its importance and saw the coronetted blinkers tossing on the other side of the railing a kind little note of welcome was put into rachels hand as she was seated in the luxurious open carriage and alick had never felt better pleased with his sister than when he found his wife thus spared the closeness of the cramping fly or the dusty old rectory phaeton hospitality is never more welcome than at the station and bessies letter was complacently accepted rachel would she knew be too much tired to see her on that day and on the next she much regretted having an engagement in london but on the sunday they would not fail to meet and she begged that rachel would send word by the servant what time meg should be sent to the rectory for her to ride it would be a kindness to exercise her for it was long since she had been used  rachel could not help colouring with pleasure at the notion of riding her own meg again and alick freely owned that it was well thought of he already had a horse at his uncles and was delighted to see rachel at last looking forward to something but as she lay back in the carriage revelling in the fresh wind she became dismayed at the succession of cottages of gentility with lawns and hedges of various pretensions  there must be a terrible number of people here  this is only littleworthy  not very little  no i told you it was villafied and cockneyfied there as the horses tried to stop at a lodge leading to a prettily built house thats timber end the crack place here where bessie has always said it was her ambition to live  how far is it from the parsonage  four miles  which was a comfort to rachel not that she wished to be distant from bessie but the population appalled her imagination  bishopsworthy is happily defended by a dukery explained alick as coming to the end of the villas they passed woods and fields a bit of heathy common and a scattering of cottages labourers going home from work looked up and as their eyes met alicks there was a mutual smile and touch of the hat he evidently felt himself coming home the trees of a park were beginning to rise in front when the carriage turned suddenly down a sharp steep hill the right side of the road bounded by a park paling the left by cottages reached by picturesque flights of brick stairs then came a garden wall and a halt alick called out thanks and we will get out here adding they will take in the goods the back way i dont like careering into the churchyard  rachel alighting saw that the lane proceeded downwards to a river crossed by a wooden bridge with an expanse of meadows beyond to her left was a stableyard and below it a white gate and white railings enclosing a graveyard with a very beautiful church standing behind a mushroom yewtree the upper boundary of the churchyard was the clipped yew hedge of the rectory garden whose front entrance was through the churchyard there was a lovely cool tranquillity of aspect as the shadows lay sleeping on the grass and rachel could have stood and gazed but alick opened the gate and there was a movement at the seat that enclosed the gnarled trunk of the yew tree a couple of village lads touched their caps and departed the opposite way a white setter dog bounded forward and closely attended by a still snowier cat a gentleman came to meet them so fearlessly treading the pathway between the graves and so youthful in figure that it was only the well uncle here she is and alick my dear boy that convinced her that this was indeed mr clare the next moment he had taken her hand kissed her brow and spoken a few words of fatherly blessing then while alick exchanged greetings with the cat and dog he led her to the arched yewtree entrance to his garden up two stone steps along a flagged path across the narrow grassplat in front of the old twostoried house with a tiled verandah like an eyebrow to the lower front windows  instead of entering by the door in the centre he turned the corner of the house where the eastern gable disclosed a window opening on a sloping lawn full of bright flowerbeds the room within was lined with books and stored with signs of parish work but with a refined orderliness reigning over the various little ornaments and almost betokening feminine habitation and alick exclaimed with admiration of a large bowl of fresh roses beautifully arranged  traces of bessie said mr clare she brought them this morning and spent nearly an hour in arranging them and entertaining me with her bright talk i have hardly been able to keep out of the room since they make it so delicious  do you often see her asked alick  yes dear child she is most goodnatured and attentive and i take it most kindly of her so courted as she is  how do you get on with his lordship  i dont come much in his way he has been a good deal laid up with sciatica but he seems very fond of her and it was all her doing that they have been all this time at littleworthy instead of being in town for the season she thought it better for him  and where is mr lifford asked alick  gone to m till saturday  unable to face the bride  i fear ranger is not equally shy said mr clare understanding a certain rustle and snort to import that the dog was pressing his chin hard upon rachels knee while she declared her content with the handsome creatures black depth of eye and the cat executed a promenade of tenderness upon alick  how are the peacocks alick added mr clare they at least are inoffensive pets i dreaded the shears without your superintendence but joe insisted that they were getting lopsided  alick put his head out at the window all right sir joe has been a little hard on the crest of the lefthand one but it is recovering  whereupon rachel discovered that the peacocks were creatures of yewtree perched at either end of the garden fence mr clare had found them there and preserved them with solicitous fidelity  nothing could be less like than he was to the grave thin stooping ascetic in a long coat that she had expected he was a tall wellmade man of the same youthful cast of figure as his nephew and a far lighter and more springy step with features and colouring recalling those of his niece as did the bright sunny playful sweetness of his manner his dark handsome eyes only betraying their want of sight by a certain glassy immobility that contrasted with the play of the expressive mouth it was hard to guess why bessie should have shunned such an uncle alick took rachel to the bedroom above the library and like it with two windowsone overlooking churchyard river and hayfields the other commanding over the peacock hedge a view of the playground where mr clare was seen surrounded by boys appealing to him on some disputed matter of cricket there was a wonderful sense of serenity freshness and fragrance inexpressibly grateful to rachels wearied feelings and far more comfortable than the fine scenery through which she had been carried because no effort to look and admire was incumbent on hernay not even an effort to talk all the evening mr clare seemed to have perfectly imbibed the idea that rest was what she wanted and did not try to make small talk with her though she sat listening with pleased interest to the conversation between him and his nephewso home like so full of perfect understanding of one another  is there anything to be read aloud presently asked alick  you have not by chance got framley parsonage  i wish i had i did pick up silas marner at a station thinking you might like it and he glanced at rachel who had he suspected thought his purchase an act of weakness have you met with it  i have met with nothing of the sort since you were here last then turning to rachel alick indulges me with novels for my good curate had rather read the catalogue of a sale any day than meddle with one and i cant set on my pupil teacher in a book where i dont know what is coming  we will get framley said alick  bessie has it she read me a very clever scene about a weak young parson bent on pleasing himself and offered to lend me the book but i thought it would not edify will walker but no doubt you have read it long ago  no said rachel and something withheld her from disclaiming such empty employments indeed she was presently much interested in the admirable portraiture of silas marner and still more by the keen vivid enjoyment critical droll and moralizing displayed by a man who heard works of fiction so rarely that they were always fresh to him and who looked on them as studies of life his hands were busy all the time carving a boss for the roof of one of the side aisles of his churchthe last step in its gradual restoration  that night there was no excitement of nerve no morbid fancy to trouble rachels slumbers she only awoke as the eight oclock bell sounded through the open window and for the first time for months rose less weary than she had gone to rest weekday though it were the description sweet day so calm so cool so bright constantly recurred to her mind as she watched the quiet course of occupation alick after escorting his uncle to a cottage found her searching among the stores in the music stand  you unmusical female he said what is that for  your uncle spoke of music last night and i thought he would like it  i thought you had no such propensity  i learnt like other people but it was the only thing i could not do as well as grace and i thought it wasted time and was a young ladyism but if can recover music enough to please him i should be glad  thank you said alick earnestly he is very much pleased with your voice in speaking indeed i believe i first heard it with his ears  this is a thorough ladys collection of music said rachel looking through it to hide her blush of pleasure altogether the house has not a bachelor look  did you not know that he had been married it was when he first had the living twelve years ago she was a very lovely young thing half irish and this was the happiest place in the world for two years till her little brother was sent home here from school without proper warning of a fever that had begun there we all had it but she and her baby were the only ones that did not recover there they lie under the yewtree where my uncle likes to teach the children he was terribly struck down for years though he went manfully to his work and it has been remarkable how his spirits and sociability have returned since he lost his sight indeed he is more consistently bright than ever he was  i never saw any one like him said rachel i have fallen in with clergy that some call holy and with some that others call pious but he is not a bit like either he is not even grave yet there is a calming refreshing sense of reverence towards him that would be awe only it is so happy  alicks response was to bend over her and kiss her brow she had never seen him so much gratified  what a comfort your long stay with him must have been she said presently in the beginning of his blindness  i hope so it was an ineffable comfort to me to come here out of littleworthy croquet and i think cheering me did him good rachel you may do and say what you please he added earnestly since you have taken to him  i could not help it said rachel though a slight embarrassment came over her at the recollection of bessie and at the thought of the narrow views on which she expected to differ then as alick continued to search among the music she asked will he like the piano to be used  of all things bessies singing is his delight look could we get this up  you dont sing alick i mean do you  we need not betray our talents to worldlings base  rachel found her accompaniment the least satisfactory part of the affair and resolved on an hours practice every day in mr clares absence a wholesome purpose even as regarded her health and spirits she had just sat down to write letters feeling for the first time as if they would not be a toil when mr clare looked in to ask alick to refer to a verse in the psalms quoting it in greek as well as english and after the research had been carried to the hebrew he told rachel that he was going to write his sermon and repaired to the peacock path where he paced along with ranger and the cat in faithful unobtrusive attendance  what you can read hebrew alick  so can you  enough to appreciate the disputed passages when did you study it  i learnt enough when i was laid up to look out my uncles texts for him  she felt a little abashed by the tone but a message called him away and before his return mr clare came back to ask for a reference to st augustine on her offer of her services she was thanked and directed with great precision to the right volume of the library of the fathers but spying a real st augustine she could not be satisfied without a flight at the original it was not however easy to find the place she was forced to account for her delay by confessing her attempt and then to profit by mr clares directions and after all her false quantities though most tenderly and apologetically corrected must have been dreadful to the scholarly ear for she was obliged to get alick to read the passage over to him before he arrived at the sense and rachel felt her flight of clever womanhood had fallen short it was quite new to her to be living with people who knew more of and went deeper into everything than she did and her husbands powers especially amazed her  the afternoon was chiefly spent in the hayfield under a willowtree mr clare tried to leave the young people to themselves but they would not consent and after a good deal of desultory talk and description of the minnows and waterspiders in whom mr clare seemed to take a deep interest they went on with their book till the horses came and alick took rachel for a ride in earlsworthy park a private gate of which just opposite to the rectory was free to its inhabitants the duke was an old college friend of mr clare and though much out of health and hardly ever able to reside at the park all its advantages were at the rectors service and they were much appreciated when on this sultry summers day rachel found shade and coolness in the deep arcades of the beech woods and freshness on the upland lawns as she rode happily on the dear old mare by whom she really thought herself fondly recognised there was something in the stillness of the whole even in the absence of the roll and plash of the sea waves beside which she had grown up that seemed to give her repose from the hurry and throb of sensations and thoughts that had so long preyed upon her and when the ride was over she was refreshed not tired and the evening bell drew her to the conclusion most befitting a day spent in that atmosphere of quietude she felt grateful to her husband for making no remark though the only time she had been within a church since her illness had been at their wedding he only gave her his arm and said she should sit in the nook that used to be his in the time of his lameness and a most sheltered nook it was between a pillar and the open chancel screen where no eyes could haunt her even if the congregation had been more than a saturday summer evening one  she only saw the pure clear delicatelytoned hues of the east window and the reverent richness of the chancel and she heard the blind pastors deep musical voice full of that expressive power always enhanced by the absence of a book he led the psalms with perfect security and a calm fervour that rendered the whole familiar service like something new and touching the lessons were read by alick and rachel though under any other circumstances she would have been startled to see him standing behind the eagle could not but feel all appropriate and went along with each word as he read it in a tone well worthy of his uncles scholar whether few or many were present rachel knew not thought not she was only sensible of the fulness of calm joy that made the thanksgiving touch her heart and fill her eyes with unbidden tears that came far more readily than of old  yet this cant be all she said to herself as she wandered among the tall white lilies in the twilight is it a trance or am i myself i have not unthought or unfelt yet i seem falling into a very sweet hypocrisy alick says thought will come back with strength i dont think i wish it  the curate did not return till after she had gone to bed and in the morning he proved to be indeed a very dry and serious middleaged man extremely silent and so grave that there was no knowing how much to allow for shyness he looked much worn and had a wearied voice and mr clare and alick were contriving all they could to give him the rest which he refused mr clare insisting on taking all the service that could be performed without eyes and alick volunteering schoolwork this rachel was not yet able to undertake nor would alick even let her go to church in the morning but the shady garden and the echoes of the amens and sweet clear tones of singing seemed to lull her on in this same gentle unthinking state of dreamy rest and thence too in the after part of the day she could watch the rector with his sunday class on his favourite seat under the yewtree close to the cross that marked the restingplace of his wife and child  she went to church in the evening sheltered from curious eyes in her nook and there for a moment she heard the peculiar brush and sweep of rich silk upon pavement and wondered at so sophisticated a sound in the little homely congregation but forgot it again in the exulting joyous beauty of the chants and hymns led by the rector himself and oh how different from poor mr touchetts best efforts and forgot it still more in the unfettered eloquence of the preaching of a man of great natural power and entirely accustomed to trust to his own inward stores like ermine williams she could have said that this preaching was the first that won her attention it certainly was the first that swept away all her spirit of criticising and left her touched and impressed not judging on what north country folk call the loosing of the kirk she moving outwards after the throng found herself close behind a gauzy white cloak over a lilac silk that filled the whole breadth of the central aisle and by the dark curl descending beneath the tiny white bonnet as well as by the turn of the graceful head she knew her sisterinlaw lady keith of gowanbrae in the porch she was met with outstretched hands and eager greetings  at last where did you hide yourself i had begun to imagine dire mischances  only in the corner by the chancel  alicks old nook keeping up honeymoon privileges i have kept your secret faithfully no one knows you are not on the top of snowdon or you would have had all the world to call on you  there are always the earlsworthy woods said alick  or better still come to timber end no one penetrates to my morning room laughed bessie  now uncle george she said as the rector appeared you have had a full allowance of them for three days you must spare them to me tomorrow morning  so it is you my lady he answered with a pleased smile i heard a sort of hailstorm of dignity sailing in how is lord keith  very stiff i want him to have advice but he hates doctors what is the last avonmouth news is ermine in good heart and the boys well again  she was the same bessie as everfull of exulting animation joined to a caressing manner that her uncle evidently delighted in and to rachel she was most kind and sisterly welcoming her so as amply to please and gratify alick an arrangement was made that rachel should be sent for early to spend the day at timber end and that mr clare and alick should walk over later then the two pretty ponies came with her little low carriage to the yewtree gate were felt and admired by mr clare and approved by alick and she drove off gaily leaving all pleased and amused but still there was a sense that the perfect serenity had been ruffled  rachel said alick as they wandered in the twilight garden i wonder if you would be greatly disappointed if our travels ended here  i am only too glad of the quiet  because lifford is in great need of thorough rest he has not been away for more than a year and now he is getting quite knocked up all he does care to do is to take lodgings near his wifes asylum poor man and see her occasionally sad work but it is rest and winds him up again and there is no one but myself to whom he likes to leave my uncle strangers always do too little or too much and there is a young man at littleworthy for the long vacation who can help on a sunday  oh pray let us stay as long as we can  giving up the cretins  it is no sacrifice i am thankful not to be hunted about and if anything could make me better pleased to be here it would be feeling that i was not hindering you  then i will hunt him away for six weeks or two months at least it will be a great relief to my uncles mind  it was so great a relief that mr clare could hardly bring himself to accept the sacrifice of the honeymoon and though there could be little doubt which way the discussion would end he had not yielded when the ponies bore off rachel on monday morning  timber end was certainly a delightful place alick had railed it a cockney villa but it was in good taste and very fair and sweet with flowers and shade bessies own rooms where she made rachel charmingly at home were wonderful in choiceness and elegance exciting rachels surprise how it could be possible to be so sumptuously lodged in such a temporary abode for the house was only hired for a few months while gowanbrae was under repair it was within such easy reach of london that bessie had been able from thence to go through the more needful season gaieties and she had thought it wise both for herself and lord keith not to enter on their full course it sounded very moderate and prudent and rachel felt vexed with herself and alick for recollecting a certain hint of his that lady keith felt herself more of a star in her own old neighbourhood than she could be in london and wisely abstained from a full flight till she had tried her wings it was much pleasanter to go along with bessies many far better and more affectionate reasons for prudence and her minutely personal confidences about her habits hopes and fears given with a strong sense of her own importance and consideration yet with a warm sisterly tone that made them tokens of adoption and with an arch drollery that invested them with a sort of grace the number of engagements that she mentioned in town and country did indeed seem inconsistent with the prudence she spoke of with regard to her own health or with her attention to that of her husband but it appeared that all were quite necessary and according to his wishes and the london ones were usually for the sake of trying to detach his daughter mrs comyn menteith from the extravagant set among whom she had fallen bessie was excessively diverting in her accounts of her relations with this scatterbrained stepdaughter of hers and altogether showed in the most flattering manner how much more thoroughly she felt herself belonging to her brothers wife if she had ever been amazed or annoyed at alicks choice she had long ago surmounted the feeling or put it out of sight and she judiciously managed to leap over all that had passed since the beginning of the intimacy that had arisen at the station door at avoncester it was very flattering and would have been perfectly delightful if rachel had not found herself wearying for alick and wondering whether at the end of seven months she should be as contented as bessie seemed to know her husband to be in the sittingroom without one sight of him  at luncheon however when lord keith appeared nothing could be prettier than his wifes manner to himbright sweet and with a touch of graceful deference at which he always smiled and showed himself pleased but rachel thought him looking much older than in the autumnhe had little appetite stooped a good deal and evidently moved with pain he would not go out of doors and bessie after following him to the library and spending a quarter of an hour in ministering to his comfort took rachel to sit by a cool dancing fountain in the garden and began with some solicitude to consult her whether he could be really suffering from sciatica or as she had lately begun to suspect from the effects of a blow from the end of a scaffoldpole that had been run against him when taking her through a crowded street rachel spoke of advice  what you rachel you who despised allopathy  i have learnt not to despise advice  and bessie would not trench on rachels experiences  theres some old scotch doctor to whom his faith is given and that i dont half believe in if he would see our own mr harvey here it would be quite another thing but it is of no use telling him that alick would never have had an available knee but for mr harveys management he persists in leaving me to my personal trust in him but for himself he wont see him at any price have you seen mr harvey  i have seen no one  oh i forgot you are not arrived yet but  theres some one exclaimed rachel nervously and in fact a young man was sauntering towards them bessie rose with a sort of annoyance and never mind my dear he is quite inoffensive well soon get rid of him then as he greeted her with good morning lady keith i thought i should find you here she quickly replied  if you had been proper behaved and gone to the door you would have known that i am not at home  he smiled and came nearer  no i am not at home and what is more i do not mean to be my uncle will be here directly she added in a feefawfum tone  then it is not true that your brother and his bride are arrived  true in the same sense as that i am at home there she is you seeonly you are not to see her on any account as a bow necessarily passed between him and rachel now mind you have not been introduced to mrs keith and if you utter a breath that will bring the profane crowd in shoals upon the rectory i shall never forgive you  then i am afraid we must not hope to see you at the bazaar for the idiots  no indeed bessie answered respecting rachels gesture of refusal no one is to infringe her incog under penalty of never coming here again  you are going he added to bessie indeed that was what brought me here my sisters sent me to ask whether they may shelter themselves under your matronly protection for my mother dreads the crush  i suppose as they put my name down that i must go but you know i had much rather give the money outright it is a farce to call a bazaar charity  call it what you will it is one device for a little sensation  rachels only sensation at that moment was satisfaction at the sudden appearance of rangers white head the sure harbinger of his master and alick and she sprang up to meet them in the shrubbery pathall her morbid shyness at the sight of a fresh face passing away when her hand was within alicks arm when they came forth upon the lawn alicks brow darkened for a moment and there was a formal exchange of greetings as the guest retreated  i am so sorry began bessie at once i had taken precautions against invasion but he did not go to the front door i do so hope rachel has not been fluttered  i thought he was at rio said alick  he could not stand the climate and was sent home about a month agoa regular case of bad shilling i am afraid poor fellow i am so sorry he came to startle rachel but i swore him over to secrecy he is not to mention to any living creature that she is nearer than plinlimmon till the incog is laid aside i know how to stand up for bridal privileges and not to abuse the confidence placed in me  any one who was up to the game might have perceived that the sister was trying to attribute all the brothers tone of disapprobation to his anxiety lest his wife should have been startled while both knew as well as possible that there was a deeper ground of annoyance which was implied in alicks answer  he seems extremely tame about the garden  or he would not have fallen on rachel it was only a chance he just brought over a message about that tiresome bazaar that has been dinned into our ears for the last three months a bazaar for idiots they may well call it they wanted a carving of yours uncle george  i am afraid i gave little alice bertie one in a weak moment bessie said mr clare but i hardly durst show my face to lifford afterwards  after all it is better than some bazaars said bessie it is only for the idiot asylum and i could not well refuse my name and countenance to my old neighbours though i stood out against taking a stall lord keith would not have liked it  will he be able to go with you asked alick  oh no it would be an intolerable bore and his scottish thrift would never stand the sight of people making such very bad bargains no i am going to take the carleton girls in they are very accommodating and i can get away whenever i please i am much too forbearing to ask any of you to go with me though i believe uncle george is pining to go and see after his carving  no thank you after what i heard of the last bazaar i made up my mind that they are no places for an old parson nor for his carvings either so you are quite welcome to fall on me for my inconsistency  not now when you have a holiday from mr lifford returned bessie now come and smell the roses  all the rest of the day alick relapsed into the lazy frivolous young officer with whom rachel had first been acquainted  as he was driving home in the cool fresh summer night he began  i think i must go to this idiotical bazaar  you exclaimed rachel  yes i dont think bessie ought to go by herself with all this carleton crew  you dont wish me to go said rachel gulping down the effort  you my dear rachel i would not take you for fifty pounds nor could i go myself without leaving you as vice deputy curate  no need for that said mr clare from the seat behind young people must not talk secrets with a blind mans ears behind them  i make no secret said alick i could not go without leaving my wife to take care of my uncle or my uncle to take care of my wife  and you think you ought to go said mr clare it is certainly better that bessie should have a gentleman with her in the crowd but you know this is a gossiping neighbourhood and you must be prepared for amazement at your coming into public alone not three weeks after your wedding  i cant help it she cant go and i must  and you will bring down all the morning visitors that you talk of dreading  we will leave you to amuse them sir much better that he added between his teeth than to leave the very semblance of a secret trusted by her to that intolerable puppy  rachel said no more but when she was gone upstairs mr clare detained his nephew to say i beg your pardon alick but you should be quite sure that your wife likes this proposal  thats the value of a strongminded wife sir returned alick she is not given to making a fuss about small matters  most ladies might not think this a small matter  that is because they have no perspective in their brains rachel understands me a great deal too well to make me explain what is better unspoken  you know what i think alick that you are the strictest judge that ever a merry girl had  i had rather you continued to think so uncle i should like to think so myself good night  alick was right but whether or not rachel entered into his motives she made no objection to his going to the bazaar with his sister being absolutely certain that he would not have done so if he could have helped it  nor was her day at all dreary mr clare was most kind and attentive to her without being oppressive and she knew she was useful to him she was indeed so full of admiration and reverence for him that once or twice it crossed her whether she were not belying another of her principles by lapsing into curatocult but the idea passed away with scorn at the notion of comparing mr clare with the objects of such devotion he belonged to that generation which gave its choicest in intellectual as well as in religious gifts to the ministry when a fresh tide of enthusiasm was impelling men forward to build up instead of breaking down before disappointment and suspicion had thinned the ranks and hurled back many a recruit or doctrinal carpings had taught men to dread a search into their own tenets he was a highly cultivated largeminded man and the conversation between him and his nephew was a constant novelty to her who had always yearned after depth and thought and seldom met with them still here she was constantly feeling how shallow were her acquirements how inaccurate her knowledge how devoid of force and solidity her reasonings compared with what here seemed to be old wellbeaten ground nay the very sparkle of fun and merriment surprised and puzzled her and all the courtesy of the one gentleman and the affection of the other could not prevent her sometimes feeling herself the dullest and most ignorant person present and yet the sense was never mortifying except when here and there a spark of the old conceit had lighted itself and lured her into pretensions where she thought herself proficient she was becoming more and more helpful to mr clare and his gratitude for her services made them most agreeable nor did that atmosphere of peace and sincerity that reigned round the rectory lose its charm she was really happy all through the solitary wednesday and much more contented with the results than was alick a sickening place he said i am glad i went  how glad bessie must have been to have you  i believe she was she has too much good taste for much of what went on there  i doubt said mr clare laughing if you could have been an agreeable acquisition  i dont know bessie fools one into thinking oneself always doing her a favour oh rachel i am thankful you have never taken to being agreeable     chapter xxv the huntsford croquet    une femme egoiste non seulement de coeur mais desprit ne pent

earlsworthy woods  nay listen alick i have let you alone and defended you for a whole month but if you persist in shutting up you wife people wont stand it  which of us is the mahometan  you are pitied but you see it was a strong thing our appearing without our several incumbrances and though an old married woman like me may do as she pleases yet for a bridegroom of not three weeks standing to resort to bazaars solus argues some weighty cause  and argues rightly  then you are content to be supposed to have an unproduceably eccentric melancholy bride  better they should think so than that she should be so she has been victimized enough already to her mothers desire to save appearances  you do not half believe me alick and this is really a very kind thoughtful arrangement of mrs huntsfords she consulted me saying there were such odd stories about you two that she was most anxious that rachel should appear and confute them and she thought that an outofdoor party like this would suit best because it would be early and rachel could get away if she found it too much for her  after being walked out to satisfy a curious neighbourhood  now alick do consider it this sort of thing could remind her of nothing painful uncle george would enjoy it  and fall over the croquet traps  no if you wanted to attend to him i could take care of rachel  i cannot tell bessie i believe it is pure goodnature on mrs huntsfords part but if we go it must be from rachels spontaneous movement i will not press her on any account i had rather the world said she was crazy at once than expose her to the risk of one of the dreadful nights that haunted us till we came here to perfect quiet  but she is well now she looks better and nicer than i ever saw her really alick now her face is softer and her eyes more veiled and her chin not cocked up i am quite proud of her every one will be struck with her good looks  flattery bessie he said not ill pleased yes she is much better and more like herself but i dread all this being overthrown if she herself wishes to go it may be a good beginning but she must not be persuaded  then i must not even tell her that she wont be required to croquet and that ill guard her from all civil speeches  no for indeed bessie on your own account and lord keiths you should hardly spend a long afternoon from home  heres the war in the enemys quarters as to fatigue dawdling about mrs huntsfords garden is much the same as dawdling about my own and makes me far more entertaining  i cannot help thinking bessie that lord keith is more ill than you suppose i am sure he is in constant pain  so i fear said bessie gravely but what can be done he will see no one but his old surgeon in edinburgh  then take him there  take him you must know what it is to be in the hands of a clever woman before you make such a proposal  you are a cleverer woman than my wife in bringing about what you really wish  just consider alick our own house is uninhabitable and this one on our handsmy aunt coming to me in a months time you dont ask me to do what is reasonable  i cannot tell bessie you can be the only judge of what is regard of the right kind for your husbands health or for yourself and see there is mrs huntsford actually arrived and talking to my uncle  one moment alick i am not going to insult myself so far as to suppose that poor charlie carletons being at home has anything to do with your desire to deport me but i want you to know that he did not come home till after we were settled here  i do not wish to enter into details bessie and he crossed the lawn towards the window where mr clare and rachel had just received mrs huntsford a goodnatured joyouslooking lady a favourite with every one her invitation was dexterously given to meet a few friends at luncheon and in the garden where the guests would be free to come and go there might perhaps be a little dancing later she had secured some good music which would she knew attract mr clare and she hoped he would bring captain and mrs keith she knew mrs keith had not been well but she promised her a quiet room to rest in and she wanted to show her a view of the devon coast done by a notable artist in watercolours rachel readily acceptedin fact this quiet month had been so full of restoration that she had almost forgotten her morbid shrinking from visitors and bessie infused into her praise and congratulations a hint that a refusal would have been much against alicks reputation so that she resolved to keep up to the mark even though he took care that she should know that she might yet retract  you did not wish me to refuse alick said she struck by his grave countenance when she found him lying on the slope of the lawn shortly after in deep thought  no not at all he replied it is likely to be a pleasant affair and my uncle will be delighted to have us with him no he added seeing that she still looked at him inquisitively it is the old story my sister poor little thing i always feel as though i wore more unkind and unjust to her than any one else and yet we are never together without my feeling as if she was deceiving herself and me and yet it is all so fair and well reasoned that one is always left in the wrong i regretted this marriage extremely at first and i am not the less disposed to regret it now  indeed every one says how attentive she is to him and how nicely they go on together  pshaw rachel that is just the way a few words and pretty ways pass with her and all the world for attention when she is wherever her fancy calls her all for his good it is just the attention she showed my uncle and now it is her will and pleasure to queen it here among her old friends and she will not open her eyes to see the poor old mans precarious state  do you think him so very ill alick  i was shocked when i saw him yesterday as to sciatica that is all nonsense the blow in his side has done some serious damage and if it is not well lookedto who knows what will be the end of it and then a gay young widow with no control over heri hate to think of it  indeed said rachel she is so warm and bright and really earnest in her kindness that she will be sure to see her own way right at home i dont think we can guess how obstinate lord keith may be in refusing to take advice  he cut me off pretty short said alick i am afraid he will see no one here and as bessie says the move to scotland would not be easy just now as i said she leaves one in the wrong and i dont like the future but it is of no use to talk of it so let us come and see if my uncle wants to go anywhere  it was alicks fate never to meet with sympathy in his feeling of his sisters doublemindedness whether it were that he was mistaken or that she really had the gift of sincerity for the moment in whatever she was saying the most candid and transparent people in the worldhis uncle and his wifenever even succeeded in understanding his dissatisfaction with bessies doings but always received them at her own valuation even while he had been looking forward with hope deferred to her residence with him as the greatest solace the world could yet afford him mr clare had always been convinced that her constant absence from his rectory except when his grand neighbours were at home had been unavoidable and had always credited the outward tokens of zealous devotion to his church and parish and to all that was useful or good elsewhere in effect there was a charm about her which no one but her brother ever resisted and even he held out by an exertion that made him often appear ungracious  however for the present the uneasiness was set aside in the daily avocations of the rectory where alick was always a very different person from what he appeared in lady temples drawingroom constantly engaged as he was by unobtrusive watchfulness over his uncle and active and alert in this service in a manner that was a curious contrast to his ordinary sauntering ways as to rachel the whole state of existence was still a happy dream she floated on from day to day in the tranquil activity of the rectory without daring to look back on the past or to think out her present frame of mind it was only the languor and rest of recovery after suffering and her husband was heedfully watching her fearing the experiment of the croquet party though on many accounts feeling the necessity of its being made  ermines hint that with rachel it rested to prevent her unpopularity from injuring her husband had not been thrown away and she never manifested any shrinking from the party and even took some interest in arraying herself for it  that is what i call well turned out exclaimed alick when she came down  describe her dress if you please said mr clare i like to hear how my nieces look  alick guided his hand there stroke it down a long white feather in a shady hat trimmed with dark green velvet she is fresh and rosy you know sir and looks well in green and then is it graces taste rachel for it is the prettiest thing you have worna pale buff sort of silky thing embroidered all over in the same colour and he put a fold of the dress into his uncles hand  indian surely said mr clare feeling the pattern it is too intricate and graceful for the west  yes said alick i remember now grace showed it to me it was one that lady temple brought from india and never had made up poor grace could get no sympathy from rachel about the wedding clothes so she was obliged to come to me  and i thought you did not know one of my things from another said rachel do you really mean that you care  depend upon it he does my dear said mr clare i have heard him severely critical on his cousins  he has been very good in not tormenting me said rachel nestling nearer to him  i apprehended the consequences said alick and besides you never mounted that black lace pall or curtain or whatever you call it upon your head after your first attempt at frightening me away with it  a cap set against instead of at said mr clare laughing and therewith his old horse was heard clattering in the yard and alick proceeded to drive the wellused phaeton about three miles through earlsworthy park to a pleasantlooking demesne in the village beyond as they were turning in at the gate up came lady keith with her two brisk little shetlands she was one mass of pretty fresh fluttering blue and white muslin ribbon and lace and looked particularly well and brilliant  well met she said i called at the rectory to take up rachel but you were flown before me  yes we went through the park  i wish the duke would come home i cant go that way now till i have called i have no end of things to say to you she added and her little lively ponies shot ahead of the old rectorial steed however she waited at the entrance who do you think is come colin keith made his appearance this morning he has safely captured his ouralian bear though not without plenty of trouble and he could not get him on to avonmouth till he had been to some chemical institution about an invention colin thought him safe there and rushed down by the train to see us they go on tomorrow  what did he think of lord keith said alick in the more haste because he feared something being said to remind rachel that this was the assize week at avoncester  he has settled the matter about advice said bessie seriously you cannot think what a relief it is i mean as soon as i get home to write and ask mr harvey to come and talk to me tomorrow and see if the journey to edinburgh is practicable i almost thought of sending an apology and driving over to consult him this afternoon but i did not like to disappoint mrs huntsford and i thought rachel would feel herself lost  thank you said rachel but could we not go away early and go round by mr harveys  unluckily i have sent the ponies home and told the close carriage to come for me at nine it was all settled and i dont want to alarm lord keith by coming home too soon  alick who had hitherto listened with interest here gave his arm to rachel as if recollecting that it was time to make their entree bessie took her uncles and they were soon warmly welcomed by their kind hostess who placed them so favourably at luncheon that rachel was too much entertained to feel any recurrence of the old associations with company afterwards bessie took her into the cool drawingroom where were a few ladies who preferred the sofa to croquet or archery and lady keith accomplished a fraternization between rachel and a plainly dressed lady who knew all about the social science heroines of whom rachel had longed to hear after a time however a little girl darted in to call aunt mary to the aid of some playfellow who had met with a mishap and rachel then perceived herself to have been deserted by her sisterinlaw she knew none of the other ladies and they made no approaches to her an access of selfconsciousness came on and feeling forlorn and uncomfortable she wandered out to look for a friend  it was not long before she saw alick walking along the terrace above the croquet players evidently in quest of her how is it with you he anxiously asked you know you can go home in a moment if you have had enough of this  no i want nothing now i have found you where is your uncle  fallen upon one of his oldest friends who will take care of him and well out of the way of the croquet traps wheres my lady i thought you were with her  she disappeared while i was talking to that good miss penwell you must be pleased now alick you see she is really going to see about going to scotland  i should be better pleased if she had not left that poor old man alone till nine oclock  she says that when he has his man saunders to read to him  dont tell me what she says i have enough of that at first hand  he broke off with a start the terrace was prolonged into a walk beyond the screen of evergreens that shut in the main lawn and becoming a shrubbery path led to a smooth glade on whose turf preparations had been made for a second field of croquet in case there should have been too many players for the principal arena this however had not been wanted and no one was visible except a lady and gentleman on a seat under a tree about halfway down on the opposite side of the glade the lady was in blue and white the gentleman would hardly have been recognised by rachel but for the start and thrill of her husbands arm and the flush of colour on his usually pale cheek but ere he could speak or move the lady sprang up and came hastening towards them diagonally across the grass rachel saw the danger and made a warning outcry bessie the hoop but it was too late she had tripped over it and fell prone and entirely unable to save herself she was much nearer to them than to her late companion and was struggling to disengage herself when alick reached her lifted her up and placed her on her feet supporting her as she clung fast to him while he asked if she were hurt  no no she cried dont let him come dont let him call any one dont she reiterated as mr carleton hovered near evidently much terrified but not venturing to approach  alick helped her to another garden chair that stood near she had been entangled in her dress which had been much torn by her attempt to rise and hung in a festoon impeding her and she moved with difficulty breathing heavily when she was first seated  i dont know if i have not twisted myself a little she said in answer to their anxious questions but it will go off rachel how scared you look  dont laugh exclaimed rachel in dread of hysterics and she plunged her hand into alicks pocket for a scentbottle which he had put there by way of precaution for her and while applying it said in her full sedate voice keeping it as steady as she could shall i drive you home alick can walk home with his uncle when he is ready  home thank you rachel pray do not that i am hurt she added in her natural voice only these rags would tell tales and there would be an intolerable fuss  then i will bring the carriage round to the road there said alick i told joe to be in readiness and you need not go back to the house  thank you but oh send him away she added with a gasping shudder only dont let him tell any one tell him i desire he will not  after a few words with mr carleton alick strode off to the stables and rachel asked anxiously after the twist  i dont feel it i dont believe in it my dear your strong mind is all humbug or you would not look so frightened and again she was on the verge of hysterical laughing it is only that i cant stand a chorus of old ladies in commotion how happy alick must be to have his prediction verified by some one tumbling over a hoop just then however seeing mr carleton still lingering near she caught hold of rachel with a little cry dont let him come dear rachel go to him tell him i am well but keep him away and mind he tells no one  rachels cold repellent manner was in full force and she went towards the poor little man whose girlish face was blanched with fright  she told him that lady keith did not seem to be hurt and only wished to be alone and to go home without attracting notice he stammered out something about quite understanding and retreated while rachel returned to find bessie sitting upright anxiously watching and she was at once drawn down to sit beside her on the bench to listen to the excited whisper the miserable simpleton rachel alick was right i thought i little thought he would forget how things stand now but he got back to the old strain as ifi shall make lord keith go to scotland any way now i was so thankful to see you and alick she proceeded with the agitated vehemence of one who under a great shock was saying more than she would have betrayed in a cooler and more guarded mood what could possess him for years he had followed me about like a little dog and never said more than i let him and now what folly was in his head just because i could not walk as far as the ruin with the others when i said i was going to scotland what business had he tooh the others will be coming back rachel could we not go to meet the carriage  the attempt to move however brought back the feeling of the strain of which she had complained but she would not give way and by the help of rachels arm proceeded across the grass to the carriagedrive where alick was to meet them it seemed very far and very hot and her alternately excited and shamestricken manner and sobbing breath much alarmed rachel but when alick met them all this seemed to pass awayshe controlled herself entirely declaring herself unhurt and giving him cheerful messages and excuses for her hostess alick put the reins into rachels hands and after watching her drive off returned to the party and delivered the apologies of the ladies then went in search of his uncle he did not however find him quickly and then he was so happy with his old friend among a cluster of merry young people that alick would not say a word to hasten him home especially as rachel would have driven bessie to timber end so that it would only be returning to an empty house and such was mr clares sociableness and disability of detaching himself from pleasant conversation that the uncle and nephew scarcely started for their walk across the park in time for the seven oclock service mr clare had never been so completely belated and as alicks assistance was necessary he could only augur from his wifes absence that she was still at timber end with his sister     chapter xxvi the end of cleverness     where am i   o vanity   we are not what we deem   the sins that hold my heart in thrall   they are more real than allrev i williams   as the uncle and nephew came out of church and approached the yewtree gate rachel came swiftly to meet them oh alick oh uncle she said breathlessly bessie says she is shocked to have turned your house upside down but we could not go any further and her baby is born then in answer to exclamations halfdismayed halfwondering yes it is all right so nurse jones says i could not send to you for we had to send everywhere at once mr harvey was not at home and we telegraphed to london but no one has come yet and now i have just written a note to lord keith with the news of his son and heir and uncle she has set her heart on your baptizing him directly  there was some demur for though the child had made so sudden a rush into the world there seemed to be no ground for immediate alarm and mr clare being always at hand did not think it expedient to give the name without knowing the fathers wishes with regard to that hereditary alexander which had been borne by the dead son of the first marriage a message however came down to hasten him and whenas he had often before done in cottageshe demanded of nurse jones whether private baptism were immediately necessary she allowed that she saw no pressing danger but added that the lady was in a way about it and this both rachel and her maid strongly corroborated rachels maid was an experienced person whom mrs curtis had selected with a view to rachels weak state at the time of her marriage and she showed herself anxious for anything that might abate lady keiths excitement to which they at length yielded feeling that resistance might be dangerous to her she further insisted that the rite should be performed in her presence nor was she satisfied when rachel had brought in her uncle but insisted on likewise calling in her brother who vaguely anxious and fully conscious of the small size of the room had remained downstairs  mr clare always baptized his infant parishioners and no one was anxious about his manner of handling the little one the touch of whose garments might be familiar as being no other than his own parish baby linen he could do no otherwise than give the child the name reiterated by the mother in weak but impatient accents alexander clare her brothers own name and when the short service was concluded she called out triumphantly make alick kiss him rachel and do homage to his young chieftain  they obeyed her as she lay watching them and a very pretty sight she was with her dark hair lying round her a rosy colour on her cheeks and light in her eyes but mr clare thought both her touch and voice feverish and entreated rachel not to let her talk indeed alick longed to take rachel away but this was not at present feasible since her maid was occupied with the infant and nurse jones was so entirely a cottage practitioner that she was scarcely an available attendant elsewhere bessie herself would by no means have parted with her sisterinlaw nor was it possible to reduce her to silence alexander she said joyfully i always promised my child that he should not have a stupid second sons name i had a right to my own fathers and brothers name and now it cant be altered then catching a shade of disapproval upon rachels face not that i would have hurried it on if i had not thought it right poor little fellow but now i trust he will do nicely and i do think we have managed it all with less trouble than might have been expected  sure by this time that she was talking too much rachel was glad to hear that mr harvey was come he was a friendly elderly man who knew them all intimately having attended alick through his tedious recovery and his first measure was to clear the room rachel thought that at her age he might have accepted her services rather than her maids but she suspected alick of instigating her exclusion so eagerly did he pounce on her to make her eat drink and lie on the sofa and so supremely scornful was he of her views of sitting up a measure which might be the more needful for want of a bed  on the whole however he was satisfied about her alarm and excitement had restrung her powers and she knew herself to have done her part so that she was ready to be both cheerful and important over the evening meal mr clare was by no means annoyed at this vicissitude but rather amused at it and specially diverted at the thought of what would be mr liffords consternation lord keiths servant had come over reporting his master to be a good deal worn out by the afternoons anxiety and recommending that he should not be again disturbed that night so he was off their minds and the only drawback to the pleasantness of the evening was surprise at seeing and hearing nothing from mr harvey the london doctor arrived he met him and took him upstairs at once and then ensued a long stillness all attempts at conversation died away and alick only now and then made attempts to send his companions to bed mr clare went out to the hall to listen or rachel stole up to the extemporary nursery to consult nurse jones whom she found very gruff at having been turned out in favour of the stranger maid  it was a strange time of suspense alick made rachel lie on the sofa and she almost heard the beating of her own heart he sat by her trying to seem to read and his uncle stood by the open window where the tinkle of a sheep bell came softly in from the meadows and now and then the hoot of the owl round the church tower made the watchers start to watch that calm and earnest face was their great help in that hour of alarm those sightless eyes and broad upraised spiritual brow seemed so replete with steadfast trust and peace that the very sight was soothing and supporting to the young husband and wife and when the long strokes of twelve resounded from the church tower mr clare turning towards them began in his full musical voice to repeat bishop kens noble midnight hymn                my god now i from sleep awake               the sole possession of me take               from midnight terrors me secure               and guard my soul from thoughts impure   to rachel who had so often heard that hour strike amid a tumult of midnight miseries there was something in these words inexpressibly gentle and soothing the tears sprang into her eyes as if she had found the spell to chase the grisly phantoms and she clasped her husbands hand as though to communicate her comfort                oh may i always ready stand               with my lamp burning in my hand               may i in sight of heaven rejoice               wheneer i hear the bridegrooms voice   mr clare had just repeated this verse when he paused saying they are coming down and moved quickly to meet them in the hall alick followed him to the door but as they entered the diningroom after a moments hesitation returned to rachel as she sat upright and eager after all this may mean nothing he said  oh we dont make it better by fancying it nothing said rachel let us try to meet it like your uncle oh alick it seemed all this time as if i could pray again as i never could since those sad times he seemed so sure such a rock to help and lean on  he drew her close to him you are praying for her he murmured his soul so much absorbed in his sister that he could not admit other thoughts and still they waited and watched till other sounds were heard the london doctor was going away alick sprang to the door and opened it as his uncles hand was on the lock there was a mournful solemn expression on his face as they gazed mutely up in expectation  children he said it is as we feared this great sorrow is coming on us  then there is danger said alick with stunned calmness  more than danger said his uncle they have tried all that skill can do  was it the fall said alick  it was my bad management it always is said rachel ever affirmative  no dear child said mr clare there was fatal injury in the fall and even absolute stillness for the last few hours could hardly have saved her you have nothing to reproach yourself with  and now asked alick hoarsely  much more exhausted than when we were with her sometimes faint but still feverish they think it may last many hours yet poor dear child she has so much youth and strength  does she know  harvey thought some of their measures alarmed her but they soothed and encouraged her while they saw hope and he thinks she has no real fears  and how is it to be said alick she ought  yes harvey thinks she ought she is fully herself and it can make no difference now he is gone to judge about coming up at once but alick my poor boy you must speak to her i have found that without seeing the face i cannot judge what my words may be doing  rachel asked about poor lord keith and was told that he was to be left in quiet that night unless his wife should be very anxious for him at once mr harvey came down bringing word that his patient was asking urgently for mrs keith  you had better let me go in first said alick his face changed by the firm but tender awestruck look  not if she is asking for me said rachel moving on her heart feeling as if it would rend asunder but her looks composed  bessies face was in shade but her voice had the old ring of coaxing archness i thought you would stay to see the doctors off they had their revenge for our stealing a march on them and have prowled about me till i was quite faint and now i dont feel a bit like sleep though i am so tired would alick think me very wicked if i kept you a little while dont i see alicks shadow dear old fellow are you come to wish me goodnight that is good of you i am not going to plague you any more alick i shall be so good now but what as he held back the curtain and the light fell on his face oh there is nothing wrong with the baby  no dear bessie not with the baby said alick with strong emphasis  what myself she said quickly turning her eyes from one face to the other  alick told her the state of the case hers was a resolute character or perhaps the double nature that had perplexed and chafed her brother was so integral that nothing could put it off she fully comprehended but as if she and herself were two separate persons she asked how much time might be left to her and hearing the doctors opinion said then i think my poor old lord keith had better have his nights rest in peace but oh i should like to speak to colin send for him alick telegraph alick he is at the paddington hotel send directly  she was only tranquillised by her brother beginning to write a telegraphic message  rachel she said presently ermine must marry him now and see to lord keith and the little onetell her so please then with her unfailing courtesy he will seem like your own child dear rachel and you should have him but youll have a wandering home with the dear old highlanders oh i wonder if he will ever go into them there must always be a keith there and they say he is sure of the victoria cross though papa will not send up his name because of being his own son then passing her hand over her face she exclaimedwasnt i talking great nonsense rachel i dont seem able to say what i mean  it is weakness dearest said rachel perhaps you might gain a little strength if you were quite still and listened to my uncle  presently o rachel i like the sound of your voice i am glad alick has got you you suit him better than his wicked little sister ever did you have been so kind to me tonight rachel i never thought i should have loved you so well when i quizzed you i did use you ill then rachel but i think you won alick by it just by force of contrastshe was verging into the dreamy voice and rachel requested her to rest and be silent  it cant make any difference said bessie and ill try to be quiet and do all right if youll just let me have my child again i do want to know who he is like i am so glad it is not he that was hurt oh i did so want to have brought him up to be like alick  the infant was brought and she insisted on being lifted to see its face which she declared to resemble her brother but here her real self seemed to gain the mastery and calling it a poor little motherless thing she fell into a fit of violent convulsive weeping which ended in a fainting fit and this was a fearfully perceptible stage on her way to the dark valley  she was however conscious when she revived and sent for her uncle whom she begged to let her be laid in his churchyard near the willowtree not next to my aunt im not good enough she said but i could not bear that old ruined abbey where all the keiths go and alick always wanted me to be herealick was right  the dreamy mist was coming on nor was it ever wholly dispelled again she listened or seemed to listen to her uncles prayers but whenever he ceased she began to talkperhaps sensibly at first but soon losing the threadsometimes about her child or husband sometimes going back to those expressions of charles carleton that had been so dire a shock to her he ought not i thought he knew better alick was right come away rachel ill never see him again i have done nothing that he should insult me alick was right  then would come the sobs terrible in themselves and ending in fainting and the whole scene was especially grievous to alick even more than to either of the others for as her perception failed her association carried her back to old arguments with him and sometimes it was alick indeed you do like to attribute motives sometimes indeed it is not all selfdeception or the recurring wail alick is right only dont let him be so angry if he told her how far he was from anger she would make him kiss her or return to some playful rejoinder more piteous to hear than all or in the midst would come on the deadly swoon  morning light was streaming into the room when one of these swoons had fallen on her and no means of restoration availed to bring her back to anything but a gasping condition in which she lay supported in rachels arms the doctor had his hand on her pulse the only sounds outside were the twittering of the birds and within the ticking of the clock alicks deepdrawn breaths and his uncles prayer rachel felt a thrill pass through the form she was supporting she looked at mr harvey and understood his glance but neither moved till mr clares voice finished when the doctor said i feared she would have suffered much more thank god  he gently relieved rachel from the now lifeless weight and they knelt on for some moments in complete stillness except that alicks breath became more laboured and his shuddering and shivering could no longer be repressed rachel was excessively terrified to perceive that his whole frame was trembling like an aspen leaf he rose however bent to kiss his sisters brow and steadying himself by the furniture made for the door the others followed him and in a few rapid words rachel was assured that her fears were ungrounded it was only an attack of his old indian fever which was apt to recur on any shock but was by no means alarming though for the present it must be given way to indeed his teeth were chattering too much for him to speak intelligibly when he tried to tell rachel to rest and not think of him  this of course was impossible and the sun had scarcely risen before he was placed in his old quarters the bed in the little inner study and rachel watched over him while mr clare had driven off with the doctor to await the awakening of lord keith  rachel had never so much needed strength it was hard to believe the assurances of alick the doctor and the whole house that his condition was not critical for he was exceedingly ill for some hours the ailment having been coming on all night though it was forced back by the resolute will and it was aggravated by the intensity of his grief which on the other hand broke forth the more violently from the failure of the physical powers the brother and sister had been so long alone in the world together and with all her faults she had been so winning that it was a grievous loss to him coming too in the full bloom of her beauty and prosperity when he was conscious of having dealt severely with her foibles all was at an endthat double thread of brilliant goodnature and worldly selfishness with the one strand of sound principle sometimes coming into sight the life was gone from the earth in its incompleteness without an unravelling of its complicated texture and the wandering utterances that revealed how entirely the brother stood first with her added poignancy to his regret for having been harsh with her it could hardly be otherwise than that his censures however just should now recoil upon him and in vain did rachel try to point out that every word of his sisters had proved that her better sense had all along acquiescedhe only felt what it might have been if he had been more indulgent and less ironical and gave himself infinitely harder measure than he ever could have shown to her it was long before the suffering either mental or bodily by any means abated and rachel felt extremely lonely deserted and doubtful whether she were in any way ministering to his relief but at last a gleam of satisfaction came upon her he evidently did like her attendance on him and he began to say something about bessies real love and esteem for hersofter grief was setting in and the ailment was lessening  the summer morning was advancing and the knell rung out its two deep notes from the church tower rachel had been dreading the effect on him but he lay still as if he had been waiting for it and was evidently counting the twentythree strokes that told the age of the deceased then he said he was mending and that he should fall asleep if rachel would leave him see after the poor child and if his uncle should not come home within the next quarter of an hour take measures to silence the bell for the morning service after which he laid his injunctions on her to rest or what should he say to her mother and the approach to a smile with which these last words were spoken enabled rachel to obey in some comfort  after satisfying herself that the child was doing well rachel was obliged to go into her former room and there to stand face to face with the white still countenance so lately beaming with life she was glad to be alone the marble calm above all counteracted and drove aside the painful phantom left by lovedys agony and yet the words of that poor persecuted suffering child came surging into her mind full of peace and hope perhaps it was the first time she had entered into what it is for weak things to confound the wise or how things hidden from the intellectual can be revealed to babes and she hid her face in her hands and was thankful for the familiar words of old that we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life   the continued clang of the bell warned her she looked round at the still uncleared room poor bessies rings and bracelets lying mingled with her own on the toilet table and her little clock bessies own gift standing ticking on as it had done at her peaceful rising only yesterday morning  she took out her hat and was on her way to silence the bellringer when mr clare was driven up to the churchyard gate  lord keith had been greatly shocked but not overpowered he had spoken calmly and made minute inquiries and mr clare was evidently a little disappointed repeating that age and health made a difference and that people showed their feelings in various ways colonel keith had been met at the station and was with his brother but would come to make arrangements in the course of the day rachel begged to stop the bell representing that the assembled congregation included no male person capable of reading the lessons but mr clare answered no my dear this is not a day to do without such a beginning we must do what we can or stay it is the last chapter of st john i could hardly fail in that sit near me and give me the word if i do unless you want to be with alick  as rachel knelt that day the scales of selfconceit seemed to have gone she had her childhoods heart again her bitter remorse her afterthoughts of perplexity had been lulled in the long calm of the respite and when roused again even by this sudden sorrow she woke to her old trust and hope and when she listened to the expressive though calm rehearsal of that solemn sunrisegreeting to the weary darkling fishers on the shore of the mountain lake it was to her as if the form so long hidden from her by mists of her own raising once more shone forth smoothing the vexed waters of her soul and she could say with a new thrill of recognition it is the lord  once mr clare missed a word and paused for aid she was crying too much to be ready and through her tears could not recover the passage so as to prompt him before he had himself recalled the verse perhaps a sense of failure was always good for rachel but she was much concerned and her apologies quite distressed mr clare  dear child no one could be expected to keep the place when there was so much to dwell on in the very comfort of the chapter and now if you are not in haste would you take me to the place that dear bessie spoke of by the willowtree i am almost afraid little mary lawrences grave may have left too little space  rachel guided him to a lovely spot almost overhanging the stream with the dark calm pools beneath the high bank and the willow casting a long morning shadow over it her mind went back to the merry drive from avoncester when she had first seen elizabeth keith and had little dreamt that in one short year she should be choosing the spot for her grave mr clare paced the green nook and was satisfied asking if it were not a very pretty place  yes said rachel there is such a quiet freshness and the willowtree seems to guard it  is there not a white foxglove on the bank  yes but with only a bell or two left at the top of the side spikes  your aunt sowed the seed it is strange that i was very near choosing this place nine years ago but it could not be seen from my window which was an object with me then  just then his quick ear detected that some one was at the parsonage door and rachel turning round exclaimed with horror it is that unhappy mr carleton  poor young fellow said mr clare with more of pity than of anger i had better speak to him  but they were far from the path and it was not possible to guide the blind steps rapidly between the graves and head stones so that before the pathway was reached young carleton must have received the sad reply to his inquiries for hurrying from the door he threw himself on his horse and rode off at full speed  by the afternoon when colonel keith came to bishopsworthy alick was lying on the sofa with such a headache that he could neither see nor spell and rachel was writing letters for him both in the frame of mind in which the colonels genuine warm affection and admiration for bessie was very comforting assisting them in putting all past misgivings out of sight he had induced his brother to see mr harvey and the result had been that lord keith had consented to a consultation the next day with an eminent london surgeon since it was clear that the blow not the sciatica was answerable for the suffering which was evidently becoming severe the colonel of course intended to remain with his brother at least till after the funeral  can you exclaimed alick ought you not to be at avoncester  i am not a witness and the case is in excellent hands  could you not run down i shall be available tomorrow and i could be with lord keith  thank you alick it is impossible for me to leave him said colin so quietly that no one could have guessed how keenly he felt the being deprived of bringing her brother to ermine and being present at the crisis to which all his thoughts and endeavours had so long been directed  that assize day had long been a dream of dread to rachel and perhaps even more so to her husband yet how remote its interest actually seemed they scarcely thought of it for the chief part of the day alick looking very pale though calling himself well went early to timber end and he had not long been gone before a card was brought in with an urgent entreaty that mrs keith would see mrs carleton rachel longed to consult mr clare but he had gone out to a sick person and she was obliged to decide that alick could scarcely wish her to refuse reluctant and indignant as she felt but her wrath lessened as she saw the ladys tears and agitation so great that for a moment no words were possible and the first were broken apologies for intruding nothing should have induced her but her poor son was in such a dreadful state  rachel again became cold and stern and did not relent at the description of charlies horror and agony for she was wondering at the audacity of mentioning his grief to the wife of lady keiths brother and thinking that this weak indulgent mother was the very person to make a foolish mischievous son and it was on her tongues end that she did not see to what she was indebted for the favour of such a visit perhaps mrs carleton perceived her resentment for she broke off and urgently asked if poor dear lady keith had alluded to anything that had passed yes rachel was is forced to say and when again pressed as to the manner of alluding replied that she was exceedingly distressed and displeased with difficulty refraining from saying who had done all the mischief mrs carleton was in no need of hearing it ah she said it was right quite right it was very wrong of my poor boy indeed i am not excusing him but if you only knew how he blames himself  i am sure he ought rachel could not help saying mrs carleton here entreated her to listen and seized her hand so that there was no escape the tale was broken and confused but there could be little doubt of its correctness poor bessie had been the bane of young carletons life she had never either decidedly accepted or repelled his affection but as she had truly said let him follow her like a little dog and amused herself with him in the absence of better game he was in his fathers office but her charms disturbed his application to business and kept him trifling among the croquet lawns of littleworthy whence his mother never had the resolution to banish her spoilt child at last miss keiths refusal of him softened by a halfimplied hope sent him forth to his uncle at rio on the promise that if he did his utmost there he should in three years be enabled to offer miss keith more than a competence with this hope he had for the first time applied himself to business in earnest when he received the tidings of her marriage and like a true spoilt child broke down at once in resolution capacity and health so that his uncle was only too glad to ship him off for england and when lady keith made her temporary home in her old neighbourhood the companionship began again permitted by her in good nature and almost contempt and allowed by his family in confidence of the rectitude of both parties and indeed nothing could be more true than that no harm had been intended but it was perilous ground ladies however highly principled cannot leave off selfpleasing habits all at once and the old terms returned sufficiently to render the barrier but slightly felt when lady keith had spoken of her intention of leaving timber end the reply had been the old complaint of her brothers harshness and jealousy of his ardent and lasting affection and reproof had not at once silenced him this it was that had so startled her as to make her hurry to her brothers side unheeding of her steps  as far as rachel could make out the poor young mans grief and despair had been poured out to his mother and she unable to soothe had come to try to extract some assurance that the catastrophe had been unconnected with his folly a very slight foundation would have served her but this rachel would not give honestly believing him the cause of the accident and also that the shock to the sense of duty higher than he could understand had occasioned the excitement which had destroyed the slender possibility of recovery she pitied the unhappy man more than she had done at first and she was much pained by his mothers endeavours to obtain a palliative for him but she could not be untrue indeed she said i fear no one can say it was not so i dont think anything is made better by blinking the reality  oh mrs keith it is so dreadful i cannot tell my poor son i dont know what might be the consequence  tears came into rachels eyes indeed she said i am very sorry for you i believe every one knows that i have felt what it is to be guilty of fatal mischief but indeed indeed i am sure that to realize it all is the only way to endure it so as to be the better for it believe me i am very sorry but i dont think it would be any real comfort to your son to hear that poor bessie had never been careful or that i was inexperienced or the nurse ignorant it is better to look at it fairly i hear mr clare coming in will you see him she added suddenly much relieved  but mrs carleton did not wish to see him and departed thinking alick keiths wife as bad as had ever been reported and preparing an account of her mismanagement wherewith to remove her sons remorse  she was scarcely gone and rachel had not had time to speak to mr clare before another visitor was upon her no other than lord keiths daughter mrs comyn menteith or as she introduced herself im isabel i came down from london today because it was so very shocking and deplorable and i am dying to see my poor little brother and uncle colin i must keep away from poor papa till the doctors are gone so i came here  she was a little woman in the delicately featured style of sandy prettiness and exceedingly talkative and goodnatured the rapid tongue though low and modulated jarred painfully on rachels feelings in the shaded staircase and she was glad to shut the door of the temporary nursery when mrs menteith pounced upon the poor little baby pitying him with all her might comparing him with her own children and asking authoritative questions coupled with demonstrations of her intention of carrying him off to her own nursery establishment which had been left in scotland with a head nurse whose name came in with every fourth wordthat is if he lived at all which she seemed to think a hopeless matter  she spoke of poor dear bessie with such affection as was implied in oh she was such a darling i got on with her immensely why didnt you send to me though i dont know that donald would have let me come and she insisted on learning the whole history illustrating it profusely with personal experiences rachel was constantly hoping to be released from a subject so intensely painful but curiosity prevailed through the chatter and kept hold of the thread of the story mrs menteith decidedly thought herself defrauded of a summons it was very odd of them all not to telegraph for me those telegrams are such a dreadful shock there came one just as i set out from timber end and i made sure little sandie was ill at home for you know the child is very delicate and there are so many things going about and what with all this dreadful business i was ready to faint and after all it was only a stupid thing for uncle colin from those people at avoncester  you do not know what it was  somebody was convicted or acquitted i forget which but i know it had something to do with uncle colins journey to russia so ridiculous of him at his age when he ought to know better and so unlucky for all the family his engagement to that swindlers sister bythebye did he not cheat you out of ever so much money  oh that had nothing to do with itit was not miss williamss brotherit was not he that was tried  wasnt he i thought he was found guilty or something but it is very unfortunate for the family for uncle colin wont give her up though she is a terrible cripple too and to tell you a secret it was his obstinacy that made papa marry again and now it is of no use this poor little fellow will never live and this sharpers sister will be lady keith after all so unlucky papa says she is very handsome and poor bessie declares she is quite ladylike  the most superior person i ever knew said rachel indignantly  ah yes of course she must be very clever and artful if her brother is a swindler  but indeed he is not he was cheated the swindler was maddox  oh but he was a glassblower or something i know and her sister is a governess i am sure it is no fault of mine the parties i gave to get him and jessie douglas together donald was quite savage about the bills and after all uncle colin went and caught cold and would not come i would not have minded half so much if it had been jessie douglas but to have her at gowanbraea glassblowers daughterisnt it too bad  her father was a clergyman of a good welsh family  was he then her brother or somebody had something to do with glass  attempts at explanation were vain the good lady had an incapacity of attention and was resolved on her grievance she went away at last because those horrid doctors will be gone now and i will be able to see poor papa and tell him when i will take home the baby though i dont believe he will live to be taken anywhere poor dear little man  she handled him go much more scientifically than rachel could do that it was quite humiliating and yet to listen to her talk and think of committing any child to her charge was sickening and rachel already felt a love and pity for her little charge that made her wretched at the thoughts of the prognostic about him  you are tired with your visitors my dear said mr clare holding out his hand towards her when she returned to him  how do you know she asked  by the sound of your move across the room and the stream of talk i heard above must be enough to exhaust any one  she thinks badly of that poor child said rachel her voice trembling  my dear it would take a good deal to make me uneasy about anything i heard in that voice  and if he lives she is to have the charge of him added rachel  that is another matter on which i would suspend my fears said mr clare come out and take a turn in the peacock path you want air more than rest so you have been talked to death  and i am afraid she is gone to talk alick to death i wonder when alick will come home she proceeded as they entered on the path she says colonel keith had a telegram about the result of the trial but she does not know what it was nor indeed who was tried  alick will not keep you in doubt longer than he can help said mr clare  you know all about it said rachel the facts every one must know but i mean that which led to them  alick told me you had suffered very much  i dont know whether it is a right question but if it is i should much like to know what alick did say i begged him to tell you all or it would not have been fair towards you to bring me here  he told me that he knew you had been blind and wilful but that your confidence had been cruelly abused and you had been most unselfish throughout  i did not mean so much what i had done as what i amwhat i was  the first time he mentioned you it was as one of the reasons that he wished to take our dear bessie to avonmouth he said there was a girl there of a strong spirit independent and thoroughgoing and thinking for herself he said to be sure she generally thinks wrong but theres a candour and simplicity about her that make her wildest blunders better than parrot commonplace and he thought your reality might impress his sister even then i gathered what was coming  and how wrong and foolish you must have thought it  i hoped i might trust my boys judgment  indeed you could not think it worse for him than i did but i was ill and weak and could not help letting alick do what he would but i have never understood it i told him how unsettled my views were and he did not seem to mind  my dear may i ask if this sense of being unsettled is with you still  i dont know i had no power to read or think for a long time and now since i have been here i hope it has not been hypocrisy for going on in your way and his has been very sweet to me and made me feel as i used when i was a young girl with only an ugly dream between i dont like to look at it and yet that dream was my real life that i made for myself  dear child i have little doubt that alick knew it would come to this  rachel paused what you and he think a womans doubts so vague and shallow as to be always mastered by a husbands influence  mr clare was embarrassed if he had thought so he had not expected her to make the inference he asked her if she could venture to look back on her dream so as to mention what had chiefly distressed her he could not see her frowning effort at recollection but after a pause she said things will seem to you like trifles indeed individual criticisms appear so to me but the difficulty to my mind is that i dont see these objections fairly grappled with there is either denunciation or weak argument but i can better recollect the impression on my own mind than what made it  yes i know that feeling but are you sure you have seen all the arguments  i cannot tellperhaps not whenever i get a book with anything in it somebody says it is not sound  and you therefore conclude that a sound book can have nothing in it he asked smiling  well most of the new sound books that i have met are just what my mother and sister likeeither dull or sentimental and trashy  perhaps those that get into popular circulation do deserve some of your terms for them illogical replies break down and carry off some who have pinned their faith to them but are you sure that though you have read much you have read deep  i have read more deeply than any one i knowwomen i meanor than any man ever showed me he had read indeed i am trying not to say it in conceit but ermine williams does not read argumentative books and gentlemen almost always make as if they knew nothing about them  i think you may be of great use to me my dear if you will help me the bishop has desired me to preach the next visitation sermon and he wishes it to be on some of these subjects now if you will help me with the book work it will be very kind in you and might serve to clear your mind about some of the details though you must be prepared for some questions being unanswered  best so replied rachel i dont like small answers to great questions  nor i only let us take care not to get absorbed in admiring the boldness that picks out stones to be stumbled over  do you object to my having read and thought and tried  certainly not those who have the capability should if they feel disturbed work out the argument nothing is gained while it is felt that both sides have not been heard i do not myself believe that a humble patient earnest spirit can go far wrong though it may for a time be tried and people often cry out at the first stumbling block and then feel committed to the exclamations they have made  the conversation was here ended by the sight of alick coming slowly and wearily in from the churchyard looking as if some fresh weight were upon him and he soon told them that the doctors had pronounced that lord keith was in a critical state and would probably have much to suffer from the formation that had begun where he had received the neglected bruise in the side no word of censure of poor bessie had been breathed nor did alick mention her name but he deeply suffered under the fulfilment of his own predictions and his subdued dejected manner expressed far more than did his words rachel asked how lord keith seemed  oh theres no getting at his feelings he was very civil to measked after you racheltold me to give you his thanks but not a single word about anything nearer then i had to read the paper to himall that dinner at liverpool and he made remarks and expected me to know what it was about i suppose he does feel the colonel says he is exceedingly cut up and he looks like a man of eighty infinitely worse than last time i saw him but i dont know what to make of him  and alick did you hear the verdict  what verdict  that man at avoncester mrs menteith said there had been a telegram  alick looked startled this has put everything out of my head he said what was the verdict  that was just what she could not tell she did not quite know who was tried  and she came here and harassed you with it he said looking at her anxiously as if you had not gone through enouqh already  never mind that now it seems so long ago now that i can hardly think much about it and i have had another visitor she added as mr clare left them to themselves mrs carletonthat poor son of hers is in such distress  she has been palavering you over he said in a tone more like displeasure than he had ever used towards her  indeed alick if you would listen you would find him very much to be pitied  i only wish never to hear of any of them again he did not speak like himself and rachel was aghast  i thought you would not object to my letting her in she began  i never said i did he answered i can never think of him but as having caused her death and it was no thanks to him that there was nothing worse  the sternness of his manner would have silenced rachel but for her strong sense of truth and justice which made her persevere in saying there may have been more excuse than you believe  do you suppose that is any satisfaction to me he walked decidedly away and entered by the library window and she stood grieved and wondering whether she had been wrong in pitying or whether he were too harsh in his indignation it was a sign that her tone and spirit had recovered that she did not succumb in judgment though she felt utterly puzzled and miserable till she recollected how unwell weary and unhappy he was and that every fresh perception of his sisters errors was like a poisoned arrow to him and then she felt shocked at having obtruded the subject on him at all and when she found him leaning back in his chair spent and worn out she waited on him in the quietest gentlest way she could accomplish and tried to show that she had put the subject entirely aside however when they were next alone together he turned his face away and muttered what did that woman say to you  oh alick i am sorry i began it only gives you pain  go on  she did go on till she had told all and he uttered no word of comment she longed to ask whether he disapproved of her having permitted the interview but as he did not again recur to the topic it was making a real and legitimate use of strength of mind to abstain from tearing him on the matter yet when she recollected what worldly honour would once have exacted of a military man and the conflicts between religion and public opinion she felt thankful indeed that half a century lay between her and that terrible code and even as it was perceiving the strong hold that just resentment had taken on her husbands silently determined nature she could not think of the neighbourhood of the carleton family without dread     chapter xxvii the post bag    thefts like ivy on a ruin make the rifts they seem to shade                                                   c g duffy                                                    august 3d 7 a m  my dear colonel keithpapa is come and i have got up so early in the morning that i have nothing to do but to write to you before we go in to avoncester papa and mr beechum came by the six oclock train and lady temple sent me in the waggonette to meet them aunt ailie would not go because she was afraid aunt ermine would get anxious whilst she was waiting i saw papa directly and yet i did not think it could be papa because you were not there and he looked quite past me and i do not think he would have found me or the carriage at all if mr beechum had not known me and then i am afraid i was very naughty but i could not help crying just a little when i found you had not come but perhaps lady keith may be better and you may come before i go into court today and then i shall tear up this letter i am afraid papa thought i was unkind to cry when he was just come home for he did not talk to me near so much as mr beechum did and his eyes kept looking out as if he did not see anything near only quite far away and i suppose russian coats must be made of some sort of sheep that eats tobacco                                                    august 3d 10 a m  dearest colini have just lighted on poor little rosies beforebreakfast composition and i cant refrain from sending you her first impressions poor child though no doubt they will alter as she sees more of her father all are gone to avoncester now though with some doubts whether this be indeed the critical day i hope it may be the sooner this is over the better but i am full of hope i cannot believe but that the providence that has done so much to discover edwards innocence to the world will finish the work i have little expectation though of your coming down in time to see it the copy of the telegraphic message which you sent by harry looks as bad as possible and even allowing something for inexperience and fright things must be in a state in which you could hardly leave your brother so unwell as he seems  2 pm i was interrupted by lady temple who was soon followed by mrs curtis burning to know whether i had any more intelligence than had floated to them pray if you can say anything to exonerate poor rachel from mismanagement say it strongly her best friends are so engaged in wishing themselves there and pitying poor bessie for being in her charge that i long to confute them for i fully believe in her sense and spirit in any real emergency that she had not ridden out to encounter  and i have written so far without a word on the great subject of all the joy untold for which our hearts had ached so long and which we owe entirely to you for edward owns that nothing but your personal representations would have brought him and as i suppose you already knowhe so much hated the whole subject of maddoxs treachery that he had flung aside unread all that he saw related to it dear colin whatever else you have done you have filled a famished heart could you but have seen ailies face all last evening as she sat by his side you would have felt your rewardit was as if the worn anxious almost stern mask had been taken away and our ailies face was beaming out as of old when she was the family pet before julia took her away to be finished she sees no change she is in an ecstasy of glamour that makes her constantly repeat her rejoicings that edward is so much himself so unchanged till i almost feel unsisterly for seeing in him the traces that these sad years have left and that poor little rose herself has detected no he is not so much changed as exaggerated the living to himself and with so cruel a past has greatly increased the old dreaminess that we always tried to combat and he seems less able than before to turn his mind into any channel but the one immediately before him he is most loving when roused but infinitely more inclined to fall off into a muse i am afraid you must have had a troublesome charge in him judging by the uproar harry makes about the difficulty of getting him safe from paddington it is good to see him and harry togetherthe old schoolboy ways are so renewed all bitterness so entirely forgotten only harry rages a little that he is not more wrapped up in rose to say the truth so do i but if it were not for harrys feeling the same i should believe that you had taught me to be exacting about my rosebud partly it is that he is disappointed that she is not like her mother he had made up his mind to another lucy and her williams face took him by surprise and partly he is not a man to adapt himself to a child she must be trained to help unobtrusively in his occupations the unknowing little plaything her mother was she never can be i am afraid he will never adapt himself to english life againhis soul seems to be in his mines and if as you say he is happy and valued therethough it is folly to look forward to the wrench again instead of rejoicing in the present gladness but often as i had fashioned that arrival in my fancy it was never that harrys voice not yours should say the here he is  they all went this morning in the waggonette and the two boys with miss curtis in the carriage lady temple is very kind in coming in and out to enliven me i am afraid i must close and send this before their return what a day it is and how are you passing it i fear even at the best in much anxiety lady temple asks to put in a lineyours ever                                                  e w                                                    august 3d 5 p m  my dear colonelthis is just to tell you that dear ermine is very well and bearing the excitement and suspense wonderfully we were all dreadfully shocked to hear about poor dear bessie it is so sad her having no mother nor any one but rachel to take care of her though rachel would do her best i know if she would like to have me or if you think i could do any good pray telegraph for me the instant you get this letter i would have come this morning only i thought perhaps she had her aunt that stupid telegram never said whether her baby was alive or what it was i do hope it is all right i should like to send nurse up at oncei always thought she saved little cyril when he was so ill pray send for nurse or me or anything i can send anyway i know nobody can be such a comfort as you but the only thing there is to wish about you is that you could be in two places at once  the two boys are gone in to the trial they were very eager about it and dear grace promises to take care of conrades throat poor boys they had got up a triumphal arch for your return but i am afraid i am telling secrets dear ermine is so good and resolutely composedquite an exampleyours affectionately                                                   f g temple                                                    avoncester                                                   august 3d 2 p m  my dear colonel keithi am just come out of court and i am to wait at the inn for aunt ailie does not like for me to hear the trial but she says i may write to you to pass away the time i am sorry i left my letter out to go this morning for aunt ailie says it is very undutiful to say anything about the sheeps wool in russia smelling of tobacco conrade says it is all smoking and that every one does it who has seen the world papa never stops smoking but when he is with aunt ermine he sat on the box and did it all the way to avoncester and mr beechum said it was to compose his mind after we got to avoncester we had a long long time to wait and first one was called and then another and then they wanted me i was not nearly so frightened as i was that time when you sent for me though there were so many more people but it was daylight and the judge looked so kind and the lawyer spoke so gently to me and mr maddox did not look horrid like that first time i think he must be sorry now he has seen how much he has hurt papa the lawyer asked me all about the noises and the lions and the letters of light just as mr grey did and they showed me papas old seal ring and asked if i knew it and a seal that was made with the new one that he got when the other was lost and i knew them because i used to make impressions on my arms with them when i was a little girl there was another lawyer that asked how old i was and why i had not told before and i thought he was going to laugh at me for a silly little girl but the judge would not let him and said i was a clearheaded little maiden and mr beechum came with aunt ailie and took me out of court and told me to choose anything in the whole world he should give me so i chose the little writing case i am writing with now and the heroes besides so i shall be able to read till the others come back and we go homeyour affectionate little friend                                                rose ermine williams                                                 the homestead

so sadly engaged indeed i should hardly have gone to avoncester had the sad intelligence reached me before i had set out when i thought my sudden return would be a greater alarm to my mother and i knew that dear fanny would do all she could for her still she has had a very nervous day thinking constantly of your dear sister and of rachels alarm and inexperience but her unlimited confidence in your care of rachel is some comfort and i am hoping that the alarm may have subsided and you may be all rejoicing i have always thought that with dear rachel some new event or sensation would most efface the terrible memories of last spring my mother is now taking her evening nap and i am using the time for telling you of the days doings i took with me fannys two eldest who were very good and manageable and we met mr grey who put us in very good places and told us the case was just coming on you will see the report in detail in the paper so i will only try to give you what you would not find there i should tell you that maddox has entirely dropped his alias mr grey is convinced that was only a bold stroke to gain time and prevent the committal so as to be able to escape and that he reckoned upon bullying a dense old country magistrate but that he knew it was quite untenable before a body of unexceptionable witnesses altogether the man looked greatly altered and crestfallen and there was a meanness and vulgarity in his appearance that made me wonder at our ever having credited his account of himself he had an abject look very unlike his confident manner at the sessions nor did he attempt his own defence mr grey kept on saying he must know that he had not a leg to stand upon  the counsel for the prosecution told the whole story and it was very touching i had never known the whole before the sisters are so resolute and uncomplaining but how they must have suffered when every one thought them ruined by their brothers fraud i grieve to think how we neglected them and only noticed them when it suited our convenience then he called mr beechum and you will understand better than i can all about the concern in which they were embarked and maddox coming to him for an advance of £300 giving him a note from mr williams asking for it to carry out an invention the order for the sum was put into maddoxs hands and the banker proved the paying it to him by an order on a german bank  then came mr williams i had seen him for a moment in setting out and was struck with his strange lost dreamy look there is something very haggard and mournful in his countenance and though he has naturally the same fine features as his eldest sister his cheeks are hollow his eyes almost glassy and his beard which is longer than the colonels very grey he gave me the notion of the wreck of a man stunned and crushed and never thoroughly alive again but when he stood in the witnessbox face to face with the traitor he was very different he lifted up his head his eyes brightened his voice became clear and his language terse and concentrated so that i could believe in his having been the very able man he was described to be i am sure maddox must have quailed under his glance there was something so loftily innocent in it yet so wistful as much as to say how could you abuse my perfect confidence mr williams denied having received the money written the letter or even thought of making the request they showed him the impression of two seals he said one was made with a sealring given him by colonel keith and lost some time before he went abroad the other with one with which he had replaced it and which he producedhe had always worn it on his finger they matched exactly with the impressions and there was a little difference in the hair of the head upon the seal that was evident to every one it amused the boys extremely to see some of the old jurymen peering at them with their glasses he was asked where he was on the 7th of september the date of the letter and he referred to some notes of his own which enabled him to state that on the 6th he had come back to prague from a village with a horrible bohemian nameall cs and zswhich i will not attempt to write though much depended on the number of the said letters  the rest of the examination must have been very distressing for maddoxs counsel pushed him hard about his reasons for not returning to defend himself and he was obliged to tell how ill his wife was and how terrified and they endeavoured to make that into an admission that he thought himself liable they tried him with bits of the handwriting and he could not always tell which were his ownbut i think every one must have been struck with his honourable scrupulosity in explaining every doubt he had  other people were called in about the writing but alison williams was the clearest of all she was never puzzled by any scrap they showed her and moreover she told of maddox having sent for her brothers address and her having copied it from a letter of mrs williamss which she produced with the wrong spelling just as it was in the forgery the next day had come a letter from the brother which she showed saying that they were going to leave the place sooner than they had intended and spelling it right she gave the same account of the seals and nothing ever seemed to disconcert her my boys were so much excited about their own miss williams that i was quite afraid they would explode into a cheer  that poor woman whom we used to call mrs rawlins told her sad story next she is much worn and subdued and mr grey was struck with the change from the fierce excitement she showed when she was first confronted with maddox after her own trial but she held fast to the same evidence giving it not resentfully but sadly and firmly as if she felt it to be her duty she as you know explained how maddox had obtained access to mr williamss private papers and how she had afterwards found in his possession the seal ring and the scraps of paper in his patrons writing a policeman produced them and the seal perfectly filled the wax upon the forged letter the bits of paper showed that maddox had been practising imitating mr williamss writing it all seemed most distinct but still there was some sharp crossexamination of her on her own part in the matter and mr grey said it was well that little rose could so exactly confirm the facts she mentioned  poor dear little rose looked very sweet and innocent and not so much frightened as at her first examination she told her story of the savage way in which she had been frightened into silence half the people in the court were crying and i am sure it was a mercy that she was not driven out of her senses or even murdered that night it seems that she was sent to bed early but the wretches knowing that she always woke and talked while her mother was going to bed the phosphoric letters were prepared to frighten her and detain her in her room and then maddox growled at her when she tried to pass the door she was asked how she knew the growl to be maddoxs and she answered that she heard him cough rachel will i am sure remember the sound of that little dry cough nothing could make it clearer than that the woman had spoken the truth the child identified the two seals with great readiness and then was sent back to the inn that she might not be perplexed with hearing the defence this of course was very trying to us all since the best the counsel could do for his client was to try to pick holes in the evidence and make the most of the general acquiescence in mr williamss guilt for all these years he brought forward letters that showed that mr williams had been very sanguine about the project and had written about the possibility that an advance might be needed some of the letters which both mr williams and his sister owned to be in his own writing spoke in most flourishing terms of his plans and it was proved by documents and witnesses that the affairs were in such a state that bankruptcy was inevitable so that there was every motive for securing a sum to live upon it was very miserable all the time this was going on the whole interpretation of mr williamss conduct seemed to be so cruelly twisted aside and it was what every one had all along believed his absence was made so much of and all these little circumstances that had seemed so important were held so cheapone knew it was only the counsels representation and yet alison grew whiter and whiter under it i wish you could have heard the reply drawing the picture of the students absorption and generous confidence and his agents treachery creeping into his household and brutally playing on the terrors of his child  well i cannot tell you all but the judge summed up strongly for a conviction though he said a good deal about culpable negligence almost inviting fraud and i fear it must have been very distressing to the williamses but the end was that maddox was found guilty and sentenced to fourteen years penal servitude though i am afraid they will not follow conrades suggestion and chain up a lion by his bed every night of his life  we were very happy when we met at the inn and all shook hands dr long was i think the least at ease he had come in case this indictment had in any way failed to bring his own matter forward so that maddox should not get off i do not like him very much he seemed unable to be really hearty and i think he must have once been harsh and now ashamed of it then he was displeased at colonel keiths absence and could hardly conceal how much he was put out by the cause as if he thought the colonel had imposed himself on the family as next heir i hardly know how to send all this in the present state of things but i believe you will wish to have it and will judge how much rachel will bear to hear good nightyour affectionate sister                                                   grace curtis

a few lines from the man whom your exertions have relieved from a stigma the full misery of which i only know by the comfort of its removal i told you there was much that could never be restored i feel this all the more in the presence of all that now remains to me but i did not know how much could still be given back the oppression of the load of suspicion under which i laboured now seems to me to have been intolerable since i have been freed from it i cannot describe how changed a man i have felt since beechum shook hands with me the full blackness of maddoxs treachery i had not known far less his cruelty to my child had i been aware of all i could not have refrained from trying to bring him to justice but there is no need to enter into the past it is enough that i owe to you a freed spirit and new life and that my gratitude is not lessened by the knowledge that something besides friendship urged you ermine is indeed as attractive as ever and has improved in health far more than i durst expect i suppose it is your allpowerful influence you are first with all here as you well deserve even my child who is as lovely and intelligent as you told me has every thought pervaded with the colonel she is a sweet creature but there was one who will never be retraced and forgive me keith without her even triumph must be bitternessstill ever most gratefully yours

thanks it is as if we had passed from a dungeon into sunshine i suppose it would be too much if you were here to share it they sent rose in first to tell me but i knew in the sound of their wheels that all was well what an evening we have had but i must not write more ailie is watching me like a dragon and will not rest till i am in bed but i cant tell how to lose one minute of gladness in sleep oh colin colin truest of all true knights what an achievement yours has been                                                    august 4th  that was a crazy bit that i wrote last night but i will not make away with it i dont care how crazy you think me it would have been a pity not to have slept to wake to the knowledge that all was not a dream but then came the contrast with the sorrow you are watching and i have just had your letter what a sudden close to that joyous life she was one of the most winning beings as you truly say that ever flashed across ones course and if she had faults they were those of her day and her training i suppose by what you say that she was too girlish to be all the companion your brother required and that this may account for his being more shocked than sorrowstricken and his child since he can dwell on the thought is such a new beginning of hope that i wonder less than you do at his bearing up so well besides pain dulls the feelings and is a great occupation i wish you could have seen that dear bessie but i gather that the end came on much more rapidly than had been expected it seemed as if she were one of those to whom even suffering was strangely lightened and shortened as if she had met only the flowers of life and even the thorns and stings were almost lost in their bright blossoms and she could hardly have lived on without much either of temptation or sorrow i am glad of your testimony to rachels effectiveness i wrote it out and sent it up to the homestead there was a note this morning requesting edward to come in to see maddox and ailie is gone with him thinking she may get leave to see poor maria think of writing edward and ailie again dr long and harry are gone with them the broken thread is better pieced by harry than by the doctor but he wants ailie and me to go and stay at belfast now i must hear rose read in order to bring both her and myself to our reasonable senses                                                    5 p m  they have been returned about an hour and i must try to give you edwards account of his interview maddox has quite dropped his mask and seems to have been really touched by being brought into contact with edward again and now it is all up with him seemed to take a kind of pleasure in explaining the whole web almost edward said with vanity at his own ingenuity his earlier history was as he used to represent it to edward he was a respectable ironmongers son with a taste for art he was not allowed to indulge it and then came rebellion and breaking away from home he studied at the academy for a few years but wanted application and fancied he had begun too late tried many things and spent a shifty life but never was consciously dishonest till after he had fallen in with edward and the large sums left uninquired for in his hands became a temptation to one already inclined to gambling his own difficulties drove him on and before he ventured on the grand stroke he had been in a course of using the sums in his hands for his own purposes the finding poor maria open to the admiration he gave her beauty put it into his head to make a tool of her and this was not the first time he had used edwards seal or imitated his writing no wonder there was such a confusion in the accounts as told so much against edward he told the particulars edward says with the strangest mixture of remorse and exultation at last came the journey to bohemia and his frauds became the more easy until he saw there must be a bankruptcy and made the last bold stroke investing the money abroad in his own name so that he would have been ready to escape if edward had come home again he never expected but that edward would have returned and finding the affairs hopeless did this deed in order to have a resource as to regret he seemed to feel some when he said the effects had gone farther than he anticipated but i could not let him get into that subject edward said and he soon came back to his amused complacency in his complete hoodwinking of all concerned at home almost thanking edward for the facilities his absence had given him after this he went abroad taking maria lest she should betray him on being cast off and they lived in such style at german gambling places that destitution brought them back again to england where he could better play the lecturer and the artist in search of subscriptions edward could not help smiling over some of his good stories rather as the lord may have commended the wisdom of his unjust steward well here he came and as he said he really could hardly have helped himself he had only to stand still and let poor rachel deceive herself and the whole concern was in a manner thrust upon him he was always expecting to be able to get the main sum into his hands as he obtained more confidence from rachel and the woodcuts were an overbold stroke for the purpose he had not intended her to keep or show them but her ready credulity tempted him too far and i cannot help laughing now at poor edwards reproofs to us for having been all so easily cheated now that he has been admitted behind the scenes maddox never suspected our neighbourhood he had imagined us to be still in london and though he heard alisons name he did not connect it with us after all what you thought would have been fatal to your hopes of tracing him was really what gave him into our handslady temples sudden descent upon their f u e e if he had not been so hurried and distressed as to be forced to leave maria and the poor child to her fate maria would have held by him to the last and without her testimony where should we have been but with a summons out against him and hearing that maria had been recognised he could only fly to the place at bristol that he thought unknown to maria even when seized by the police he did not know it was she who directed them and had not expected her evidence till he actually saw and heard her on the night of the sessions it was all colonel keiths doing he said every other adversary he would have despised but your array of forces met him at every corner where he hoped to escape and the dear little rosie gave him checkmate like a gallant little knights pawn as she is who could have guessed that child would have such a confounded memory he said for edward had listened with a sort of interest that had made him quite forget that he was roses father and that this wicked cunning colonel was working in his cause so off he goes to penal servitude and edward is so much impressed and touched with his sharpness as to predict that he will be the model prisoner before long if he do not make his escape as to poor maria that was a much more sad meeting though perhaps less really melancholy for there can be no doubt that she repents entirely she speaks of every one as being very good to her and indeed the old influences only needed revival they had never quite died out even that poor childs name was given for love of ailie and the perception of having been used to bring about her masters ruin had always preyed upon her and further embittered her temper the barbarity seemed like a dream in connexion with her but as she told ailie when she once began something came over her and she could not help striking harder it reminded me of horrible stories of the hathertons usage of animals enough of this i believe the sisterhood will find a safe shelter for her when her imprisonment is over and that temptation will not again be put in her way we should never have trusted her in poor dear lucys household rose calls for the letters good bye dearest colin and conqueror i know all this will cheer you for it is your own doing i cant stop saying so it is such a pleasant soundyour own

keiths considerate arrangement the attendants met at timber end so that the stillness of the parsonage was not invaded a measure the more expedient as alick was suffering from a return of his old enemy intermitting fever and only was able to leave his room in time to join the procession  many were present for poor bessie had been a general favourite and her untimely fate had stirred up feelings that had created her into a saint upon earth but there was no one whose token of respect she would have more esteemed than colonel hammonds who in all the bustle of the remove to edinburgh had found time to come to bishopsworthy to do honour to the daughter of his old commanding officer a flush of gratitude came over alicks pale face when he became aware of his colonels presence and when the choristers hymn had pealed low and sweetly over the tranquil meadows and the mourners had turned away alick paused at the parsonage gate to hold out his hand and bring in this one guest to hear how near to bessies heart the fathers highland regiment had been in all the wanderings of her last moments  the visit was prolonged for nearly an hour while recollections of alicks parents were talked over and rachel thought him more cheered and gratified than by any other tribute that had been paid to his sister he was promised an extension of leave if it were required on account of lord keiths state though under protest that he would have the aguish fever as long as he remained overlooking the water meadows and did not put himself under dr mvicar through these meadows colonel hammond meant to walk back to the station and alick and rachel conducted him far enough to put him into the right path and in going back again they could not but go towards the stile leading to that corner of the churchyard where the sexton had finished his work and smoothed the sods over that new grave  some one was standing at the footnot the sextonbut a young man bending as with an intolerable load of grief rachel saw him first when alick was helping her down the step and her start of dismay made him turn and look round his brow contracted and she clutched his arm with an involuntary cry of oh dont but he with a gesture that at once awed and tranquillized her unclasped her hold and put her back while he stepped forward  she could hear every word though his voice was low and deep with emotion carleton if i have ever been harsh or unjust in my dealings towards you i am sorry for it we have both had the saddest of all lessons may we both take it as we ought  he wrung the surprised and unwilling hand and before the youth startled and overcome had recovered enough to attempt a reply he had come back to rachel resumed her arm and crossed the churchyard still shivering and trembling with the agitation and the force he had put on himself rachel neither could nor durst speak she only squeezed his hand and when he had shut himself up in his own room she could not help repairing to his uncle and telling him the whole mr clares god bless you my boy had double meaning in it that night  not long after alick told rachel of his having met poor young carleton in the meadows pretending to occupy himself with his fishingrod but too wretched to do anything and in a short time mrs carleton again called to pour out to mrs keith her warm thanks to the captain for having roused her son from his moody unmanageable despair and made him consent to accept a situation in a new field of labour in a spirit of manful duty that he had never evinced before  this was a grave and subdued but not wholly mournful period at bishopsworthya time very precious to rachel in the retrospectthough there was much to render it anxious alick continued to suffer from recurrences of the fever not very severe in themselves after the first two or three but laying him prostrate with shivering and headache every third day and telling heavily on his strength and looks when he called himself well on these good days he was always at timber end where his services were much needed lord keith liked and esteemed him as a sensible prudent young man and his qualities as a firstrate nurse were of great assistance to the colonel lord keiths illness was tedious and painful the necessity of a dangerous operation became increasingly manifest but the progress towards such a crisis was slow and the pain and discomfort great the patient never moved beyond his dressingroom and needed incessant attention to support his spirits and assist his endeavours to occupy himself it was impossible to leave him for long together and colonel keith was never set at liberty for exercise or rest except when alick came to his assistance and fortunately this young brotherinlaw was an especial favourite partly from lord keiths esteem for his prudence partly from his experience in this especial species of suffering at any rate the days of alicks enforced absence were always times of greater restlessness and uneasiness at timber end  meantime rachel was constantly thrown with mr clare supplying alicks place to him and living in a round of duties that suited her well details of parish work walking with writing for and reading to mr clare and reaping much benefit from intercourse with such a mind many of her errors had chiefly arisen from the want of some one whose superiority she could feel and her old presumptions withered up to nothing when she measured her own powers with those of a highly educated man while all the time he gave her thanks and credit for all she had effected but such as taught her humility by very force of infection  working in earnest at his visitation sermon she was drawn up into the real principles and bearings of the controversy and mr clare failed not to give full time and patience to pick out all her difficulties removing scruples at troubling him by declaring that it was good for his own purpose to unwind every tangle even if he did not use every thread it was wonderful how many puzzles were absolutely intangible not even tangled threads but a sort of nebulous matter that dispersed itself on investigation and after all unwilling as she would have been to own it a womans tone of thought is commonly moulded by the masculine intellect which under one form or another becomes the master of her soul those opinions once made her own may be acted and improved upon often carried to lengths never thought of by their inspirer or held with noble constancy and perseverance even when he himself may have fallen from them but from some living medium they are almost always adopted and thus happily for herself a womans efforts at scepticism are but blind faith in her chosen leader or at the utmost in the spirit of the age and rachel having been more than usually removed from the immediate influence of superior man had been affected by the more feeble and distant power a leading that appeared to her the light of her independent mind but it was not in the nature of things that from her husband and his uncle her character should not receive that tincture for which it had so long waited strong and thorough in proportion to her nature not rapid in receiving impressions but steadfast and uncompromising in retaining and working on them when once accepted a nature that alick keith had discerned and valued amid its worst errors far more than mere attractiveness of which his sister had perhaps made him weary and distrustful nor indeed under the force of the present influences was attractiveness wanting and she suited alicks peculiarities far better than many a more charming person would have done and his uncle knowing her only by her clear mellow voice her consideration helpfulness and desire to think and do rightly never understood the doubtful amazement now and then expressed in talking of alicks choice one great bond between rachel and mr clare was affection for the little babe who continued to be rachels special charge and was a great deal dearer to her already than all the seven temples put together she studied all the books on infant management that she could obtain constantly listened for his voice and filled her letters to her mother with questions and details on his health and descriptions of his small person alick was amused whenever he glanced at his strongminded womans correspondence and now and then used to divert himself with rousing her into emphatic declarations of her preference of this delicate little being to great stout coarse creatures that people call fine children in fact alicks sensitive tenderness towards his sisters motherless child took the form of avoiding the sight of it and being ironical when it was discussed but with mr clare rachel was sure of sympathy ever since the afternoon when he had said how the sounds upstairs reminded him of his own little daughter and sitting under the yewtree he had told rachel all the long storedup memories of the little life that had been closed a few days after he had first heard himself called papa by the baby lips he had described all these events calmly and not without smiles and had said how his own blindness had made him feel thankful that he had safely laid his little una on her mothers bosom under the churchs shade but when rachel spoke of this conversation to her husband she learnt that it was the first time that he had ever talked of those buried hopes he had often spoken of his wife but though always fond of children few who had not read little unas name beneath her mothers cross knew that he was a childless father and yet it was beautiful to see the pleasure he took in the touch of bessies infant and how skilfully and tenderly he would hold it so that rachel in full faith averred that the little alexander was never so happy as with him the chief alarms came from mrs comyn menteith who used to descend on the rectory like a whirlwind when the colonel had politely expelled her from her fathers room at timber end possessed with the idea of rachels being very dull at bishopsworthy she sedulously enlivened her with melancholy prognostics as to the life limbs and senses of the young heir who would never live poor little darling even with the utmost care of herself and her nurse and it was very perverse of papa and the doctors still to keep him from herpoor little darlingnot that it mattered for he was certain not to thrive wherever he was and the gowanbrae family would end with uncle colin and the glassblowers daughter a disaster on which she met with such condolence from alick n b the next heir that rachel was once reduced to the depths of genuine despair by the conviction that his opinion of his nephews life was equally desponding and another time was very angry with him for not defending ermines gentility she had not entirely learnt what alicks assent might mean  once when mrs menteith had been besetting her father with entreaties for the keys of lady keiths private possessions she was decisively silenced and the next day these same keys were given to alick with a request that his wife would as soon as possible look over and take to herself all that had belonged to his sister except a few heirloom jewels that must return to scotland alick demurred greatly but the old man would not brook contradiction and rachel was very unwillingly despatched upon the mission on one of alicks days of prostration at home his absence was the most consoling part of this sad days work any way it could not be otherwise than piteous to dismantle what had been lately so bright and luxurious and the contrast of the present state of things with that in which these dainty new wedding presents had been brought together could not but give many a pang but beside this there was a more than ordinary impression of vanity of vanities all is vanity very painful to affection that was striving to lose the conviction that it had been a selfindulgent plausible life the accumulation of expensive trinkets and small luxuries was as surprising as perplexing to a person of rachels severely simple and practical tastes it was not only since the marriage for bessie had always had at her disposal means rather ample and had used them not exactly foolishly but evidently for her own gratification everything had some intrinsic worth and was tasteful or useful but the multitude was perfectly amazing and the constant echo in rachels ears was he heapeth up riches and cannot tell who shall gather them lord keith could hardly have found an executrix for his poor young wife to whom her properties would have done so little harm rachel set many aside for the cousins and for mrs menteith others she tried to persuade the colonel to call gowanbrae belongings and failing in this she hoped through grace to smuggle some of them into his gowanbrae but when all was done there was a mass of things that lord keith never wished to see again and that seemed to rachel to consist of more ornaments than she could ever wear and more knickknacks than a captains wife could ever carry about with her  she was putting aside the various packets of letters and papers to be looked over more at leisure when the colonel knocked at the morningroom door and told her that his brother would like to see her when her work was done but first he said i must ask you to be kind enough to look over some of these papers and try to find receipts for some of those bills  here they are said rachel i was going to look them over at home  if you have time to examine them here with me said colonel keith gently i think it might save alick some pain and vexation  rachel was entirely unaware of his meaning and supposed he only thought of the mere thrilling of the recent wound but when he sat down and took a long account out of a tradesmans envelope a chill of dismay came over her followed by a glow of hope as she recollected a possible explanation have these wretched tradesmen been sending in bills over again at such a time as this she exclaimed  i should be very glad to find their receipts returned the colonel  they opened the most businesslike looking bundles all of them though neatly kept really in hopeless confusion in vain was the search and notes came forth which rendered it but too plain that there had been a considerable amount of debt even before the marriage and that she had made partial payments and promises of clearing all off gradually but that her new expenses were still growing upon her and the few payments on account since she had been lady keith by no means tallied with the amount of new purchases and orders no one had suspected her money matters of being in disorder and rachel was very slow to comprehend her simple country life had made her utterly unaware of the difficulties and ways and means of a young lady of fashion even the direct evidence before her eyes would not at first persuade her that it was not all those wicked tradesmen she had always heard that fashionable shops were not to be trusted  i am afraid said colonel keith that the whole can scarcely be shifted on the tradesmen i fear poor bessie was scarcely free from blame in this matter  not paying going on in debt oh she could not have meant it said rachel still too much astonished to understand of course one hears of gay thoughtless people doing such things but bessiewho had so much thought and sense it must be a mistake cant you go and speak to the people  it is very sad and painful to make such discoveries said colonel keith but i am afraid such things are not uncommon in the set she was too much thrown amongst  but she knew so wellshe was so superior and with alick and her uncle to keep her above them said rachel i cannot think she could have done such things  i could not think but i see it was so said colonel keith gravely as i am obliged to understand these things she must have greatly exceeded her means and have used much cleverness and ingenuity in keeping the tradesmen quiet and preventing all from coming to light  how miserable i cant fancy living in such a predicament  i am much afraid added the colonel looking over the papers that it explains the marriageand then keith did not allow her as much as she expected  oh colonel keith dont cried rachel it is just the one thing where i could not bear to believe alick she was so dear and beautiful and spoke so rightly  to believe alick repeated the colonel as rachels voice broke down  i thoughti ought not to have thoughthe was hard upon herbut he knew better said rachel of course he did not know of all this dreadful business  assuredly not said the colonel that is selfevident but as you say i am afraid he did know his poor sisters character better than we did when he came to warn me against the marriage  did he oh how much it must have cost him  i am afraid i did not make it cost him less i thought he judged her harshly and that his illness had made him magnify trifles but though our interference would have been perfectly useless he was quite right in his warning now that poor thing she is no longer here to enchant us with her witcheries i see that my brother greatly suffered from being kept away from home and detained in this place and that she left him far more alone than she ought to have done  yes alick thought so but she had such good reasons i am sure she believed them herself  if she had not believed them she could not have had such perfect sincerity of manner said the colonel she must have persuaded at least one half of herself that she was acting for every ones good except her own  and mr clare whom alick always thought she neglected never felt it alick says he was too unselfish to claim attention  i never doubted her for one moment till i came home on that unhappy day and found how ill keith was i did think then that considering how much she had seen of alick while the splinters were working out she ought to have known better than to talk of sciatica but she made me quite believe in her extreme anxiety and that she was only going out because it was necessary for her to take care of you on your first appearance how bright she looked and how little i thought i should never see her again  oh she meant what she said she always was kind to me most kind repeated rachel so considerate about all the dreadful springnot one word did she say to vex me about the past i am sure she did go out on that day as much to shelter me as for anything else i cant bear to think all thishere in this pretty room that she had such pleasure in where she made me so welcome after all my disagreeableness and foolishness  the colonel could almost have said better such foolishness than such wisdom such repulsion than such attraction he was much struck by rachels distress and the absence of all female spite and triumph made him understand ermines defence of her as really largeminded and generous  it is a very sad moment to be undeceived he said one would rather have ones faults come to light in ones life than afterwards  they were simple words so simple that the terrible truth with which they were connected did not come upon rachel at the first moment but as if to veil her agitation she drew towards her a book an ivorybound prayerbook full of illuminations of bessies own doing and her eye fell upon the awful verse so long as thou doest well unto thyself men will speak good of thee it was almost more than rachel could bear sitting in the midst of the hoards for which poor bessie had sold herself she rose up with a sob of oppressive grief and broke out oh at least it is a comfort that alick was really the kindest and rightest only too right but you can settle all this without him she added imploringly need he know of this i cant bear that he should  nor i said colonel keith it was the reason that i am glad you are here alone  oh thank you no one need ever know added rachel  i fear my brother must see the accounts as they have to be paid but that need not be immediately  is there anything else that is dreadful said rachel looking at the remaining papers as if they were a nest of adders i dont like to take them home now if they will grieve alick  you need not be afraid of that packet said the colonel i see his fathers handwriting they look like his letters from india  rachel looked into one or two and her face lighted up oh she exclaimed this is enough to make up for all this is his letter to tell about alicks wound oh how beautifully he speaks of him and rachel with no voice to read handed the thin paper to her companion that he might see the full commendation that had been wrung from the reserved fathers heart by his sons extremity  you must be prepared to hear that all is over wrote the father to his daughter in fact i doubt whether he can live till morning though mvicar declares that nothing vital has been touched be it as it may the boy has been in all respects even more than i dared to wish and the comfort he has been ever since he came out to me has been unspeakable we must not grudge him such a soldiers death after his joyous life but for you my poor girl i could only wish the same for myself tomorrow you will at least if you lose a brothers care have a memory of him to which to live up the thought of such a dead brother will be more to you than many a living one can ever be to a sister  rachels heart beat high and her eyes were full of tears of exultation and the colonel was well pleased to compensate for all the pain he had inflicted by giving her all the details he could recollect of her husbands short campaign they had become excellent friends over their mournful work and were sorry to have their teteatete interrupted when a message was brought that his lordship was ready if mrs keith would be so good as to come into his sittingroom  she wiped away the tears and awestruck and grave followed the colonel a great contrast to lord keiths more frequent ladyvisitor as she silently received the polished greeting its peculiar stateliness of courtesy enhanced by the feeble state of the shattered old man unable to rise from his pillowed chair and his face deeply lined by suffering he would not let her give him any account of her labours nor refer any question to him he only entreated that everything might be taken away and that he might hear nothing about it he spoke warmly of alicks kindness and attention and showed much solicitude about his indisposition and at last he inquired for rachels little charge hoping he was not clamorous or obnoxious to her or to mr clares household her eager description of his charms provoked a look of interest and a sad smile followed by a request that weather and doctor permitting she would bring the child to be seen for a few minutes the next day there was an appointment at which both the colonel and alick were wanted but on the following one the carriage should be sent to bring her and the little one to timber end  the effect of this invitation amused alick the first thing he heard in the morning was a decided announcement from rachel that she must go up to london to procure equipments for the baby to be presented in  you know i cant go with you today  of course but i must make him fit to be seen you know he has been wearing little unas things all this time and that will not do out of the nursery  a superior woman ought to know that his lordship will never find out what his son has on  then it is all the more reason that i should not let the poor dear little fellow go about wrapped up in somebodys old shawl  what will you do thentake your maid  certainly not i cant have him left  then take him with you  what alick a little unvaccinated baby where have you ever lived i dont see the least reason why i should not go alone  you need not begin beating about the world yet rachel how many times did you say you had been in london  three once with my father when i was a child once in the time of the great exhibition and passing through it now with you but any one of common sense can manage  if you will wait till five oclock i will come with you said alick wearily  no indeed i had rather not go than that you should you are quite tired out enough at the end of the day  then do not go  alick why will you have no proper feeling for that poor dear child said rachel with tears in her eyes  if he winced he did not show it my proper feeling takes the direction of my wife he said  you dont really mean to forbid me to go she exclaimed  i dont mean it for i do so unless you find some one to go with you  it was the first real collision that had taken place but alicks quiet almost languid tone had an absolute determination in it from the very absence of argument and rachel though extremely annoyed felt the uselessness of battling the point she paused for a few moments then said with an effort may i take the housekeeper  yes certainly and then he added some advice about taking a brougham and thus lightened her heart so that she presently said humbly  have i been selfwilled and overbearing alick  he laughed not at all you have persevered just where you ought i dare say this is all more essential than shows on the surface and he added with a shaken voice if you were not myself rachel you know how i should thank you for caring for my poor bessies child he was gone almost as he spoke the words but rachel still felt the kiss and the hot tears that had fallen on her face  mr clare readily consented to spare his housekeeper but the housekeeper was untoward she was busied in her housewife skep and would not stir alick was gone to timber end and rachel was just talking of getting the schoolmasters wife as an escort when mr clare said  pray are you above accepting my services  you oh uncle thank you but  what were your orders anybody with you was it not i flatter myself that i have some body at least  if alick will not think i ought not  the boy will not presume to object to what i do with you  i do wish it very much said candid rachel  of course you do my dear alick is not cured of a young mans notion that babies are a sort of puppies he is quite right not to let you run about london by yourself but he will be quite satisfied if you find eyes and i find discretion  but is it not very troublesome to you  it is a capital lark said mr clare with a zest that only the slang word could imply removing all rachels scruples and in effect mr clare did enjoy the spice of adventure in a most amusing way he knew perfectly well how to manage laid out the plan of operations gave orders to the driver went into all the shops and was an effective assistant in the choice of material and even of embroidery his touch and ear seemed to do more for him than many mens eyes do for them he heard odd scraps of conversation and retailed them with so much character he had such pleasant colloquies with all in whose way he fell and so thoroughly enjoyed the flow and babble of the full stream of life that rachel marvelled that the seclusion of his parsonage was bearable to him he took her to lunch with an old friend a lady who had devoted herself to the care of poor girls to be trained as servants and rachel had the first real sight of one of the many great and good works set on foot by personal and direct labour  if i had been sensible i might have come to something like this she said  do you wish to undo these last three months  no i am not fit to be anything but an ordinary married woman with an alick to take care of me but i am glad some people can be what i meant to be  and you need not regret not being useful now said mr clare where should any of us be without you  it had not occurred to rachel but she was certainly of far more positive use in the world at the present moment than ever she had bean in her most assuming maiden days  little alexander was arrayed in all that could enhance his baby dignity and rachel was more than ever resolved to assert his superiority over great frightful fine children resenting vehemently an innocent observation from alick that the small features and white skin promised sandiness of hair perhaps alick delighted in saying such things for the sake of proving the very womanhood of his clever woman rachel hung back afraid of the presentation and would have sent her maid into the room with the child if colonel keith had not taken her in himself even yet she was not dexterous in handling the baby her hands were both occupied and her attention absorbed and she could not speak she felt it so mournful to show this frail motherless creature to a father more like its grandfather and already almost on the verge of the grave she came up to lord keith and held the child to him in silence he said thank you and kissed not only the little one but her own brow and she kept the tears back with difficulty  colonel keith gave her a chair and footstool and she sat with the baby on her lap while very few words were spoken it was the colonel who asked her to take off the hood that hid the head and brow and who chiefly hazarded opinions as to likeness and colour of eyes lord keith looked earnestly and sadly but hardly made any observation except that it looked healthier than he had been led to expect he was sure it owed much to mrs keiths great care and kindness  rachel feared he would not be able to part with his little son and began to mention the arrangements she had contemplated in case he wished to keep the child at timber end on this lord keith asked with some anxiety if its presence were inconvenient to mr clare and being assured of the contrary said then while you are so kind as to watch over him i much prefer that things should remain in their present state than to bring him to a house like this you do not object  oh no i am so glad i was only dreading the losing him i thought mrs menteith wished for him when he is old enough to travel  colin said lord keith looking up sharply will nothing make the menteiths understand that i would rather put out the child to nurse in a highland hut than in that babel of a nursery of theirs  colin smiled and said isabel does not easily accept an answer she dislikes  but remember both of you continued lord keith that happen what may this poor child is not to be in her charge ive seen enough of her children left alone in perambulators in the sun you will be in edinburgh he added turning to rachel  yes when alicks leave ends  i shall return thither when this matter is over i know i shall be better at home in scotland and if i winter in edinburgh may be we could make some arrangement for his being still under your eye  rachel went home more elevated than she had been for months past     chapter xxix at last     i bid thee hail not as in former days   not as my chosen only but my bride   my very bride coming to make my house   a glorious temple          a h hallam                                                     timber end                                                    littleworthy                                                    september 10th  dear miss williamsi must begin by entreating your forgiveness for addressing you in a manner for which perhaps you may be unprepared but i trust you have always been aware that any objections that i may have offered to my brother colins attachment to yourself have never been personal or owing to anything but an unfortunate complication of circumstances these difficulties are as no doubt he will explain to you in great measure removed by the present condition of my family which will enable me to make such settlements as i could wish in the ease of one so nearly connected with me so that i am enabled to entreat of you at length to reward the persevering constancy so well deserved i have a further and a personal cause for wishing that the event should not be deferred as regard for my feelings might have led you to propose you are aware of the present state of my health and that it has become expedient to make immediate arrangements for the future guardianship of my little boy his uncles are of course his natural guardians and i have unbounded confidence in both but alexander keiths profession renders it probable that he may not always be at hand and i am therefore desirous of being able to nominate yourself together with my brother among the personal guardians indeed i understand from alexander keith that such was the express wish of his sister i mention this as an additional motive to induce you to consent for my own part even without so stringent a cause all that i have ever seen or known of yourself would inspire me with the desire that you should take a mothers place towards my son but you must be aware that such an appointment could only be made when you are already one of the family and this it is that leads me to entreat you to overlook any appearance of precipitancy on my brothers part and return a favourable reply to the request which with my complete sanction he is about to address to you  yes ermine williams forgive all that is past and feel for an old it may be a dying man and for a motherless infant there is much to forget but i trust to your overcoming any scruples and giving me all the comfort in your power in thinking of the poor child who has come into the world under such melancholy circumstances                                                 yours most truly                                                 keith of gowanbrae   poor keith he has given me his letter open his real anxiety has been too much at last for his dignity and now my ermine what do you say to his entreaty the state of the case is this how soon this abscess may be ready for the operation is still uncertain the surgeons think it will be in about three weeks and in this interval he wishes to complete all his arrangements in plain english his strongest desire is to secure the poor little boy from falling into menteiths hands now mine is a precarious life and alick and rachel may of course be at the ends of the earth so the point is that you shall be one of the family before the will is signed alicks leave has been extended to the 1st of october no more is possible and he undertakes to nurse poor keith for a fortnight from tomorrow if you will consent to fulfil this same request within that time after the 1st i should have to leave you but as soon as keith is well enough to bear the journey he wishes to return to edinburgh where he would be kindly attended to by alick and rachel all the winter there ermine your victory is come your consent has been entreated at last by my brother not for my sake but as a personal favour to himself because there is no woman in the world of whom he thinks so highly for myself i say little i grieve that you should be thus hurried and fluttered and if ailie thinks it would harm you she must telegraph back to me not to come down and i will try to teach myself patience by preaching it to keith but otherwise you will see me by four oclock tomorrow every time i hear rachels name i think it ought to have been yours and surely in this fourteenth year lesser objections may give way but persuasions are out of the question you must be entirely led by your own feeling if i could have seen you in july this should not have come so suddenly at last yours more than ever decide as you may                                                    colin a keith  p si am afraid rose would hardly answer this purpose equally well   colonel keith followed his letter at four oclock and entering his own study found it in a cloud of smoke in the midst of which he dimly discerned a long beard and thin visage absorbed in calculation  edward how is ermine  oh inquiringly keith as taken by surprise ah you were to come home today how are you  how is she has she had my letter  what letter you write every day i thought  the letter of yesterday have you heard nothing of it  not that i know of look here keith i told you i was sure the platinum  your brain is becoming platinum i must go and the chemist remained with merely a general impression of having been interrupted  next the colonel met rose watching at his own gate and this time his answer was more explicit  yes aunt ermine said you were coming and that i might meet you but that i must let you come in alone for she had not seen you so long that she wanted you all to herself  and how is she how has she been  she is well now said rose in the grave grownup way she always assumed when speaking of her aunts health but she has been having a good deal of her nervous headache this summer and lady temple wanted her to see mr frampton but aunt ailie said it was only excitement and wear of spirits oh i am glad you have come back we have so wearied after you  nevertheless rose duteously loosed the hand to which she had been clinging till they came to the door and as colin keith opened it again he was met by the welcoming glances of the bright eyes this time he did not pause till he was close to her and kneeling on one knee beside her he put his arm round her and held her hands in his  the first words that passed were you had the letters  colin colin my one prayer has been make thy way plain before my face  and now it is  the suspicion is gone the displeasure is gone the doubts are gone and now there is nothingnothing but the lameness and the poverty and if you like the old cinder colin that is your concern and she hid her face with a sort of sobbing laugh  and even the haste you consent to that  i dont feel it like haste she said looking up with a smile and then crimsoning  and ailie gives leave and thinks the hurry will not harm you  ailie o colin did you think i could tell any one of your letter before you had had your answer  then edward is not so moonstruck as i thought him and when shall it be dearest give me as much time as you can i must go back this day fortnight  i suppose your expectations are not high in the matter of finery said ermine with a certain archness of voice  those eyes are all the finery i ever see  then if you will not be scandalized at my natural sunday dress i dont see why this day week should not do as well as any other time  ermine you are the only woman i ever met totally free from nonsense  take care it is very unfeminine and disagreeable to be devoid of nonsense  very and therefore you are talking it now ermine how shall i thank you not only for the sake of the ease of mind to my poor brother but in the scenes we are going through a drop of happiness is wanted as a stimulant when i looked at the young couple at bishopsworthy i often felt as if another halfyear of suspense was more than i could bear and that i must ask you to help me through with at least a definite hope  ah you have gone through a great deal i am sure it has been a time of great trouble  indeed it has the suffering has become unceasing and often most severe and there is grievous depression of spirits i could not have left him even for a day if he had not been so fervently bent on this  is he feeling his loss more acutely than at first  not so much that as for the poor little boy who is a heavy burthen on his mind he has lived in such a state of shrewd distrust that he has no power of confidence and his complications for making all the boys guardians check one another till we come to a dead lock and to make provision for isabel out of menteiths reach are enough to distract the brain of a man in health  is he fond of the child  it is an oppressive care to him and he only once has made up his mind to see it though it is never off his mind and it is very curious how from the first he has been resolved on your taking charge of it it is the most real testimony he could give you  it is very comfortable not to be brought in like an enemy in spite of him as even a year ago i could have been proud to do  and i to have brought you he answered but it is far better as it is he is very cordial and wants to give up the auchinvar estate to me indeed he told me that he always meant me to have it as soon as i had washed my hands of youyou wicked syrenbut i think you will agree with me that he had better leave it to his daughter mary who has nothing we never reckoned on it  nor on anything else said ermine smiling  you have never heard my ways and means he said and as a prudent woman you ought you know see taking out his tablets here is my calculation  all that  on the staff in india there were good opportunities of saving then out of that sum i bought the house and with my halfpay our income will be very fair and there would be a pension afterwards for you this seems to me all we can reasonably want  unless i became like die ilsebill in the german tale after four years of living from hand to mouth this will be like untold gold to wish to be above strict economy in wheeled chairs has seemed like perilous discontent in rose and me  i have ventured on the extravagance of taking the ponies and little carriage off my brothers hands it is low enough for you and i shall teach rose to ride one of the ponies with me  the dear little rose but colin there is a dreadful whisper about her going with her father and ailie too you see now his character is cleared he has been offered a really lucrative post so that he could have them with him  does he wish it  i dare not ask i must be passive or i shall be selfish you are all my world and edward has no one make them settle it without me talk of something else tell me how your brother is to be taken care of  there cannot be a better nurse than alick keith and ferguson the agent is there getting directions from keith whenever he can bear it i am best out of the way of all that i have said once for all that i will do anything for them except live at gowanbrae and i am sick of demonstrating that the poor childs existence is the greatest possible relief to me and i hope now not to go back till the whole is settled and done with  you look regularly worn out with the discussions  it was an endless business the only refreshment was in now and then getting over to bishopsworthy  what to rachel said ermine archly  rachel is showing to great advantage i did not think it was in her to be so devoted to the child and it is beautiful to see her and mr clare together  theres a triumph said ermine smiling do you grant that the happy medium is reached that alick should learn to open his eyes and rachel to shut hers  well her eyes are better but he poor lad has been in no spirits to open his very wide the loss of his sister went very deep and those aguish attacks though they become much slighter make him look wretchedly ill i should have doubted about leaving him in charge in his present state but that he was urgent on me and he is spared all the night nursing any way i must not leave him longer than i can help i may have one week with you at homeat our home ermine  and let us make the most of that said ermine quickly  meanwhile alison sore and sick at heart wandered on the esplanade foreboding that the blow was coming that she ought to rejoice at if her love could only be more unselfish at last the colonel joined her and as usual his tone of consideration cheered and supported her when in actual conference with him and as he explained his plans he added that he hoped there would be scarcely any interruption to her intercourse with her sister  you know she said abruptly that we could go to ekaterinburg  and what is your feeling about it remember ailie that i am your brother too and as she hesitated your feelingsno doubt you are in many minds  ah yes i never settled anything without ermine and she will not help me now and she has been so worn with the excitement and anxiety of all this long detention of yours that i dont dare to say a word that could prey on her  in fact you would chiefly be decided by edwards own wishes  if i were sure of them sighed poor alison but he lives on experiments and can hardly detach himself from them even to attend to ermine herself i dont know whether we should be a comfort or a burthen and he would be afraid to hurt our feelings by telling the truth i have been longing to consult you who have seen him at that place in russia  and indeed ailie he is so wedded to smoke and calculations and so averse to this sublunary world that though your being with him might be beneficial still i greatly question whether the risk of carrying poor little rose to so remote a place in such a climate would be desirable if he were pining to have a home made for him it would be worth doing as it is the sacrifice would be disproportioned  it would be no sacrifice if he only wanted us  where you are wanted is here ermine wants you i want you the temples want you  now colin tell me truly edward feels as i do and dr long spoke seriously of it will not my present position do you and ermine harm among your friends  with no friend we wish to make or keep  if i do remain continued alison it must be as i am i would not live upon you even if you asked me which you have too much sense to do and though dear lady temple is everything to me and wants me to forget that i am her governess that would be a mere shuffle but if it is best for you that i should give it up and go out say so at once  best for me to have eight temples thrown on my hands all in despair to have you at myrtlewood is an infinite relief to me both on their account and ermines you should not suspect a penniless scotsman of such airs ailie  not you colin but your family  isabel menteith thinks a glassblower was your father and mauleverer your brother so yours is by far the most respectable profession no indeed my family might be thankful to have any one in it who could do as you have done  alisons scruples were thus disposed of and when edwards brain cleared itself from platinum he showed himself satisfied with the decision though he insisted on henceforth sending home a sum sufficient for his daughters expenses and once said something that could be construed into a hope of spending a quiet old age with her and his sister but at present he was manifestly out of his element and was bent on returning to ekaterinburg immediately after the marriage  his presence was but a qualified pleasure naturally shy and absent his broken spirits and removal from domestic life and from society had exaggerated his peculiarities and under the pressure of misfortune caused in a great measure by his own negligence he had completely given way without a particle of his sisters patience or buoyancy and had merely striven to drown his troubles in engrossing problems of his favourite pursuit till the habit of abstraction had become too confirmed to be shaken off when the blot on his name was removed he was indeed sensible that he was no longer an exile but he could not resume his old standing friendships rudely severed could not be reunited his absorption had grown by indulgence old interests had passed away needful conformity to social habits was irksome and even his foreign manner and appearance testified to his entire unfitness for english life  tibbie was in constant dread of his burning the house down so incalculable and preposterous were his hours and the colonel longing to render the house a perfect shrine for his bride found it hard to tolerate the fumes with which her brother saturated it if he had been sure that opium formed no portion of edwards solace his counsel to alison would have been less decisive to poor little rose her father was an abiding perplexity and distress she wanted to love him and felt it absolute naughtiness to be constantly disappointed by his insensibility to her approaches or else repelled and disgusted by that vice of the russian sheep and a vague hint of being transported to the ural mountains away from aunt ermine had haunted her of late more dreadfully than even the lions of old so that the relief was ineffable when her dear colonel confided to her that she was to be his niece and aunt ermines handmaid sent her to consult with tibbie on her new apartment and invited augustus to the most eligible hole in the garden the grotto that rose conrade and francis proceeded to erect with pebbles and shells was likely to prove as alarming to that respectable reptile as a model cottage to an irish peasant  ermine had dropped all scruples about roses intercourse with other children and the feeling that she might associate with them on equal terms perhaps was the most complete assurance of edwards restoration she was glad that companionship should render the little maiden more active and childlike for edwards abstraction had made her believe that there might be danger in indulging the dreaminess of the imaginative child  no one welcomed the removal of these restraints more warmly than lady temple she was perhaps the happiest of the happy for with her there was no drawback no sorrow no parting to fear her first impulse when colonel keith came to tell her his plans was to seize on hat and shawl and rush down to mackarel lane to kiss ermine with all her heart and tell her that it was the most delightful thing of her to have consented at last for nobody deserved so well to be happy as that dear colonel and then she clung to alison declaring that now she should have her all to herself and if she would only come to myrtlewood she would do her very best to make her comfortable there and it should be her homeher home always  in fact said ermine afterwards to the colonel when you go to avoncester i think you may as well get a licence for the wedding of alison williams and fanny temple at the same time there has been quite a courtship on the ladys part  the courtship had been the more ardent from fannys alarm lest the brother should deprive her of alison and when she found her fears groundless she thanked him with such fervour and talked so eagerly of his sisters excellences that she roused him into a lucid interval in which he told colonel keith that lady temple might give him an idea of the style of woman that lucy had been indeed colin began to think that it was as well that he was so well wrapped up in smoke and chemistry otherwise another might have been added to the list of lady temples hopeless adorers the person least satisfied was tibbie who could not get over the speediness of the marriage nor forgive the injury to miss williams of bringing her hame like any pleughmans wife wantin a honeymoon trip forbye providin hersel with weddin braws conformable gin folk tak sic daft notions aff the english theyd be mair wise like to bide at hame an thats my way o thinkin  crusty as she was there was no danger of her not giving her warmest welcome and thus the morning came tibbie had donned her cap with white satin ribbons and made of lace once belonging to the only heiress who had ever brought wealth to the keiths edward williams all his goods packed up had gone to join his sisters and the colonel only perceptibly differing from his daily aspect in having a hat free from crape was opening all the windows in hopes that a thorough draft would remove the last of the tobacco when the letters were brought in and among them one of the black bordered bulletins from littleworthy which ordinarily arrived by the second post it was a hurried note evidently dashed off to catch the morning mail   my dear colonelalick tells me to write in haste to catch the morning post and beg you to telegraph the instant your wedding is over the doctors see cause to hasten their measures but your brother will have nothing done till the will is signed he and alick both desire you will not come but it is getting to be far too much for alick i would tell you more if there were time before the post goes love to dear ermine                                               very sincerely yours                                                            r keith   there was so shocked and startled a look on colins face that tibbie believed that his brother must be dead and when in a few almost inaudible words he told her that he must start for bishopsworthy by the afternoon train she fairly began to scold partly by way of working off the irritation left by her alarm the lads clean demented heard ye ever the like to rin awa frae his newmade wife afore the blessins been weel spoke an a for the whimsie of that daft english lassie that made siccan a piece of work wi her cantrips  i am afraid she is right now said the colonel and my brother must not be left any longer  hout awa maister colin his lordship has come between you and your luve oft enough already without partin ye at the very church door ye would na have the english cast up to us that one of your name did na ken better what was fittin by his bride  my bride must be the judge tibbie you shall see whether she bids me stay said colin a little restored by his amusement at her anxiety for his honour among the english now desire smith to meet me at the church door and ride at once from thence to avoncester and get your face ready to give a cheerful welcome tibbie let her have that at least whatever may come after  tibbie looked after him and shook her head understanding from her ain laddies pallid check and resolute lip nay in the very sound of his footfall how sore was his trial and with onesided compassion she muttered telegrafted awa on his vera weddin day his lordshipll be the death o them baith before hes done  as it was in every way desirable that the wedding should be unexpected by avonmonth in general it was to take place at the close of the ordinary morning service and ermine in her usual seat within the vestry was screened from knowing how late was colins entrance or seeing the determined composure that would to her eyes have betrayed how much shaken he was he was completely himself again by the time the congregation dispersed leaving only grace curtis lady temple and the little best man conrade a goodly sight in his grey suit and scarlet hose then came the slow movement from the vestry the only really bridallooking figure being rose in white muslin and white ribbons walking timidly and somewhat in awe beside her younger aunt while her father upheld and guided the elder both were in quiet soft dark dresses and straw bonnets but over hers ermine wore the small though exquisite brussels lace veil that had first appeared at her mothers wedding and thankful joy and peaceful awe looked so lovely on her noble brow deep soft dark eyes and the more finely moulded because somewhat worn features and so beauteously deepened was the carnation on her cheek that mr mitchell ever after maintained that he had never married any one to compare with that thirtythree years old bride upon crutches and as he reported to his wife in no dress at all  her brother who supported her all the time she stood was infinitely more nervous than she was her native grace and dignity and absence of all false shame entirely covered her helplessness and in her earnestness she had no room for confusion her only quivering of voice was caught for one moment from the tremulous intensity of feeling that colin keith could not wholly keep from thrilling in his tones as he at last proclaimed his right to love and to cherish her for whom he had so long persevered  unobserved he filled up the halfwritten despatch with the same pen with which he signed the register and sent conrade to the door with it to his already mounted messenger then assuming edwards place as ermines supporter he led her to the door seated her in her wheeled chair and silently handing rachels note as his explanation to alison he turned away and walked alone by ermines side to his own house still silent he took her into the bright drawingroom he had so long planned for her and seated her in her own peculiar chair then his first words were thank god for this  she knew his face colin your brother is worse he bent his head he could not speak  and you have to go to him this very day  ermine you must decide you are at last my first duty  that means that you know you ought to go tell me what it is  he told the substance of the note ending with if you could come with me  i would if i should not be a tie and hindrance no i must not do that but here i am colin here i am and it is all trueit has all come right at last all we waited for nothing has ever been like this  she was the stronger tears as much of loving thankfulness as of overflowing disappointment rushed into his eyes at such a fulfilment of the purpose that he had carried with him by sea and land in battle and sickness through all the years of his manhood and withal her one thought was to infuse in its strongest measure the drop of happiness that was to sustain him through the scenes that awaited him to make him feel her indeed his wife and to brighten him with the sunbeam face that she knew had power to cheer him rallying her playfulness she took off her bonnet and said as she settled her hair there that is being at home take my shawl yes and these white gloves and put them out of sight that i may not feel like a visitor and that you may see how i shall look when you come back do you know i think your being out of the way will be rather a gain for there will be a tremendous feminine bustle with the fitting of our possessions  her smile awoke a responsive look and she began to gaze round and admire feeling it safest to skim on the surface and he could not but be gratified by her appreciation of the pains spent upon this her especial home he had recovered himself again by the time these few sentences had passed they discussed the few needful arrangements required by his departure and tibbie presently found them so cheerful that she was quite scandalized and when ermine held out her hands saying what tibbie wont you come and kiss me and wish me joy she exclaimed  wish ye joy its like me to wish ye joy an yer lad hurled awa frae yer side i the blink o an ee by thae wild telegrams i dinna see what joys to come ot its clean again the scripture  i told you i had left it to her to decide tibbie said the colonel  weel an what wad ye hae the puir leddy say she kens what sorts ye when the head of yer name is sick an lyin among thae english loons that hae brocht him to siccan a pass  right tibbie exclaimed ermine greatly amused at the unexpected turn purely for the sake of putting maister colin in the wrong if a gentleman wont be content without a bride who cant walk he must take the consequence and take his wedding trip by himself it is my belief tibbie as i have just been telling him that you and i shall get the house in all the better order for having him off our hands just at first she added with a look of intelligence  deed an maybe we shall responded tibbie with profound satisfaction he was aye a camsteary child when there was any wark on hand  colin could not help laughing and when once this had been effected ermine felt that his depression had been sufficiently met and that she might venture on deeper and more serious sympathy befitting the chastened thankful feelings with which they hailed the crowning of their youthful love the fulfilment of the hopes and prayers that the one had persisted in through doubt and change the other had striven to resign into the allwise hands  they had an early meal together chiefly for the sake of his wheeling her to the head of his table and seeing how she looked there and then the inexorable hour was come and he left her with the echo of her last words in his ear goodbye colin stay as long as you ought it will make the meeting all the sweeter and you have your wife to some back to now give a sisters love to your brother and thanks for having spared you and his last look at the door was answered with her sunshiny smile  but when a few minutes after edward came up with alison for his farewell they found her lying back in her chair half fainting and her startled look told almost too plainly that she had not thought of her brother never mind said edward affectionately as much to console alison as ermine for this oblivion of course it must be so and i dont deserve otherwise nothing brought me home but colin keiths telling me that he saw you would not have him till my character was cleared up and now he has repaired so much of the evil i did you all i can do is to work to make it up to you in other ways goodbye ermine i leave you all in much better hands than mine ever were you are right enough in feeling that a week of his absence outweighs a year of mine bless you for all that you and he have done for my child she at least is a comfort to you  ermines powers were absolutely exhausted she could only answer him by embraces and tears and all the rest of the day she was to use her own expression good for nothing but to be let alone nor though she exerted herself that she might with truth write that she was well and happy was she good for much more on the next and her jealous guardians allowed her to see no one but soft fondling lady temple who insisted on a relationship through rachel and whose tender pensive quietness could not fail to be refreshment to the strained spirits and wearied physical powers and who better than anybody could talk of the colonel nay who could understand and even help ermine herself to understand that these everwelling tears came from a source by no means akin to grief or repining  the whole aspect of the rooms was full of tokens of his love and thought for her the groundfloor had been altered for her accommodation the furniture chosen in accordance with her known tastes or with old memories all undemonstratively prepared while yet she had not decided on her consent and what touched her above all was the collection of treasures that he had year by year gathered together for her throughout the weary waiting purchases at which lady temple remembered her mothers banter with his quiet evasions of explanation no wonder ermine laid her head on her hand and could not retain her tears as she recalled the white dismayed face of the youth who had printed that one sad earliest kiss on her brow as she lay firescathed and apparently dying and who had cherished the dream unbroken and unwaveringly had denied himself consistently had garnered up those choice tokens when ignorant over whether she still lived had relied on her trust and come back heartwhole to claim and win her undaunted by her crippled state her poverty and her brothers blotted name how can such love ever be met why am i favoured beyond all i could have dared to image to myself she thought and wept again because as she murmured to fanny i do thank god for it with all my heart and i do long to tell him all i dont think my married life ought to begin by being sillier than ever i was before but i cant help it  and i do love you so much the better for it said fanny a better companion today than the grave strong alison who would have been kind but would have had to suppress some marvel at the breakdown and some resentment that edward had no greater share in it  the mornings post brought her the first letter from her husband and in the midst of all her anxiety as to the contents she could not but linger a moment on the aspect of the honourable mrs colin keith in his handwriting there was a carefulness in the penmanship that assured her that let him have to tell her what he would the very inditing of that address had been enjoyment to him that the border was black told nothing but the intelligence was such as she had been fully prepared for colin had arrived to find the surgeons work over but the patient fast sinking even his recognition of his brother had been uncertain and within twentyfour hours of the morning that had given colin a home of his own the last remnant of the home circle of his childhood had passed from him  still ermine had to continue a widowed bride for full a fortnight whilst the funeral and subsequent arrangements necessitated colins presence in scotland it was on a crisp beautiful october evening that rose her chestnut hair flying about her brow stood lighted up by the sunbeams in the porch with upraised face and outstretched hands and as the colonel bent down to receive her joyous embrace said aunt ermine gave me leave to bring you to the door then i am going to myrtlewood till bedtime and after that i shall always have you  the open door showed ermine too tremulous to trust to her crutch but leaning forward her eyes liquid with tears of thankfulness the patient spirits had reached their home and haven the earthly haven of loving hearts the likeness of the heavenly haven and as her head leant at last upon his shoulder and his guardian arm encircled her there was such a sense of rest and calm that even the utterance of their inward thanksgiving or of a word of tenderness would have jarred upon them it was not till a knock and message at the door interrupted them that they could break the blessed stillness  and there you are my ermine said colin standing on the hearthrug and surveying her with satisfied eyes you are a queenly looking dame in your black draperies and you look really well much better than rachel led me to expect  ah when she was here i had no fixed day to look forward to and receiving our poor little orphan baby was not exactly like receiving his uncle though rachel seemed to think it ought to make up for anything  she was thoroughly softened by that child it was a spirited thing her bringing him down here on the monday when we started for scotland and then coming all the way alone with her maid i did not think alick would have consented but he said she would always be the happier for having deposited her charge in your hands  it was a great wrench to her i felt it like robbery when she put the little fellow down on my lap and knelt over him not able to get herself away but saying that she was not fit to have him she could not bear it if she made him hate her as conrade did i am glad she has had his first smile she deserves it  is tibbie in charity with him  oh more than in charity she did not take the first announcement of his coming very amiably but when i told her she was to reign in the nursery and take care the poor little chief know the sound of a scots tongue she began to thaw and when he came into the house pity or loyalty or both flamed up hotly and have quite relieved me for at first she made a baby of me and was a perfect dragon of jealousy at poor ailies doing anything for me it was a rich scene when rachel began giving her directions out of hints for the management of infants just in the old voice and tibbie swept round indignantly his lordship lord keith of gowanbrae suld hae the best tendance she could gie him she did na lippen to thae english buiks as though she couldna rear a wean without bulk learning poor rachel nearly cried and was not half comforted by my promising to study the book as much as she pleased  it will never do to interfere with tibbie and i own i am much of her opinion i had rather trust to her than to rachel or the book  well the more rachel talked book the more amiable surprise passed between her mother and lady temple that the poor little follow should have lived at all and i believe they were very angry with me for thinking her views very sensible lady temple is so happy with him she says it is so melancholy to have a house without a baby that she comes in twice or three times a day to console herself with this one  did you not tell me that she and the curtises spent the evening with you  yes it was rather shocking to receive them without you but it was the only way of being altogether on rachels one evening here and it was very amusing mrs curtis so happy with her daughter looking well and bright and rachel with so much to tell about bishopsworthy till at last grace in her sly odd way said she thought dear alexander had even taught rachel curatolatry whereupon rachel fired up at such an idea being named in connexion with mr clare then came suddenly and very prettily down and added living with alick and mr clare has taught me what nonsense i talked in those days  well done rachel it proves what alick always said that her great characteristic is candour  i hope she was not knocked up by the long night journey all at one stretch mrs curtis was very uneasy about it but nothing would move her she owned that alick did not expect her for she had taken care he should not object by saying nothing of her intention but she was sure he would be ill on wednesday morning and then mrs curtis not only gave in directly but all we married women turned upon poor grace for hinting that alick might prefer a days solitary illness to her being overtired  she was extremely welcome alick was quite done for by all he had gone through he was miserably ill and i hardly knew what to do with him and he mended from the moment his face lightened up at the sight of her  theres the use of strength of mind how is alick  getting better under mvicar and edinburgh winds it was hard on him to have borne the brunt of all the nursing that terrible last week and in fact i never knew how much he was going through rather than summon me his sauntering manner always conceals how much he is doing and poor keith was so fond of him and liked his care so much that almost the whole fell upon him at last and i believe he said more that was good for keith and brought in mr clare more than perhaps i should ever have been able to do so though i must regret having been away it may have been the best thing  and it was by your brothers earnest wish said ermine it was not as if you had stayed away for your own pleasure  no poor keith repeatedly said he could not die in peace till he had secured our having the sole charge of his son it was a strong instinct that conquered inveterate prejudice did i tell you about the will  you said i should hear particulars when you came  the personal guardianship is left to us first then to alick and rachel with £300 a year for the expenses then we have auchinvar the estate is charged with an equivalent settlement upon mary a better plan which i durst not propose but with so long a minority the estate will bear it alick has his sisters fortune back again and the menteith children a few hundreds but menteith is rabid about the guardianship and would hardly speak to alick  and you  they always keep the peace with me isabel even made us a wedding presenta pair of miniatures of my father and mother that i am very glad to rescue though as she politely told me i was welcome to them for they were hideously dressed and she wanted the frames for two sweet photographs of garibaldi and the queen of naples  then looking up as if to find a place for them  why ermine what have you done to the room it is the old parsonage drawingroom  did not you mean it when you took the very proportions of the bay window and chose just such a carpet  but what have you done to it  ailie and rose and lady temple and her boys have done it i have sat looking on and suggesting old things that we kept packed up have seen the light and your beautiful indian curiosities have found their corners  and the room has exactly the old geranium scent  i think the curtises must have brought half their greenhouse down do you remember the old oakleaf geranium that you used to gather a leaf of whenever you passed our old conservatory  i have been wondering where the fragrance came from that made the likeness complete i have smelt nothing like it since  i said that i wished for one and grace got off without a word and searched everywhere at avoncester till she found one in a corner of the deans greenhouse there now you have a leaf in your fingers i think you do feel at home  not quite ermine it still has the dizziness of a dream i have so often conjured up all this as a vision that now there is nothing to take me away from it i can hardly feel it a reality  then i shall ring tibbie and the poor little lord upstairs are substantial witnesses to the cares and troubles of real life     chapter xxx who is the clever woman     halfgrown as yet a child and vain   she cannot fight the fight of death   what is she cut from love and faith                     knowledge and wisdom tennyson   it was long before the two mrs keiths met again mrs curtis and grace were persuaded to spend the spring and summer in scotland and alicks leave of absence was felt to be due to mr clare and thus it was that the first real family gathering took place on occasion of the opening of the institution that had grown out of the burnaby bargain this work had cost colonel keith and mr mitchell an infinity of labour and perseverance before even the preliminaries could be arranged but they contrived at length to carry it out and by the fourth spring after the downfall of the f u e e a house had been erected for the convalescents whose wants were to be attended to by a matron assisted by a dozen young girls in training for service  the male convalescents were under the discipline of sergeant obrien and the whole was to be superintended by colonel and mrs keith ermine undertook to hear a class of the girls two or three times a week and lower rooms had been constructed with a special view to her being wheeled into them so as to visit the convalescents and give them her attention and sympathy mary morris was head girl most of the others were from avonmouth but two pale londoners came from mr touchetts district and a little motherless lassie from the th highlanders was brought down with the nursery establishment on which mrs alexander keith now practised the hints on the management of infants  may was unusually propitious and after an orthodox teadrinking the new pupils and all the sundayschools were turned out to play on the homestead slopes with all the world to look on at them it was a warm brilliant day of joyous blossom and lively green and long laughing streaks of sunlight on the sea and no one enjoyed it more than did ermine as she sat in her chair delighting in the fresh sweetness of the old thorns laughing at the freaks of the scampering groups of children gaily exchanging pleasant talk with one friend after another and most of all with rachel who seemed to gravitate back to her whenever any summons had for a time interrupted their affluence of conversation  and all the time ermines footstool was serving as a table for the various flowers that two children were constantly gathering in the grass and presenting to her to rachel or to each other with a constant stream of not very comprehensible prattle full of pretty gesticulation that seemed to make up for the want of distinctness the yellowhaired slenderlymade delicatelyfeatured boy whose personal pronouns were just developing and his consonants very scanty though the elder of the two dutifully and admiringly obeyed the more distinct though less connected utterances of the little darkeyed girl eked out by pretty imperious gestures that seemed already to enchain the little whitefrocked cavalier to her service all the time it was droll to see how the two ladies could pay full attention to the children while going on with their own unbroken stream of talk  i am not overwhelming you suddenly exclaimed rachel checking herself in midcareer about the mothers meetings for the soldiers wives  far from it was i inattentive  oh noyes una dear very prettybut i found myself talking in the voice that always makes alick shut his eyesi should not think he often had to do so said ermine much amused by this gentle remedymind keith that is a nettle it will sting  less often than before said rachelnever mind the butterfly unai dont think i have had more than one thorough fit of what he calls leaping into the gulf it was about the soldiers wives married without leave who poor things are the most miserable creatures in the world and when i first found out about them i was in the sort of mood i was in about the lace and raved about the system and was resolved to employ one poor woman and alick looked meeker and meeker and assented to all i said as if he was half asleep and at last he quietly took up a sheet of paper and said he must write and sell out since i was bent on my gulf and an officers wife must be bound by the regulations of the service i was nearly as bad as ever i could have written an article on the injustice of the army regulations indeed i did begin but what do you think the end was i got a letter from a good lady who is always looking after the poor to thank mrs alexander keith for the help that had been sent for this poor woman to be given as if from the general fund after that i could not help listening to him and then i found it was so impossible to know about character or to be sure that one was not doing more harm thanwhat is it boys as three or four temples rushed up  aunt rachel mr clare is going to teach us a new game and he says you know it pray come  come una what keith will you come too ill take care of him ermine  and with a child in each hand rachel followed the deputation and had scarcely disappeared before the light gracious figure of rose glanced through the thorn trees aunt ermine you must come nearer it is so wonderful to see mr clare teaching this game  dont push my chair my dear it is much too heavy for you uphill  as if i could not drive you anywhere and here is conrade coming  conrade was in search of the deserter but he applied himself heartily to the propulsion of aunt ermine informing rose that mr clare was no end of a man much better than if he could see and aunt rachel was grown quite jolly  i think she has left off her long words said rose  she is not a civilian now said conrade quite unconscious of ermines amusement at his confidences as he pushed behind her i did think it a most benighted thing to marry her but thats what it is military discipline has made her conformable having placed the chair on a spot which commanded the scene the boy and girl rushed off to take their part in the sport leaving ermine looking down a steep bank at the huge ring of performers with linked hands advancing and receding to the measure of a chanted verse round a figure in the centre who made gesticulations pursued and caught different individuals in the ring and put them through a formula which provoked shouts of mirth ermine much enjoyed the sight it was pretty to watch the prononce dresses of the parish children interspersed with the more graceful forms of the little gentry and here and there a taller lady then ermine smiled to recognise alison as usual among her boys and lady temples soft greys and whites and gentle floating movements as she advanced and receded with stephana in one hand and a shy infantschool child in the other but ermines eye roamed anxiously for though rachels animated characteristic gestures were fully discernible and her little unas arch toss of the head marked her out yet the companion whom she had beguiled away and who had become more to ermine than any other of the frisking little ones of the flock was neither with her not with his chief protector rose in a second or two however the step that to her had most music int of all footfalls that ever were trodden was sounding on the path that led circuitously up the path and the colonel appeared with the little runaway holding his hand  why baby you are soon come away  i did not like itsit on mammas knee said the little fellow scrambling to his place then as one who felt it his own nest and throne  he was very soon frightened said the colonel it was only that little witch una who could have deluded him into such a crowd and as soon as she saw a bigger boy to beguile she instantly deserted keith so i relieved rachel of him  see rachel now mr clare is interrogating her how she is making them laugh i did not think she could ever have so entered into fun  alick must have made it a part of her education when the invalid has time for another essay ermine it should be on the benefits of ridicule  against clever womanhood but then the subject must have rachels perfect good humour  and the weapon must be in the most delicately skilful hands added the colonel properly wielded it saves blunting the superior weapon by overfrequent use here the success is complete  it has been irony rather than ridicule said ermine though when he taught her to laugh he won half the battle it is beautiful to see her holding herself back and most forbearing where she feels most positive i am glad to see him looking so much stronger and more substantial where is he  on the further bank supposed by mrs curtis to be asleep but watching uncle wife and child through his eyelashes did you ever see any one so like his sister as that child  much more so than this one i am glad he may one day see such a shadow of his brightfaced mother  you are mother said the the little orphan looking up into ermines face with a startled wistful look as having caught more of her meaning than she had intended and she met his look with a kiss the time was not yet come for gainsaying the belief more than in the words yes always a mother to you my precious little man  nor could you have had a bonnier face to look into added the colonel there the game breaks up we should collect our flock and get them them back to les invalides as alick calls it  take care no one else does so said ermine laughing it has been a most happy day and chief of all the pleasures has been the sight of rachel just what i hoped a thorough wife and mother all the more so for her being awake to larger interests and doing common things better for being the clever woman of the family where is she i dont see her now  where is she was asked by more than one of the party but the next to see her was alick who found her standing at the window of her own room with her longrobed twomonths old baby in her arms tired he asked  no i only sent down nurse to drink tea with the other grandees what a delightful day it has been i never hoped that such good fruit would rise out of my unhappy blunders  the blunders that brought so much good to me  ah the old places bring them back again i have been recollecting how it used to seem to me the depth of my fall that you were marrying me out of pure pity without my having the spirit to resent or prevent it and now i just like to think how kind and noble it was in you  i am glad to hear it i thought i was so foolishly in love that i was very glad of any excuse for pressing it on  are the people dispersing where is your uncle  he went home with the colonel and his wife he has quite lost his heart to ermine  and unadid you leave her with grace  no she trotted down hand in hand with his little lordship promising to lead her uncle back  my dear alick you dont mean that you trust to that  why hardly implicitly  is that the way you say so they may be both over the cliffs if you will just stay in the room with baby i will go down and fetch them up  alick very obediently held out his arms for his son but when rachel proceeded to take up her hat he added you have run miles enough today i am going down as soon as my uncle has had time to pay his visit in peace without being hunted  does he know that  the colonel does which comes to the same thing is not this boy just of the age that little keith was when you gave him up  yes and is it not delightful to see how much larger and heavier he is  hardly considering your objections to fine children  oh that was only to coarse overgrown ones una is really quite as tall as little keith and much more active you saw he could not play at the game at all and she was all life and enjoyment with no notion of shyness  it does not enter into her composition  and she speaks much plainer i never miss a word she says and i dont understand keith a bit though he tells such long stories  how backward  then she knows all her letters by sightalmost all and ermine can never get him to tell b from d and you know how she can repeat so many little verses while he could not even say thank you pretty cow this morning when i wanted to hear him  vast interval  it is only eight months but then una is such a bright forward child  highlydeveloped precocity  now alick what am i about why are you agreeing with me  i am between the horns of a dilemma either our young chieftain must be a dunce or we are rearing the clever woman of the family  i hope not exclaimed rachel  indeed i would not grudge her a superior implement even if i had sometimes cut my own fingers  but alick i really do not think i ever was such a clever woman  i never thought you one he quietly returned  she smiled this faculty had much changed her countenance i see she said thoughtfully i had a few intellectual tastes and liked to think and read which was supposed to be cleverness and my wilfulness made me fancy myself superior in force of character in a way i could never have imagined if i had lived more in the world contact with really clever people has shown me that i am slow and unready  it was a rusty implement and you tried weight instead of edge now it is infinitely brighter  but alick she said leaving the thought of herself for that of her child i believe you may be right about una for she added in low voice she is like the most practically clever person i ever saw  true he answered gravely i see it every day in every saucy gesture and coaxing smile when she tries to turn away displeasure in her naughty fits i hardly knew how to look on at her airs with keith it was so exactly like the little sister i first knew rachel such cleverness as that is a far more perilous gift to woman than your plodding intellectuality could ever be god grant he added with one of the effusions which sometimes broke through his phlegmatic temperament that this little fellow may be a kinder wiser brother than ever i was and that we may bring her up to your own truth and unselfishness then such power would be a happy endowment  yes said rachel may she never be out of your influence or be left to untrustworthy hands i should have been much better if i had had either father or brother to keep me in order poor child she has a wonderful charm not all my fancy alick and yet there is one whose real working talent has been more than that of any of us who has made it effective for herself and others and has let it do her only good not harm  you are right if we are to show una how intellect and brilliant power can be no snares but only blessings helping the spirits in infirmity and trouble serving as a real engine for independence and usefulness winning love and influence for good genuine talents in the highest sense of the word then commend me to such a clever woman of the family as ermine keith
