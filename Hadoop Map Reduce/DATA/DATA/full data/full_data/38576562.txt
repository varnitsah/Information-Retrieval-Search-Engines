38576562	maiwas revenge  or the war of the little hand   by h rider haggard     preface  it may be well to state that the incident of the thing that bites recorded in this tale is not an effort of the imagination on the contrary it is plagiarized mandara a wellknown chief on the east coast of africa has such an article and uses it in the same way the wicked conduct attributed to wambe is not without a precedent tchaka the zulu napoleon never allowed a child of his to live indeed he went further for on discovering that his mother unandi was bringing up one of his sons in secret like nero he killed her and with his own hand      maiwas revenge     igobo strikes  one dayit was about a week after allan quatermain told me his story of the three lions and of the moving death of jimjimhe and i were walking home together on the termination of a days shooting he owned about two thousand acres of shooting round the place he had bought in yorkshire over a hundred of which were wood it was the second year of his occupation of the estate and already he had reared a very fair head of pheasants for he was an allround sportsman and as fond of shooting with a shotgun as with an eightbore rifle we were three guns that day sir henry curtis old quatermain and myself but sir henry was obliged to leave in the middle of the afternoon in order to meet his agent and inspect an outlying farm where a new shed was wanted however he was coming back to dinner and going to bring captain good with him for brayley hall was not more than two miles from the grange  we had met with very fair sport considering that we were only going through outlying cover for cocks i think that we had killed twentyseven a woodcock and a leash of partridges which we secured out of a driven covey on our way home there lay a long narrow spinney which was a very favourite lie for woodcocks and generally held a pheasant or two as well  well what do you say said old quatermain shall we beat through this for a finish  i assented and he called to the keeper who was following with a little knot of beaters and told him to beat the spinney  very well sir answered the man but its getting wonderful dark and the winds rising a gale it will take you all your time to hit a woodcock if the spinney holds one  you show us the woodcocks jeffries answered quatermain quickly for he never liked being crossed in anything to do with sport and we will look after shooting them  the man turned and went rather sulkily i heard him say to the underkeeper hes pretty good the master is im not saying he isnt but if he kills a woodcock in this light and wind im a dutchman  i think that quatermain heard him too though he said nothing the wind was rising every minute and by the time the beat begun it blew big guns i stood at the righthand corner of the spinney which curved round somewhat and quatermain stood at the left about forty paces from me presently an old cock pheasant came rocketing over me looking as though the feathers were being blown out of his tail i missed him clean with the first barrel and was never more pleased with myself in my life than when i doubled him up with the second for the shot was not an easy one in the faint light i could see quatermain nodding his head in approval when through the groaning of the trees i heard the shouts of the beaters cock forward cock to the right then came a whole volley of shouts woodcock to the right cock to the left cock over  i looked up and presently caught sight of one of the woodcocks coming down the wind upon me like a flash in that dim light i could not follow all his movements as he zigzagged through the naked treetops indeed i could see him when his wings flitted up now he was passing mebang and a flick of the wing i had missed him bang again surely he was down no there he went to my left  cock to you i shouted stepping forward so as to get quatermain between me and the faint angry light of the dying day for i wanted to see if he would wipe my eye i knew him to be a wonderful shot but i thought that cock would puzzle him  i saw him raise his gun ever so little and bend forward and at that moment out flashed two woodcocks into the open the one i had missed to his right and the other to his left  at the same time a fresh shout arose of woodcock over and looking down the spinney i saw a third bird high up in the air being blown along like a brown and whirling leaf straight over quatermains head and then followed the prettiest little bit of shooting that i ever saw the bird to the right was flying low not ten yards from the line of a hedgerow and quatermain took him first because he would become invisible the soonest of any indeed nobody who had not his hawks eyes could have seen to shoot at all but he saw the bird well enough to kill it dead as a stone then turning sharply he pulled on the second bird at about fortyfive yards and over he went by this time the third woodcock was nearly over him and flying very high straight down the wind a hundred feet up or more i should say i saw him glance at it as he opened his gun threw out the right cartridge and slipped in another turning round as he did so by this time the cock was nearly fifty yards away from him and travelling like a flash lifting his gun he fired after it and wonderful as the shot was killed it dead a tearing gust of wind caught the dead bird and blew it away like a leaf torn from an oak so that it fell a hundred and thirty yards off or more  i say quatermain i said to him when the beaters were up do you often do this sort of thing  well he answered with a dry smile the last time i had to load three shots as quickly as that was at rather larger game it was at elephants i killed them all three as dead as i killed those woodcocks but it very nearly went the other way i can tell you i mean that they very nearly killed me  just at that moment the keeper came up did you happen to get one of them there cocks sir he said with the air of a man who did not in the least expect an answer in the affirmative  well yes jeffries answered quatermain you will find one of them by the hedge and another about fifty yards out by the plough there to the left  the keeper had turned to go looking a little astonished when quatermain called him back  stop a bit jeffries he said you see that pollard about one hundred and forty yards off well there should be another woodcock down in a line with it about sixty paces out in the field  well if that beant the very smartest bit of shooting murmured jeffries and departed  after that we went home and in due course sir henry curtis and captain good arrived for dinner the latter arrayed in the tightest and most ornamental dresssuit i ever saw i remember that the waistcoat was adorned with five pink coral buttons  it was a very pleasant dinner old quatermain was in an excellent humour induced i think by the recollection of his triumph over the doubting jeffries good too was full of anecdotes he told us a most miraculous story of how he once went shooting ibex in kashmir these ibex according to good he stalked early and late for four entire days at last on the morning of the fifth day he succeeded in getting within range of the flock which consisted of a magnificent old ram with horns so long that i am afraid to mention their measure and five or six females good crawled upon his stomach painfully taking shelter behind rocks till he was within two hundred yards then he drew a fine bead upon the old ram at this moment however a diversion occurred some wandering native of the hills appeared upon a distant mountain top the females turned and rushing over a rock vanished from goods ken but the old ram took a bolder course in front of him stretched a mighty crevasse at least thirty feet in width he went at it with a bound whilst he was in midair good fired and killed him dead the ram turned a complete somersault in space and fell in such fashion that his horns hooked themselves upon a big projection of the opposite cliffs there he hung till good after a long and painful d√©tour gracefully dropped a lasso over him and fished him up  this moving tale of wild adventure was received with undeserved incredulity  well said good if you fellows wont believe my story when i tell ita perfectly true story mindperhaps one of you will give us a better im not particular if it is true or not and he lapsed into a dignified silence  now quatermain i said dont let good beat you let us hear how you killed those elephants you were talking about this evening just after you shot the woodcocks  well said quatermain dryly and with something like a twinkle in his brown eyes it is very hard fortune for a man to have to follow on goods spoor indeed if it were not for that running giraffe which as you will remember curtis we saw good bowl over with a martini rifle at three hundred yards i should almost have said that this was an impossible tale  here good looked up with an air of indignant innocence  however he went on rising and lighting his pipe if you fellows like i will spin you a yarn i was telling one of you the other night about those three lions and how the lioness finished my unfortunate voorlooper jimjim the boy whom we buried in the breadbag  well after this little experience i thought that i would settle down a bit so i entered upon a venture with a man who being of a speculative mind had conceived the idea of running a store at pretoria upon strictly cash principles the arrangement was that i should find the capital and he the experience our partnership was not of a long duration the boers refused to pay cash and at the end of four months my partner had the capital and i had the experience after this i came to the conclusion that storekeeping was not in my line and having four hundred pounds left i sent my boy harry to a school in natal and buying an outfit with what remained of the money started upon a big trip  this time i determined to go further afield than i had ever been before so i took a passage for a few pounds in a trading brig that ran between durban and delagoa bay from delagoa bay i marched inland accompanied by twenty porters with the idea of striking up north towards the limpopo and keeping parallel to the coast but at a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles from it for the first twenty days of our journey we suffered a good deal from fever that is my men did for i think that i am fever proof also i was hard put to it to keep the camp in meat for although the country proved to be very sparsely populated there was but little game about indeed during all that time i hardly killed anything larger than a waterbuck and as you know waterbucks flesh is not very appetising food on the twentieth day however we came to the banks of a largish river the gonooroo it was called this i crossed and then struck inland towards a great range of mountains the blue crests of which we could see lying on the distant heavens like a shadow a continuation as i believe of the drakensberg range that skirts the coast of natal from this main range a great spur shoots out some fifty miles or so towards the coast ending abruptly in one tremendous peak this spur i discovered separated the territories of two chiefs named nala and wambe wambes territory being to the north and nalas to the south nala ruled a tribe of bastard zulus called the butiana and wambe a much larger tribe called the matuku which presents marked bantu characteristics for instance they have doors and verandahs to their huts work skins perfectly and wear a waistcloth and not a moocha at this time the butiana were more or less subject to the matuku having been surprised by them some twenty years before and mercilessly slaughtered down the tribe was now recovering itself however and as you may imagine it did not love the matuku  well i heard as i went along that elephants were very plentiful in the dense forests which lie upon the slopes and at the foot of the mountains that border wambes territory also i heard a very ill report of that worthy himself who lived in a kraal upon the side of the mountain which was so strongly fortified as to be practically impregnable it was said that he was the most cruel chief in this part of africa and that he had murdered in cold blood an entire party of english gentlemen who some seven years before had gone into his country to hunt elephants they took an old friend of mine with them as guide john every by name and often had i mourned over his untimely death all the same wambe or no wambe i determined to hunt elephants in his country i never was afraid of natives and i was not going to show the white feather now i am a bit of a fatalist as you fellows know so i came to the conclusion that if it was fated that wambe should send me to join my old friend john every i should have to go and there was an end of it meanwhile i meant to hunt elephants with a peaceful heart  on the third day from the date of our sighting the great peak we found ourselves beneath its shadow still following the course of the river which wound through the forests at the base of the peak we entered the territory of the redoubtable wambe this however was not accomplished without a certain difference of opinion between my bearers and myself for when we reached the spot where wambes boundary was supposed to run the bearers sat down and emphatically refused to go a step further i sat down too and argued with them putting my fatalistic views before them as well as i was able but i could not persuade them to look at the matter in the same light at present they said their skins were whole if they went into wambes country without his leave they would soon be like a watereaten leaf it was very well for me to say that this would be fate fate no doubt might be walking about in wambes country but while they stopped outside they would not meet him  well i said to gobo my head man and what do you mean to do  we mean to go back to the coast macumazahn he answered insolently  do you i replied for my bile was stirred at any rate mr gobo you and one or two others will never get there see here my friend and i took a repeating rifle and sat myself comfortably down resting my back against a treei have just breakfasted and i had as soon spend the day here as anywhere else now if you or any of those men walk one step back from here and towards the coast i shall fire at you and you know that i dont miss  the man fingered the spear he was carryingluckily all my guns were stacked against the treeand then turned as though to walk away the others keeping their eyes fixed upon him all the while i rose and covered him with the rifle and though he kept up a brave appearance of unconcern i saw that he was glancing nervously at me all the time when he had gone about twenty yards i spoke very quietly  now gobo i said come back or i shall fire  of course this was taking a very high hand i had no real right to kill gobo or anybody else because they objected to run the risk of death by entering the territory of a hostile chief but i felt that if i wished to keep up any authority it was absolutely necessary that i should push matters to the last extremity short of actually shooting him so i sat there looking fierce as a lion and keeping the sight of my rifle in a dead line for gobos ribs then gobo feeling that the situation was getting strained gave in  dont shoot boss he shouted throwing up his hand i will come with you  i thought you would i answered quietly you see fate walks about outside wambes country as well as in it  after that i had no more trouble for gobo was the ringleader and when he collapsed the others collapsed also harmony being thus restored we crossed the line and on the following morning i began shooting in good earnest     iia mornings sport  moving some five or six miles round the base of the great peak of which i have spoken we came the same day to one of the fairest bits of african country that i have seen outside of kukuanaland at this spot the mountain spur that runs out at right angles to the great range which stretches its cloudclad length north and south as far as the eye can reach sweeps inwards with a vast and splendid curve this curve measures some fiveandthirty miles from point to point and across its moonlike segment the river flashed a silver line of light on the further side of the river is a measureless sea of swelling ground a natural park covered with great patches of bushsome of them being many square miles in extent these are separated one from another by glades of grass land broken here and there with clumps of timber trees and in some instances by curious isolated koppies and even by single crags of granite that start up into the air as though they were monuments carved by man and not tombstones set by nature over the grave of ages gone on the west this beautiful plain is bordered by the lonely mountain from the edge of which it rolls down toward the fever coast but how far it runs to the north i cannot sayeight days journey according to the natives when it is lost in an untravelled morass  on the hither side of the river the scenery is different along the edge of its banks where the land is flat are green patches of swamp then comes a wide belt of beautiful grass land covered thickly with game and sloping up very gently to the borders of the forest which beginning at about a thousand feet above the level of the plain clothes the mountainside almost to its crest in this forest grow great trees most of them of the yellowwood species some of these trees are so lofty that a bird in their top branches would be out of range of an ordinary shot gun another peculiar thing about them is that they are for the most part covered with a dense growth of the orchilla moss and from this moss the natives manufacture a most excellent deep purple dye with which they stain tanned hides and also cloth when they happen to get any of the latter i do not think that i ever saw anything more remarkable than the appearance of one of these mighty trees festooned from top to bottom with trailing wreaths of this sadhued moss in which the wind whispers gently as it stirs them at a distance it looks like the gray locks of a titan crowned with bright green leaves and here and there starred with the rich bloom of orchids  the night of that day on which i had my little difference of opinion with gobo we camped by the edge of this great forest and on the following morning at daylight i started out shooting as we were short of meat i determined to kill a buffalo of which there were plenty about before looking for traces of elephants not more than half a mile from camp we came across a trail broad as a cartroad evidently made by a great herd of buffaloes which had passed up at dawn from their feeding ground in the marshes to spend the day in the cool air of the uplands this trail i followed boldly for such wind as there was blew straight down the mountainside that is from the direction in which the buffaloes had gone to me about a mile further on the forest began to be dense and the nature of the trail showed me that i must be close to my game another two hundred yards and the bush was so thick that had it not been for the trail we could scarcely have passed through it as it was gobo who carried my eightbore rifle for i had the 570express in my hand and the other two men whom i had taken with me showed the very strongest dislike to going any further pointing out that there was no room to run away i told them that they need not come unless they liked but that i was certainly going on and then growing ashamed they came  another fifty yards and the trail opened into a little glade i knelt down and peeped and peered but no buffalo could i see evidently the herd had broken up herei knew that from the spoorand penetrated the opposite bush in little troops i crossed the glade and choosing one line of spoor followed it for some sixty yards when it became clear to me that i was surrounded by buffaloes and yet so dense was the cover that i could not see any a few yards to my left i could hear one rubbing its horns against a tree while from my right came an occasional low and throaty grunt which told me that i was uncomfortably near an old bull i crept on towards him with my heart in my mouth as gently as though i were walking upon eggs for a bet lifting every little bit of wood in my path and placing it behind me lest it should crack and warn the game after me in single file came my three retainers and i dont know which of them looked the most frightened presently gobo touched my leg i glanced round and saw him pointing slantwise towards the left i lifted my head a little and peeped over a mass of creepers beyond the creepers was a dense bush of sharppointed aloes of that kind of which the leaves project laterally and on the other side of the aloes not fifteen paces from us i made out the horns neck and the ridge of the back of a tremendous old bull i took my eightbore and getting on to my knee prepared to shoot him through the neck taking my chance of cutting his spine i had already covered him as well as the aloe leaves would allow when he gave a kind of sigh and lay down  i looked round in dismay what was to be done now i could not see to shoot him lying down even if my bullet would have pierced the intervening aloeswhich was doubtfuland if i stood up he would either run away or charge me i reflected and came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to lie down also for i did not fancy wandering after other buffaloes in that dense bush if a buffalo lies down it is clear that he must get up again some time so it was only a case of patiencefighting the fight of sit down as the zulus say  accordingly i sat down and lighted a pipe thinking that the smell of it might reach the buffalo and make him get up but the wind was the wrong way and it did not so when it was done i lit another afterwards i had cause to regret that pipe  well we squatted like this for between half and three quarters of an hour till at length i began to grow heartily sick of the performance it was about as dull a business as the last hour of a comic opera i could hear buffaloes snorting and moving all round and see the redbeaked tic birds flying up off their backs making a kind of hiss as they did so something like that of the english misselthrush but i could not see a single buffalo as for my old bull i think he must have slept the sleep of the just for he never even stirred  just as i was making up my mind that something must be done to save the situation my attention was attracted by a curious grinding noise at first i thought that it must be a buffalo chewing the cud but was obliged to abandon the idea because the noise was too loud i shifted myself round and stared through the cracks in the bush in the direction whence the sound seemed to come and once i thought that i saw something gray moving about fifty yards off but could not make certain although the grinding noise still continued i could see nothing more so i gave up thinking about it and once again turned my attention to the buffalo presently however something happened suddenly from about forty yards away there came a tremendous snorting sound more like that made by an engine getting a heavy train under weigh than anything else in the world  by jove i thought turning round in the direction from which the grinding sound had come that must be a rhinoceros and he has got our wind for as you fellows know there is no mistaking the sound made by a rhinoceros when he gets wind of you  another second and i heard a most tremendous crashing noise before i could think what to do before i could even get up the bush behind me seemed to burst asunder and there appeared not eight yards from us the great horn and wicked twinkling eye of a charging rhinoceros he had winded us or my pipe i do not know which and after the fashion of these brutes had charged up the scent i could not rise i could not even get the gun up i had no time all that i was able to do was to roll over as far out of the monsters path as the bush would allow another second and he was over me his great bulk towering above me like a mountain and upon my word i could not get his smell out of my nostrils for a week circumstances impressed it on my memory at least i suppose so his hot breath blew upon my face one of his front feet just missed my head and his hind one actually trod upon the loose part of my trousers and pinched a little bit of my skin i saw him pass over me lying as i was upon my back and next second i saw something else my men were a little behind me and therefore straight in the path of the rhinoceros one of them flung himself backwards into the bush and thus avoided him the second with a wild yell sprung to his feet and bounded like an indiarubber ball right into the aloe bush landing well among the spikes but the third it was my friend gobo could not by any means get away he managed to gain his feet and that was all the rhinoceros was charging with his head low his horn passed between gobos legs and feeling something on his nose he jerked it up away went gobo high into the air he turned a complete somersault at the apex of the curve and as he did so i caught sight of his face it was gray with terror and his mouth was wide open down he came right on to the great brutes back and that broke his fall luckily for him the rhinoceros never turned but crashed straight through the aloe bush only missing the man who had jumped into it by about a yard  then followed a complication the sleeping buffalo on the further side of the bush hearing the noise sprang to his feet and for a second not knowing what to do stood still at that instant the huge rhinoceros blundered right on to him and getting his horn beneath his stomach gave him such a fearful dig that the buffalo was turned over on to his back while his assailant went a most amazing cropper over his carcase in another moment however the rhinoceros was up and wheeling round to the left crashed through the bush downhill and towards the open country  instantly the whole place became alive with alarming sounds in every direction troops of snorting buffaloes charged through the forest wild with fright while the injured bull on the further side of the bush began to bellow like a mad thing i lay quite still for a moment devoutly praying that none of the flying buffaloes would come my way then when the danger lessened i got on to my feet shook myself and looked round one of my boys he who had thrown himself backward into the bush was already half way up a treeif heaven had been at the top of it he could not have climbed quicker gobo was lying close to me groaning vigorously but as i suspected quite unhurt while from the aloe bush into which no 3 had bounded like a tennis ball issued a succession of the most piercing yells  i looked and saw that this unfortunate fellow was in a very tight place a great spike of aloe had run through the back of his skin waistbelt though without piercing his flesh in such a fashion that it was impossible for him to move while within six feet of him the injured buffalo bull thinking no doubt that he was the aggressor bellowed and ramped to get at him tearing the thick aloes with his great horns that no time was to be lost if i wished to save the mans life was very clear so seizing my eightbore which was fortunately uninjured i took a pace to the left for the rhinoceros had enlarged the hole in the bush and aimed at the point of the buffalos shoulder since on account of my position i could not get a fair side shot for the heart as i did so i saw that the rhinoceros had given the bull a tremendous wound in the stomach and that the shock of the encounter had put his left hindleg out of joint at the hip i fired and the bullet striking the shoulder broke it and knocked the buffalo down i knew that he could not get up any more because he was now injured fore and aft so notwithstanding his terrific bellows i scrambled round to where he was there he lay glaring furiously and tearing up the soil with his horns stepping up to within two yards of him i aimed at the vertebra of his neck and fired the bullet struck true and with a thud he dropped his head upon the ground groaned and died  this little matter having been attended to with the assistance of gobo who had now found his feet i went on to extricate our unfortunate companion from the aloe bush this we found a thorny task but at last he was dragged forth uninjured though in a very pious and prayerful frame of mind his spirit had certainly looked that way he said or he would now have been dead as i never like to interfere with true piety i did not venture to suggest that his spirit had deigned to make use of my eightbore in his interest  having despatched this boy back to the camp to tell the bearers to come and cut the buffalo up i bethought me that i owed that rhinoceros a grudge which i should love to repay so without saying a word of what was in my mind to gobo who was now more than ever convinced that fate walked about loose in wambes country i just followed on the brutes spoor he had crashed through the bush till he reached the little glade then moderating his pace somewhat he had followed the glade down its entire length and once more turned to the right through the forest shaping his course for the open land that lies between the edge of the bush and the river having followed him for a mile or so further i found myself quite on the open i took out my glasses and searched the plain about a mile ahead was something brownas i thought the rhinoceros i advanced another quarter of a mile and looked once moreit was not the rhinoceros but a big antheap this was puzzling but i did not like to give it up because i knew from his spoor that he must be somewhere ahead but as the wind was blowing straight from me towards the line that he had followed and as a rhinoceros can smell you for about a mile it would not i felt be safe to follow his trail any further so i made a d√©tour of a mile and more till i was nearly opposite the antheap and then once more searched the plain it was no good i could see nothing of him and was about to give it up and start after some oryx i saw on the skyline when suddenly at a distance of about three hundred yards from the antheap and on its further side i saw my rhino stand up in a patch of grass  heavens i thought to myself hes off again but no after standing staring for a minute or two he once more lay down  now i found myself in a quandary as you know a rhinoceros is a very shortsighted brute indeed his sight is as bad as his scent is good of this fact he is perfectly aware but he always makes the most of his natural gifts for instance when he lies down he invariably does so with his head down wind thus if any enemy crosses his wind he will still be able to escape or attack him and if on the other hand the danger approaches up wind he will at least have a chance of seeing it otherwise by walking delicately one might actually kick him up like a partridge if only the advance was made up wind  well the point was how on earth should i get within shot of this rhinoceros after much deliberation i determined to try a side approach thinking that in this way i might get a shoulder shot accordingly we started in a crouching attitude i first gobo holding on to my coat tails and the other boy on to gobos moocha i always adopt this plan when stalking big game for if you follow any other system the bearers will get out of line we arrived within three hundred yards safely enough and then the real difficulties began the grass had been so closely eaten off by game that there was scarcely any cover consequently it was necessary to go on to our hands and knees which in my case involved laying down the eightbore at every step and then lifting it up again however i wriggled along somehow and if it had not been for gobo and his friend no doubt everything would have gone well but as you have i dare say observed a native out stalking is always of that mind which is supposed to actuate an ostrichso long as his head is hidden he seems to think that nothing else can be seen so it was in this instance gobo and the other boy crept along on their hands and toes with their heads well down but though unfortunately i did not notice it till too late bearing the fundamental portions of their frames high in the air now all animals are quite as suspicious of this end of mankind as they are of his face and of that fact i soon had a proof just when we had got within about two hundred yards and i was congratulating myself that i had not had this long crawl with the sun beating on the back of my neck like a furnace for nothing i heard the hissing note of the rhinoceros birds and up flew four or five of them from the brutes back where they had been comfortably employed in catching tics now this performance on the part of the birds is to a rhinoceros what the word cave is to a schoolboyit puts him on the qui vive at once before the birds were well in the air i saw the grass stir  down you go i whispered to the boys and as i did so the rhinoceros got up and glared suspiciously around but he could see nothing indeed if we had been standing up i doubt if he would have seen us at that distance so he merely gave two or three sniffs and then lay down his head still down wind the birds once more settling on his back  but it was clear to me that he was sleeping with one eye open being generally in a suspicious and unchristian frame of mind and that it was useless to proceed further on this stalk so we quietly withdrew to consider the position and study the ground the results were not satisfactory there was absolutely no cover about except the antheap which was some three hundred yards from the rhinoceros upon his upwind side i knew that if i tried to stalk him in front i should fail and so i should if i attempted to do so from the further sidehe or the birds would see me so i came to a conclusion i would go to the antheap which would give him my wind and instead of stalking him i would let him stalk me it was a bold step and one which i should never advise a hunter to take but somehow i felt as though rhino and i must play the hand out  i explained my intentions to the men who both held up their arms in horror their fears for my safety were a little mitigated however when i told them that i did not expect them to come with me  gobo breathed a prayer that i might not meet fate walking about and the other one sincerely trusted that my spirit might look my way when the rhinoceros charged and then they both departed to a place of safety  taking my eightbore and halfadozen spare cartridges in my pocket i made a d√©tour and reaching the antheap in safety lay down for a moment the wind had dropped but presently a gentle puff of air passed over me and blew on towards the rhinoceros by the way i wonder what it is that smells so strong about a man is it his body or his breath i have never been able to make out but i saw it stated the other day that in the duck decoys the man who is working the ducks holds a little piece of burning turf before his mouth and that if he does this they cannot smell him which looks as though it were the breath well whatever it was about me that attracted his attention the rhinoceros soon smelt me for within half a minute after the puff of wind had passed me he was on his legs and turning round to get his head up wind there he stood for a few seconds and sniffed and then he began to move first of all at a trot then as the scent grew stronger at a furious gallop on he came snorting like a runaway engine with his tail stuck straight up in the air if he had seen me lie down there he could not have made a better line it was rather nervous work i can tell you lying there waiting for his onslaught for he looked like a mountain of flesh i determined however not to fire till i could plainly see his eye for i think that rule always gives one the right distance for big game so i rested my rifle on the antheap and waited for him kneeling at last when he was about forty yards away i saw that the time had come and aiming straight for the middle of the chest i pulled  thud went the heavy bullet and with a tremendous snort over rolled the rhinoceros beneath its shock just like a shot rabbit but if i had thought that he was done for i was mistaken for in another second he was up again and coming at me as hard as ever only with his head held low i waited till he was within ten yards in the hope that he would expose his chest but he would do nothing of the sort so i just had to fire at his head with the left barrel and take my chance well as luck would have it of course the animal put its horn in the way of the bullet which cut clean through it about three inches above the root and then glanced off into space  after that things got rather serious my gun was empty and the rhinoceros was rapidly arriving so rapidly indeed that i came to the conclusion that i had better make way for him accordingly i jumped to my feet and ran to the right as hard as i could go as i did so he arrived full tilt knocked my friendly antheap flat and for the third time that day went a most magnificent cropper this gave me a few seconds start and i ran down windmy word i did run unfortunately however my modest retreat was observed and the rhinoceros as soon as he had found his legs again set to work to run after me now no man on earth can run so fast as an irritated rhinoceros can gallop and i knew that he must soon catch me up but having some slight experience of this sort of thing luckily for myself i kept my head and as i fled i managed to open my rifle get the old cartridges out and put in two fresh ones to do this i was obliged to steady my pace a little and by the time that i had snapped the rifle to i heard the beast snorting and thundering away within a few paces of my back i stopped and as i did so rapidly cocked the rifle and slued round upon my heel by this time the brute was within six or seven yards of me but luckily his head was up i lifted the rifle and fired at him it was a snap shot but the bullet struck him in the chest within three inches of the first and found its way into his lungs it did not stop him however so all i could do was to bound to one side which i did with surprising activity and as he brushed past me to fire the other barrel into his side that did for him the ball passed in behind the shoulder and right through his heart he fell over on to his side gave one more awful squeala dozen pigs could not have made such a noiseand promptly died keeping his wicked eyes wide open all the time  as for me i blew my nose and going up to the rhinoceros sat on his head and reflected that i had done a capital mornings shooting     iiithe first round  after this as it was now midday and i had killed enough meat we marched back triumphantly to camp where i proceeded to concoct a stew of buffalo beef and compressed vegetables when this was ready we ate the stew and then i took a nap about four oclock however gobo woke me up and told me that the head man of one of wambes kraals had arrived to see me i ordered him to be brought up and presently he came a little wizened talkative old man with a waistcloth round his middle and a greasy frayed kaross made of the skins of rock rabbits over his shoulders  i told him to sit down and then abused him roundly what did he mean i asked by disturbing me in this rude way how did he dare to cause a person of my quality and evident importance to be awakened in order to interview his entirely contemptible self  i spoke thus because i knew that it would produce an impression on him nobody except a really great man he would argue would dare to speak to him in that fashion most savages are desperate bullies at heart and look on insolence as a sign of power  the old man instantly collapsed he was utterly overcome he said his heart was split in two and well realized the extent of his misbehaviour but the occasion was very urgent he heard that a mighty hunter was in the neighbourhood a beautiful white man how beautiful he could not have imagined had he not seen this to me and he came to beg his assistance the truth was that three bull elephants such as no man ever saw had for years been the terror of their kraal which was but a small placea cattle kraal of the great chief wambes where they lived to keep the cattle and now of late these elephants had done them much damage but last night they had destroyed a whole patch of mealie land and he feared that if they came back they would all starve next season for want of food would the mighty white man then be pleased to come and kill the elephants it would be easy for him to dooh most easy it was only necessary that he should hide himself in a tree for there was a full moon and then when the elephants appeared he would speak to them with the gun and they would fall down dead and there would be an end of their troubling  of course i hummed and hawed and made a great favour of consenting to his proposal though really i was delighted to have such a chance one of the conditions that i made was that a messenger should at once be despatched to wambe whose kraal was two days journey from where i was telling him that i proposed to come and pay my respects to him in a few days and to ask his formal permission to shoot in his country also i intimated that i was prepared to present him with hongo that is blackmail and that i hoped to do a little trade with him in ivory of which i heard he had a great quantity  this message the old gentleman promised to despatch at once though there was something about his manner which showed me that he was doubtful as to how it would be received after that we struck our camp and moved on to the kraal which we reached about an hour before sunset this kraal was a collection of huts surrounded by a slight thornfence perhaps there were ten of them in all it was situated in a kloof of the mountain down which a rivulet flowed the kloof was densely wooded but for some distance above the kraal it was free from bush and here on the rich deep ground brought down by the rivulet were the cultivated lands in extent somewhere about twenty or twentyfive acres on the kraal side of these lands stood a single hut that served for a mealie store which at the moment was used as a dwellingplace by an old woman the first wife of our friend the head man  it appears that this lady having had some difference of opinion with her husband about the extent of authority allowed to a younger and more amiable wife had refused to dwell in the kraal any more and by way of marking her displeasure had taken up her abode among the mealies as the issue will show she was it happened cutting off her nose to spite her face  close by this hut grew a large baobab tree a glance at the mealie grounds showed me that the old head man had not exaggerated the mischief done by the elephants to his crops which were now getting ripe nearly half of the entire patch was destroyed the great brutes had eaten all they could and the rest they had trampled down i went up to their spoor and started back in amazementnever had i seen such a spoor before it was simply enormous more especially that of one old bull that carried so said the natives but a single tusk one might have used any of the footprints for a hipbath  having taken stock of the position my next step was to make arrangements for the fray the three bulls according to the natives had been spoored into the dense patch of bush above the kloof now it seemed to me very probable that they would return tonight to feed on the remainder of the ripening mealies if so there was a bright moon and it struck me that by the exercise of a little ingenuity i might bag one or more of them without exposing myself to any risk which having the highest respect for the aggressive powers of bull elephants was a great consideration to me  this then was my plan to the right of the huts as you look up the kloof and commanding the mealie lands stands the baobab tree that i have mentioned into that baobab tree i made up my mind to go then if the elephants appeared i should get a shot at them i announced my intentions to the head man of the kraal who was delighted now he said his people might sleep in peace for while the mighty white hunter sat aloft like a spirit watching over the welfare of his kraal what was there to fear  i told him that he was an ungrateful brute to think of sleeping in peace while perched like a wounded vulture on a tree i watched for his welfare in wakeful sorrow and once more he collapsed and owned that my words were sharp but just  however as i have said confidence was completely restored and that evening everybody in the kraal including the superannuated victim of jealousy in the little hut where the mealie cobs were stored went to bed with a sense of sweet security from elephants and all other animals that prowl by night  for my part i pitched my camp below the kraal and then having procured a beam of wood from the head manrather a rotten one by the wayi set it across two boughs that ran out laterally from the baobab tree at a height of about twentyfive feet from the ground in such fashion that i and another man could sit upon it with our legs hanging down and rest our backs against the bole of the tree this done i went back to the camp and ate my supper about nine oclock halfanhour before the moonrise i summoned gobo who thinking that he had seen about enough of the delights of big game hunting for that day did not altogether relish the job and despite his remonstrances gave him my eightbore to carry i having the 570express then we set out for the tree it was very dark but we found it without difficulty though climbing it was a more complicated matter however at last we got up and sat down like two little boys on a form that is too high for them and waited i did not dare to smoke because i remembered the rhinoceros and feared that the elephants might wind the tobacco if they should come my way and this made the business more wearisome so i fell to thinking and wondering at the completeness of the silence  at last the moon came up and with it a moaning wind at the breath of which the silence began to whisper mysteriously lonely enough in the newborn light looked the wide expanse of mountain plain and forest more like some vision of a dream some reflection from a fair world of peace beyond our ken than the mere face of garish earth made soft with sleep indeed had it not been for the fact that i was beginning to find the log on which i sat very hard i should have grown quite sentimental over the beautiful sight but i will defy anybody to become sentimental when seated in the damp on a very rough beam of wood and halfway up a tree so i merely made a mental note that it was a particularly lovely night and turned my attention to the prospect of elephants but no elephants came and after waiting for another hour or so i think that what between weariness and disgust i must have dropped into a gentle doze presently i awoke with a start gobo who was perched close to me but as far off as the beam would allowfor neither white man nor black like the aroma which each vows is the peculiar and disagreeable property of the otherwas faintly very faintly clicking his forefinger against his thumb i knew by this signal a very favourite one among native hunters and gunbearers that he must have seen or heard something i looked at his face and saw that he was staring excitedly towards the dim edge of the bush beyond the deep green line of mealies i stared too and listened presently i heard a soft large sound as though a giant were gently stretching out his hands and pressing back the ears of standing corn then came a pause and then out into the open majestically stalked the largest elephant i ever saw or ever shall see heavens what a monster he was and how the moonlight gleamed upon his one splendid tuskfor the other was missingas he stood among the mealies gently moving his enormous ears to and fro and testing the wind with his trunk while i was still marvelling at his girth and speculating upon the weight of that huge tusk which i swore should be my tusk before very long out stepped a second bull and stood beside him he was not quite so tall but he seemed to me to be almost thickerset than the first and even in that light i could see that both his tusks were perfect another pause and the third emerged he was shorter than either of the others but higher in the shoulder than no 2 and when i tell you as i afterwards learnt from actual measurement that the smallest of these mighty bulls measured twelve feet one and a half inches at the shoulder it will give you some idea of their size the three formed into line and stood still for a minute the onetusked bull gently caressing the elephant on the left with his trunk  then they began to feed walking forward and slightly to the right as they gathered great bunches of the sweet mealies and thrust them into their mouths all this time they were more than a hundred and twenty yards away from me this i knew because i had paced the distances from the tree to various points much too far to allow of my attempting a shot at them in that uncertain light they fed in a semicircle gradually drawing round towards the hut near my tree in which the corn was stored and the old woman slept  this went on for between an hour and an hour and a half till what between excitement and hope that maketh the heart sick i grew so weary that i was actually contemplating a descent from the tree and a moonlight stalk such an act in ground so open would have been that of a stark staring lunatic and that i should even have been contemplating it will show you the condition of my mind but everything comes to him who knows how to wait and sometimes too to him who doesnt and so at last those elephants or rather one of them came to me  after they had fed their fill which was a very large one the noble three stood once more in line some seventy yards to the left of the hut and on the edge of the cultivated lands or in all about eightyfive yards from where i was perched then at last the one with a single tusk made a peculiar rattling noise in his trunk just as though he were blowing his nose and without more ado began to walk deliberately toward the hut where the old woman slept i made my rifle ready and glanced up at the moon only to discover that a new complication was looming in the immediate future i have said that a wind rose with the moon well the wind brought rainclouds along its track several light ones had already lessened the light for a little while though without obscuring it and now two more were coming up rapidly both of them very black and dense the first cloud was small and long and the one behind big and broad i remember noticing that the pair of them bore a most comical resemblance to a dray drawn by a very long rawboned horse as luck would have it just as the elephant arrived within twentyfive yards or so of me the head of the horsecloud floated over the face of the moon rendering it impossible for me to fire in the faint twilight which remained however i could just make out the gray mass of the great brute still advancing towards the hut then the light went altogether and i had to trust to my ears i heard him fumbling with his trunk apparently at the roof of the hut next came a sound as of straw being drawn out and then for a little while there was complete silence  the cloud began to pass i could see the outline of the elephant he was standing with his head quite over the top of the hut but i could not see his trunk and no wonder for it was inside the hut he had thrust it through the roof and attracted no doubt by the smell of the mealies was groping about with it inside it was growing light now and i got my rifle ready when suddenly there was a most awful yell and i saw the trunk reappear and in its mighty fold the old woman who had been sleeping in the hut out she came through the hole like a periwinkle on the point of a pin still wrapped up in her blanket and with her skinny arms and legs stretched to the four points of the compass and as she did so gave that most alarming screech i really dont know who was the most frightened she or i or the elephant at any rate the last was considerably startled he had been fishing for mealiesthe old woman was a mere accident and one that greatly discomposed his nerves he gave a sort of trumpet and threw her away from him right into the crown of a low mimosa tree where she stuck shrieking like a metropolitan engine the old bull lifted his tail and flapping his great ears prepared for flight i put up my eightbore and aiming hastily at the point of his shoulder for he was broadside on i fired the report rang out like thunder making a thousand echoes in the quiet hills i saw him go down all of a heap as though he were stone dead then alas whether it was the kick of the heavy rifle or the excited bump of that idiot gobo or both together or merely an unhappy coincidence i do not know but the rotten beam broke and i went down too landing flat at the foot of the tree upon a certain humble portion of the human frame the shock was so severe that i felt as though all my teeth were flying through the roof of my mouth but although i sat slightly stunned for a few seconds luckily for me i fell light and was not in any way injured  meanwhile the elephant began to scream with fear and fury and attracted by his cries the other two charged up i felt for my rifle it was not there then i remembered that i had rested it on a fork of the bough in order to fire and doubtless there it remained my position was now very unpleasant i did not dare to try and climb the tree again which shaken as i was would have been a task of some difficulty because the elephants would certainly see me and gobo who had clung to a bough was still aloft with the other rifle i could not run because there was no shelter near under these circumstances i did the only thing feasible clambered round the trunk as softly as possible and keeping one eye on the elephants whispered to gobo to bring down the rifle and awaited the development of the situation i knew that if the elephants did not see mewhich luckily they were too enraged to dothey would not smell me for i was upwind gobo however either did not or preferring the safety of the tree would not hear me he said the former but i believed the latter for i knew that he was not enough of a sportsman to really enjoy shooting elephants by moonlight in the open so there i was behind my tree dismayed unarmed but highly interested for i was witnessing a remarkable performance  when the two other bulls arrived the wounded elephant on the ground ceased to scream but began to make a low moaning noise and to gently touch the wound near his shoulder from which the blood was literally spouting the other two seemed to understand at any rate they did this kneeling down on either side they placed their trunks and tusks underneath him and aided by his own efforts with one great lift got him on to his feet then leaning against him on either side to support him they marched off at a walk in the direction of the village it was a pitiful sight and even then it made me feel a brute        the editor would have been inclined to think that in      relating this incident mr quatermain was making himself      interesting at the expense of the exact truth did it not      happen that a similar incident has come within his      knowledgeeditor  presently from a walk as the wounded elephant gathered himself together a little they broke into a trot and after that i could follow them no longer with my eyes for the second black cloud came up over the moon and put her out as an extinguisher puts out a dip i say with my eyes but my ears gave me a very fair notion of what was going on when the cloud came up the three terrified animals were heading directly for the kraal probably because the way was open and the path easy i fancy that they grew confused in the darkness for when they came to the kraal fence they did not turn aside but crashed straight through it then there were times as the irish servantgirl says in the american book having taken the fence they thought that they might as well take the kraal also so they just ran over it one hiveshaped hut was turned quite over on to its top and when i arrived upon the scene the people who had been sleeping there were bumbling about inside like bees disturbed at night while two more were crushed flat and a third had all its side torn out oddly enough however nobody was hurt though several people had a narrow escape of being trodden to death  on arrival i found the old head man in a state painfully like that favoured by greek art dancing about in front of his ruined abodes as vigorously as though he had just been stung by a scorpion  i asked him what ailed him and he burst out into a flood of abuse he called me a wizard a sham a fraud a bringer of bad luck i had promised to kill the elephants and i had so arranged things that the elephants had nearly killed him etc  this still smarting or rather aching as i was from that most terrific bump was too much for my feelings so i just made a rush at my friend and getting him by the ear i banged his head against the doorway of his own hut which was all that was left of it  you wicked old scoundrel i said you dare to complain about your own trifling inconveniences when you gave me a rotten beam to sit on and thereby delivered me to the fury of the elephant bump bump bump when your own wife bump has just been dragged out of her hut bump like a snail from its shell and thrown by the earthshaker into a tree bump bump  mercy my father mercy gasped the old fellow truly i have done amissmy heart tells me so  i should hope it did you old villain bump  mercy great white man i thought the log was sound but what says the unequalled chiefis the old woman my wife indeed dead ah if she is dead all may yet prove to have been for the very best and he clasped his hands and looked up piously to heaven in which the moon was once more shining brightly  i let go his ear and burst out laughing the whole scene and his devout aspirations for the decease of the partner of his joys or rather woes were so intensely ridiculous  no you old iniquity i answered i left her in the top of a thorntree screaming like a thousand bluejays the elephant put her there  alas alas he said surely the back of the ox is shaped to the burden doubtless my father she will come down when she is tired and without troubling himself further about the matter he began to blow at the smouldering embers of the fire  and as a matter of fact she did appear a few minutes later considerably scratched and startled but none the worse  after that i made my way to my little camp which fortunately the elephants had not walked over and wrapping myself up in a blanket was soon fast asleep  and so ended my first round with those three elephants     ivthe last round  on the morrow i woke up full of painful recollections and not without a certain feeling of gratitude to the powers above that i was there to wake up yesterday had been a tempestuous day indeed what between buffalo rhinoceros and elephant it had been very tempestuous having realized this fact i next bethought me of those magnificent tusks and instantly early as it was broke the tenth commandment i coveted my neighbours tusks if an elephant could be said to be my neighbour de jure as certainly so recently as the previous night he had been de factoa much closer neighbour than i cared for indeed now when you covet your neighbours goods the best thing if not the most moral thing to do is to enter his house as a strong man armed and take them i was not a strong man but having recovered my eightbore i was armed and so was the other strong manthe elephant with the tusks consequently i prepared for a struggle to the death in other words i summoned my faithful retainers and told them that i was now going to follow those elephants to the edge of the world if necessary they showed a certain bashfulness about the business but they did not gainsay me because they dared not ever since i had prepared with all due solemnity to execute the rebellious gobo they had conceived a great respect for me  so i went up to bid adieu to the old head man whom i found alternately contemplating the ruins of his kraal and with the able assistance of his last wife thrashing the jealous lady who had slept in the mealie hut because she was as he declared the fount of all his sorrows  leaving them to work a way through their domestic differences i levied a supply of vegetable food from the kraal in consideration of services rendered and left them with my blessing i do not know how they settled matters because i have not seen them since  then i started on the spoor of the three bulls for a couple of miles or so below the kraalas far indeed as the belt of swamp that borders the riverthe ground is at this spot rather stony and clothed with scattered bushes rain had fallen towards the daybreak and this fact together with the nature of the soil made spooring a very difficult business the wounded bull had indeed bled freely but the rain had washed the blood off the leaves and grass and the ground being so rough and hard did not take the footmarks so clearly as was convenient however we got along though slowly partly by the spoor and partly by carefully lifting leaves and blades of grass and finding blood underneath them for the blood gushing from a wounded animal often falls upon their inner surfaces and then of course unless the rain is very heavy it is not washed away it took us something over an hour and a half to reach the edge of the marsh but once there our task became much easier for the soft soil showed plentiful evidences of the great brutes passage threading our way through the swampy land we came at last to a ford of the river and here we could see where the poor wounded animal had lain down in the mud and water in the hope of easing himself of his pain and could see also how his two faithful companions had assisted him to rise again we crossed the ford and took up the spoor on the further side and followed it into the marshlike land beyond no rain had fallen on this side of the river and the bloodmarks were consequently much more frequent  all that day we followed the three bulls now across open plains and now through patches of bush they seemed to have travelled on almost without stopping and i noticed that as they went the wounded bull recovered his strength a little this i could see from his spoor which had become firmer and also from the fact that the other two had ceased to support him at last evening closed in and having travelled some eighteen miles we camped thoroughly tired out  before dawn on the following day we were up and the first break of light found us once more on the spoor about halfpast five oclock we reached the place where the elephants had fed and slept the two unwounded bulls had taken their fill as the condition of the neighbouring bushes showed but the wounded one had eaten nothing he had spent the night leaning against a goodsized tree which his weight had pushed out of the perpendicular they had not long left this place and could not be very far ahead especially as the wounded bull was now again so stiff after his nights rest that for the first few miles the other two had been obliged to support him but elephants go very quick even when they seem to be travelling slowly for shrub and creepers that almost stop a mans progress are no hindrance to them the three had now turned to the left and were travelling back again in a semicircular line toward the mountains probably with the idea of working round to their old feeding grounds on the further side of the river  there was nothing for it but to follow their lead and accordingly we followed with industry through all that long hot day did we tramp passing quantities of every sort of game and even coming across the spoor of other elephants but in spite of my mens entreaties i would not turn aside after these i would have those mighty tusks or none  by evening we were quite close to our game probably within a quarter of a mile but the bush was dense and we could see nothing of them so once more we must camp thoroughly disgusted with our luck that night just after the moon rose while i was sitting smoking my pipe with my back against a tree i heard an elephant trumpet as though something had startled it and not three hundred yards away i was very tired but my curiosity overcame my weariness so without saying a word to any of the men all of whom were asleep i took my eightbore and a few spare cartridges and steered toward the sound the game path which we had been following all day ran straight on in the direction from which the elephant had trumpeted it was narrow but well trodden and the light struck down upon it in a straight white line i crept along it cautiously for some two hundred yards when it opened suddenly into a most beautiful glade some hundred yards or more in width wherein tall grass grew and flattopped trees stood singly with the caution born of long experience i watched for a few moments before i entered the glade and then i saw why the elephant had trumpeted there in the middle of the glade stood a large maned lion he stood quite still making a soft purring noise and waving his tail to and fro presently the grass about forty yards on the hither side of him gave a wide ripple and a lioness sprang out of it like a flash and bounded noiselessly up to the lion reaching him the great cat halted suddenly and rubbed her head against his shoulder then they both began to purr loudly so loudly that i believe that in the stillness one might have heard them two hundred yards or more away  after a time while i was still hesitating what to do either they got a whiff of my wind or they wearied of standing still and determined to start in search of game at any rate as though moved by a common impulse they bounded suddenly away leap by leap and vanished in the depths of the forest to the left i waited for a little while longer to see if there were any more yellow skins about and seeing none came to the conclusion that the lions must have frightened the elephants away and that i had taken my stroll for nothing but just as i was turning back i thought that i heard a bough break upon the further side of the glade and rash as the act was i followed the sound i crossed the glade as silently as my own shadow on its further side the path went on albeit with many fears i went on too the jungle growth was so thick here that it almost met overhead leaving so small a passage for the light that i could scarcely see to grope my way along presently however it widened and then opened into a second glade slightly smaller than the first and there on the further side of it about eighty yards from me stood the three enormous elephants  they stood thusimmediately opposite and facing me was the wounded onetusked bull he was leaning his bulk against a dead thorntree the only one in the place and looked very sick indeed near him stood the second bull as though keeping a watch over him the third elephant was a good deal nearer to me and broadside on while i was still staring at them this elephant suddenly walked off and vanished down a path in the bush to the right  there are now two things to be doneeither i could go back to the camp and advance upon the elephants at dawn or i could attack them at once the first was of course by far the wiser and safer course to engage one elephant by moonlight and singlehanded is a sufficiently rash proceeding to tackle three was little short of lunacy but on the other hand i knew that they would be on the march again before daylight and there might come another day of weary trudging before i could catch them up or they might escape me altogether  no i thought to myself faint heart never won fair tusk ill risk it and have a slap at them but how i could not advance across the open for they would see me clearly the only thing to do was to creep round in the shadow of the bush and try to come upon them so so i started seven or eight minutes of careful stalking brought me to the mouth of the path down which the third elephant had walked the other two were now about fifty yards from me and the nature of the wall of bush was such that i could not see how to get nearer to them without being discovered i hesitated and peeped down the path which the elephant had followed about five yards in it took a turn round a shrub i thought that i would just have a look behind it and advanced expecting that i should be able to catch a sight of the elephants tail as it happened however i met his trunk coming round the corner it is very disconcerting to see an elephants trunk when you expect to see his tail and for a moment i stood paralyzed almost under the vast brutes head for he was not five yards from me he too halted threw up his trunk and trumpeted preparatory to a charge i was in for it now for i could not escape either to the right or left on account of the bush and i did not dare turn my back so i did the only thing that i could doraised the rifle and fired at the black mass of his chest it was too dark for me to pick a shot i could only brown him as it were  the shot rung out like thunder on the quiet air and the elephant answered it with a scream then dropped his trunk and stood for a second or two as still as though he had been cut in stone i confess that i lost my head i ought to have fired my second barrel but i did not instead of doing so i rapidly opened my rifle pulled out the old cartridge from the right barrel and replaced it but before i could snap the breech to the bull was at me i saw his great trunk fly up like a brown beam and i waited no longer turning i fled for dear life and after me thundered the elephant right into the open glade i ran and then thank heaven just as he was coming up with me the bullet took effect on him he had been shot right through the heart or lungs and down he fell with a crash stone dead  but in escaping from scylla i had run into the jaws of charybdis i heard the elephant fall and glanced round straight in front of me and not fifteen paces away were the other two bulls they were staring about and at that moment they caught sight of me then they came the pair of themcame like thunderbolts and from different angles i had only time to snap my rifle to lift it and fire almost at haphazard at the head of the nearest the unwounded bull  now as you know in the case of the african elephant whose skull is convex and not concave like that of the indian this is always a most risky and very frequently a perfectly useless shot the bullet loses itself in the masses of bone that is all but there is one little vital place and should the bullet happen to strike there it will follow the channel of the nostrilsat least i suppose it is that of the nostrilsand reach the brain and this was what happened in the present casethe ball struck the fatal spot in the region of the eye and travelled to the brain down came the great bull all of a heap and rolled on to his side as dead as a stone i swung round at that instant to face the third the monster bull with one tusk that i had wounded two days before he was already almost over me and in the dim moonlight seemed to tower above me like a house i lifted the rifle and pulled at his neck it would not go off then in a flash as it were i remembered that it was on the halfcock the lock of this barrel was a little weak and a few days before in firing at a cow eland the left barrel had jarred off at the shock of the discharge of the right knocking me backwards with the recoil so after that i had kept it on the halfcock till i actually wanted to fire it  i gave one desperate bound to the right and my lame leg notwithstanding i believe that few men could have made a better jump at any rate it was none too soon for as i jumped i felt the wind made by the tremendous downward stroke of the monsters trunk then i ran for it  i ran like a buck still keeping hold of my gun however my idea so far as i could be said to have any fixed idea was to bolt down the pathway up which i had come like a rabbit down a burrow trusting that he would lose sight of me in the uncertain light i sped across the glade fortunately the bull being wounded could not go full speed but wounded or no he could go quite as fast as i could i was unable to gain an inch and away we went with just about three feet between our separate extremities we were at the other side now and a glance served to show me that i had miscalculated and overshot the opening to reach it now was hopeless i should have blundered straight into the elephant so i did the only thing i could do i swerved like a course hare and started off round the edge of the glade seeking for some opening into which i could plunge this gave me a moments start for the bull could not turn as quickly as i could and i made the most of it but no opening could i see the bush was like a wall we were speeding round the edge of the glade and the elephant was coming up again now he was within about six feet and now as he trumpeted or rather screamed i could feel the fierce hot blast of his breath strike upon my head heavens how it frightened me  we were three parts round the glade now and about fifty yards ahead was the single large dead thorntree against which the bull had been leaning i spurted for it it was my last chance of safety but spurt as i would it seemed hours before i got there putting out my right hand i swung round the tree thus bringing myself face to face with the elephant i had not time to lift the rifle to fire i had barely time to cock it and run sideways and backward when he was on to me crash he came striking the tree full with his forehead it snapped like a carrot about forty inches from the ground fortunately i was clear of the trunk but one of the dead branches struck me on the chest as it went down and swept me to the ground i fell upon my back and the elephant blundered past me as i lay more by instinct than anything else i lifted the rifle with one hand and pulled the trigger it exploded and as i discovered afterwards the bullet struck him in the ribs but the recoil of the heavy rifle held thus was very severe it bent my arm up and sent the butt with a thud against the top of my shoulder and the side of my neck for the moment quite paralyzing me and causing the weapon to jump from my grasp meanwhile the bull was rushing on he travelled for some twenty paces and then suddenly he stopped faintly i reflected that he was coming back to finish me but even the prospect of imminent and dreadful death could not rouse me into action i was utterly spent i could not move  idly almost indifferently i watched his movements for a moment he stood still next he trumpeted till the welkin rang and then very slowly and with great dignity he knelt down at this point i swooned away  when i came to myself again i saw from the moon that i must have been insensible for quite two hours i was drenched with dew and shivering all over at first i could not think where i was when on lifting my head i saw the outline of the onetusked bull still kneeling some fiveandtwenty paces from me then i remembered slowly i raised myself and was instantly taken with a violent sickness the result of overexertion after which i very nearly fainted a second time presently i grew better and considered the position two of the elephants were as i knew dead but how about no 3 there he knelt in majesty in the lonely moonlight the question was was he resting or dead i rose on my hands and knees loaded my rifle and painfully crept a few paces nearer i could see his eye now for the moonlight fell full upon itit was open and rather prominent i crouched and watched the eyelid did not move nor did the great brown body or the trunk or the ear or the tailnothing moved then i knew that he must be dead  i crept up to him still keeping the rifle well forward and gave him a thump reflecting as i did so how very near i had been to being thumped instead of thumping he never stirred certainly he was dead though to this day i do not know if it was my random shot that killed him or if he died from concussion of the brain consequent upon the tremendous shock of his contact with the tree anyhow there he was cold and beautiful he lay or rather knelt as the poet nearly puts it indeed i do not think that i have ever seen a sight more imposing in its way than that of the mighty beast crouched in majestic death and shone upon by the lonely moon  while i stood admiring the scene and heartily congratulating myself upon my escape once more i began to feel sick accordingly without waiting to examine the other two bulls i staggered back to the camp which in due course i reached in safety everybody in it was asleep i did not wake them but having swallowed a mouthful of brandy i threw off my coat and shoes rolled myself up in a blanket and was soon fast asleep  when i woke it was already light and at first i thought that like joseph i had dreamed a dream at that moment however i turned my head and quickly knew that it was no dream for my neck and face were so stiff from the blow of the buttend of the rifle that it was agony to move them i collapsed for a minute or two gobo and another man wrapped up like a couple of monks in their blankets thinking that i was still asleep were crouched over a little fire they had made for the morning was damp and chilly and holding sweet converse  gobo said that he was getting tired of running after elephants which they never caught macumazahn that is myself was without doubt a man of parts and of some skill in shooting but also he was a fool none but a fool would run so fast and far after elephants which it was impossible to catch when they kept cutting the spoor of fresh ones he certainly was a fool but he must not be allowed to continue in his folly and he gobo had determined to put a stop to it he should refuse to accompany him any further on so mad a hunt  yes the other answered the poor man certainly was sick in his head and it was quite time that they checked his folly while they still had a patch of skin left upon their feet moreover he for his part certainly did not like this country of wambes which really was full of ghosts only the last night he had heard the spooks at workthey were out shooting at least it sounded as though they were it was very queer but perhaps their lunatic of a master  gobo you scoundrel i shouted out at this juncture sitting bolt upright on the blankets stop idling there and make me some coffee  up sprang gobo and his friend and in half a moment were respectfully skipping about in a manner that contrasted well with the lordly contempt of their previous conversation but all the time they were in earnest in what they said about hunting the elephants any further for before i had finished my coffee they came to me in a body and said that if i wanted to follow those elephants i must follow them myself for they would not go  i argued with them and affected to be much put out the elephants were close at hand i said i was sure of it i had heard them trumpet in the night  yes answered the men mysteriously they too had heard things in the night things not nice to hear they had heard the spooks out shooting and no longer would they remain in a country so vilely haunted  it was nonsense i replied if ghosts went out shooting surely they would use airguns and not black powder and one would not hear an airgun well if they were cowards and would not come of course i could not force them to but i would make a bargain with them they should follow those elephants for one halfhour more then if we failed to come upon them i would abandon the pursuit and we would go straight to wambe chief of the matuku and give him hongo  to this compromise the men agreed readily accordingly about halfanhour later we struck our camp and started and notwithstanding my aches and bruises i do not think that i ever felt in better spirits in my life it is something to wake up in the morning and remember that in the dead of the night singlehanded one has given battle to and overthrown three of the largest elephants in africa slaying them with three bullets such a feat to my knowledge had never been done before and on that particular morning i felt a very tall man of my hands indeed the only thing i feared was that should i ever come to tell the story nobody would believe it for when a strange tale is told by a hunter people are apt to think it is necessarily a lie instead of being only probably so        for the satisfaction of any who may be so disbelieving      as to take this view of mr quatermains story the editor      may state that a gentleman with whom he is acquainted and      whose veracity he believes to be beyond doubt not long ago      described to him how he chanced to kill four african      elephants with four consecutive bullets two of these      elephants were charging him simultaneously and out of the      four three were killed with the head shot a very uncommon      thing in the case of the african elephanteditor  well we passed on till having crossed the first glade where i had seen the lions we reached the neck of bush that separated it from the second glade where the dead elephants were and here i began to take elaborate precautions amongst others ordering gobo to keep some yards ahead and look out sharp as i thought that the elephants might be about he obeyed my instructions with a superior smile and pushed ahead presently i saw him pull up as though he had been shot and begin to snap his fingers faintly  what is it i whispered  the elephant the great elephant with one tusk kneeling down  i crept up beside him there knelt the bull as i had left him last night and there too lay the other bulls  do these elephants sleep i whispered to the astonished gobo  yes macumazahn they sleep  nay gobo they are dead  dead how can they be dead who killed them  what do people call me gobo  they call you macumazahn  and what does macumazahn mean  it means the man who keeps his eyes open the man who gets up in the night  yes gobo and i am that man look you idle lazy cowards while you slept last night i rose and alone i hunted those great elephants and slew them by the moonlight to each of them i gave one bullet and only one and it fell dead look and i advanced into the glade here is my spoor and here is the spoor of the great bull charging after me and there is the tree that i took refuge behind see the elephant shattered it in his charge oh you cowards you who would give up the chase while the blood spoor steamed beneath your nostrils see what i did singlehanded while you slept and be ashamed  ou said the men ou koos koos y umcool chief great chief and then they held their tongues and going up to the three dead beasts gazed upon them in silence  but after that those men looked upon me with awe as being almost more than mortal no mere man they said could have slain those three elephants alone in the nighttime i never had any further trouble with them i believe that if i had told them to jump over a precipice and that they would take no harm they would have believed me  well i went up and examined the bulls such tusks as they had i never saw and never shall see again it took us all day to cut them out and when they reached delagoa bay as they did ultimately though not in my keeping the single tusk of the big bull scaled one hundred and sixty pounds and the four other tusks averaged ninetynine and a half poundsa most wonderful indeed an almost unprecedented lot of ivory unfortunately i was forced to saw the big tusk in two otherwise we could not have carried it        the largest elephant tusk of which the editor has any      certain knowledge scaled one hundred and fifty pounds  oh quatermain you barbarian i broke in here the idea of spoiling such a tusk why i would have kept it whole if i had been obliged to drag it myself  oh yes young man he answered it is all very well for you to talk like that but if you had found yourself in the position which it was my privilege to occupy a few hours afterwards it is my belief that you would have thrown the tusks away altogether and taken to your heels  oh said good so that isnt the end of the yarn a very good yarn quatermain by the wayi couldnt have made up a better one myself  the old gentleman looked at good severely for it irritated him to be chaffed about his stories  i dont know what you mean good i dont see that there is any comparison between a true story of adventure and the preposterous tales which you invent about ibex hanging by their horns no it is not the end of the story the most exciting part is to come but i have talked enough for tonight and if you go on in that way good it will be some time before i begin again  sorry i spoke im sure said good humbly lets have a split to show that there is no illfeeling and they did     vthe message of maiwa  on the following evening we once more dined together and quatermain after some pressure was persuaded to continue his storyfor goods remark still rankled in his breast  at last he went on a few minutes before sunset the task was finished we had laboured at it all day stopping only once for dinner for it is no easy matter to hew out five such tusks as those which now lay before me in a white and gleaming line it was a dinner worth eating too i can tell you for we dined off the heart of the great onetusked bull which was so big that the man whom i sent inside the elephant to look for his heart was forced to remove it in two pieces we cut it into slices and fried it with fat and i never tasted heart to equal it for the meat seemed to melt in ones mouth by the way i examined the jaw of the elephant it never grew but one tusk the other had not been broken off nor was it present in a rudimentary form  well there lay the five beauties or rather four of them for gobo and another man were engaged in sawing the grand one in two at last with many sighs i ordered them to do this but not until by practical experiment i had proved that it was impossible to carry it in any other way one hundred and sixty pounds of solid ivory or rather more in its green state is too great a weight for two men to bear for long across a broken country i sat watching the job and smoking the pipe of contentment when suddenly the bush opened and a very handsome and dignified native girl apparently about twenty years of age stood before me carrying a basket of green mealies upon her head  although i was rather surprised to see a native girl in such a wild spot and so far as i knew a long way from any kraal the matter did not attract my particular notice i merely called to one of the men and told him to bargain with the woman for the mealies and ask her if there were any more to be bought in the neighbourhood then i turned my head and continued to superintend the cutting of the tusk presently a shadow fell upon me i looked up and saw that the girl was standing before me the basket of mealies still on her head  mar√™me mar√™me she said gently clapping her hands together the word mar√™me among these matuku though she was no matuku answers to the zulu koos and the clapping of hands is a form of salutation very common among the tribes of the basutu race  what is it girl i asked her in sisutu are those mealies for sale  no great white hunter she answered in zulu i bring them as a gift  good i replied set them down  a gift for a gift white man  ah i grumbled the old storynothing for nothing in this wicked world what do you wantbeads  she nodded and i was about to tell one of the men to go and fetch some from one of the packs when she checked me  a gift from the givers own hand is twice a gift she said and i thought that she spoke meaningly  you mean that you want me to give them to you myself  surely  i rose to go with her how is it that being of the matuku you speak in the zulu tongue i asked suspiciously  i am not of the matuku she answered as soon as we were out of hearing of the men i am of the people of nala whose tribe is the butiana tribe and who lives there and she pointed over the mountain also i am one of the wives of wambe and her eyes flashed as she said the name  and how did you come here  on my feet she answered laconically  we reached the packs and undoing one of them i extracted a handful of beads now i said a gift for a gift hand over the mealies  she took the beads without even looking at them which struck me as curious and setting the basket of mealies on the ground emptied it  at the bottom of the basket were some curiouslyshaped green leaves rather like the leaves of the guttapercha tree in shape only somewhat thicker and of a more fleshy substance as though by hazard the girl picked one of these leaves out of the basket and smelt it then she handed it to me i took the leaf and supposing that she wished me to smell it also was about to oblige her by doing so when my eye fell upon some curious red scratches on the green surface of the leaf  ah said the girl whose name by the way was maiwa speaking beneath her breath read the signs white man  without answering her i continued to stare at the leaf it had been scratched or rather written upon with a sharp tool such as a nail and wherever this instrument had touched it the acid juice oozing through the outer skin had turned a rusty blood colour presently i found the beginning of the scrawl and read this in english and covering the surface of the leaf and of two others that were in the basket  i hear that a white man is hunting in the matuku country this is to warn him to fly over the mountain to nala wambe sends an impi at daybreak to eat him up because he has hunted before bringing hongo for gods sake whoever you are try to help me i have been the slave of this devil wambe for nearly seven years and am beaten and tortured continually he murdered all the rest of us but kept me because i could work iron maiwa his wife takes this she is flying to nala her father because wambe killed her child try to get nala to attack wambe maiwa can guide them over the mountain you wont come for nothing for the stockade of wambes private kraal is made of elephants tusks for gods sake dont desert me or i shall kill myself i can bear this no longer  john every  great heavens i gasped everywhy it must be my old friend the girl or rather the woman maiwa pointed to the other side of the leaf where there was more writing it ran thusi have just heard that the white man is called macumazahn if so it must be my friend quatermain pray heaven it is for i know he wont desert an old chum in such a fix as i am it isnt that im afraid of dying i dont care if i die but i want to get a chance at wambe first  no old boy thought i to myself it isnt likely that i am going to leave you there while there is a chance of getting you out i have played fox before nowtheres still a double or two left in me i must make a plan thats all and then theres that stockade of tusks i am not going to leave that either then i spoke to the woman  you are called maiwa  it is so  you are the daughter of nala and the wife of wambe  it is so  you fly from wambe to nala  i do  why do you fly stay i would give an orderand calling to gobo i ordered him to get the men ready for instant departure the woman who as i have said was quite young and very handsome put her hand into a little pouch made of antelope hide which she wore fastened round the waist and to my horror drew from it the withered hand of a child which evidently had been carefully dried in the smoke  i fly for this cause she answered holding the poor little hand towards me see now i bore a child wambe was its father and for eighteen months the child lived and i loved it but wambe loves not his children he kills them all he fears lest they should grow up to slay one so wicked and he would have killed this child also but i begged its life one day some soldiers passing the hut saw the child and saluted him calling him the chief who soon shall be wambe heard and was mad he smote the babe and it wept then he said that it should weep for good cause among the things that he had stolen from the white men whom he slew is a trap that will hold lions so strong is the trap that four men must stand on it two on either side before it can be opened   here old quatermain broke off suddenly  look here you fellows he said i cant bear to go on with this part of the story because i never could stand either seeing or talking of the sufferings of children you can guess what that devil did and what the poor mother was forced to witness would you believe it she told me the tale without a tremor in the most matteroffact way only i noticed that her eyelid quivered all the time  well i said as unconcernedly as though i had been talking of the death of a lamb though inwardly i was sick with horror and boiling with rage and what do you mean to do about the matter maiwa wife of wambe  i mean to do this white man she answered drawing herself up to her full height and speaking in tones as hard as steel and cold as icei mean to work and work and work to bring this to pass and to bring that to pass until at length it comes to pass that with these living eyes i behold wambe dying the death that he gave to his child and my child  well said i answered  ay well said macumazahn well said and not easily forgotten who could forget oh who could forget see where this dead hand rests against my side so once it rested when alive and now though it is dead now every night it creeps from its nest and strokes my hair and clasps my fingers in its tiny palm every night it does this fearing lest i should forget oh my child my child ten days ago i held thee to my breast and now this alone remains of thee and she kissed the dead hand and shivered but never a tear did she weep  see now she went on the white man the prisoner at wambes kraal he was kind to me he loved the child that is dead yes he wept when its father slew it and at the risk of his life told wambe my husbandah yes my husbandthat which he is he too it was who made a plan he said to me go maiwa after the custom of thy people go purify thyself in the bush alone having touched a dead one say to wambe thou goest to purify thyself alone for fifteen days according to the custom of thy people then fly to thy father nala and stir him up to war against wambe for the sake of the child that is dead this then he said and his words seemed good to me and that same night ere i left to purify myself came news that a white man hunted in the country and wambe being mad with drink grew very wrath and gave orders that an impi should be gathered to slay the white man and his people and seize his goods then did the smiter of iron every write the message on the green leaves and bid me seek thee out and show forth the matter that thou mightest save thyself by flight and behold this thing have i done macumazahn the hunter the slayer of elephants  ah i said i thank you and how many men be there in the impi of wambe  a hundred of men and half a hundred  and where is the impi  there to the north it follows on thy spoor i saw it pass yesterday but myself i guessed that thou wouldst be nigher to the mountain and came this way and found thee tomorrow at the daybreak the slayers will be here  very possibly i thought to myself but they wont find macumazahn i have half a mind to put some strychnine into the carcases of those elephants for their especial benefit though i knew that they would stop to eat the elephants as indeed they did to our great gain but i abandoned the idea of poisoning them because i was rather short of strychnine  or because you did not like to play the trick quatermain i suggested with a laugh  i said because i had not enough strychnine it would take a great deal of strychnine to poison three elephants effectually answered the old gentleman testily  i said nothing further but i smiled knowing that old allan could never have resorted to such an artifice however severe his strait but that was his way he always made himself out to be a most unmerciful person   well he went on at that moment gobo came up and announced that we were ready to march i am glad that you are ready i said because if you dont march and march quick you will never march again that is all wambe has an impi out to kill us and it will be here presently  gobo turned positively green and his knees knocked together ah what did i say he exclaimed fate walks about loose in wambes country  very good now all you have to do is to walk a little quicker than he does no no you dont leave those elephant tusks behindi am not going to part with them i can tell you  gobo said no more but hastily directed the men to take up their loads and then asked which way we were to run  ah i said to maiwa which way  there she answered pointing towards the great mountain spur which towered up into the sky some forty miles away separating the territories of nala and wambethere below that small peak is one place where men may pass and one only also it can easily be blocked from above if men pass not there then they must go round the great peak of the mountain two days journey and half a day  and how far is the peak from us  all tonight shall you walk and all tomorrow and if you walk fast at sunset you shall stand on the peak  i whistled for that meant a fiveandforty miles trudge without sleep then i called to the men to take each of them as much cooked elephants meat as he could carry conveniently i did the same myself and forced the woman maiwa to eat some as we went this i did with difficulty for at that time she seemed neither to sleep nor eat nor rest so fiercely was she set on vengeance  then we started maiwa guiding us after going for a halfhour over gradually rising ground we found ourselves on the further edge of a great bushclad depression something like the bottom of a lake this depression through which we had been travelling was covered with bush to a very great extent indeed almost altogether so except where it was pitted with glades such as that wherein i had shot the elephants  at the top of this slope maiwa halted and putting her hand over her eyes looked back presently she touched me on the arm and pointed across the sea of forest towards a comparatively vacant space of country some six or seven miles away i looked and suddenly i saw something flash in the red rays of the setting sun a pause and then another quick flash  what is it i asked  it is the spears of wambes impi and they travel fast she answered coolly  i suppose that my face showed how little i liked the news for she went on  fear not they will stay to feast upon the elephants and while they feast we shall journey we may yet escape  after that we turned and pushed on again till at length it grew so dark that we had to wait for the rising of the moon which lost us time though it gave us rest fortunately none of the men had seen that ominous flashing of the spears if they had i doubt if even i could have kept control of them as it was they travelled faster than i had ever known loaded natives to go before so thoroughpaced was their desire to see the last of wambes country i however took the precaution to march last of all fearing lest they should throw away their loads to lighten themselves or worse still the tusks for these kind of fellows would be capable of throwing anything away if their own skins were at stake if the pious √Üneas whose story you were reading to me the other night had been a mongrel delagoa bay native anchises would have had a poor chance of getting out of troy that is if he was known to have made a satisfactory will  at moonrise we set out again and with short occasional halts travelled till dawn when we were forced to rest and eat starting once more about halfpast five we crossed the river at noon then began the long toilsome ascent through thick bush the same in which i shot the bull buffalo only some twenty miles to the west of that spot and not more than twentyfive miles on the hither side of wambes kraal there were six or seven miles of this dense bush and hard work it was to get through it next came a belt of scattered forest which was easier to pass though in revenge the ground was steeper this was about two miles wide and we passed it by about four in the afternoon above this scattered bush lay a long steep slope of boulderstrewn ground which ran up to the foot of the little peak some three miles away as we emerged footsore and weary on to this inhospitable plain some of the men looking round caught sight of the spears of wambes impi advancing rapidly not more than a mile behind us  at first there was a panic and the bearers tried to throw off their loads and run but i harangued them calling out to them that certainly i would shoot the first man who did so and that if they would but trust in me i would bring them through the mess now ever since i had killed those three elephants singlehanded i had gained great influence over these men and they listened to me so off we went as hard as ever we could gothe members of the alpine club would not have been in it with us we made the boulders burn as a frenchman would say  when we had done about a mile the spears began to emerge from the belt of scattered bush and the whoop of their bearers as they viewed us broke upon our ears quick as our pace had been before it grew much quicker now for terror lent wings to my gallant crew but they were sorely tired and the loads were heavy so that run or rather climb as we would wambes soldiers a scrubbylooking lot of men armed with big spears and small shields but without plumes climbed considerably faster the last mile of that pleasing chase was like a fox hunt we being the fox and always in view what astonished me was the extraordinary endurance and activity shown by maiwa she never even flagged i think that girls muscles must have been made of iron or perhaps it was the strength of her will that supported her at any rate she reached the foot of the peak second poor gobo who was an excellent hand at running away being first  presently i came up panting and glanced at the ascent before us was a wall of rock about one hundred and fifty feet in height upon which the strata were laid so as to form a series of projections sufficiently resembling steps to make the ascent easy comparatively speaking except at one spot where it was necessary to climb over a projecting angle of cliff and bear a little to the left it was not a really difficult place but what made it awkward was that immediately beneath this projection gaped a deep fissure or donga on the brink of which we now stood originally dug out no doubt by the rush of water from the peak and cliff this gulf beneath would be trying to the nerves of a weakheaded climber at the critical point and so it proved in the result the projecting angle once passed the remainder of the ascent was very simple at the summit however the brow of the cliff hung over and was pierced by a single narrow path cut through it by water in such fashion that a single boulder rolled into it at the top would make the cliff quite impassable to men without ropes  at this moment wambes soldiers were about a thousand yards from us so it was evident that we had no time to lose i at once ordered the men to commence the ascent the girl maiwa who was familiar with the pass going first to show them the way accordingly they began to mount with alacrity pushing and lifting their loads in front of them when the first of them led by maiwa reached the projecting angle they put down their loads upon a ledge of rock and clambered over once there by lying on their stomachs upon a boulder they could reach the loads which were held to them by the men beneath and in this way drag them over the awkward place whence they were carried easily to the top  but all of this took time and meanwhile the soldiers were coming up fast screaming and brandishing their big spears they were now within about four hundred yards and several loads together with all the tusks had yet to be got over the rock i was still standing at the bottom of the cliff shouting directions to the men above but it occurred to me that it would soon be time to move before doing so however i thought that it might be well to try and produce a moral effect upon the advancing enemy in my hand i held a winchester repeating carbine but the distance was too great for me to use it with effect so i turned to gobo who was shivering with terror at my side and handing him the carbine took my express from him  the enemy was now about three hundred and fifty yards away and the express was only sighted to three hundred still i knew that it could be trusted for the extra fifty yards running in front of wambes soldiers were two mencaptains i supposeone of them very tall i put up the three hundred yard flap and sitting down with my back against the rock i drew a long breath to steady myself and covered the tall man giving him a full sight feeling that i was on him i pulled and before the sound of the striking bullet could reach my ears i saw the man throw up his arms and pitch forward on to his head his companion stopped dead giving me a fair chance i rapidly covered him and fired the left barrel he turned round once and then sank down in a heap this caused the enemy to hesitatethey had never seen men killed at such a distance before and thought that there was something uncanny about the performance taking advantage of the lull i gave the express back to gobo and slinging the winchester repeater over my back i began to climb the cliff  when we reached the projecting angle all the loads were over but the tusks still had to be passed up and owing to their weight and the smoothness of their surface this was a very difficult task of course i ought to have abandoned the tusks often and often have i since reproached myself for not doing so indeed i think that my obstinacy about them was downright sinful but i was always obstinate about such things and i could not bear the idea of leaving those splendid tusks which had cost me so much pains and danger to come by well it nearly cost me my life also and did cost poor gobo his as will be seen shortly to say nothing of the loss inflicted by my rifle on the enemy when i reached the projection i found that the men with their usual stupidity were trying to hand up the tusks point first now the result of this was that those above had nothing to grip except the round polished surface of the ivory and in the position in which they were this did not give them sufficient hold to enable them to lift the weight i told them to reverse the tusks and push them up so that the rough and hollow ends came to the hands of the men above this they did and the first two were dragged up in safety  at this point looking behind me i saw the matukus streaming up the slope in a rough extended order and not more than a hundred yards away cocking the winchester i turned and opened fire on them i dont quite know how many i missed but i do know that i never shot better in my life i had to keep shifting myself from one enemy to the other firing almost without getting a sight that is by the eye alone after the fashion of the experts who break glass balls but quick as the work was men fell thick and by the time that i had emptied the carbine of its twelve cartridges for the moment the advance was checked i rapidly pushed in some more cartridges and hardly had i done so when the enemy seeing that we were about to escape them altogether came on once more with a tremendous yell by this time the two halves of the single tusk of the great bull alone remained to be passed up i fired and fired as effectively as before but notwithstanding all that i could do some men escaped my hail of bullets and began to ascend the cliff presently my rifle was again empty i slung it over my back and drawing my revolver turned to run for it the attackers being now quite close as i did so a spear struck the cliff close to my head  the last half of the tusk was now vanishing over the rock and i sung out to gobo and the other man who had been pushing it up to vanish after it gobo poor fellow required no second invitation indeed his haste was his undoing he went at the projecting rock with a bound the end of the tusk was still hanging over and instead of grasping the rock he caught at it it twisted in his handhe slippedhe fell with one wild shriek he vanished into the abyss beneath his falling body brushing me as it passed for a moment we stood aghast and presently the dull thud of his fall smote heavily upon our ears poor fellow he had met the fate which as he declared walked about loose in wambes country then with an oath the remaining man sprung at the rock and clambered over it in safety aghast at the awfulness of what had happened i stood still till i saw the great blade of a matuku spear pass up between my feet that brought me to my senses and i began to clamber up the rock like a cat i was half way round it already i had clasped the hand of that brave girl maiwa who came down to help me the men having scrambled forward with the ivory when i felt some one seize my ankle  pull maiwa pull i gasped and she certainly did pull maiwa was a very muscular woman and never before did i appreciate the advantages of the physical development of females so keenly she tugged at my left arm the savage below tugged at my right leg till i began to realize that something must give way ere long luckily i retained my presence of mind like the man who threw his motherinlaw out of the window and carried the mattress downstairs when a fire broke out in his house my right hand was still free and in it i held my revolver which was secured to my wrist by a leather thong the pistol was cocked and i simply pointed it downwards and fired the result was instantaneousand so far as i am concerned most satisfactory the bullet hit the man beneath me somewhere i am sure i dont know where at any rate he let go of my leg and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath to join gobo in another moment i was on the top of the rock and going up the remaining steps like a lamplighter a single other soldier appeared in pursuit but one of my boys at the top fired my elephant gun at him i dont know if he hit him or only frightened him at any rate he vanished whence he came i do know however that he very nearly hit me for i felt the wind of the bullet  another thirty seconds and i and the woman maiwa were at the top of the cliff panting but safe  my men being directed thereto by maiwa had most fortunately rolled up some big boulders which lay about and with these we soon managed to block the passage through the overhanging ridge of rock in such fashion that the soldiers below could not possibly climb over it indeed so far as i could see they did not even try to do sotheir heart was turned to fat as the zulus say  then having rested a few moments we took up the loads including the tusks of ivory that had cost us so dear and in silence marched on for a couple of miles or more till we reached a patch of dense bush and here being utterly exhausted we camped for the night taking the precaution however of setting a guard to watch against any attempt at surprise     vithe plan of campaign  notwithstanding all that we had gone through perhaps indeed on account of it for i was thoroughly worn out i slept that night as soundly as poor gobo round whose crushed body the hy√¶nas would now be prowling rising refreshed at dawn we went on our way towards nalas kraal which we reached at nightfall it is built on open ground after the zulu fashion in a ring fence and with beehive huts the cattle kraal is behind and a little to the left indeed both from their habits and their talk it was easy to see that these butiana belong to that section of the bantu people which since tchakas time has been known as the zulu race we did not see the chief nala that night his daughter maiwa went on to his private huts as soon as we arrived and very shortly afterwards one of his head men came to us bringing a sheep and some mealies and milk with him the chief sent us greeting he said and would see us on the morrow meanwhile he was ordered to bring us to a place of resting where we and our goods should be safe and undisturbed accordingly he led the way to some very good huts just outside nalas private enclosure and here we slept comfortably  on the morrow about eight oclock the head man came again and said that nala requested that i would visit him i followed him into the private enclosure and was introduced to the chief a finelooking man of about fifty with very delicatelyshaped hands and feet and a rather nervous mouth the chief was seated on a tanned oxhide outside his hut by his side stood his daughter maiwa and squatted on their haunches round him were some twenty head men or indunas whose number was continually added to by fresh arrivals these men saluted me as i entered and the chief rose and took my hand ordering a stool to be brought for me to sit on when this was done with much eloquence and native courtesy he thanked me for protecting his daughter in the painful and dangerous circumstances in which she found herself placed and also complimented me very highly upon what he was pleased to call the bravery with which i had defended the pass in the rocks i answered in appropriate terms saying that it was to maiwa herself that thanks were due for had it not been for her warning and knowledge of the country we should not have been here today while as to the defence of the pass i was fighting for my life and that put heart into me  these courtesies concluded nala called upon his daughter maiwa to tell her tale to the head men and this she did most simply and effectively she reminded them that she had gone as an unwilling bride to wambethat no cattle had been paid for her because wambe had threatened war if she was not sent as a free gift since she had entered the kraal of wambe her days had been days of heaviness and her nights nights of weeping she had been beaten she had been neglected and made to do the work of a lowborn wifeshe a chiefs daughter she had borne a child and this was the story of the child then amidst a dead silence she told them the awful tale which she had already narrated to me when she had finished her hearers gave a loud ejaculation ou they said ou maiwa daughter of nala  ay she went on with flashing eyes ay it is true my mouth is as full of truth as a flower of honey and for tears my eyes are like the dew upon the grass at dawn it is true i saw the child diehere is the proof of it councillors and she drew forth the little dead hand and held it before them  ou they said again ou it is the dead hand  yes she continued it is the dead hand of my dead child and i bear it with me that i may never forget never for one short hour that i live that i may see wambe die and be avenged will you bear it my father that your daughter and your daughters child should be so treated by a matuku will ye bear it men of my own people  no said an old induna rising it is not to be borne enough have we suffered at the hands of these matuku dogs and their loudtongued chief let us put it to the issue  it is not to be borne indeed said nala but how can we make head against so great a people  ask of himask of macumazahn the wise white man said maiwa pointing at me  how can we overcome wambe macumazahn the hunter  how does the jackal overreach the lion nala  by cleverness macumazahn  so shall you overcome wambe nala  at this moment an interruption occurred a man entered and said that messengers had arrived from wambe  what is their message asked nala  they come to ask that thy daughter maiwa be sent back and with her the white hunter  how shall i make answer to this macumazahn said nala when the man had withdrawn  thus shalt thou answer i said after reflection say that the woman shall be sent and i with her and then bid the messengers be gone stay i will hide myself here in the hut that the men may not see me and i did  shortly afterwards through a crack in the hut i saw the messengers arrive and they were great truculentlooking fellows there were four of them and evidently they had travelled night and day they entered with a swagger and squatted down before nala  your business said nala frowning  we come from wambe bearing the orders of wambe to nala his servant answered the spokesman of the party  speak said nala with a curious twitch of his nervouslooking mouth  these are the words of wambe send back the woman my wife who has run away from my kraal and send with her the white man who has dared to hunt in my country without my leave and to slay my soldiers these are the words of wambe  and if i say i will not send them asked nala  then on behalf of wambe we declare war upon you wambe will eat you up he will wipe you out your kraals shall be stamped flatso and with an expressive gesture he drew his hand across his mouth to show how complete would be the annihilation of that chief who dared to defy wambe  these are heavy words said nala let me take counsel before i answer  then followed a little piece of acting that was really very creditable to the untutored savage mind the heralds withdrew but not out of sight and nala went through the show of earnestly consulting his indunas the girl maiwa too flung herself at his feet and appeared to weep and implore his protection while he wrung his hands as though in doubt and tribulation of mind at length he summoned the messengers to draw near and addressed them while maiwa sobbed very realistically at his side  wambe is a great chief said nala and this woman is his wife whom he has a right to claim she must return to him but her feet are sore with walking she cannot come now in eight days from this day she shall be delivered at the kraal of wambe i will send her with a party of my men as for the white hunter and his men i have nought to do with them and cannot answer for their misdeeds they have wandered hither unbidden by me and i will deliver them back whence they came that wambe may judge them according to his law they shall be sent with the girl for you go your ways food shall be given you without the kraal and a present for wambe in atonement of the illdoing of my daughter i have spoken  at first the heralds seemed inclined to insist upon maiwas accompanying them then and there but on being shown the swollen condition of her feet ultimately they gave up the point and departed  when they were well out of the way i emerged from the hut and we went on to discuss the situation and make our plans first of all as i was careful to explain to nala i was not going to give him my experience and services for nothing i heard that wambe had a stockade round his kraal made of elephant tusks these tusks in the event of our succeeding in the enterprise i should claim as my perquisite with the proviso that nala should furnish me with men to carry them down to the coast  to this modest request nala and the head men gave an unqualified and hearty assent the more hearty perhaps because they never expected to get the ivory  the next thing i stipulated was that if we conquered the white man john every should be handed over to me together with any goods which he might claim his cruel captivity was i need hardly say the only reason that induced me to join in so hairbrained an expedition but i was careful from motives of policy to keep this fact in the background nala accepted this condition my third stipulation was that no women or children should be killed this being also agreed to we went on to consider ways and means wambe it appeared was a very powerful petty chief that is he could put at least six thousand fighting men into the field and always had from three to four thousand collected about his kraal which was supposed to be impregnable nala on the contrary at such short notice could not collect more than from twelve to thirteen hundred men though being of the zulu stock they were of much better stuff for fighting purposes than wambes matukus  these odds though large under the circumstances were not overwhelming the real obstacle to our chance of success was the difficulty of delivering a crushing assault against wambes strong place this was it appeared fortified all round with schanses or stone walls and contained numerous caves and koppies in the hillside and at the foot of the mountain which no force had ever been able to capture it is said that in the time of the zulu monarch dingaan a great impi of that kings having penetrated to this district had delivered an assault upon the kraal then owned by a forefather of wambes and been beaten back with the loss of more than a thousand men  having thought the question over i interrogated maiwa closely as to the fortifications and the topographical peculiarities of the spot and not without results i discovered that the kraal was indeed impregnable to a front attack but that it was very slightly defended to the rear which ran up a slope of the mountain indeed only by two lines of stone walls the reason of this was that the mountain is quite impassable except by one secret path supposed to be known only to the chief and his councillors and this being so it had not been considered necessary to fortify it  well i said when she had done and now as to this secret path of thineknowest thou aught of it  ay she answered i am no fool macumazahn knowledge learned is power earned i won the secret of that path  and canst thou guide an impi thereon so that it shall fall upon the town from behind  yes i can do this if only wambes people know not that the impi comes for if they know then they can block the way  so then here is my plan listen nala and say if it be good or if thou hast a better show it forth let messengers go out and summon all thy impi that it be gathered here on the third day from now this being done let the impi led by maiwa march on the morrow of the fourth day and crossing the mountains let it travel along on the other side of the mountains till it come to the place on the further side of which is the kraal of wambe that shall be some three days journey in all then on the night of the third days journey let maiwa lead the impi in silence up the secret path so that it comes to the crest of the mountain that is above the strong place and here let it hide among the rocks        about one hundred and twenty mileseditor  meanwhile on the sixth day from now let one of thy indunas nala bring with him two hundred men that have guns and lead me and my men as prisoners and take also a girl from among the butiana people who by form and face is like unto maiwa and bind her hands and pass by the road on which we came and through the cutting in the cliff on to the kraal of wambe but the men shall take no shields or plumes with them only their guns and one short spear and when they meet the people of wambe they shall say that they come to give up the woman and the white man and his party to wambe and to make atonement to wambe so shall they pass in peace and travelling thus on the evening of the seventh day we shall come to the gates of the place of wambe and nigh the gates there is so says maiwa a koppie very strong and full of rocks and caves but having no soldiers on it except in time of war or at the worst but a few such as can easily be overpowered  this being done at the dawn of day the impi on the mountain behind the town must light a fire and put wet grass on it so that the smoke goes up then at the sight of the smoke we in the koppie will begin to shoot into the town of wambe and all the soldiers will run to kill us but we will hold our own and while we fight the impi shall charge down the mountain side and climb the schanses and put those who defend them to the assegai and then falling upon the town shall surprise it and drive the soldiers of wambe as a wind blows the dead husks of corn this is my plan i have spoken  ou said nala it is good it is very good the white man is cleverer than a jackal yes so shall it be and may the snake of the butiana people stand up upon its tail and prosper the war for so shall we be rid of wambe and the tyrannies of wambe  after that the girl maiwa stood up and once more producing the dreadful little dried hand made her father and several of his head councillors swear by it and upon it that they would carry out the war of vengeance to the bitter end it was a very curious sight to see and by the way the fight that ensued was thereafter known among the tribes of that district as the war of the little hand  the next two days were busy ones for us messengers were sent out and every available man of the butiana tribe was ordered up to a great dance the country was small and by the evening of the second day some twelve hundred and fifty men were assembled with their assegais and shields and a fine hardy troop they were at dawn of the following day the fourth from the departure of the heralds the main impi having been doctored in the usual fashion started under the command of nala himself who knowing that his life and chieftainship hung upon the issue of the struggle wisely determined to be present to direct it with them went maiwa who was to guide them up the secret path of course we were obliged to give them two days start as they had more than a hundred miles of rough country to pass including the crossing of the great mountain range which ran north and south for it was necessary that the impi should make a wide d√©tour in order to escape detection  at length however at dawn on the sixth day i took the road accompanied by my most unwilling bearers who did not at all like the idea of thus putting their heads into the lions mouth indeed it was only the fear of nalas spears together with a vague confidence in myself that induced them to accept the adventure with me also were about two hundred butianas all armed with guns of various kinds for many of these people had guns though they were not very proficient in the use of them but they carried no shields and wore no headdress or armlets indeed every warlike appearance was carefully avoided with our party went also a sister of maiwas though by a different mother who strongly resembled her in face and form and whose mission it was to impersonate the runaway wife  that evening we camped upon the top of the cliff up which we had so barely escaped and next morning at the first breaking of the light we rolled away the stones with which we had blocked the passage some days before and descended to the hillside beneath here the bodies or rather the skeletons of the men who had fallen before my rifle still lay about the matuku soldiers had left their comrades to be buried by the vultures i descended the gully into which poor gobo had fallen and searched for his body but in vain although i found the spot where he and the other man had struck together with the bones of the latter which i recognized by the waistcloth either some beast of prey had carried gobo off or the matuku people had disposed of his remains and also of my express rifle which he carried at any rate i never saw or heard any more of him  once in wambes country we adopted a very circumspect method of proceeding about fifty men marched ahead in loose order to guard against surprise while as many more followed behind the remaining hundred were gathered in a bunch between and in the centre of these men i marched together with the girl who was personating maiwa and all my bearers we were disarmed and some of my men were tied together to show that we were prisoners while the girl had a blanket thrown over her head and moved along with an air of great dejection we headed straight for wambes place which was at a distance of about twentyfive miles from the mountainpass  when we had gone some five miles we met a party of about fifty of wambes soldiers who were evidently on the lookout for us they stopped us and their captain asked where we were going the head man of our party answered that he was conveying maiwa wambes runaway wife together with the white hunter and his men to be given up to wambe in accordance with his command the captain then wanted to know why we were so many to which our spokesman replied that i and my men were very desperate fellows and that it was feared that if we were sent with a smaller escort we should escape and bring disgrace and the wrath of wambe upon their tribe thereon this gentleman the matuku captain began to amuse himself at my expense and mock me saying that wambe would make me pay for the soldiers whom i had killed he would put me into the thing that bites in other words the lion trap and leave me there to die like a jackal caught by the leg i made no answer to this though my wrath was great but pretended to look frightened indeed there was not much pretence about it i was frightened i could not conceal from myself that ours was a most hazardous enterprise and that it was very possible that i might make acquaintance with that lion trap before i was many days older however it seemed quite impossible to desert poor every in his misfortune so i had to go on and trust to providence as i have so often been obliged to do before and since  and now a fresh difficulty arose wambes soldiers insisted upon accompanying us and what is more did all they could to urge us forward as they were naturally anxious to get to the chiefs place before evening but we on the other hand had excellent reasons for not arriving till night was closing in since we relied upon the gloom to cover our advance upon the koppie which commanded the town finally they became so importunate that we were obliged to refuse flatly to move faster alleging as a reason that the girl was tired they did not accept this excuse in good part and at one time i thought that we should have come to blows for there is no love lost between butianas and matukus at last however either from motives of policy or because they were so evidently outnumbered they gave in and suffered us to go our own pace i earnestly wished that they would have added to the obligation by going theirs but this they declined absolutely to do on the contrary they accompanied us every foot of the way keeping up a running fire of allusions to the thing that bites that jarred upon my nerves and discomposed my temper  about halfpast four in the afternoon we came to a neck or ridge of stony ground whence we could see wambes town plainly lying some six or seven miles away and three thousand feet beneath us the town is built in a valley with the exception of wambes own kraal that is situated at the mouth of some caves upon the slope of the opposing mountains over which i hoped to see our impis spears flashing in the morrows light even from where we stood it was easy to see how strongly the place was fortified with schanses and stone walls and how difficult of approach indeed unless taken by surprise it seemed to me quite impregnable to a force operating without cannon and even cannon would not make much impression on rocks and stony koppies filled with caves  then came the descent of the pass and an arduous business it was for the pathif it may be called a pathis almost entirely composed of huge waterworn boulders from the one to the other of which we must jump like so many grasshoppers it took us two hours to climb down and travelling through that burning sun when at last we did reach the bottom i for one was nearly played out shortly afterwards just as it was growing dark we came to the first line of fortifications which consisted of a triple stone wall pierced by a gateway so narrow that a man could hardly squeeze through it we passed this without question being accompanied by wambes soldiers then came a belt of land three hundred paces or more in width very rocky and broken and having no huts upon it here in hollows in this belt the cattle were kraaled in case of danger on the further side were more fortifications and another small gateway shaped like a v and just beyond and through it i saw the koppie we had planned to seize looming up against the line of mountains behind  as we went i whispered my suggestions to our captain with the result that at the second gateway he halted the cavalcade and addressing the captain of wambes soldiers said that we would wait here till we received wambes word to enter the town the other man said that this was well only he must hand over the prisoners to be taken up to the chiefs kraal for wambe was hungry to begin upon them and his heart desired to see the white man at rest before he closed his eyes in sleep and as for his wife surely he would welcome her our leader replied that he could not do this thing because his orders were to deliver the prisoners to wambe at wambes own kraal and they might not be broken how could he be responsible for the safety of the prisoners if he let them out of his hand no they would wait there till wambes word was brought  to this after some demur the other man consented and went away remarking that he would soon be back as he passed me he called out with a sneer pointing as he did so to the fading red in the western skylook your last upon the light white man for the thing that bites lives in the dark  next day it so happened that i shot this man and do you know i think that he is about the only human being who has come to harm at my hands for whom i do not feel sincere sorrow and in a degree remorse     viithe attack  just where we halted ran a little stream of water i looked at it and an idea struck me probably there would be no water on the koppie i suggested this to our captain and acting on the hint he directed all the men to drink what they could and also to fill the seven or eight cooking pots which we carried with us with water then came the crucial moment how were we to get possession of the koppie when the captain asked me i said that i thought that we had better march up and take it and this accordingly we went on to do when we came to the narrow gateway we were as i expected stopped by two soldiers who stood on guard there and asked our business the captain answered that we had changed our minds and would follow on to wambes kraal the soldiers said no we must now wait  to this we replied by pushing them to one side and marching in single file through the gateway which was not distant more than a hundred yards from the koppie while we were getting through the men we had pushed away ran towards the town calling for assistance a call that was promptly responded to for in another minute we saw scores of armed men running hard in our direction so we ran too for the koppie as soon as they understood what we were after which they did not at first owing to the dimness of the light they did their best to get there before us but we had the start of them and with the exception of one unfortunate man who stumbled and fell we were well on to the koppie before they arrived this man they captured and when fighting began on the following morning and he refused to give any information they killed him luckily they had no time to torture him or they would certainly have done so for these matuku people are very fond of torturing their enemies  when we reached the koppie the base of which covers about half an acre of ground the soldiers who had been trying to cut us off halted for they knew the strength of the position this gave us a few minutes before the light had quite vanished to reconnoitre the place we found that it was unoccupied fortified with a regular labyrinth of stone walls and contained three large caves and some smaller ones the next business was to post the soldiers to such advantage as time would allow my own men i was careful to place quite at the top they were perfectly useless from terror and i feared that they might try to escape and give information of our plans to wambe so i watched them like the apple of my eye telling them that should they dare to stir they would be shot  then it grew quite dark and presently out of the darkness i heard a voiceit was that of the leader of the soldiers who had escorted uscalling us to come down we replied that it was too dark to move we should hit our feet against the stones he insisted upon our descending and we flatly refused saying that if any attempt was made to dislodge us we would fire after that as they had no real intention of attacking us in the dark the men withdrew but we saw from the fires which were lit around that they were keeping a strict watch upon our position  that night was a wearing one for we never quite knew how the situation was going to develop fortunately we had some cooked food with us so we did not starve it was lucky however that we drunk our fill before coming up for as i had anticipated there was not a drop of water on the koppie  at length the night wore away and with the first tinge of light i began to go my rounds and stumbling along the stony paths to make things as ready as i could for the attack which i felt sure would be delivered before we were two hours older the men were cramped and cold and consequently lowspirited but i exhorted them to the best of my ability bidding them remember the race from which they sprang and not to show the white feather before a crowd of matuku dogs at length it began to grow light and presently i saw long columns of men advancing towards the koppie they halted under cover at a distance of about a hundred and fifty yards and just as the dawn broke a herald came forward and called to us our captain stood up upon a rock and answered him  these are the words of wambe the herald said come forth from the koppie and give over the evildoers and go in peace or stay in the koppie and be slain  it is too early to come out as yet answered our man in fine diplomatic style when the sun sucks up the mist then we will come out our limbs are stiff with cold  come forth even now said the herald  not if i know it my boy said i to myself but the captain replied that he would come out when he thought proper and not before  then make ready to die said the herald for all the world like the villain of a transpontine piece and majestically stalked back to the soldiers  i made my final arrangements and looked anxiously at the mountain crest a couple of miles or so away from which the mist was now beginning to lift but no column of smoke could i see i whistled for if the attacking force had been delayed or made any mistake our position was likely to grow rather warm we had barely enough water to wet the mouths of the men and when once it was finished we could not hold the place for long in that burning heat  at length just as the sun rose in glory over the heights behind us the matuku soldiers of whom about fifteen hundred were now assembled set up a queer whistling noise which ended in a chant then some shots were fired for the matuku had a few guns but without effect though one bullet passed just by a mans head  now they are going to begin i thought to myself and i was not far wrong for in another minute the body of men divided into three companies each about five hundred strong and heralded by a running fire charged at us on three sides our men were now all well under cover and the fire did us no harm i mounted on a rock so as to command a view of as much of the koppie and plain as possible and yelled to our men to reserve their fire till i gave the word and then to shoot low and load as quickly as possible i knew that like all natives they were sure to be execrable shots and that they were armed with weapons made out of old gaspipes so the only chance of doing execution was to let the enemy get right on to us  on they came with a rush they were within eighty yards now and as they drew near the point of attack i observed that they closed their ranks which was so much the better for us  shall we not fire my father sung out the captain  no confound you i answered  sixty yardsfiftyfortythirty fire you scoundrels i yelled setting the example by letting off both barrels of my elephant gun into the thickest part of the company opposite to me  instantly the place rang out with the discharge of two hundred and odd guns while the air was torn by the passage of every sort of missile from iron pot legs down to slugs and pebbles coated with lead the result was very prompt the matukus were so near that we could not miss them and at thirty yards a leadcoated stone out of a gaspipe is as effective as a martini rifle or more so over rolled the attacking soldiers by the dozen while the survivors fairly frightened took to their heels we plied them with shot till they were out of rangei made it very warm for them with the elephant gun by the wayand then we loaded up in quite a cheerful frame of mind for we had not lost a man whereas i could count more than fifty dead and wounded matukus the only thing that damped my ardour was that stare as i would i could see no column of smoke upon the mountain crest  half an hour elapsed before any further steps were taken against us then the attacking force adopted different tactics seeing that it was very risky to try to rush us in dense masses they opened out into skirmishing order and ran across the open space in lots of five and six as it happened right at the foot of the koppie the ground broke away a little in such fashion that it was almost impossible for us to search it effectually with our fire on the hither side of this dip wambes soldiers were now congregating in considerable numbers of course we did them as much damage as we could while they were running across but this sort of work requires good shots and that was just what we had not got another thing was that so many of our men would insist upon letting off the things they called guns at every little knot of the enemy that ran across thus the first few lots were indeed practically swept away but after that as it took a long while to load the gaspipes and old flint muskets those who followed got across in comparative safety for my own part i fired away with the elephant gun and repeating carbine till they grew almost too hot to hold but my individual efforts could do nothing to stop such a rush or perceptibly to lessen the number of our enemies  at length there were at least a thousand men crowded into the dip of ground within a few yards of us whence those of them who had guns kept up a continued fusillade upon the koppie they killed two of my bearers in this way and wounded a third for being at the top of the koppie these men were most exposed to the fire from the dip at its base seeing that the situation was growing most serious at length by the dint of threats and entreaties i persuaded the majority of our people to cease firing useless shots to reload and prepare for the rush scarcely had i done so when the enemy came for us with a roar i am bound to say that i should never have believed that matukus had it in them to make such a determined charge a large party rushed round the base of the koppie and attacked us in flank while the others swarmed wherever they could get a foothold so that we were taken on every side  fire i cried and we did with terrible effect many of their men fell but though we checked we could not stop them they closed up and rushed the first fortification killing a good number of its defenders it was almost all cold steel work now for we had no time to reload and that suited the butiana habits of fighting well enough for the stabbing assegai is a weapon which they understand those of our people who escaped from the first line of walls took refuge in the second where i stood myself encouraging them and there the fight raged fiercely occasionally parties of the enemy would force a passage only to perish on the hither side beneath the butiana spears but still they kept it up and i saw that fight as we would we were doomed we were altogether outnumbered and to make matters worse fresh bodies of soldiers were pouring across the plain to the assistance of our assailants so i made up my mind to direct a retreat into the caves and there expire in a manner as heroic as circumstances would allow and while mentally lamenting my hard fate and reflecting on my sins i fought away like a fiend it was then i remember that i shot my friend the captain of our escort of the previous day he had caught sight of me and making a vicious dig at my stomach with a spear which i successfully dodged shouted out or rather began to shout out one of his unpleasant allusions to the thing that he never got as far as bites because i shot him after that  well the game was about up already i saw one man throw down his spear in token of surrenderwhich act of cowardice cost him his life by the waywhen suddenly a shout arose  look at the mountain they cried there is an impi on the mountain side  i glanced up and there sure enough about halfway down the mountain nearing the first fortification the longplumed double line of nalas warriors was rushing down to battle the bright light of the morning glancing on their spears afterwards we discovered that the reason of their delay was that they had been stopped by a river in flood and could not reach the mountain crest by dawn when they did reach it however they saw instantly that the fight was already going on was in flower as they put it and so advanced at once without waiting to light signalfires  meanwhile they had been observed from the town and parties of soldiers were charging up the steep side of the hill to occupy the schanses and the second line of fortifications behind them the first line they did not now attempt to reach or defend nala pressed them too close but they got to the schanses or pits protected with stone walls and constructed to hold from a dozen to twenty men and soon began to open fire from them and from isolated rocks i turned my eyes to the gates of the town which were placed to the north and south already they were crowded with hundreds of fugitive women and children flying to the rocks and caves for shelter from the foe  as for ourselves the appearance of nalas impi produced a wonderful change for the better in our position the soldiers attacking us turned realizing that the town was being assailed from the rear and clambering down the koppie streamed off to protect their homes against this new enemy in five minutes there was not a man left except those who would move no more or were too sorely wounded to escape i felt inclined to ejaculate saved like the gentleman in the play but did not because the occasion was too serious what i did do was to muster all the men and reckon up our losses they amounted to fiftyone killed and wounded sixteen men having been killed outright then i sent men with the cookingpots to the stream of water and we drank this done i set my bearers being the most useless part of the community from a fighting point of view to the task of attending the injured and turned to watch the fray  by this time nalas impi had climbed the first line of fortifications without opposition and was advancing in a long line upon the schanses or pits which were scattered about between it and the second line singing a war chant as it came presently puffs of smoke began to start from the schanses and with my glasses i could see several of our men falling over then as they came opposite a schanse that portion of the long line of warriors would thicken up and charge it with a wild rush i could see them leap on to the walls and vanish into the depths beneath some of their number falling backward on each occasion shot or stabbed to death  next would come another act in the tragedy out from the hither side of the schanse would pour such of its defenders as were left alive perhaps three or four and perhaps a dozen running for dear life with the war dogs on their tracks one by one they would be caught then up flashed the great spear and down fell the pursueddead i saw ten of our men leap into one large schanse but though i watched for some time nobody came out afterwards we inspected the place and found these men all dead together with twentythree matukus neither side would give in and they had fought it out to the bitter end  at last they neared the second line of fortifications behind which the whole remaining matuku force numbering some two thousand men was rapidly assembling one little pause to get their breath and nalas men came at it with a rush and a long wild shout of bulala matuku kill the matuku that went right through me thrilling every nerve then came an answering shout and the sounds of heavy firing and presently i saw our men retreating somewhat fewer in numbers than they had advanced their welcome had been a warm one for the matuku fight splendidly behind walls this decided me that it was necessary to create a diversion if we did not do so it seemed very probable that we should be worsted after all i called to the captain of our little force and rapidly put the position before him  seeing the urgency of the occasion he agreed with me that we must risk it and in two minutes more with the exception of my own men whom i left to guard the wounded we were trotting across the open space and through the deserted town towards the spot where the struggle was taking place some seven hundred yards away in six or eight minutes we reached a group of hutsit was a head mans kraal that was situated about a hundred and twenty yards behind the fortified wall and took possession of it unobserved the enemy was too much engaged with the foe in front of him to notice us and besides the broken ground rose in a hogback shape between there we waited a minute or two and recovered our breath while i gave my directions so soon as we heard the butiana impi begin to charge again we were to run out in a line to the brow of the hogback and pour our fire into the mass of defenders behind the wall then the guns were to be thrown down and we must charge with the assegai we had no shields but that could not be helped there would be no time to reload the guns and it was absolutely necessary that the enemy should be disconcerted at the moment when the main attack was delivered  the men who were as plucky a set of fellows as ever i saw and whose blood was now thoroughly up consented to this scheme though i could see that they thought it rather a large order as indeed i did myself but i knew that if the impi was driven back a second time the game would be played and for me at any rate it would be a case of the thing that bites and this sure and certain knowledge filled my breast with valour  we had not long to wait presently we heard the butiana warsong swelling loud and long they had commenced their attack i made a sign and the hundred and fifty men headed by myself poured out of the kraal and getting into a rough line ran up the fifty or sixty yards of slope that intervened between ourselves and the crest of the hogbacked ridge in thirty seconds we were there and immediately beyond us was the main body of the matuku host waiting the onslaught of the enemy with guns and spears even now they did not see us so intent were they upon the coming attack i signed to my men to take careful aim and suddenly called out to them to fire which they did with a will dropping thirty or forty matukus  charge i shouted again throwing down my smoking rifle and drawing my revolver an example which they followed snatching up their spears from the ground where they had placed them while they fired the men set up a savage whoop and we started i saw the matuku soldiers wheel around in hundreds utterly taken aback at this new development of the situation and looking over them before we had gone twenty yards i saw something else for of a sudden as though they had risen from the earth there appeared above the wall hundreds of great spears followed by hundreds of savage faces shadowed with drooping plumes with a yell they sprang upon the wall shaking their broad shields and with a yell they bounded from it straight into our astonished foes  crash we were in them now and fighting like demons crash from the other side nalas impi was at its work and still the spears and plumes appeared for a moment against the brown background of the mountain and then sprang down and rushed like a storm upon the foe the great mob of men turned this way and turned that way astonished bewildered overborne by doubt and terror  meanwhile the slayers stayed not their hands and on every side spears flashed and the fierce shout of triumph went up to heaven there too on the wall stood maiwa a white garment streaming from her shoulders an assegai in her hand her breast heaving her eyes flashing above all the din of battle i could catch the tones of her clear voice as she urged the soldiers on to victory but victory was not yet wambes soldiers gathered themselves together and bore our men back by the sheer weight of numbers they began to give then once more they rallied and the fight hung doubtfully  slay you warwhelps cried maiwa from the wall are you afraid you women you chickenhearted women strike home or die like dogs whatyou give way follow me children of nala and with one long cry she leapt from the wall as leaps a stricken antelope and holding the spear poised rushed right into the thickest of the fray the warriors saw her and raised such a shout that it echoed like thunder against the mountains they massed together and following the flutter of her white robe crashed into the dense heart of the foe down went the matuku before them like trees before a whirlwind nothing could stand in the face of such a rush as that it was as the rush of a torrent bursting its banks all along their line swept the wild desperate charge and there straight in the forefront of the battle still waved the white robe of maiwa  then they broke and stricken with utter panic wambes soldiers streamed away a scattered crowd of fugitives while after them thundered the footfall of the victors  the fight was over we had won the day and for my part i sat down upon a stone and wiped my forehead thanking providence that i had lived to see the end of it twenty minutes later nalas warriors began to return panting wambes soldiers had taken to the bush and the caves they said where they had not thought it safe to follow them adding significantly that many had stopped on the way  i was utterly dazed and now that the fight was over my energy seemed to have left me and i did not pay much attention till presently i was aroused by somebody calling me by my name i looked up and saw that it was the chief nala himself who was bleeding from a flesh wound in his arm by his side stood maiwa panting but unhurt and wearing on her face a proud and terrifying air  they are gone macumazahn said the chief there is little to fear from them their heart is broken but where is wambe the chiefand where is the white man thou camest to save  i know not i answered  close to where we stood lay a matuku a young man who had been shot through the fleshy part of the calf it was a trifling wound but it prevented him from running away  say thou dog said nala stalking up to him and shaking his red spear in his face say where is wambe speak or i slay thee was he with the soldiers  nay lord i know not groaned the terrified man he fought not with us wambe has no stomach for fighting perchance he is in his kraal yonder or in the cave behind the kraal and he pointed to a small enclosure on the hillside about four hundred yards to the right of where we were  let us go and see said nala summoning his soldiers     viiimaiwa is avenged  the impi formed up alas an hour before it had been stronger by a third than it was now then nala detached two hundred men to collect and attend to the injured and at my suggestion issued a stringent order that none of the enemys wounded and above all no women or children were to be killed as is the savage custom among african natives on the contrary they were to be allowed to send word to their women that they might come in to nurse them and fear nothing for nala made war upon wambe the tyrant and not on the matuku tribe  then we started with some four hundred men for the chiefs kraal very soon we were there it was as i have said placed against the mountain side but within the fortified lines and did not at all cover more than an acre and a half of ground outside was a tiny reed fence within which neatly arranged in a semicircular line stood the huts of the chiefs principal wives maiwa of course knew every inch of the kraal for she had lived in it and led us straight to the entrance we peeped through the gatewaynot a soul was to be seen there were the huts and there was the clear open space floored with a concrete of lime on which the sun beat fiercely but nobody could we see or hear  the jackal has gone to earth said maiwa he will be in the cave behind his hut and she pointed with her spear towards another small and semicircular enclosure over which a large hut was visible that had the cliff itself for a background i stared at this fence by george it was true it was entirely made of tusks of ivory planted in the ground with their points bending outwards the smallest ones though none were small were placed nearest to the cliff on either side but they gradually increased in size till they culminated in two enormous tusks which set up so that their points met something in the shape of an inverted v formed the gateway to the hut i was dumbfoundered with delight and indeed where is the elephanthunter who would not be if he suddenly saw five or six hundred picked tusks set up in a row and only waiting for him to take them away of course the stuff was what is known as black ivory that is the exterior of the tusks had become black from years or perhaps centuries of exposure to wind and weather but i was certain that it would be none the worse for that forgetting the danger of the deed in my excitement i actually ran right across the open space and drawing my knife scratched vigorously at one of the great tusks to see how deep the damage might be as i thought it was nothing there beneath the black covering gleamed the pure white ivory i could have capered for joy for i fear that i am very mercenary at heart when suddenly i heard the faint echo of a cry for assistance help screamed a voice in the sisutu dialect from somewhere behind the hut help they are murdering me  i knew the voice it was john everys oh what a selfish brute was i for the moment that miserable ivory had driven the recollection of him out of my head and nowperhaps it was too late  nala maiwa and the soldiers had now come up they too heard the voice and interpreted its tone though they had not caught the words  this way cried maiwa and we started at a run passing round the hut of wambe behind was the narrow entrance to a cave we rushed through it heedless of the danger of the ambush and this is what we saw though very confusedly at first owing to the gloom  in the centre of the cave and with either end secured to the floor by strong stakes stood a huge doublespringed lion trap edged with sharp and grinning teeth it was set and beyond the trap indeed almost over it a terrible struggle was in progress a naked or almost naked white man with a great beard hanging down over his breast in spite of his furious struggles was being slowly forced and dragged towards the trap by six or eight women only one man was present a fat cruellooking man with small eyes and a hanging lip it was the chief wambe and he stood by the trap ready to force the victim down upon it so soon as the women had dragged him into the necessary position  at this instant they caught sight of us and there came a moments pause and then before i knew what she was going to do maiwa lifted the assegai she still held and whirled it at wambes head i saw the flash of light speed towards him and so did he for he stepped backward to avoid itstepped backward right into the trap he yelled with pain as the iron teeth of the thing that bites sprang up with a rattling sound like living fangs and fastened into himsuch a yell i have not often heard now at last he tasted of the torture which he had inflicted upon so many and though i trust i am a christian i cannot say that i felt sorry for him  the assegai sped on and struck one of the women who had hold of the unfortunate every piercing through her arm this made her leave go an example that the other women quickly followed so that every fell to the ground where he lay gasping  kill the witches roared nala in a voice of thunder pointing to the group of women  nay gasped every spare them he made them do it and he pointed to the human fiend in the trap then maiwa waved her hand to us to fall back for the moment of her vengeance was come we did so and she strode up to her lord and flinging the white robe from her stood before him her fierce beautiful face fixed like stone  who am i she cried in so terrible a voice that he ceased his yells am i that woman who was given to thee for wife and whose child thou slewest or am i an avenging spirit come to see thee die  what is this she went on drawing the withered babyhand from the pouch at her side  is it the hand of a babe and how came that hand to be thus alone what cut it off from the babe and where is the babe is it a hand or is it the vision of a hand that shall presently tear thy throat  where are thy soldiers wambe do they sleep and eat and go forth to do thy bidding or are they perchance dead and scattered like the winter leaves  he groaned and rolled his eyes while the fiercefaced woman went on  art thou still a chief wambe or does another take thy place and power and say lord what doest thou there and what is that slaves leglet upon thy knee  is it a dream wambe great lord and chief orand she lifted her clenched hands and shook them in his facehath a womans vengeance found thee out and a womans wit oermatched thy tyrannous strength and art thou about to slowly die in torments horrible to think on oh thou accursed murderer of little children  and with one wild scream she dashed the dead hand of the child straight into his face and then fell senseless on the floor as for the demon in the trap he shrank back so far as its iron bounds would allow his yellow eyes starting out of his head with pain and terror and then once more began to yell  the scene was more than i could bear  nala i said this must stop that man is a fiend but he must not be left to die there see thou to it  nay answered nala let him taste of the food wherewith he hath fed so many leave him till death shall find him  that i will not i answered let his end be swift see thou to it  as thou wilt macumazahn answered the chief with a shrug of the shoulders first let the white man and maiwa be brought forth  so the soldiers came forward and carried every and the woman into the open air as the former was borne past his tormentor the fallen chief so cowardly was his wicked heart actually prayed him to intercede for him and save him from a fate which but for our providential appearance would have been everys own  so we went away and in another moment one of the biggest villains on the earth troubled it no more once in the fresh air every recovered quickly i looked at him and horror and sorrow pierced me through to see such a sight his face was the face of a man of sixty though he was not yet forty and his poor body was cut to pieces with stripes and scars and other marks of the torments which wambe had for years amused himself with inflicting on him  as soon as he recovered himself a little he struggled on to his knees burst into a paroxysm of weeping and clasping my legs with his emaciated arms would have actually kissed my feet  what are you about old fellow i said for i am not accustomed to that sort of thing and it made me feel uncomfortable  oh god bless you he moaned god bless you if only you knew what i have gone through and to think that you should have come to help me and at the risk of your own life well you were always a true friendyes yes a true friend  bosh i answered testily im a trader and i came after that ivory and i pointed to the stockade of tusks did you ever hear of an elephanthunter who would not have risked his immortal soul for them and much more his carcase  but he took no notice of my explanations and went on god blessing me as hard as ever till at last i bethought me that a nip of brandy of which i had a flask full might steady his nerves a bit i gave it him and was not disappointed in the result for he brisked up wonderfully then i hunted about in wambes hut and found a kaross to put over his poor bruised shoulders and he was quite a man again  now i said why did the late lamented wambe want to put you in that trap  because as soon as they heard that the fight was going against them and that maiwa was charging at the head of nalas impi one of the women told wambe that she had seen me write something on some leaves and give them to maiwa before she went away to purify herself then of course he guessed that i had to do with your seizing the koppie and holding it while the impi rushed the place from the mountain so he determined to torture me to death before help could come oh heavens what a mercy it is to hear english again  how long have you been a prisoner here every i asked  six years and a bit quatermain i have lost count of the odd months lately i came up here with major aldey and three other gentlemen and forty bearers that devil wambe ambushed us and murdered the lot to get their guns they werent much use to him when he got them being breechloaders for the fools fired away all the ammunition in a month or two however they are all in good order and hanging up in the hut there they didnt kill me because one of them saw me mending a gun just before they attacked us so they kept me as a kind of armourer twice i tried to make a bolt of it but was caught each time last time wambe had me flogged very nearly to deathyou can see the scars upon my back indeed i should have died if it hadnt been for the girl maiwa who nursed me by stealth he got that accursed lion trap among our things also and i suppose he has tortured between one and two hundred people to death in it it was his favourite amusement and he would go every day and sit and watch his victim till he died sometimes he would give him food and water to keep him alive longer telling him or her that he would let him go if he lived till a certain day but he never did let them go they all died there and i could show you their bones behind that rock  the devil i said grinding my teeth i wish i hadnt interfered i wish i had left him to the same fate  well he got a taste of it any way said every im glad he got a taste theres justice in it and now hes gone to hell and i hope there is another one ready for him there by jove i should like to have the setting of it  and so he talked on and i sat and listened to him wondering how he had kept his reason for so many years but he didnt talk as i have told it in plain english he spoke very slowly and as though he had got something in his mouth continually using native words because the english ones had slipped his memory  at last nala came up and told us that food was made ready and thankful enough we were to get it i can tell you after we had eaten we held a consultation quite a thousand of wambes soldiers were put hors de combat but at least two thousand remained hidden in the bush and rocks and these men together with those in the outlying kraals were a source of possible danger the question arose therefore what was to be donewere they to be followed or left alone i waited till everybody had spoken some giving one opinion and some another and then being appealed to i gave mine it was to the effect that nala should take a leaf out of the great zulu tchakas book and incorporate the tribe not destroy it we had a good many women among the prisoners let them i suggested be sent to the hidingplaces of the soldiers and make an offer if the men would come and lay down their arms and declare allegiance to nala they and their town and cattle should be spared wambes cattle alone would be seized as the prize of war moreover wambe having left no children his wife maiwa should be declared chieftainess of the tribe under nala if they did not accept this offer by the morning of the second day it should be taken as a declaration that they wished to continue the war their town should be burned their cattle which our men were already collecting and driving in in great numbers would be taken and they should be hunted down  this advice was at once declared to be wise and acted on the women were despatched and i saw from their faces that they never expected to get such terms and did not think that their mission would be in vain nevertheless we spent that afternoon in preparations against possible surprise and also in collecting all the wounded of both parties into a hospital which we extemporized out of some huts and there attending to them as best we could  that evening every had the first pipe of tobacco that he had tasted for six years poor fellow he nearly cried with joy over it the night passed without any sign of attack and on the following morning we began to see the effect of our message for women children and a few men came in in little knots and took possession of their huts it was of course rather difficult to prevent our men from looting and generally going on as natives and for the matter of that white men too are in the habit of doing after a victory but one man who after warning was caught maltreating a woman was brought out and killed by nalas order and though there was a little grumbling that put a stop to further trouble  on the second morning the head men and numbers of their followers came in in groups and about midday a deputation of the former presented themselves before us without their weapons they were conquered they said and wambe was dead so they came to hear the words of the great lion who had eaten them up and of the crafty white man the jackal who had dug a hole for them to fall in and of maiwa lady of war who had led the charge and turned the fate of the battle  so we let them hear the words and when we had done an old man rose and said that in the name of the people he accepted the yoke that was laid upon their shoulders and that the more gladly because even the rule of a woman could not be worse than the rule of wambe moreover they knew maiwa the lady of war and feared her not though she was a witch and terrible to see in battle  then nala asked his daughter if she was willing to become chieftainess of the tribe under him  maiwa who had been very silent since her revenge was accomplished answered yes that she was and that her rule should be good and gentle to those who were good and gentle to her but the froward and rebellious she would smite with a rod of iron which from my knowledge of her character i thought exceedingly probable  the head man replied that that was a good saying and they did not complain at it and so the meeting ended  next day we spent in preparations for departure mine consisted chiefly in superintending the digging up of the stockade of ivory tusks which i did with the greatest satisfaction there were some five hundred of them altogether i made inquiries about it from every who told me that the stockade had been there so long that nobody seemed to know exactly who had collected the tusks originally there was however a kind of superstitious feeling about them which had always prevented the chiefs from trying to sell this great mass of ivory every and i examined it carefully and found that although it was so old its quality was really as good as ever and there was very little soft ivory in the lot at first i was rather afraid lest now that my services had been rendered nala should hesitate to part with so much valuable property but this was not the case when i spoke to him on the subject he merely said take it macumazahn take it you have earned it well and to speak the truth though i say it who shouldnt i think i had so we pressed several hundred matuku bearers into our service and next day marched off with the lot  before we went i took a formal farewell of maiwa whom we left with a bodyguard of three hundred men to assist her in settling the country she gave me her hand to kiss in a queenly sort of way and then said  macumazahn you are a brave man and have been a friend to me in my need if ever you want help or shelter remember that maiwa has a good memory for friend and foe all i have is yours  and so i thanked her and went she was certainly a very remarkable woman a year or two ago i heard that her father nala was dead and that she had succeeded to the chieftainship of both tribes which she ruled with great justice and firmness  i can assure you that we ascended the pass leading to wambes town with feelings very different from those with which we had descended it a few days before but if i was grateful for the issue of events you can easily imagine what poor everys feelings were when we got to the top of the pass before the whole impi he actually flopped down upon his knees and thanked heaven for his escape the tears running down his face but then as i have said his nerves were shakenthough now that his beard was trimmed and he had some sort of clothes on his back and hope in his heart he looked a very different man from the poor wretch whom we had rescued from death by torture  well we separated from nala at the little stairway or pass over the mountainevery and i and the ivory going down the river which i had come up a few weeks before and the chief returning to his own kraal on the further side of the mountain he gave us an escort of a hundred and fifty men however with instructions to accompany us for six days journey and to keep the matuku bearers in order and then return i knew that in six days we should be able to reach a district where porters were plentiful and whence we could easily get the ivory conveyed to delagoa bay  and did you land it up safe i asked  well no said quatermain we lost about a third of it in crossing a river a flood came down suddenly just as the men were crossing and many of them had to throw down their tusks to save their lives we had no means of dragging it up and so we were obliged to leave it which was very sad however we sold what remained for nearly seven thousand pounds so we did not do so badly i dont mean that i got seven thousand pounds out of it because you see i insisted upon every taking a half share poor fellow he had earned it if ever a man did he set up a store in the old colony on the proceeds and did uncommonly well  and what did you do with the lion trap asked sir henry  oh i brought that away with me also and when i reached durban i put it in my house but really i could not bear to sit opposite to it at nights as i smoked visions of that poor woman and the hand of her dead child would rise up in my mind and also of all the horrors of which it had been the instrument i began to dream at last that it held me by the leg this was too much for my nerves so i just packed it up and shipped it to its maker in england whose name was stamped upon the steel sending him a letter at the same time to tell him to what purpose the infernal machine had been put i believe that he gave it to some museum or other  and what became of the tusks of the three bulls which you shot you must have left them at nalas kraal i suppose  the old gentlemans face fell at this question  ah he said that is a very sad story nala promised to send them with my goods to my agent at delagoa and so he did but the men who brought them were unarmed and as it happened they fell in with a slave caravan under the command of a halfbred portuguese who seized the tusks and what is worse swore that he had shot them i paid him out afterwards however he added with a smile of satisfaction but it did not give me back my tusks which no doubt have been turned into hair brushes long ago and he sighed  well said good that is a capital yarn of yours quatermain but  but what he asked sharply foreseeing a draw  but i dont think that it was so good as mine about the ibexit hasnt the same finish  mr quatermain made no reply good was beneath it  do you know gentlemen he said it is halfpast two in the morning and if we are going to shoot the big wood tomorrow we ought to leave here at ninethirty sharp  oh if you shoot for a hundred years you will never beat the record of those three woodcocks i said  or of those three elephants added sir henry  and then we all went to bed and i dreamed that i had married maiwa and was much afraid of that attractive but determined lady
