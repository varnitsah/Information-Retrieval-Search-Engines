40253815	the elevator  by william d howells     i    scene  through the curtained doorway of mrs edward robertss pretty drawingroom in hotel bellingham shows the snowy and gleaming array of a table set for dinner under the dim light of gasburners turned low  an air of expectancy pervades the place and the uneasiness of mr roberts in evening dress expresses something more as he turns from a glance into the diningroom and still holding the portiere with one hand takes out his watch with the other  mr roberts to mrs roberts entering the drawingroom from regions beyond  my dear its six oclock  what can have become of your aunt  mrs roberts with a little anxiety  that was just what i was going to ask  shes never late and the children are quite heartbroken they had counted upon seeing her and talking christmas a little before they were put to bed  roberts  very singular her not coming  is she going to begin standing upon ceremony with us and not come till the hour  mrs roberts  nonsense edward  shes been detained  of course shell be here in a moment  how impatient you are  roberts  you must profit by me as an awful example  mrs roberts going about the room and bestowing little touches here and there on its ornaments  if youd had that new cook to battle with over this dinner youd have learned patience by this time without any awful example  roberts dropping nervously into the nearest chair  i hope she isnt behind time  mrs roberts drifting upon the sofa and disposing her train effectively on the carpet around her  shes before time  the dinner is in the last moment of ripe perfection now when we must still give people fifteen minutes grace  she studies the convolutions of her train absentmindedly  roberts joining in its perusal  is that the way youve arranged to be sitting when people come in  mrs roberts  of course not  i shall get up to receive them  roberts  thats rather a pity  to destroy such a lovely pose  mrs roberts  do you like it  roberts  its divine  mrs roberts  you might throw me a kiss  roberts  no if it happened to strike on that train anywhere it might spoil one of the folds  i cant risk it  a ring is heard at the apartment door  they spring to their feet simultaneously  mrs roberts  theres aunt mary now  she calls into the vestibule aunt mary  dr lawton putting aside the vestibule portiere with affected timidity  very sorry  merely a father  mrs roberts  oh  dr lawton  i am so glad to see you  she gives him her hand  i thought it was my aunt  we cant understand why she hasnt come  why wheres miss lawton  lawton  that is precisely what i was going to ask you  mrs roberts  why she isnt here  lawton  so it seems  i left her with the carriage at the door when i started to walk here  she called after me down the stairs that she would be ready in three seconds and begged me to hurry so that we could come in together and not let people know id saved half a dollar by walking  mrs roberts  shes been detained too  roberts coming forward  now you know what it is to have a delinquent auntmaryinlaw  lawton shaking hands with him  o roberts  is that you  its astonishing how little one makes of the husband of a lady who gives a dinner  in my timea long time agohe used to carve  but nowadays when everything is served a la russe he might as well be abolished  dont you think on the whole roberts youd better not have come  roberts  well you see i had no excuse  i hated to say an engagement when i hadnt any  lawton  oh i understand  you wanted to come  we all do when mrs roberts will let us  he goes and sits down by mrs roberts who has taken a more provisional pose on the sofa  mrs roberts youre the only woman in boston who could hope to get people with a fireside of their ownor a registerout to a christmas dinner  you know i still wonder at your effrontery a little  mrs roberts laughing  i knew i should catch you if i baited my hook with your old friend  lawton  yes nothing would have kept me away when i heard bemis was coming  but he doesnt seem so inflexible in regard to me  where is he  mrs roberts  im sure i dont know  id no idea i was giving such a formal dinner  but everybody beginning with my own aunt seems to think it a ceremonious occasion  there are only to be twelve  do you know the millers  lawton  no thank goodness  one meets some people so often that one fancies ones weariness of them reflected in their sympathetic countenances  who are these acceptably novel millers  mrs roberts  do explain the millers to the doctor edward  roberts standing on the hearthrug with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets  they board  lawton  genus  that accounts for their willingness to flutter round your evening lamp when they ought to be singeing their wings at their own  well species  roberts  theyre very nice young newly married people  hes something or other of some kind of manufactures  and mrs miller is disposed to think that all the other ladies are as fond of him as she is  mrs roberts  oh  that is not so edward  lawton  you defend your sex as women always do  but youll admit that as your friend mrs miller may have this foible  mrs roberts  i admit nothing of the kind  and weve invited another young couple who havent gone to housekeeping yetthe curwens  and he has the same foible as mrs miller  mrs roberts takes out her handkerchief and laughs into it  lawton  that is if mrs miller has it which we both deny  let us hope that mrs miller and mr curwen may not get to making eyes at each other  roberts  and mr bemis and his son complete the list  why agnes there are only ten  you said there were twelve  mrs roberts  well never mind  i meant ten  i forgot that the somerses declined  a ring is heard  ah thats aunt mary  she runs into the vestibule and is heard exclaiming without  why mrs miller is it you  i thought it was my aunt  where is mr miller  mrs miller entering the drawingroom arm in arm with her hostess oh hell be here directly  i had to let him run back for my fan  mrs roberts  well were very glad to have you to begin with  let me introduce dr lawton  mrs miller in a polite murmur  dr lawton  in a louder tone o mr roberts  lawton  you see roberts  the same aggrieved surprise at meeting you here that i felt  mrs miller  what in the world do you mean  lawton  dont you think that when a husband is present at his wifes dinner party he repeats the mortifying superfluity of a bridegroom at a wedding  mrs miller  im sure i dont know what you mean  i should never think of giving a dinner without mr miller  lawton  no  a ring is heard  theres bemis  mrs miller  its mr miller  mrs roberts  aunt mary at last  as she bustles toward the door edward there are twelveaunt mary and willis  roberts  oh yes  i totally forgot willis  lawton  whos willis  roberts  willis  oh willis is my wifes brother  we always have him  lawton  oh yes campbell  mrs roberts without  mr bemis  so kind of you to come on christmas  mr bemis without  so kind of you to ask us houseless strangers  mrs roberts without  i ran out here thinking it was my aunt shes played us a trick and hasnt come yet  bemis entering the drawingroom with mrs roberts  i hope she wont fail altogether  i havent met her for twenty years and i counted so much upon the pleasurehello lawton  lawton  hullo old fellow  they fly at each other and shake hands  glad to see you again  bemis reaching his left hand to mr roberts while mr lawton keeps his right  ah  mr roberts  lawton  oh never mind him  hes merely the husband of the hostess  mrs miller to roberts  what does he mean  roberts  oh nothing  merely a joke hes experimenting with  lawton to bemis  wheres your boy  bemis  hell be here directly  he preferred to walk  wheres your girl  lawton  oh shell come by and by  she preferred to drive  mrs roberts introducing them  mr bemis have you met mrs miller  she drifts away again manifestly too uneasy to resume even a provisional pose on the sofa and walks detachedly about the room  bemis  what a lovely apartment mrs roberts has  mrs miller  exquisite  but then she has such perfect taste  bemis to mrs roberts who drifts near them  we were talking about your apartment mrs roberts  its charming  mrs roberts  it is nice  its the ideal way of living  all on one floor  no stairs  nothing  bemis  yes when once you get here  but that little matter of five pair up   mrs roberts  you dont mean to say you walked up  why in the world didnt you take the elevator  bemis  i didnt know you had one  mrs roberts  its the only thing that makes life worth living in a flat  all these apartment hotels have them  bemis  bless me  well you see ive been away from boston so long and am back so short a time that i cant realize your luxuries and conveniences  in florence we always walk up  they have ascenseurs in a few great hotels and they brag of it in immense signs on the sides of the building  lawton  what pastoral simplicity  we are elevated here to a degree that you cant conceive of gentle shepherd  has yours got an air cushion mrs roberts  mrs roberts  an aircushion  whats that  lawton  the only thing that makes your life worth a moments purchase in an elevator  you get in with a glass of water a basket of eggs and a file of the daily advertiser they cut the elevator loose at the top and you drop  both ladies  oh  lawton  in three seconds you arrive at the groundfloor reading your file of the daily advertiser not an egg broken nor a drop spilled  i saw it done in a new york hotel  the air is compressed under the elevator and acts as a sort of ethereal buffer  mrs roberts  and why dont we always go down in that way  lawton  because sometimes the walls of the elevator shaft give out  mrs roberts  and what then  lawton  then the elevator stops more abruptly  i had a friend who tried it when this happened  mrs roberts  and what did he do  lawton  stepped out of the elevator laughed cried went home got into bed  and did not get up for six weeks  nervous shock  he was fortunate  mrs miller  i shouldnt think youd want an aircushion on your elevator mrs roberts  mrs roberts  no indeed  horrid  the bell rings  edward you go and see if thats aunt mary  mrs miller  its mr miller i know  bemis  or my son  lawton  my voice is for mrs robertss brother  ive given up all hopes of my daughter  roberts without  oh curwen  glad to see you  thought you were my wifes aunt  lawton at a suppressed sigh from mrs roberts  its one of his jokes mrs roberts  of course its your aunt  mrs roberts through her set teeth smilingly  oh if it is ill make him suffer for it  mr curwen without  no i hated to wait so i walked up  lawton  it is mr curwen after all mrs roberts  now let me see how a lady transmutes a frown of threatened vengeance into a smile of society welcome  mrs roberts  well look  to mr curwen who enters followed by her husband  ah mr curwen  so glad to see you  you know all our friends heremrs miller dr lawton and mr bemis  curwen smiling and bowing and shaking hands right and left  very gladvery happypleased to know you  mrs roberts behind her fan to dr lawton  didnt i do it beautifully  lawton behind his hand  wonderfully  and so unconscious of the fact that he hasnt his wife with him  mrs roberts in great astonishment to mr curwen  where in the world is mrs curwen  curwen  ohohshell be here  i thought she was here  she started from home with two righthand gloves and i had to go back for a left and ii supposegood heavens  pulling the glove out of his pocket  i ought to have sent it to her in the ladies dressingroom  he remains with the glove held up before him in spectacular stupefaction  lawton  only imagine what mrs curwen would be saying of you if she were in the dressingroom  roberts  mr curwen felt so sure she was there that he wouldnt wait to take the elevator and walked up  another ring is heard shall i go and meet your aunt now my dear  mrs roberts  no indeed  she may come in now with all the formality she chooses and i will receive her excuses in state  she waves her fan softly to and fro concealing a murmur of trepidation under an indignant air till the portiere opens and mr willis campbell enters  then mrs roberts breaks in nervous agitation why willis  wheres aunt mary  mrs miller  and mr miller  curwen  and mrs curwen  lawton  and my daughter  bemis  and my son  mr campbell looking tranquilly round on the faces of his interrogators  is it a conundrum  mrs roberts mingling a real distress with an effort of mockheroic solemnity  it is a tragedy  o willis dear its what you seewhat you hear a niece without an aunt a wife without a husband a father without a son and another father without a daughter  roberts  and a dinner getting cold and a cook getting hot  lawton  and you are expected to account for the whole situation  campbell  oh i understand  i dont know what your little game is agnes but i can wait and see  im not hungry  mrs roberts  willis do you think i would try and play a trick on you if i could  campbell  i think you cant  come now agnes  its a failure own up and bring the rest of the company out of the next room  i suppose almost anything is allowable at this festive season but this is pretty feeble  mrs roberts  indeed indeed they are not there  campbell  where are they then  all  thats what we dont know  campbell  oh come now thats a little too thin  you dont know where any of all these bloodrelations and connections by marriage are  well search me  mrs roberts in open distress  oh im sure something must have happened to aunt mary  mrs miller  i cant understand what ellery c miller means  lawton with a simulated sternness  i hope you havent let that son of yours run away with my daughter bemis  bemis  im afraid hes come to a pass where he wouldnt ask my leave  curwen reassuring himself  ah shes all right of course  i know that   bemis  miss lawton  curwen  no nomrs curwen  campbell  is it a true bill agnes  mrs roberts  indeed it is willis  weve been expecting her for an hourof course she always comes earlyand im afraid shes been taken ill suddenly  roberts  oh i dont think its that my dear  mrs roberts  oh of course you never think anythings wrong edward  my whole family might die andmrs roberts restrains herself and turns to mr campbell with hysterical cheerfulness who came up in the elevator with you  campbell  me  i didnt come in the elevator  i had my usual luck  the elevator was up somewhere and after id pressed the annunciator button till my thumb ached i watched my chance and walked up  mrs roberts  where was the janitor  campbell  where the janitor always isnowhere  lawton  eating his christmas dinner probably  mrs roberts partially abandoning and then recovering herself yes its perfectly spoiled  well friends i think wed better go to dinnerthats the only way to bring them  ill go out and interview the cook  sotto voce to her husband  if i dont go somewhere and have a cry i shall break down here before everybody did you ever know anything so strange  its perfectlypokerish  lawton  yes theres nothing like serving dinner to bring the belated guest  its as infallible as going without an umbrella when it wont rain  campbell  no no  wait a minute roberts  you might sit down without one guest but you cant sit down without five  its the old joke about the part of hamlet  ill just step round to aunt marys housewhy ill be back in three minutes  mrs roberts with perfervid gratitude  oh how good you are willis  you dont know how much youre doing  what presence of mind you have  why couldnt we have thought of sending for her  o willis i can never be grateful enough to you  but you always think of everything  roberts  i accept my punishment meekly willis since its in your honor  lawton  its a simple and beautiful solution mrs roberts as far as your aunts concerned but i dont see how it helps the rest of us  mrs miller to mr campbell  if you meet mr miller    curwen  or my wife   bemis  or my son   lawton  or my daughter   campbell  ill tell them theyve just one chance in a hundred to save their lives and that one is open to them for just five minutes  lawton  tell my daughter that ive been here half an hour and everybody knows i drove here with her  bemis  tell my son that the next time ill walk and let him drive  mrs miller  tell mr miller i found i had my fan after all  curwen  and mrs curwen that ive got her glove all right  he holds it up  mrs roberts at a look of mystification and demand from her brother never mind explanations willis  theyll understand and well explain when you get back  lawton examining the glove which curwen holds up  why so it is right  curwen  what do you mean  lawton  were you sent back to get a left glove  curwen  yes yes of course  lawton  well if youll notice this is a right one  the one at home is left  curwen staring helplessly at it  gracious powers what shall i do  lawton  pray that mrs curwen may never come  mr curwen dashing through the door  ill be back by the time mr campbell returns  mrs miller with tokens of breaking down visible to mrs roberts i wonder what could have kept mr miller  its so very mysterious i   mrs roberts suddenly seizing her by the arm and hurrying her from the room  now mrs miller youve just got time to see my baby  mr roberts winking at his remaining guests  a little cry will do them good  i saw as soon as willis came in instead of her aunt that my wife couldnt get through without it  theyll come back as bright as   lawton  bemis should you mind a bereaved father falling upon your neck  bemis  yes lawton i think i should  lawton  well it is rather odd about all those people  you can say of one or two that theyve been delayed but five people cant have been delayed  its too much  it amounts to a coincidence  hello whats that  roberts  whats what  lawton  i thought i heard a cry  roberts  very likely you did  they profess to deaden these floors so that you cant hear from one apartment to another  but i know pretty well when my neighbor overhead is trying to wheel his baby to sleep in a perambulator at three oclock in the morning and i guess our young lady lets the people below understand when shes wakeful but its the only way to live after all  i wouldnt go back to the old upanddownstairs houseinablock system on any account  here we all live on the groundfloor practically  the elevator equalizes everything  bemis  yes when it happens to be where you are  i believe i prefer the good old florentine fashion of walking upstairs after all  lawton  roberts i did hear something  hark  it sounded like a cry for help  there  roberts  youre nervous doctor  its nothing  however its easy enough to go out and see  he goes out to the door of the apartment and immediately returns  he beckons to dr lawton and mr bemis with a mysterious whisper  come here both of you  dont alarm the ladies    ii    in the interior of the elevator are seated mrs robertss aunt mary mrs crashaw mrs curwen and miss lawton mr miller and mr alfred bemis are standing with their hats in their hands  they are in dinner costume with their overcoats on their arms and the ladies draperies and ribbons show from under their outer wraps where they are caught up and held with that caution which characterizes ladies in sitting attitudes which they have not been able to choose deliberately  as they talk together the elevator rises very slowly and they continue talking for some time before they observe that it has stopped  mrs crashaw  its very fortunate that we are all here together  i ought to have been here half an hour ago but i was kept at home by an accident to my finery and before i could be put in repair i heard it striking the quarter past  i dont know what my niece will say to me  i hope you good people will all stand by me if she should be violent  miller  in what a poor man may with his wifes fan you shall command me mrs crashaw  he takes the fan out and unfurls it  mrs crashaw  did she send you back for it  miller  i shouldnt have had the pleasure of arriving with you if she hadnt  mrs crashaw laughing to mrs curwen  what did you send yours back for my dear  mrs curwen thrusting out one hand gloved and the other ungloved i didnt want two rights  young mr bemis  not even womens rights  mrs curwen  oh so young and so depraved  are all the young men in florence so bad  surveying her extended arms which she turns over  i dont know that i need have sent him for the other glove i could have explained to mrs roberts  perhaps she would have forgiven my coming in one glove  miller looking down at the pretty arms  if she had seen you without  mrs curwen  oh you were looking  she rapidly involves her arms in her wrap  then she suddenly unwraps them and regards them thoughtfully  what if he should bring a tenbutton instead of an eight  and hes quite capable of doing it  miller  are there such things as tenbutton gloves  mrs curwen  you would think there were tenthousand button gloves if you had them to button  miller  it would depend upon whom i had to button them for  mrs curwen  for mrs miller for example  mrs crashaw  we women are too bad always sending people back for something  its well the men dont know how bad  mrs curwen  sh  mr miller is listening  and he thought we were perfect  he asks nothing better than to be sent back for his wifes fan  and he doesnt say anything even under his breath when she finds shes forgotten it and begins oh dearest my fanmr curwen does  but he goes all the same  i hope you have your father in good training miss lawton  you must commence with your father if you expect your husband to be good  miss lawton  then mine will never behave for papa is perfectly incorrigible  mrs curwen  im sorry to hear such a bad report of him  shouldnt you think he would be good mr bemis  young mr bemis  i should think he would try  mrs curwen  a diplomat as well as a punster already  i must warn miss lawton  mrs crashaw interposing to spare the young people  what an amusing thing elevator etiquette is  why should the gentlemen take their hats off  why dont you take your hats off in a horsecar  miller  the theory is that the elevator is a room  young mr bemis  we were at a hotel in london where they called it the ascending room  miss lawton  oh how amusing  miller looking about  this is a regular drawingroom for size and luxury  theyre usually such cribs in these hotels  mrs crashaw  yes its very nice though i say it that shouldnt of my nieces elevator  the worst about it is its so slow  miller  lets hope its sure  young mr bemis  some of these elevators in america go up like express trains  mrs curwen drawing her shawl about her shoulders as if to be ready to step out  well i never get into one without taking my life in my hand and my heart in my mouth  i suppose every one really expects an elevator to drop with them some day just as everybody really expects to see a ghost some time  mrs crashaw  oh my dear what an extremely disagreeable subject of conversation  mrs curwen  i cant help it mrs crashaw  when i reflect that there are two thousand elevators in boston and that the inspectors have just pronounced a hundred and seventy of them unsafe im so desperate when i get into one that i couldflirt  miller guarding himself with the fan  not with me  miss lawton to young mr bemis  how it does creep  young mr bemis looking down fondly at her  oh does it  mrs crashaw  why it doesnt go at all  its stopped  let us get out  they all rise  the elevator boy pulling at the rope  were not there yet  mrs crashaw with mingled trepidation and severity  not there what are you stopping then for  the elevator boy  i dont know  it seems to be caught  mrs crashaw  caught  miss lawton  oh dear  young mr bemis  dont mind  miller  caught  nonsense  mrs curwen  were caught i should say  she sinks back on the seat  the elevator boy  seemed to be going kind of funny all day  he keeps tugging at the rope  miller arresting the boys efforts  well hold onstop  what are you doing  the elevator boy  trying to make it go  miller  well dont be soviolent about it  you might break something  the elevator boy  break a wire rope like that  miller  well well be quiet now  ladies i think youd better sit downand as gently as possible  i wouldnt move about much  mrs curwen  move  were stone  and i wish for my part i were a feather  miller to the boy  eraerwhere do you suppose we are  the elevator boy  were in the shaft between the fourth and fifth floors  he attempts a fresh demonstration on the rope but is prevented  miller  hold on  erer   mrs crashaw as if the boy had to be communicated with through an interpreter  ask him if its ever happened before  miller  yes  were you ever caught before  the elevator boy  no  miller  he says no  mrs crashaw  ask him if the elevator has a safety device  miller  has it got a safety device  the elevator boy  how should i know  miller  he says he dont know  mrs curwen in a shriek of hysterical laughter  why he understands english  mrs crashaw sternly ignoring the insinuation  ask him if theres any means of calling the janitor  miller  could you call the janitor  the elevator boy ironically  well there aint any telephone attachment  miller solemnly  no he says there isnt  mrs crashaw sinking back on the seat with resignation  well i dont know what my niece will say  miss lawton  poor papa  young mr bemis gathering one of her wandering hands into his dont be frightened  im sure theres no danger  the elevator boy indignantly  why she cant drop  the cogs in the runs wont let her  all  oh  miller with a sigh of relief  i knew there must be something of the kind  well i wish my wife had her fan  mrs curwen  and if i had my left glove i should be perfectly happy  not that i know what the cogs in the runs are  mrs crashaw  then were merely caught here  miller  thats all  mrs curwen  its quite enough for the purpose  couldnt you put on a lifepreserver mr miller and go ashore and get help from the natives  miss lawton putting her handkerchief to her eyes  oh dear  mrs crashaw putting her arm around her  dont be frightened my child  theres no danger  young mr bemis caressing the hand which he holds  dont be frightened  miss lawton  dont leave me  young mr bemis  no no i wont  keep fast hold of my hand  miss lawton  oh yes i will  im ashamed to cry  young mr bemis fervently  oh you neednt be  it is perfectly natural you should  mrs curwen  im too badly scared for tears  mr miller you seem to be in charge of this expeditioncouldnt you do something  throw out ballast or let the boy down in a parachute  or ive read of a shipwreck where the survivors in an open boat joined in a cry and attracted the notice of a vessel that was going to pass them  we might join in a cry  miller  oh its all very well joking mrs curwen   mrs curwen  you call it joking  miller  but its not so amusing being cooped up here indefinitely i dont know how were to get out  we cant join in a cry and rouse the whole house  it would be ridiculous  mrs curwen  and our present attitude is so eminently dignified well i suppose we shall have to cast lots pretty soon to see which of us shall be sacrificed to nourish the survivors  its long past dinnertime  miss lawton breaking down  oh dont say such terrible things  young mr bemis indignantly comforting her  dont dont cry theres no danger  its perfectly safe  miller to the elevator boy  couldnt you climb up the cable and get on to the landing andahget somebody  the elevator boy  i could maybe if there was a hole in the roof  miller glancing up  ah true  mrs crashaw with an old ladys serious kindness  my boy cant you think of anything to do for us  the elevator boy yielding to the touch of humanity and bursting into tears  no maam i cant  and everybodys blamin me as if i done it  whats my poor mother goin to do  mrs crashaw soothingly  but you said the runs in the cogs   the elevator boy  how can i tell  thats what they say  they haint never been tried  mrs curwen springing to her feet  there  i knew i should  oh she sinks fainting to the floor  mrs crashaw abandoning miss lawton to the ministrations of young mr bemis while she kneels beside mrs curwen and chafes her hand oh poor thing  i knew she was overwrought by the way she was keeping up  give her air mr miller  open aoh there isnt any window  miller dropping on his knees and fanning mrs curwen  there there  wake up mrs curwen  i didnt mean to scold you for joking i didnt indeed  iii dont know what the deuce im up to  he gathers mrs curwens inanimate form in his arms and fans her face where it lies on his shoulder i dont know what my wife would say if   mrs crashaw  she would say that you were doing your duty  miller a little consoled  oh do you think so  well perhaps  young mr bemis  do you feel faint at all miss lawton  miss lawton  no i think not  no not if you say its safe  young mr bemis  oh im sure it is  miss lawton renewing her hold upon his hand  well then  perhaps i hurt you  young mr bemis  no no  you couldnt  miss lawton  how kind you are  mrs curwen opening her eyes  where   miller rapidly transferring her to mrs crashaw  still in the elevator mrs curwen  rising to his feet  something must be done  perhaps we had better unite in a cry  its ridiculous of course  but its the only thing we can do  now then  hello  miss lawton  papa  mrs crashaw  agneees  mrs curwen faintly  walter  the elevator boy  say  miller  oh that wont do  all join in hello  all  hello  miller  once more  all  hello  miller  once more  all  hello  miller  now wait a while  after an interval  no nobody coming  he takes out his watch  we must repeat this cry at intervals of a halfminute  now then  they all join in the cry repeating it as mr miller makes the signal with his lifted hand  miss lawton  oh its no use  mrs crashaw  they dont hear  mrs curwen  they wont hear  miller  now then three times  all  hello hello hello    iii    roberts appears at the outer door of his apartment on the fifth floor  it opens upon a spacious landing to which a wide staircase ascends at one side  at the other is seen the grated door to the shaft of the elevator  he peers about on all sides and listens for a moment before he speaks  roberts  hello yourself  miller invisibly from the shaft  is that you roberts  roberts  yes where in the world are you  miller  in the elevator  mrs crashaw  were all here edward  roberts  what  you aunt mary  mrs crashaw  yes

at the grating and walks the landing in agitation  just hold on a minute  miller  oh we shant stir  roberts  ill see what can be done  miller  well see quick please  we have plenty of time but we dont

thats true  and it would make a racket and alarm the housestaring desperately at the grated doorway of the shaft  if i could only find an elevator manan elevator builder  but of course they all live in the suburbs and theyre keeping christmas and it would take too long anyway  bemis  hadnt you better send for the police  it seems to me its a case for the authorities  lawton  ah there speaks the europeanized mind  they always leave the initiative to the authorities  go out and sound the firealarm roberts  its a case for the fire department  roberts  oh its all very well to joke dr lawton  why

from his house  oh he will helpi know he will  oh mr curwen the elevator is caught just below here with my aunt in it and mrs millers husband   lawton  and my girl  bemis  and my boy  mrs curwen calling up  and your wife  curwen horrorstruck  and my wife  oh heavenly powers what are we going to do  how shall we get them out  why dont they come up  all  they cant  curwen  cant  oh my goodness  he flies at the grating and kicks and beats it  roberts  hold on  whats the use of that  lawton  you couldnt get at them if you beat the door down  bemis  certainly not  they lay hands upon him and restrain him  curwen struggling  let me speak to my wife  will you prevent a husband from speaking to his own wife  mrs miller in blind admiration of his frenzy  yes thats just what i said  if some one had beaten the door in at once   mrs roberts  oh edward dear let him speak to his wife tearfully  think if i were there  roberts releasing him  he may speak to his wife all night  but he mustnt knock the house down  curwen rushing at the grating  caroline  can you hear me  are you safe  mrs curwen  perfectly  i had a little faint when we first stuck   curwen  faint  oh  mrs curwen  but i am all right now  curwen  well thats right  dont be frightened  theres no occasion for excitement  keep perfectly calm and collected  its the only waywhats that ringing  the sound of an electric bell is heard within the elevator  it increases in fury  mrs roberts and mrs miller  oh isnt it dreadful  the elevator boy  its somebody on the groundfloor callin the elevator  curwen  well never mind him  dont pay the slightest attention to him  let him go to the deuce  and caroline  mrs curwen  yes  curwen  iiive got your glove all right  mrs curwen  left you mean i hope  curwen  yes left dearest  i mean left  mrs curwen  eightbutton  curwen  yes  mrs curwen  light drab  curwen pulling a light yellow glove from his pocket  oh  he staggers away from the grating and stays himself against the wall the mistaken glove dangling limply from his hand  roberts lawton and bemis  ah ha ha ha  mrs roberts  oh for shame to laugh at such a time  mrs miller  when its a question of life and death  there  the ringings stopped  whats that  steps are heard mounting the stairway rapidly several treads at a time  mr campbell suddenly bursts into the group on the landing with a final bound from the stairway  oh  campbell  i cant find aunt mary agnes  i cant find anything not even the elevator  wheres the elevator  i rang for it down there till i was black in the face  mrs roberts  no wonder  its here  mrs miller  between this floor and the floor below  with my husband in it  curwen  and my wife  lawton  and my daughter  bemis  and my son  mrs roberts  and aunty  all  and its stuck fast  roberts  and the long and short of it is willis that we dont know how to get them out and we wish you would suggest some way  lawton  theres been a great tacit confidence among us in your executive ability and your inventive genius  mrs roberts  oh yes we know you can do it  mrs miller  if you cant nothing can save them  campbell going to the grating  miller  miller  well  campbell  start her up  miller  now look here campbell we are not going to stand that weve had enough of it  i speak for the whole elevator  dont you suppose that if it had been possible to start her up we   mrs curwen  we shouldnt have been at the moon by this time  campbell  well then start her down  miller  i never thought of that  to the elevator boy  start her down  to the people on the landing above  hurrah  shes off  campbell  well now start her up  a joint cry from the elevator  thank you well walk up this time  miller  here let us out at this landing  they are heard precipitately emerging with sighs and groans of relief on the floor below  mrs roberts devoutly  o willis it seems like an interposition of providence your coming just at this moment  campbell  interposition of common sense  these hydraulic elevators weaken sometimes and cant go any farther  roberts to the shipwrecked guests who arrive at the top of the stairs crestfallen spent and clinging to one another for support why didnt you think of starting her down some of you  mrs roberts welcoming them with kisses and handshakes  i should have thought it would occur to you at once  miller goaded to exasperation  did it occur to any of you  lawton with sublime impudence  it occurred to all of us  but we naturally supposed you had tried it  mrs miller taking possession of her husband  oh what a fright you have given us  miller  i given you  do you suppose i did it out of a joke or voluntarily  mrs roberts  aunty i dont know what to say to you  you ought to have been here long ago before anything happened  mrs crashaw  oh i can explain everything in due season  what i wish you to do now is to let me get at willis and kiss him  as campbell submits to her embrace  you dear good fellow  if it hadnt been for your presence of mind i dont know how we should ever have got out of that horrid pen  mrs curwen giving him her hand  as it isnt proper for me to kiss you  campbell  well i dont know  i dont wish to be too modest  mrs curwen  i think i shall have to vote you a service of plate  mrs roberts  come and look at the pattern of mine  and willis as you are the true hero of the occasion you shall take me in to dinner  and i am not going to let anybody go before you  she seizes his arm and leads the way from the landing into the apartment  roberts lawton and bemis follow stragglingly  mrs miller getting her husband to one side  when she fainted she fainted at you of course  what did you do  miller  who  i  oh  after a moments reflection  she came to  curwen getting his wife aside  when you fainted caroline who revived you  mrs curwen  who  me  oh  how should i know  i was insensible they wheel arm in arm and meet mr and mrs miller in the middle mrs curwen yields precedence with an ironical courtesy  after you mrs miller  mrs miller in a nervous inimical twitter  oh before the heroine of the lost elevator  mrs curwen dropping her husbands arm and taking mrs millers let us split the difference  mrs miller  delightful  i shall never forget the honor  mrs curwen  oh dont speak of honors  mr miller was so kind through all those terrible scenes in the elevator  mrs miller  ive no doubt you showed yourself duly grateful they pass in followed by their husbands  young mr bemis timidly  miss lawton in the elevator you asked me not to leave you  did youahmeani must ask you it may be my only chance if you meantnever  miss lawton dropping her head  iidontknow  young mr bemis  but if i wished never to leave you should you send me away  miss lawton with a shy sly upward glance at him  not in the elevator  young mr bemis  oh  mrs roberts reappearing at the door  why you goodfornothing young things why dont you come tooh excuse me  she reenters precipitately followed by her tardy guests on whom she casts a backward glance of sympathy  oh you neednt hurry
