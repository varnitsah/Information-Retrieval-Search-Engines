come out of the fire his grandfather forthwith gave him a sound beating that he might the better remember so unique a prodigy though perhaps in this case the rod had another application than the autobiographer chooses to disclose and was intended to fix in the pupils mind a lesson of veracity rather than of science the testimony to its mnemonic virtue remains nay so universally was it once believed that the senses and through them the faculties of observation and retention were quickened by an irritation of the cuticle that in france it was customary to whip the children annually at the boundaries of the parish lest the true place of them might ever be lost through neglect of so inexpensive a mordant for the memory from this practice the older school of critics would seem to have taken a hint for keeping fixed the limits of good taste and what was somewhat vaguely called classical english to mark these limits in poetry they set up as hermae the images they had made to them of dryden of pope and later of goldsmith here they solemnly castigated every new aspirant in verse who in turn performed the same function for the next generation thus helping to keep always sacred and immovable the ne plus ultra alike of inspiration and of the vocabulary though no two natures were ever much more unlike than those of dryden and pope and again of pope and goldsmith and no two styles except in such externals as could be easily caught and copied yet it was the fashion down even to the last generation to advise young writers to form themselves as it was called on these excellent models wordsworth himself began in this school and though there were glimpses here and there of a direct study of nature yet most of the epithets in his earlier pieces were of the traditional kind so fatal to poetry during great part of the last century and he indulged in that alphabetic personification which enlivens all such words as hunger solitude freedom by the easy magic of an initial capital    where the green apple shrivels on the spray   and pines the unripened pear in summers kindliest ray   even here content has fixed her smiling reign   with independence child of high disdain   exulting mid the winter of the skies   shy as the jealous chamois freedom flies   and often grasps her sword and often eyes  here we have every characteristic of the artificial method even to the triplet which swift hated so heartily as a vicious way of rhyming wherewith mr dryden abounded imitated by all the bad versifiers of charles the seconds reign wordsworth became indeed very early the leader of reform but like wesley he endeavored a reform within the establishment purifying the substance he retained the outward forms with a feeling rather than conviction that in poetry substance and form are but manifestations of the same inward life the one fused into the other in the vivid heat of their common expression wordsworth could never wholly shake off the influence of the century into which he was born he began by proposing a reform of the ritual but it went no further than an attempt to get rid of the words of latin original where the meaning was as well or better given in derivatives of the saxon he would have stricken out the assemble and left the meet together like wesley he might be compelled by necessity to a breach of the canon but like him he was never a willing schismatic and his singing robes were the full and flowing canonicals of the church by law established inspiration makes short work with the usage of the best authors and readymade elegances of diction but where wordsworth is not possessed by his demon as molière said of corneille he equals thomson in verbiage outmiltons milton in artifice of style and latinizes his diction beyond dryden the fact was that he took up his early opinions on instinct and insensibly modified them as he studied the masters of what may be called the middle period of english verse2 as a young man he disparaged virgil we talked a great deal of nonsense in those days he said when taken to task for it later in life at fiftynine he translated three books of the aeneid in emulation of dryden though falling far short of him in everything but closeness as he seems after a few years to have been convinced keats was the first resolute and wilful heretic the true founder of the modern school which admits no ciselizabethan authority save milton whose own english was formed upon those earlier models keats denounced the authors of that style which came in toward the close of the seventeenth century and reigned absolute through the whole of the eighteenth as                            a schism   nurtured by foppery and barbarism    who went about   holding a poor decrepit standard out   marked with most flimsy mottoes and in large   the name of one boileau  but keats had never then3 studied the writers of whom he speaks so contemptuously though he might have profited by so doing boileau would at least have taught him that flimsy would have been an apter epithet for the standard than for the mottoes upon it dryden was the author of that schism against which keats so vehemently asserts the claim of the orthodox teaching it had displaced he was far more just to boileau of whom keats had probably never read a word if i would only cross the seas he says i might find in france a living horace and a juvenal in the person of the admirable boileau whose numbers are excellent whose expressions are noble whose thoughts are just whose language is pure whose satire is pointed and whose sense is just what he borrows from the ancients he repays with usury of his own in coin as good and almost as universally valuable4  dryden has now been in his grave nearly a hundred and seventy years in the second class of english poets perhaps no one stands on the whole so high as he during his lifetime in spite of jealousy detraction unpopular politics and a suspicious change of faith his preeminence was conceded he was the earliest complete type of the purely literary man in the modern sense there is a singular unanimity in allowing him a certain claim to greatness which would be denied to men as famous and more readto pope or swift for example he is supposed in some way or other to have reformed english poetry it is now about half a century since the only uniform edition of his works was edited by scott no library is complete without him no name is more familiar than his and yet it may be suspected that few writers are more thoroughly buried in that great cemetery of the british poets if contemporary reputation be often deceitful posthumous fame may be generally trusted for it is a verdict made up of the suffrages of the select men in succeeding generations this verdict has been as good as unanimous in favor of dryden it is perhaps worth while to take a fresh observation of him to consider him neither as warning nor example but to endeavor to make out what it is that has given so lofty and firm a position to one of the most unequal inconsistent and faulty writers that ever lived he is a curious example of what we often remark of the living but rarely of the deadthat they get credit for what they might be quite as much as for what they areand posterity has applied to him one of his own rules of criticism judging him by the best rather than the average of his achievement a thing posterity is seldom wont to do on the losing side in politics it is true of his polemical writings as of burkeswhom in many respects he resembles and especially in that supreme quality of a reasoner that his mind gathers not only heat but clearness and expansion by its own motionthat they have won his battle for him in the judgment of after times  to us looking back at him he gradually becomes a singularly interesting and even picturesque figure he is in more senses than one in language in turn of thought in style of mind in the direction of his activity the first of the moderns he is the first literary man who was also a man of the world as we understand the term he succeeded ben jonson as the acknowledged dictator of wit and criticism as dr johnson after nearly the same interval succeeded him all ages are in some sense ages of transition but there are times when the transition is more marked more rapid and it is perhaps an ill fortune for a man of letters to arrive at maturity during such a period still more to represent in himself the change that is going on and to be an efficient cause in bringing it about unless like goethe he is of a singularly uncontemporaneous nature capable of being tutta in se romita and of running parallel with his time rather than being sucked into its current he will be thwarted in that harmonious development of native force which has so much to do with its steady and successful application dryden suffered no doubt in this way though in creed he seems to have drifted backward in an eddy of the general current yet of the intellectual movement of the time so far certainly as literature shared in it he could say with aeneas not only that he saw but that himself was a great part of it that movement was on the whole a downward one from faith to scepticism from enthusiasm to cynicism from the imagination to the understanding it was in a direction altogether away from those springs of imagination and faith at which they of the last age had slaked the thirst or renewed the vigor of their souls dryden himself recognized that indefinable and gregarious influence which we call nowadays the spirit of the age when he said that every age has a kind of universal genius5 he had also a just notion of that in which he lived for he remarks incidentally that all knowing ages are naturally sceptic and not at all bigoted which if i am not much deceived is the proper character of our own6 it may be conceived that he was even painfully halfaware of having fallen upon a time incapable not merely of a great poet but perhaps of any poet at all for nothing is so sensitive to the chill of a sceptical atmosphere as that enthusiasm which if it be not genius is at least the beautiful illusion that saves it from the baffling quibbles of selfconsciousness thrice unhappy he who horn to see things as they might be is schooled by circumstances to see them as people say they areto read god in a prose translation such was drydens lot and such for a good part of his days it was by his own choice he who was of a stature to snatch the torch of life that flashes from lifted hand to hand along the generations over the heads of inferior men chose rather to be a linkboy to the stews  as a writer for the stage he deliberately adopted and repeatedly reaffirmed the maxim that    he who lives to please must please to live  without earnest convictions no great or sound literature is conceivable but if dryden mostly wanted that inspiration which comes of belief in and devotion to something nobler and more abiding than the present moment and its petulant need he had at least the next best thing to thata thorough faith in himself he was moreover a man of singularly open soul and of a temper selfconfident enough to be candid even with himself his mind was growing to the last his judgment widening and deepening his artistic sense refining itself more and more he confessed his errors and was not ashamed to retrace his steps in search of that better knowledge which the omniscience of superficial study had disparaged surely an intellect that is still pliable at seventy is a phenomenon as interesting as it is rare but at whatever period of his life we look at dryden and whatever for the moment may have been his poetic creed there was something in the nature of the man that would not be wholly subdued to what it worked in there are continual glimpses of something in him greater than he hints of possibilities finer than anything he has done you feel that the whole of him was better than any random specimens though of his best seem to prove incessu patet he has by times the large stride of the elder race though it sinks too often into the slouch of a man who has seen better days his grand air may in part spring from a habit of easy superiority to his competitors but must also in part be ascribed to an innate dignity of character that this preeminence should have been so generally admitted during his life can only be explained by a bottom of good sense kindliness and sound judgment whose solid worth could afford that many a flurry of vanity petulance and even error should flit across the surface and be forgotten whatever else dryden may have been the last and abiding impression of him is that he was thoroughly manly and while it may be disputed whether he was a great poet it may be said of him as wordsworth said of burke that he was by far the greatest man of his age not only abounding in knowledge himself but feeding in various directions his most able contemporaries7  dryden was born in 1631 he was accordingly six years old when jonson died was nearly a quarter of a century younger than milton and may have personally known bishop hall the first english satirist who was living till 1656 on the other side he was older than swift by thirtysix than addison by fortyone and than pope by fiftyseven years dennis says that dryden for the last ten years of his life was much acquainted with addison and drank with him more than he ever used to do probably so far as to hasten his end being commonly an extreme sober man pope tell us that in his twelfth year he saw dryden perhaps at wills perhaps in the street as scott did burns dryden himself visited milton now and then and was intimate with davenant who could tell him of fletcher and jonson from personal recollection thus he stands between the age before and that which followed him giving a hand to each his father was a country clergyman of puritan leanings a younger son of an ancient county family the puritanism is thought to have come in with the poets greatgrandfather who made in his will the somewhat singular statement that he was assured by the holy ghost that he was elect of god it would appear from this that drydens selfconfidence was an inheritance the solid quality of his mind showed itself early he himself tells us that he had read polybius in english with the pleasure of a boy before he was ten years of age and yet even then had some dark notions of the prudence with which he conducted his design8 the concluding words are very characteristic even if dryden as men commonly do interpreted his boyish turn of mind by later selfknowledge we thus get a glimpse of him browsingfor like johnson burke and the full as distinguished from the learned men he was always a random reader9in his fathers library and painfully culling here and there a spray of his own proper nutriment from among the stubs and thorns of puritan divinity after such schooling as could be had in the country he was sent up to westminster school then under the headship of the celebrated dr busby here he made his first essays in verse translating among other school exercises of the same kind the third satire of persius in 1650 he was entered at trinity college cambridge and remained there for seven years the only record of his college life is a discipline imposed in 1652 for disobedience to the vicemaster and contumacy in taking his punishment inflicted by him whether this punishment was corporeal as johnson insinuates in the similar case of milton we are ignorant he certainly retained no very fond recollection of his alma mater for in his prologue to the university of oxford he says    oxford to him a dearer name shall be   than his own mother university   thebes did his green unknowing youth engage   he chooses athens in his riper age  by the death of his father in 1654 he came into possession of a small estate of sixty pounds a year from which however a third must be deducted for his mothers dower till 1676 after leaving cambridge he became secretary to his near relative sir gilbert pickering at that time cromwells chamberlain and a member of his upper house in 1670 he succeeded davenant as poet laureate10 and howell as historiographer with a yearly salary of two hundred pounds this place he lost at the revolution and had the mortification to see his old enemy and butt shadwell promoted to it as the best poet the whig party could muster if william was obliged to read the verses of his official minstrel dryden was more than avenged from 1688 to his death twelve years later he earned his bread manfully by his pen without any mean complaining and with no allusion to his fallen fortunes that is not dignified and touching these latter years during which he was his own man again were probably the happiest of his life in 1664 or 1665 he married lady elizabeth howard daughter of the earl of berkshire about a hundred pounds a year were thus added to his income the marriage is said not to have been a happy one and perhaps it was not for his wife was apparently a weakminded woman but the inference from the internal evidence of drydens plays as of shakespeares is very untrustworthy ridicule of marriage having always been a common stock in trade of the comic writers  the earliest of his verses that have come down to us were written upon the death of lord hastings and are as bad as they can bea kind of parody on the worst of donne they have every fault of his manner without a hint of the subtile and often profound thought that more than redeems it as the doctor himself would have said here is donne outdone the young nobleman died of the smallpox and dryden exclaims pathetically    was there no milder way than the smallpox   the very filthiness of pandoras box  he compares the pustules to rosebuds stuck i the lily skin about and says that    each little pimple had a tear in it   to wail the fault its rising did commit  but he has not done his worst yet by a great deal what follows is even finer    no comet need foretell his change drew on   whose corpse might seem a constellation   o had he died of old how great a strife   had been who from his death should draw their life   who should by one rich draught become whateer   seneca cato numa caesar were   learned virtuous pious great and have by this   an universal metempsychosis   must all these aged sires in one funeral   expire all die in one so young so small  it is said that one of allstons early pictures was brought to him after he had long forgotten it and his opinion asked as to the wisdom of the young artists persevering in the career he had chosen allston advised his quitting it forthwith as hopeless could the same experiment have been tried with these verses upon dryden can any one doubt that his counsel would have been the same it should be remembered however that he was barely turned eighteen when they were written and the tendency of his style is noticeable in so early an abandonment of the participial ed in learned and aged in the next year he appears again in some commendatory verses prefixed to the sacred epigrams of his friend john hoddesdon in these he speaks of the author as a    young eaglet who thy nest thus soon forsook   so lofty and divine a course hast took   as all admire before the down begin   to peep as yet upon thy smoother chin  here is almost every fault which drydens later nicety would have condemned but perhaps there is no schooling so good for an author as his own youthful indiscretions after this effort dryden seems to have lain fallow for ten years and then he at length reappears in thirtyseven heroic stanzas on the death of cromwell the versification is smoother but the conceits are there again though in a milder form the verse is modelled after gondibert a single image from nature he was almost always happy in these gives some hint of the maturer dryden    and wars like mists that rise against the sun   made him but greater seem not greater grow  two other verses    and the isle when her protecting genius went   upon his obsequies loud sighs conferred  are interesting because they show that he had been studying the early poems of milton he has contrived to bury under a rubbish of verbiage one of the most purely imaginative passages ever written by the great puritan poet           from haunted spring and dale           edged with poplar pale   the parting genius is with sighing sent  this is the more curious because twentyfour years afterwards he says in defending rhyme whatever causes he milton alleges for the abolishment of rhyme his own particular reason is plainly this that rhyme was not his talent he had neither the ease of doing it nor the graces of it which is manifest in his juvenilia  where his rhyme is always constrained and forced and comes hardly from him at an age when the soul is most pliant and the passion of love makes almost every man a rhymer though not a poet11 it was this no doubt that heartened dr johnson to say of lycidas that the diction was harsh the rhymes uncertain and the numbers unpleasing it is drydens excuse that his characteristic excellence is to argue persuasively and powerfully whether in verse or prose and that he was amply endowed with the most needful quality of an advocateto be always strongly and wholly of his present way of thinking whatever it might be next we have in 1660 astraea redux on the happy restoration of charles ii in this also we can forebode little of the fullgrown dryden but his defects we see his tendency to exaggeration and to confound physical with metaphysical as where he says of the ships that brought home the royal brothers that                             the joyful london meets   the princely york himself alone a freight   the swiftsure groans beneath great glosters weight  and speaks of the                                  repeated prayer   which stormed the skies and ravished charles from thence  there is also a certain everydayness not to say vulgarity of phrase which dryden never wholly refined away and which continually tempts us to sum up at once against him as the greatest poet that ever was or could be made wholly out of prose    heaven would no bargain for its blessings drive  is an example on the other hand there are a few verses almost worthy of his best days as these    some lazy ages lost in sleep and ease   no action leave to busy chronicles   such whose supine felicity but makes   in story chasms in epochas mistakes   oer whom time gently shakes his wings of down   till with his silent sickle they are mown  these are all the more noteworthy that dryden unless in argument is seldom equal for six lines together in the poem to lord clarendon 1662 there are four verses that have something of the energy divine for which pope praised his master    let envy then those crimes within you see   from which the happy never must be free   envy that does with misery reside   the joy and the revenge of ruined pride  in his aurengzebe 1675 there is a passage of which as it is a good example of dryden i shall quote the whole though my purpose aims mainly at the latter verses    when i consider life t is all a cheat   yet fooled with hope men favor the deceit   trust on and think tomorrow will repay   tomorrows falser than the former day   lies worse and while it says we shall be blest   with some new joys cuts off what we possest   strange cozenage none would live past years again   yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain   and from the dregs of life think to receive   what the first sprightly running could not give   im tired of waiting for this chymic gold   which fools us young and beggars us when old  the first sprightly running of drydens vintage was it must be confessed a little muddy if not beery but if his own soil did not produce grapes of the choicest flavor he knew where they were to be had and his product like sound wine grew better the longer it stood upon the lees he tells us evidently thinking of himself that in a poet from fifty to threescore the balance generally holds even in our colder climates for he loses not much in fancy and judgment which is the effect of observation still increases his succeeding years afford him little more than the stubble of his own harvest yet if his constitution be healthful his mind may still retain a decent vigor and the gleanings of that of ephraim in comparison with others will surpass the vintage of abiezer12 since chaucer none of our poets has had a constitution more healthful and it was his old age that yielded the best of him in him the understanding was perhaps in overplus for his entire good fortune as a poet and that is a faculty among the earliest to mature we have seen him at only ten years divining the power of reason in polybius13 the same turn of mind led him later to imitate the french school of tragedy and to admire in ben jonson the most correct of english poets it was his imagination that needed quickening and it is very curious to trace through his different prefaces the gradual opening of his eyes to the causes of the solitary preeminence of shakespeare at first he is sensible of an attraction towards him which he cannot explain and for which he apologizes as if it were wrong but he feels himself drawn more and more strongly till at last he ceases to resist altogether and is forced to acknowledge that there is something in this one man that is not and never was anywhere else something not to be reasoned about ineffable divine if contrary to the rules so much the worse for them it may be conjectured that drydens puritan associations may have stood in the way of his more properly poetic culture and that his early knowledge of shakespeare was slight he tells us that davenant whom he could not have known before he himself was twentyseven first taught him to admire the great poet but even after his imagination had become conscious of its prerogative and his expression had been ennobled by frequenting this higher society we find him continually dropping back into that sermo pedestris which seems on the whole to have been his more natural element we always feel his epoch in him that he was the lock which let our language down from its point of highest poetry to its level of easiest and most gently flowing prose his enthusiasm needs the contagion of other minds to arouse it but his strong sense his command of the happy word his wit which is distinguished by a certain breadth and as it were power of generalization as popes by keenness of edge and point were his whether he would or no accordingly his poetry is often best and his verse more flowing where as in parts of his version of the twentyninth ode of the third book of horace he is amplifying the suggestions of another mind14 viewed from one side he justifies miltons remark of him that he was a good rhymist but no poet to look at all sides and to distrust the verdict of a single mood is no doubt the duty of a critic but how if a certain side be so often presented as to thrust forward in the memory and disturb it in the effort to recall that total impression for the office of a critic is not though often so misunderstood to say guilty or not guilty of some particular fact which is the only safe ground of judgment it is the weight of the whole man not of one or the other limb of him that we want expende hannibalem very good but not in a scale capacious only of a single quality at a time for it is their union and not their addition that assures the value of each separately it was not this or that which gave him his weight in council his swiftness of decision in battle that outran the forethought of other menit was hannibal but this prosaic element in dryden will force itself upon me as i read him i cannot help thinking of an ostrich to be classed with flying things and capable what with leap and flap together of leaving the earth for a longer or shorter space but loving the open plain where wing and foot help each other to something that is both flight and run at once what with his haste and a certain dash which according to our mood we may call florid or splendid he seems to stand among poets where rubens does among paintersgreater perhaps as a colorist than an artist yet great here also if we compare him with any but the first  we have arrived at drydens thirtysecond year and thus far have found little in him to warrant an augury that he was ever to be one of the great names in english literature the most perfect type that is of his class and that class a high one though not the highest if joseph de maistres axiom qui na pas vaincu à trente ans ne vaincra jamais were true there would be little hope of him for he has won no battle yet but there is something solid and doughty in the man that can rise from defeat the stuff of which victories are made in due time when we are able to choose our position better and the sun is at our back hitherto his performances have been mainly of the obbligato sort at which few men of original force are good least of all dryden who had always something of stiffness in his strength waller had praised the living cromwell in perhaps the manliest verses he ever wrotenot very manly to be sure but really elegant and on the whole better than those in which dryden squeezed out melodious tears waller who had also made himself conspicuous as a volunteer antony to the country squire turned caesar    with ermine clad and purple let him hold   a royal sceptre made of spanish gold  was more servile than dryden in hailing the return of ex officio majesty he bewails to charles in snuffling heroics             our sorrow and our crime   to have accepted life so long a time   without you here  a weak man put to the test by rough and angry times as waller was may be pitied but meanness is nothing but contemptible under any circumstances if it be true that every conqueror creates a muse cromwell was unfortunate even miltons sonnet though dignified is reserved if not distrustful marvells horatian ode the most truly classic in our language is worthy of its theme the same poets elegy in parts noble and everywhere humanly tender is worth more than all carlyles biography as a witness to the gentler qualities of the hero and of the deep affection that stalwart nature could inspire in hearts of truly masculine temper as it is little known a few verses of it may be quoted to show the difference between grief that thinks of its object and grief that thinks of its rhymes    valor religion friendship prudence died   at once with him and all thats good beside   and we deaths refuse natures dregs confined   to loathsome life alas are left behind   where we so once we used shall now no more   to fetch day press about his chamberdoor   no more shall hear that powerful language charm   whose force oft spared the labor of his arm   no more shall follow where he spent the days   in war or counsel or in prayer and praise                                         i saw him dead a leaden slumber lies   and mortal sleep over those wakeful eyes   those gentle rays under the lids were fled   which through his looks that piercing sweetness shed   that port which so majestic was and strong   loose and deprived of vigor stretched along   all withered all discolored pale and wan   how much another thing no more that man   o human glory vain o death o wings   o worthless world o transitory things   yet dwelt that greatness in his shape decayed   that still though dead greater than death he laid   and in his altered face you something feign   that threatens death he yet will live again  such verses might not satisfy lindley murray but they are of that higher mood which satisfies the heart these couplets too have an energy worthy of miltons friend    when up the armëd mountains of dunbar   he marched and through deep severn ending war    thee many ages hence in martial verse   shall the english soldier ere he charge rehearse  on the whole one is glad that drydens panegyric on the protector was so poor it was purely official versemaking had there been any feeling in it there had been baseness in his address to charles as it is we may fairly assume that he was so far sincere in both cases as to be thankful for a chance to exercise himself in rhyme without much caring whether upon a funeral or a restoration he might naturally enough expect that poetry would have a better chance under charles than under cromwell or any successor with commonwealth principles cromwell had more serious matters to think about than verses while charles might at least care as much about them as it was in his base goodnature to care about anything but loose women and spaniels drydens sound sense afterwards so conspicuous shows itself even in these pieces when we can get at it through the tangled thicket of tropical phrase but the authentic and unmistakable dryden first manifests himself in some verses addressed to his friend dr charlton in 1663 we have first his common sense which has almost the point of wit yet with a tang of prose    the longest tyranny that ever swayed   was that wherein our ancestors betrayed   their freeborn reason to the stagyrite   and made his torch their universal light   so truth while only one supplied the state   grew scarce and dear and yet sophisticate   still it was bought like empric wares or charms   hard words sealed up with aristotles arms  then we have his graceful sweetness of fancy where he speaks of the inhabitants of the new world    guiltless men who danced away their time   fresh as their groves and happy as their clime  and finally there is a hint of imagination where mighty visions of the danish race watch round charles sheltered in stonehenge after the battle of worcester these passages might have been written by the dryden whom we learn to know fifteen years later they have the advantage that he wrote them to please himself his contemporary dr heylin said of french cooks that their trade was not to feed the belly but the palate dryden was a great while in learning this secret as available in good writing as in cookery he strove after it but his thoroughly english nature to the last would too easily content itself with serving up the honest beef of his thought without regard to daintiness of flavor in the dressing of it15 of the best english poetry it might be said that it is understanding aërated by imagination in dryden the solid part too often refused to mix kindly with the leaven either remaining lumpish or rising to a hasty puffiness grace and lightness were with him much more a laborious achievement than a natural gift and it is all the more remarkable that he should so often have attained to what seems such an easy perfection in both always a hasty writer16 he was long in forming his style and to the last was apt to snatch the readiest word rather than wait for the fittest he was not wholly and unconsciously poet but a thinker who sometimes lost himself on enchanted ground and was transfigured by its touch this preponderance in him of the reasoning over the intuitive faculties the one always there the other flashing in when you least expect it accounts for that inequality and even incongruousness in his writing which makes one revise his judgment at every tenth page in his prose you come upon passages that persuade you he is a poet in spite of his verses so often turning states evidence against him as to convince you he is none he is a prosewriter with a kind of aeolian attachment for example take this bit of prose from the dedication of his version of virgils pastorals 1694 he found the strength of his genius betimes and was even in his youth preluding to his georgicks and his aeneis he could not forbear to try his wings though his pinions were not hardened to maintain a long laborious flight yet sometimes they bore him to a pitch as lofty as ever he was able to reach afterwards but when he was admonished by his subject to descend he came down gently circling in the air and singing to the ground like a lark melodious in her mounting and continuing her song till she alights still preparing for a higher flight at her next sally and tuning her voice to better music this is charming and yet even this wants the ethereal tincture that pervades the style of jeremy taylor making it as burke said of sheridans eloquence neither prose nor poetry but something better than either let us compare taylors treatment of the same image for so have i seen a lark rising from his bed of grass and soaring upwards singing as he rises and hopes to get to heaven and climb above the clouds but the poor bird was beaten back by the loud sighings of an eastern wind and his motion made irregular and inconstant descending more at every breath of the tempest than it could recover by the libration and frequent weighing of his wings till the little creature was forced to sit down and pant and stay till the storm was over and then it made a prosperous flight and did rise and sing as if it had learned music and motion of an angel as he passed sometimes through the air about his ministries here below taylors fault is that his sentences too often smell of the library but what an open air is here how unpremeditated it all seems how carelessly he knots each new thought as it comes to the one before it with an and like a girl making lace and what a slidingly musical use he makes of the sibilants with which our language is unjustly taxed by those who can only make them hiss not sing there are twelve of them in the first twenty words fifteen of which are monsyllables we notice the structure of drydens periods but this grows up as we read it gushes like the song of the bird itself    in profuse strains of unpremeditated art  let us now take a specimen of drydens bad prose from one of his poems i open the annus mirabilis at random and hit upon this    our little fleet was now engaged so far   that like the swordfish in the whale they fought   the combat only seemed a civil war   till through their bowels we our passage wrought  is this dryden or sternhold or shadwell those toms who made him say that dulness was fatal to the name of tom the natural history of goldsmith in the verse of pye his thoughts did not voluntary move harmonious numbers he had his choice between prose and verse and seems to be poetical on second thought i do not speak without book he was more than half conscious of it himself in the same letter to mrs steward just cited he says i am still drudging on always a poet and never a good one and this from no mockmodesty for he is always handsomely frank in telling us whatever of his own doing pleased him this was written in the last year of his life and at about the same time he says elsewhere what judgment i had increases rather than diminishes and thoughts such as they are come crowding in so fast upon me that my only difficulty is to choose or to reject to run them into verse or to give them the other harmony of prose i have so long studied and practised both that they are grown into a habit and become familiar to me17 i think that a man who was primarily a poet would hardly have felt this equanimity of choice  i find a confirmation of this feeling about dryden in his early literary loves his taste was not an instinct but the slow result of reflection and of the manfulness with which he always acknowledged to himself his own mistakes in this latter respect few men deal so magnanimously with themselves as he and accordingly few have been so happily inconsistent ancora imparo might have served him for a motto as well as michael angelo his prefaces are a complete log of his life and the habit of writing them was a useful one to him for it forced him to think with a pen in his hand which according to goethe if it do no other good keeps the mind from staggering about in these prefaces we see his taste gradually rising from du bartas to spenser from cowley to milton from corneille to shakespeare i remember when i was a boy he says in his dedication of the spanish friar 1681 i thought inimitable spenser a mean poet in comparison of sylvesters du bartas and was rapt into an ecstasy when i read these lines    now when the winters keener breath began   to crystallize the baltic ocean   to glaze the lakes to bridle up the floods   and periwig with snow18 the baldpate woods  i am much deceived if this be not abominable fustian swift in his tale of a tub has a ludicrous passage in this style look on this globe of earth you will find it to be a very complete and fashionable dress what is that which some call land but a fine coat faced with green or the sea but a waistcoat of watertabby proceed to the particular works of creation you will find how curious journeyman nature has been to trim up the vegetable beaux observe how sparkish a periwig adorns the head of a beech and what a fine doublet of white satin is worn by the birch the fault is not in any inaptness of the images nor in the mere vulgarity of the things themselves but in that of the associations they awaken the prithee undo this button of lear coming where it does and expressing what it does is one of those touches of the pathetically sublime of which only shakespeare ever knew the secret herrick too has a charming poem on  julias petticoat the charm being that he lifts the familiar and the low to the region of sentiment in the passage from sylvester it is precisely the reverse and the wig takes as much from the sentiment as it adds to a lord chancellor so popes proverbial verse    true wit is nature to advantage drest  unpleasantly suggests nature under the hands of a ladysmaid19 we have no word in english that will exactly define this want of propriety in diction vulgar is too strong and commonplace too weak perhaps bourgeois comes as near as any it is to be noticed that dryden does not unequivocally condemn the passage he quotes but qualifies it with an if i am not much mistaken indeed though his judgment in substantials like that of johnson is always worth having his taste the negative half of genius never altogether refined itself from a colloquial familiarity which is one of the charms of his prose and gives that air of easy strength in which his satire is unmatched in his royal martyr 1669 the tyrant maximin says to the gods    keep you your rain and sunshine in the skies   and ill keep back my flame and sacrifice   your trade of heaven shall soon be at a stand   and all your goods lie dead upon your hand  a passage which has as many faults as only dryden was capable of committing even to a false idiom forced by the last rhyme the same tyrant in dying exclaims                        and after thee ill go   revenging still and following een to th other world my blow   and shoving back this earth on which i sit   ill mount and scatter all the gods i hit  in the conquest of grenada 1670 we have    this little loss in our vast body shews   so small that half have never heard the news   fames out of breath eer she can fly so far   to tell em all that you have eer made war20  and in the same play    that busy thing   the soul is packing up and just on wing   like parting swallows when they seek the spring  where the last sweet verse curiously illustrates that inequality poetry on a prose background which so often puzzles us in dryden infinitely worse is the speech of almanzor to his mothers ghost    ill rush into the covert of the night   and pull thee backward by the shroud to light   or else ill squeeze thee like a bladder there   and make thee groan thyself away to air  what wonder that dryden should have been substituted for davenant as the butt of the rehearsal and that the parody should have had such a run and yet it was dryden who in speaking of persius hit upon the happy phrase of boisterous metaphors21 it was dryden who said of cowley whom he elsewhere calls the darling of my youth22 that he was sunk in reputation because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way but swept like a dragnet great and small23 but the passages i have thus far cited as specimens of our poets coarseness for poet he surely was intus though not always in cute were written before he was forty and he had an odd notion suitable to his healthy complexion that poets on the whole improve after that date man at forty he says seems to be fully in his summer tropic  and i believe that it will hold in all great poets that though they wrote before with a certain heat of genius which inspired them yet that heat was not perfectly digested24 but artificial heat is never to be digested at all as is plain in drydens case he was a man who warmed slowly and in his hurry to supply the market forced his mind the result was the same after forty as before in oedipus 1679 we find                                                not one bolt   shall err from thebes but more be called for more   newmoulded thunder of a larger size  this play was written in conjunction with lee of whom dryden relates25 that when some one said to him it is easy enough to write like a madman he replied no it is hard to write like a madman but easy enough to write like a foolperhaps the most compendious lecture on poetry ever delivered the splendid bit of eloquence which has so much the sheetiron clang of impeachment thunder i hope that dryden is not in the library of congress is perhaps lees the following passage almost certainly is his    sure tis the end of all things fate has torn   the lock of time off and his head is now   the ghastly ball of round eternity  but the next in which the soul is likened to the pocket of an indignant housemaid charged with theft is wholly in drydens manner    no i dare challenge heaven to turn me outward       and shake my soul quite empty in your sight  in the same style he makes his don sebastian 1690 say that he is as much astonished as drowsy mortals at the last trump    when called in haste they fumble for their limbs  and propose to take upon himself the whole of a crime shared with another by asking heaven to charge the bill on him and in king arthur written ten years after the preface from which i have quoted his confession about dubartas we have a passage precisely of the kind he condemned                   ah for the many souls as but this morn   were clothed with flesh and warmed with vital blood   but naked now or shirted but with air  dryden too often violated his own admirable rule that an author is not to write all he can but only all he ought26 in his worst images however there is often a vividness that half excuses them but it is a grotesque vividness as from the flare of a bonfire they do not flash into sudden lustre as in the great poets where the imaginations of poet and reader leap toward each other and meet halfway  english prose is indebted to dryden for having freed it from the cloister of pedantry he more than any other single writer contributed as well by precept as example to give it suppleness of movement and the easier air of the modern world his own style juicy with proverbial phrases has that familiar dignity so hard to attain perhaps unattainable except by one who like dryden feels that his position is assured charles cotton is as easy but not so elegant walton as familiar but not so flowing swift as idiomatic but not so elevated burke more splendid but not so equally luminous that his style was no easy acquisition though of course the aptitude was innate he himself tells us in his dedication of troilus and cressida 1679 where he seems to hint at the erection of an academy he says that the perfect knowledge of a tongue was never attained by any single person the court the college and the town must all be joined in it and as our english is a composition of the dead and living tongues there is required a perfect knowledge not only of the greek and latin but of the old german french and italian and to help all these a conversation with those authors of our own who have written with the fewest faults in prose and verse but how barbarously we yet write and speak your lordship knows and i am sufficiently sensible in my own english27 for i am often put to a stand in considering whether what i write be the idiom of the tongue or false grammar and nonsense couched beneath that specious name of anglicism and have no other way to clear my doubts but by translating my english into latin and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in a more stable language tantae molis erat five years later the proprieties and delicacies of the english are known to few it is impossible even for a good wit to understand and practise them without the help of a liberal education long reading and digesting of those few good authors we have amongst us the knowledge of men and manners the freedom of habitudes and conversation with the best company of both sexes and in short without wearing off the rust which he contracted while he was laying in a stock of learning in the passage i have italicized it will be seen that dryden lays some stress upon the influence of women in refining language swift also in his plan for an academy says now though i would by no means give the ladies the trouble of advising us in the reformation of our language yet i cannot help thinking that since they have been left out of all meetings except parties at play or where worse designs are carried on our conversation has very much degenerated28 swift affirms that the language had grown corrupt since the restoration and that the court which used to be the standard of propriety and correctness of speech was then and i think has ever since continued the worst school in england29 he lays the blame partly on the general licentiousness partly upon the french education of many of charless courtiers and partly on the poets dryden undoubtedly formed his diction by the usage of the court the age was a very freeandeasy not to say a very coarse one its coarseness was not external like that of elizabeths day but the outward mark of an inward depravity what swifts notion of the refinement of women was may be judged by his anecdotes of stella i will not say that drydens prose did not gain by the conversational elasticity which his frequenting men and women of the world enabled him to give it it is the best specimen of everyday style that we have but the habitual dwelling of his mind in a commonplace atmosphere and among those easy levels of sentiment which befitted wills coffeehouse and the birdcage walk was a damage to his poetry solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character he cannot always distinguish between enthusiasm and extravagance when he sees them but apart from these influences which i have adduced in exculpation there was certainly a vein of coarseness in him a want of that exquisite sensitiveness which is the conscience of the artist an old gentleman writing to the gentlemans magazine in 1745 professes to remember plain john dryden before he paid his court with success to the great in one uniform clothing of norwich drugget i have eat tarts at the mulberry garden with him and madam reeve when our author advanced to a sword and chadreux wig30 i always fancy dryden in the drugget with wig lace ruffles and sword superimposed it is the type of this curiously incongruous man  the first poem by which dryden won a general acknowledgment of his power was the annus mirabilis written in his thirtyseventh year  pepys himself not altogether a bad judge doubtless expresses the common opinion when he says i am very well pleased this night with reading a poem i brought home with me last night from westminster hall of drydens upon the present war a very good poem31 and a very good poem in some sort it continues to be in spite of its amazing blemishes we must always bear in mind that dryden lived in an age that supplied him with no readymade inspiration and that big phrases and images are apt to be pressed into the service when great ones do not volunteer with this poem begins the long series of drydens prefaces of which swift made such excellent though malicious fun that i cannot forbear to quote it i do utterly disapprove and declare against that pernicious custom of making the preface a bill of fare to the book for i have always looked upon it as a high point of indiscretion in monstermongers and other retailers of strange sights to hang out a fair picture over the door drawn after the life with a most eloquent description underneath this has saved me many a threepence such is exactly the fate at this time of prefaces this expedient was admirable at first our great dryden has long carried it as far as it would go and with incredible success he has often said to me in confidence that the world would never have suspected him to be so great a poet if he had not assured them so frequently in his prefaces that it was impossible they could either doubt or forget it perhaps it may be so however i much fear his instructions have edified out of their place and taught men to grow wiser in certain points where he never intended they should32 the monstermongers is a terrible thrust when we remember some of the comedies and heroic plays which dryden ushered in this fashion in the dedication of the annus to the city of london is one of those pithy sentences of which dryden is ever afterwards so full and which he lets fall with a carelessness that seems always to deepen the meaning i have heard indeed of some virtuous persons who have ended unfortunately but never of any virtuous nation providence is engaged too deeply when the cause becomes so general in his account of the poem in a letter to sir robert howard he says i have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme because i have ever judged them more noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and number than any other verse in use amongst us the learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme but in this  necessity of our rhymes i  have always found the couplet verse most easy though not so proper for this occasion for there the work is sooner at an end every two lines concluding the labor of the poet a little further on they the french write in alexandrines or verses of six feet such as amongst us is the old translation of homer by chapman all which by lengthening their chain33 makes the sphere of their activity the greater i have quoted these passages because in a small compass they include several things characteristic of dryden i have ever judged and i have always found are particularly so if he took up an opinion in the morning he would have found so many arguments for it before night that it would seem already old and familiar so with his reproach of rhyme a year or two before he was eagerly defending it34 again a few years and he will utterly condemn and drop it in his plays while retaining it in his translations afterwards his study of milton leads him to think that blank verse would suit the epic style better and he proposes to try it with homer but at last translates one book as a specimen and behold it is in rhyme but the charm of this great advocate is that whatever side he was on he could always find excellent reasons for it and state them with great force and abundance of happy illustration he is an exception to the proverb and is none the worse pleader than he is always pleading his own cause the blunder about chapman is of a kind into which his hasty temperament often betrayed him he remembered that chapmans iliad was in a long measure concluded without looking that it was alexandrine and then attributes it generally to his homer chapmans iliad is done in fourteensyllable verse and his odyssee in the very metre that dryden himself used in his own version35 i remark also what he says of the couplet that it was easy because the second verse concludes the labor of the poet and yet it was dryden who found it hard for that very reason his vehement abundance refused those narrow banks first running over into a triplet and even then uncontainable rising to an alexandrine in the concluding verse and i have little doubt that it was the roominess rather than the dignity of the quatrain which led him to choose it as apposite to this i may quote what he elsewhere says of octosyllabic verse the thought can turn itself with greater ease in a larger compass when the rhyme comes too thick upon us it straightens the expression we are thinking of the close when we should be employed in adorning the thought it makes a poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for his imagination36  dryden himself as was not always the case with him was well satisfied with his work he calls it his best hitherto and attributes his success to the excellence of his subject incomparably the best he had ever had excepting only the royal family the first part is devoted to the dutch war the last to the fire of london the martial half is infinitely the better of the two he altogether surpasses his model davenant if his poem lack the gravity of thought attained by a few stanzas of gondibert it is vastly superior in life in picturesqueness in the energy of single lines and above all in imagination few men have read gondibert and almost every one speaks of it as commonly of the dead with a certain subdued respect and it deserves respect as an honest effort to bring poetry back to its highest office in the ideal treatment of life davenant emulated spenser and if his poem had been as good as his preface it could still be read in another spirit than that of investigation as it is it always reminds me of goldsmiths famous verse it is remote unfriendly solitary and above all slow its shining passages for there are such remind one of distressrockets sent up at intervals from a ship just about to founder and sadden rather than cheer37  the first part of the annus mirabilis is by no means clear of the false taste of the time38 though it has some of drydens manliest verses and happiest comparisons always his two distinguishing merits here as almost everywhere else in dryden measuring him merely as poet we recall what he with pathetic pride says of himself in the prologue to aurengzebe    let him retire betwixt two ages cast   the first of this the hindmost of the last  what can be worse than what he says of comets    whether they unctuous exhalations are   fired by the sun or seeming so alone   or each some more remote and slippery star   which loses footing when to mortals shown  or than this of the destruction of the dutch india ships    amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball   and now their odors armed against them fly   some preciously by shattered porcelain fall   and some by aromatic splinters die  dear dr johnson had his doubts about shakespeare but here at least was poetry this is one of the quatrains which he pronounces worthy of our author39  but dryden himself has said that a man who is resolved to praise an author with any appearance of justice must be sure to take him on the strongest side and where he is least liable to exceptions this is true also of one who wishes to measure an author fairly for the higher wisdom of criticism lies in the capacity to admire    leser wie gefall ich dir   leser wie gefällst du mir  are both fair questions the answer to the first being more often involved in that to the second than is sometimes thought the poet in dryden was never more fully revealed than in such verses as these    and threatening france placed like a painted jove40   kept idle thunder in his lifted hand    silent in smoke of cannon they come on    and his loud guns speak thick like angry men    the vigorous seaman every porthole plies   and adds his heart to every gun he fires    and though to me unknown they sure fought well   whom rupert led and who were british born  this is masculine writing and yet it must be said that there is scarcely a quatrain in which the rhyme does not trip him into a platitude and there are too many swaggering with that expression forte dun sentiment faible which voltaire condemns in corneillea temptation to which dryden always lay too invitingly open but there are passages higher in kind than any i have cited because they show imagination such are the verses in which he describes the dreams of the disheartened enemy    in dreams they fearful precipices tread   or shipwrecked labor to some distant shore   or in dark churches walk among the dead  and those in which he recalls glorious memories and sees where    the mighty ghosts of our great harries rose   and armëd edwards looked with anxious eyes  a few verses like the pleasantly alliterative one in which he makes the spider from the silent ambush of his den feel far off the trembling of his thread show that he was beginning to study the niceties of verse instead of trusting wholly to what he would have called his natural fougue on the whole this part of the poem is very good war poetry as war poetry goes for there is but one firstrate poem of the kind in englishshort national eager as if the writer were personally engaged with the rapid metre of a drum beating the chargeand that is draytons battle of agincourt41 but it shows more study of lucan than of virgil and for a long time yet we shall find dryden bewildered by bad models he is always imitatingno that is not the word always emulatingsomebody in his more strictly poetical attempts for in that direction he always needed some external impulse to set his mind in motion this is more or less true of all authors nor does it detract from their originality which depends wholly on their being able so far to forget themselves as to let something of themselves slip into what they write42 of absolute originality we will not speak till authors are raised by some deucalionandpyrrha process and even then our faith would be small for writers who have no past are pretty sure of having no future dryden at any rate always had to have his copy set him at the top of the page and wrote ill or well accordingly his mind somewhat solid for a poet warmed slowly but once fairly heated through he had more of that goodluck of selfoblivion than most men he certainly gave even a liberal interpretation to molières rule of taking his own property wherever he found it though he sometimes blundered awkwardly about what was properly his but in literature it should be remembered a thing always becomes his at last who says it best and thus makes it his own43  mr savage landor once told me that he said to wordsworth mr wordsworth a man may mix poetry with prose as much as he pleases and it will only elevate and enliven but the moment he mixes a particle of prose with his poetry it precipitates the whole wordsworth he added never forgave him the always hasty dryden as i think i have already said was liable like a careless apothecarys prentice to make the same confusion of ingredients especially in the more mischievous way i cannot leave the annus mirabilis without giving an example of this describing the dutch prizes rather like an auctioneer than a poet he says that    some english wool vexed in a belgian loom   and into cloth of spongy softness made   did into france or colder denmark doom   to ruin with worse ware our staple trade  one might fancy this written by the secretary of a board of trade in an unguarded moment but we should remember that the poem is dedicated to the city of london the depreciation of the rival fabrics is exquisite and dryden the most english of our poets would not be so thoroughly english if he had not in him some fibre of la nation boutiquière let us now see how he succeeds in attempting to infuse science the most obstinately prosy material with poetry speaking of a more exact knowledge of the longitudes as he explains in a note he tells us that    then we upon our globes last verge shall go   and view the ocean leaning on the sky   from thence our rolling neighbors we shall know   and on the lunar world securely pry  dr johnson confesses that he does not understand this why should he when it is plain that dryden was wholly in the dark himself to understand it is none of my business but i confess that it interests me as an americanism we have hitherto been credited as the inventors of the jumpingoff place at the extreme western verge of the world but dryden was beforehand with us though he doubtless knew that the earth was a sphere and perhaps that it was flattened at the poles it was always a flat surface in his fancy in his amphitryon he makes alcmena say    no i would fly thee to the ridge of earth   and leap the precipice to scape thy sight  and in his spanish friar lorenzo says to elvira that they will travel together to the ridge of the world and then drop together into the next it is idle for us poor yankees to hope that we can invent anything to say sooth if dryden had left nothing behind him but the annus mirabilis he might have served as a type of the kind of poet america would have produced by the biggestriverandtallestmountain recipelongitude and latitude in plenty with marks of culture scattered here and there like the carets on a proofsheet  it is now time to say something of dryden as a dramatist in the thirtytwo years between 1662 and 1694 he produced twentyfive plays and assisted lee in two i have hinted that it took dryden longer than most men to find the true bent of his genius on a superficial view he might almost seem to confirm that theory maintained by johnson among others that genius was nothing more than great intellectual power exercised persistently in some particular direction which chance decided so that it lay in circumstance merely whether a man should turn out a shakespeare or a newton but when we come to compare what he wrote regardless of minervas averted face with the spontaneous production of his happier muse we shall be inclined to think his example one of the strongest cases against the theory in question he began his dramatic career as usual by rowing against the strong current of his nature and pulled only the more doggedly the more he felt himself swept down the stream his first attempt was at comedy and though his earliest piece of that kind the wild gallant 1663 utterly failed he wrote eight others afterwards on the 23d february 1663 pepys writes in his diary to court and there saw the wild gallant performed by the kings house but it was ill acted and the play so poor a thing as i never saw in my life almost and so little answering the name that from the beginning to the end i could not nor can at this time tell certainly which was the wild gallant the king did not seem pleased at all the whole play nor anybody else after some alteration it was revived with more success on its publication in 1669 dryden honestly admitted its former failure though with a kind of salvo for his selflove i made the town my judges and the greater part condemned it after which i do not think it my concernment to defend it with the ordinary zeal of a poet for his decried poem though corneille is more resolute in his preface before pertharite44 which was condemned more universally than this yet it was received at court and was more than once the divertisement of his majesty by his own command pepys lets us amusingly behind the scenes in the matter of his majestys divertisement dryden does not seem to see that in the condemnation of something meant to amuse the public there can be no question of degree to fail at all is to fail utterly    tous les genres sont permis hors le genre ennuyeux  in the reading at least all drydens comic writing for the stage must be ranked with the latter class he himself would fain make an exception of the spanish friar but i confess that i rather wonder at than envy those who can be amused by it his comedies lack everything that a comedy should havelightness quickness of transition unexpectedness of incident easy cleverness of dialogue and humorous contrast of character brought out by identity of situation the comic parts of the maiden queen seem to me drydens best but the merit even of these is shakespeares and there is little choice where even the best is only tolerable the common quality however of all drydens comedies is their nastiness the more remarkable because we have ample evidence that he was a man of modest conversation pepys who was by no means squeamish for he found sir martin marall the most entire piece of mirth  that certainly ever was writ  very good wit therein not fooling writes in his diary of the 19th june 1668 my wife and deb to the kings playhouse today thinking to spy me there and saw the new play evening love of drydens which though the world commends she likes not the next day he saw it himself and do not like it it being very smutty and nothing so good as the maiden queen or the indian emperor of drydens making i was troubled at it on the 22d he adds calling this day at herringmans45 he tells me dryden do himself call it but a fifthrate play this was no doubt true and yet though dryden in his preface to the play says i confess i have given yielded too much to the people in it and am ashamed for them as well as for myself that i have pleased them at so cheap a rate he takes care to add not that there is anything here that i would not defend to an illnatured judge the plot was from calderon and the author rebutting the charge of plagiarism tells us that the king without whose command they should no longer be troubled with anything of mine had already answered for him by saying that he only desired that they who accused me of theft would always steal him plays like mine of the morals of the play he has not a word nor do i believe that he was conscious of any harm in them till he was attacked by collier and then with some protest against what he considers the undue severity of his censor he had the manliness to confess that he had done wrong it becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause when i have so often drawn it for a good one46 and in a letter to his correspondent mrs thomas written only a few weeks before his death warning her against the example of mrs behn he says with remorseful sincerity i confess i am the last man in the world who ought in justice to arraign her who have been myself too much a libertine in most of my poems which i should be well contented i had time either to purge or to see them fairly burned congreve was less patient and even dryden in the last epilogue he ever wrote attempts an excuse    perhaps the parson stretched a point too far   when with our theatres he waged a war   he tells you that this very moral age   received the first infection from the stage   but sure a banished court with lewdness fraught   the seeds of open vice returning brought                                         whitehall the naked venus first revealed   who standing as at cyprus in her shrine   the strumpet was adored with rites divine                                         the poets who must live by courts or starve   were proud so good a government to serve   and mixing with buffoons and pimps profane   tainted the stage for some small snip of gain  dryden least of all men should have stooped to this palliation for he had not without justice said of himself the same parts and application which have made me a poet might have raised me to any honors of the gown milton and marvell neither lived by the court nor starved charles lamb most ingeniously defends the comedy of the restoration as the sanctuary and quiet alsatia of hunted casuistry where there was no pretence of representing a real world47 but this was certainly not so dryden again and again boasts of the superior advantage which his age had over that of the elder dramatists in painting polite life and attributes it to a greater freedom of intercourse between the poets and the frequenters of the court48 we shall be less surprised at the kind of refinement upon which dryden congratulated himself when we learn from the dedication of marriage à la mode that the earl of rochester was its exemplar the best comic writers of our age will join with me to acknowledge that they have copied the gallantries of courts the delicacy of expression and the decencies of behavior from your lordship in judging dryden it should be borne in mind that for some years he was under contract to deliver three plays a year a kind of bond to which no man should subject his brain who has a decent respect for the quality of its products we should remember too that in his day manners meant what we call morals that custom always makes a larger part of virtue among average men than they are quite aware and that the reaction from an outward conformity which had no root in inward faith may for a time have given to the frank expression of laxity an air of honesty that made it seem almost refreshing there is no such hotbed for excess of license as excess of restraint and the arrogant fanaticism of a single virtue is apt to make men suspicious of tyranny in all the rest but the riot of emancipation could not last long for the more tolerant society is of private vice the more exacting will it be of public decorum that excellent thing so often the plausible substitute for things more excellent by 1678 the public mind had so far recovered its tone that drydens comedy of limberham was barely tolerated for three nights i will let the man who looked at human nature from more sides and therefore judged it more gently than any other give the only excuse possible for dryden                      mens judgments are   a parcel of their fortunes and things outward   do draw the inward quality after them   to suffer all alike  drydens own apology only makes matters worse for him by showing that he committed his offences with his eyes wide open and that he wrote comedies so wholly in despite of nature as never to deviate into the comic failing as clown he did not scruple to take on himself the office of chiffinch to the palled appetite of the public for i confess my chief endeavours are to delight the age in which i live    if the humour of this be for low comedy small accidents and raillery i will force my genius to obey it though with more reputation i could write in verse  i know i am not so fitted by nature to write comedy i want that gayety of humour which is requisite to it  my conversation is slow and dull my humour saturnine and reserved in short i am none of those who endeavour to break jests in company or make repartees    so that those who decry my comedies do me no injury except it be in point of profit reputation in them is the last thing to which i shall pretend49 for my own part though i have been forced to hold my nose in picking my way through these ordures of dryden i am free to say that i think them far less  morally mischievous than that corpsdeballet literature in which the most animal of the passions is made more temptingly naked by a veil of french gauze  nor does drydens lewdness leave such a reek in the mind as the filthy cynicism of swift who delighted to uncover the nakedness of our common mother  it is pleasant to follow dryden into the more congenial region of heroic plays though here also we find him making a false start anxious to please the king50 and so able a reasoner as to convince even himself of the justice of whatever cause he argued he not only wrote tragedies in the french style but defended his practice in an essay which is by far the most delightful reproduction of the classic dialogue ever written in english eugenius lord buckhurst lisideius sir charles sidley crites sir e howard and neander dryden are the four partakers in the debate the comparative merits of ancients and moderns of the shakespearian and contemporary drama of rhyme and blank verse the value of the three supposed aristotelian unities are the main topics discussed the tone of the discussion is admirable midway between bookishness and talk and the fairness with which each side of the argument is treated shows the breadth of drydens mind perhaps better than any other one piece of his writing there are no men of straw set up to be knocked down again as there commonly are in debates conducted upon this plan the defence of the essay is to be taken as a supplement to neanders share in it as well as many scattered passages in subsequent prefaces and dedications all the interlocutors agree that the sweetness of english verse was never understood or practised by our fathers and that our poesy is much improved by the happiness of some writers yet living who first taught us to mould our thoughts into easy and significant words to retrench the superfluities of expression and to make our rhyme so properly a part of the verse that it should never mislead the sense but itself be led and governed by it in another place he shows that by living writers he meant waller and denham rhyme has all the advantages of prose besides its own but the excellence and dignity of it were never fully known till mr waller taught it he first made writing easily an art first showed us to conclude the sense most commonly in distiches which in the verse before him runs on for so many lines together that the reader is out of breath to overtake it51 dryden afterwards changed his mind and one of the excellences of his own rhymed verse is that his sense is too ample to be concluded by the distich rhyme had been censured as unnatural in dialogue but dryden replies that it is no more so than blank verse since no man talks any kind of verse in real life but the argument for rhyme is of another kind i am satisfied if it cause delight for delight is the chief if not the only end of poesy he should have said means instruction can be admitted but in the second place for poesy only instructs as it delights the converse therefore which a poet is to imitate must be heightened with all the arts and ornaments of poesy and must be such as strictly considered could never be supposed spoken by any without premeditation thus prose though the rightful prince yet is by common consent deposed as too weak for the government of serious plays and he failing there now start up two competitors one the nearer in blood which is blank verse the other more fit for the ends of government which is rhyme blank verse is indeed the nearer prose but he is blemished with the weakness of his predecessor rhyme for i will deal clearly has somewhat of the usurper in him but he is brave and generous and his dominion pleasing52 to the objection that the difficulties of rhyme will lead to circumlocution he answers in substance that a good poet will know how to avoid them  it is curious how long the superstition that waller was the refiner of english verse has prevailed since dryden first gave it vogue he was a very poor poet and a purely mechanical versifier he has lived mainly on the credit of a single couplet    the souls dark cottage battered and decayed   lets in new light through chinks that time hath made  in which the melody alone belongs to him and the conceit such as it is to samuel daniel who said long before that the bodys                     walls grown thin permit the mind   to look out thorough and his frailty find  waller has made worse nonsense of it in the transfusion it might seem that ben jonson had a prophetic foreboding of him when he wrote others there are that have no composition at all but a kind of tuning and rhyming fall in what they write it runs and slides and only makes a sound womens poets they are called as you have womens tailors    they write a verse as smooth as soft as cream   in which there is no torrent nor scarce stream  you may sound these wits and find the depth of them with your middlefinger53 it seems to have been taken for granted by waller as afterwards by dryden that our elder poets bestowed no thought upon their verse waller was smooth but unhappily he was also flat and his importation of the french theory of the couplet as a kind of thoughtcoop did nothing but mischief54 he never compassed even a smoothness approaching this description of a nightingales song by a thirdrate poet of the earlier school    trails her plain ditty in one longspun note   through the sleek passage of her open throat   a clear unwrinkled song  one of whose beauties is its running over into the third verse those poets indeed    felt musics pulse in all her arteries   and dryden himself found out when he came to try it that blank verse was not so easy a thing as he at first conceived it nay that it is the most difficult of all verse and that it must make up in harmony by variety of pause and modulation for what it loses in the melody of rhyme in what makes the chief merit of his later versification he but rediscovered the secret of his predecessors in giving to rhymed pentameters something of the freedom of blank verse and not mistaking metre for rhythm  voltaire in his commentary on corneille has sufficiently lamented the awkwardness of movement imposed upon the french dramatists by the gyves of rhyme but he considers the necessity of overcoming this obstacle on the whole an advantage difficulty is his tenth and superior muse how did dryden who says nearly the same thing succeed in his attempt at the french manner he fell into every one of its vices without attaining much of what constitutes its excellence from the nature of the language all french poetry is purely artificial and its high polish is all that keeps out decay the length of their dramatic verse forces the french into much tautology into bombast in its original meaning the stuffing out a thought with words till it fills the line the rigid system of their rhyme which makes it much harder to manage than in english has accustomed them to inaccuracies of thought which would shock them in prose for example in the cinna of corneille as originally written emilie says to augustus    ces flammes dans nos coeurs dès longtemps étoient nées   et ce sont des secrets de plus de quatre années  i say nothing of the second verse which is purely prosaic surplusage exacted by the rhyme nor of the jingling together of ces dès étoient nées des and secrets but i confess that nées does not seem to be the epithet that corneille would have chosen for flammes if he could have had his own way and that flames would seem of all things the hardest to keep secret but in revising corneille changed the first verse thus    ces flammes dans nos coeurs sans votre ordre étoient nées  can anything be more absurd than flames born to order yet voltaire on his guard against these rhyming pitfalls for the sense does not notice this in his minute comments on this play of extravagant metaphor the result of this same making sound the fileleader of sense a single example from heraclius shall suffice    la vapeur de mon sang ira grossir la foudre   que dieu tient déja prête à le reduire en poudre  one cannot think of a louis quatorze apollo except in a fullbottomed periwig and the tragic style of their poets is always showing the disastrous influence of that portentous comet it is the style perruque in another than the french meaning of the phrase and the skill lay in dressing it majestically so that as cibber says upon the head of a man of sense if it became him it could never fail of drawing to him a more partial regard and benevolence than could possibly be hoped for in an illmade one it did not become dryden and he left it off55  like his own zimri dryden was all for this or that fancy till he took up with another but even while he was writing on french models his judgment could not be blinded to their defects look upon the cinna and the pompey they are not so properly to be called plays as long discourses of reason of state and polieucte in matters of religion is as solemn as the long stops upon our organs  their actors speak by the hourglass like our parsons i deny not but this may suit well enough with the french for as we who are a more sullen people come to be diverted at our plays so they who are of an airy and gay temper come thither to make themselves more serious56 with what an air of innocent unconsciousness the sarcasm is driven home  again while he was still slaving at these bricks without straw he says the present french poets are generally accused that wheresoever they lay the scene or in whatever age the manners of their heroes are wholly french racines bajazet is bred at constantinople but his civilities are conveyed to him by some secret passage from versailles into the seraglio it is curious that voltaire speaking of the bérénice of racine praises a passage in it for precisely what dryden condemns il semble quon entende henriette dangleterre ellemême parlant au marquis de vardes la politesse de la cour de louis xiv lagrément de la langue française la douceur de la versification la plus naturelle le sentiment le plus tendre tout se trouve dans ce peu de vers  after dryden had broken away from the heroic style he speaks out more plainly  in the preface to his all for love in reply to some cavils upon little and not essential decencies the decision about which he refers to a master of ceremonies he goes on to say the french poets i confess are strict observers of these punctilios  in this nicety of manners does the excellency of french poetry consist their heroes are the most civil people breathing but their good breeding seldom extends to a word of sense all their wit is in their ceremony they want the genius which animates our stage and therefore t is but necessary when they cannot please that they should take care not to offend they are so careful not to exasperate a critic that they never leave him any work  for no part of a poem is worth our discommending where the whole is insipid as when we have once tasted palled wine we stay not to examine it glass by glass but while they affect to shine in trifles they are often careless in essentials for my part i desire to be tried by the laws of my own country this is said in heat but it is plain enough that his mind was wholly changed in his discourse on epic poetry he is as decided but more temperate he says that the french heroic verse runs with more activity than strength57 their language is not strung with sinews like our english it has the nimbleness of a greyhound but not the bulk and body of a mastiff our men and our verses overbear them by their weight and pondere non numero is the british motto the french have set up purity for the standard of their language and a masculine vigor is that of ours like their tongue is the genius of their poetslight and trifling in comparison of the english58  dryden might have profited by an admirable saying of his own that they who would combat general authority with particular opinion must first establish themselves a reputation of understanding better than other men he understood the defects much better than the beauties of the french theatre lessing was even more onesided in his judgment upon it59 goethe with his usual wisdom studied it carefully without losing his temper and tried to profit by its structural merits dryden with his eyes wide open copied its worst faults especially its declamatory sentiment he should have known that certain things can never be transplanted and that among these is a style of poetry whose great excellence was that it was in perfect sympathy with the genius of the people among whom it came into being but the truth is that dryden had no aptitude whatever for the stage and in writing for it he was attempting to make a trade of his geniusan arrangement from which the genius always withdraws in disgust it was easier to make loose thinking and the bad writing which betrays it pass unobserved while the ear was occupied with the sonorous music of the rhyme to which they marched except in all for love the only play he tells us which he wrote to please himself60 there is no trace of real passion in any of his tragedies this indeed is inevitable for there are no characters but only personages in any except that that is in many respects a noble play and there are few finer scenes whether in the conception or the carrying out than that between antony and ventidius in the first act61  as usual drydens good sense was not blind to the extravagances of his dramatic style in mac flecknoe he makes his own maximin the type of childish rant    and little maximins the gods defy  but as usual also he could give a plausible reason for his own mistakes by means of that most fallacious of all fallacies which is true so far as it goes in his prologue to the royal martyr he says    and he who servilely creeps after sense   is safe but neer will reach an excellence                                         but when a tyrant for his theme he had   he loosed the reins and let his muse run mad   and though he stumbles in a full career   yet rashness is a better fault than fear                                         they then who of each trip advantage take   find out those faults which they want wit to make  and in the preface to the same play he tells us i have not everywhere observed the equality of numbers in my verse partly by reason of my haste but more especially because i would not have my sense a slave to syllables dryden when he had not a bad case to argue would have had small respect for the wit whose skill lay in the making of faults and has himself where his selflove was not engaged admirably defined the boundary which divides boldness from rashness what quintilian says of seneca applies very aptly to dryden velles eum suo ingenio dixisse alieno judicio62 he was thinking of himself i fancy when he makes ventidius say of antony                            he starts out wide   and bounds into a vice that bears him far   from his first course and plunges him in ills   but when his danger makes him find his fault   quick to observe and full of sharp remorse   he censures eagerly his own misdeeds   judging himself with malice to himself   and not forgiving what as man he did   because his other parts are more than man  but bad though they nearly all are as wholes his plays contain passages which only the great masters have surpassed and to the level of which no subsequent writer for the stage has ever risen the necessity of rhyme often forced him to a platitude as where he says    my love was blind to your deluding art   but blind men feel when stabbed so near the heart63  but even in rhyme he not seldom justifies his claim to the title of glorious john in the very play from which i have just quoted are these verses in his best manner    no like his better fortune ill appear   with open arms loose veil and flowing hair   just flying forward from her rolling sphere  his comparisons as i have said are almost always happy this from the indian emperor is tenderly pathetic    as callow birds   whose mothers killed in seeking of the prey   cry in their nest and think her long away   and at each leaf that stirs each blast of wind   gape for the food which they must never find  and this of the anger with which the maiden queen striving to hide her jealousy betrays her love is vigorous    her rage was love and its tempestuous flame   like lightning showed the heaven from whence it came  the following simile from the conquest of grenada is as well expressed as it is apt in conception    i scarcely understand my own intent   but silkworm like so long within have wrought   that i am lost in my own web of thought  in the rival ladies angelina walking in the dark describes her sensations naturally and strikingly    no noise but what my footsteps make and they   sound dreadfully and louder than by day   they double too and every step i take   sounds thick methinks and more than one could make  in all the rhymed plays64 there are many passages which one is rather inclined to like than sure he would be right in liking them the following verses from aurengzebe are of this sort    my love was such it needed no return   rich in itself like elemental fire   whose pureness does no aliment require  this is cowleyish and pureness is surely the wrong word and yet it is better than mere commonplace perhaps what oftenest turns the balance in drydens favor when we are weighing his claims as a poet is his persistent capability of enthusiasm to the last he kindles and sometimes almost flashes out that supernatural light which is the supreme test of poetic genius as he himself so finely and characteristically says in aurengzebe there was no period in his life when it was not true of him that    he felt the inspiring heat the absent god return  the verses which follow are full of him and with the exception of the single word underwent are in his luckiest manner    one loose one sally of a heros soul   does all the military art control   while timorous wit goes round or fords the shore   he shoots the gulf and is already oer   and when the enthusiastic fit is spent   looks back amazed at what he underwent65  pithy sentences and phrases always drop from drydens pen as if unawares whether in prose or verse i string together a few at random    the greatest argument for love is love    few know the use of life before t is past    time gives himself and is not valued    death in itself is nothing but we fear   to be we know not what we know not where    love either finds equality or makes it   like death he knows no difference in degrees    thats empire that which i can give away    yours is a soul irregularly great   which wanting temper yet abounds in heat    forgiveness to the injured does belong   but they neer pardon who have done the wrong    poor womens thoughts are all extempore    the cause of love can never be assigned   t is in no face but in the lovers mind66    heaven can forgive a crime to penitence   for heaven can judge if penitence be true   but man who knows not hearts should make examples    kings titles commonly begin by force   which time wears off and mellows into right    fears a large promiser who subject live   to that base passion know not what they give    the secret pleasure of the generous act   is the great minds great bribe    that bad thing gold buys all good things    why love does all thats noble here below                        to prove religion true   if either wit or sufferings could suffice   all faiths afford the constant and the wise  but dryden as he tells us himself    grew weary of his longloved mistress rhyme   passions too fierce to be in fetters bound   and nature flies him like enchanted ground  the finest things in his plays were written in blank verse as vernacular to him as the alexandrine to the french in this he vindicates his claim as a poet his diction gets wings and both his verse and his thought become capable of a reach which was denied them when set in the stocks of the couplet the solid man becomes even airy in this newfound freedom anthony says                             how i loved   witness ye days and nights and all ye hours   that danced away with down upon your feet  and what image was ever more delicately exquisite what movement more fadingly accordant with the sense than in the last two verses of the following passage    i feel death rising higher still and higher   within my bosom every breath i fetch   shuts up my life within a shorter compass   and like the vanishing sound of bells grows less   and less each pulse till it be lost in air67  nor was he altogether without pathos though it is rare with him the following passage seems to me tenderly full of it                             something like   that voice methinks i should have somewhere heard   but floods of woe have hurried it far off   beyond my ken of soul68  and this single verse from aurengzebe    live still oh live live even to be unkind  with its passionate eagerness and sobbing repetition is worth a shipload of the longdrawn treacle of modern selfcompassion  now and then to be sure we come upon something that makes us hesitate again whether after all dryden was not grandiose rather than great as in the two passages that next follow    he looks secure of death superior greatness   like jove when he made fate and said thou art   the slave of my creation69    im pleased with my own work jove was not more   with infant nature when his spacious hand   had rounded this huge ball of earth and seas   to give it the first push and see it roll   along the vast abyss70  i should say that dryden is more apt to dilate our fancy than our thought as great poets have the gift of doing but if he have not the potent alchemy that transmutes the lead of our commonplace associations into gold as shakespeare knows how to do so easily yet his sense is always up to the sterling standard and though he has not added so much as some have done to the stock of bullion which others afterwards coin and put in circulation there are few who have minted so many phrases that are still a part of our daily currency the first line of the following passage has been worn pretty smooth but the succeeding ones are less familiar    men are but children of a larger growth   our appetites as apt to change as theirs   and full as craving too and full as vain   and yet the soul shut up in her dark room   viewing so clear abroad at home sees nothing   but like a mole in earth busy and blind   works all her folly up and casts it outward   in the worlds open view71  the image is mixed and even contradictory but the thought obtains grace for it i feel as if shakespeare would have written seeing for viewing thus gaining the strength of repetition in one verse and avoiding the sameness of it in the other dryden i suspect was not much given to correction and indeed one of the great charms of his best writing is that everything seems struck off at a heat as by a superior man in the best mood of his talk where he rises he generally becomes fervent rather than imaginative his thought does not incorporate itself in metaphor as in purely poetic minds but repeats and reinforces itself in simile where he is imaginative it is in that lower sense which the poverty of our language for want of a better word compels us to call picturesque and even then he shows little of that finer instinct which suggests so much more than it tells and works the more powerfully as it taxes more the imagination of the reader in donnes relic there is an example of what i mean he fancies some one breaking up his grave and spying    a bracelet of bright hair about the bone  a verse that still shines there in the darkness of the tomb after two centuries like one of those inextinguishable lamps whose secret is lost72 yet dryden sometimes showed a sense of this magic of a mysterious hint as in the spanish friar    no i confess you bade me not in words   the dial spoke not but it made shrewd signs   and pointed full upon the stroke of murder  this is perhaps a solitary example nor is he always so possessed by the image in his mind as unconsciously to choose even the picturesquely imaginative word he has done so however in this passage from marriage à la mode    you neer mast hope again to see your princess   except as prisoners view fair walks and streets   and careless passengers going by their grates  but after all he is best upon a level tableland it is true and a very high level but still somewhere between the loftier peaks of inspiration and the plain of everyday life in those passages where he moralizes he is always good setting some obvious truth in a new light by vigorous phrase and happy illustration take this from oedipus as a proof of it                    the gods are just   but how can finite measure infinite   reason alas it does not know itself   yet man vain man would with his shortlined plummet   fathom the vast abyss of heavenly justice   whatever is is in its causes just   since all things are by fate but purblind man   sees but a part o th chain the nearest links   his eyes not carrying to that equal beam   that poises all above  from the same play i pick an illustration of that ripened sweetness of thought and language which marks the natural vein of dryden one cannot help applying the passage to the late mr quincy    of no distemper of no blast he died   but fell like autumn fruit that mellowed long   een wondered at because he dropt no sooner   fate seemed to wind him up for fourscore years   yet freshly ran he on ten winters more   till like a clock worn out with eating time   the wheels of weary life at last stood still73  here is another of the same kind from all for love                      gone so soon   is death no more he used him carelessly   with a familiar kindness ere he knocked   ran to the door and took him in his arms   as who should say youre welcome at all hours   a friend need give no warning  with one more extract from the same play which is in every way his best for he had when he wrote it been feeding on the beebread of shakespeare i shall conclude antony says    for i am now so sunk from what i was   thou findst me at my lowest watermark   the rivers that ran in and raised my fortunes   are all dried up or take another course   what i have left is from my native spring   ive a heart still that swells in scorn of fate   and lifts me to my banks  this is certainly from beginning to end in what used to be called the grand style at once noble and natural i have not undertaken to analyze any one of the plays for except in all for love it would have been only to expose their weakness dryden had no constructive faculty and in every one of his longer poems that required a plot the plot is bad always more or less inconsistent with itself and rather hitchedon to the subject than combining with it it is fair to say however before leaving this part of drydens literary work that horne tooke thought don sebastian the best play extant74  gray admired the plays of dryden not as dramatic compositions but as poetry75 there are as many things finely said in his plays as almost by anybody said pope to spence of their rant their fustian their bombast their bad english of their innumerable sins against drydens own better conscience both as poet and critic i shall excuse myself from giving any instances76 i like what is good in dryden so much and it is so good that i think gray was justified in always losing his temper when he heard his faults criticised77  it is as a satirist and pleader in verse that dryden is best known and as both he is in some respects unrivalled his satire is not so sly as chaucers but it is distinguished by the same goodnature there is no malice in it i shall not enter into his literary quarrels further than to say that he seems to me on the whole to have been forbearing which is the more striking as he tells us repeatedly that he was naturally vindictive it was he who called revenge the darling attribute of heaven i complain not of their lampoons and libels though i have been the public mark for many years i am vindictive enough to have repelled force by force if i could imagine that any of them had ever reached me it was this feeling of easy superiority i suspect that made him the mark for so much jealous vituperation scott is wrong in attributing his onslaught upon settle to jealousy because one of the latters plays had been performed at courtan honor never paid to any of drydens78 i have found nothing like a trace of jealousy in that large and benignant nature in his vindication of the duke of guise he says with honest confidence in himself nay i durst almost refer myself to some of the angry poets on the other side whether i have not rather countenanced and assisted their beginnings than hindered them from rising he seems to have been really as indifferent to the attacks on himself as pope pretended to be in the same vindication he says of the rehearsal the only one of them that had any wit in it and it has a great deal much less am i concerned at the noble name of bayes thats a brat so like his own father that he cannot be mistaken for any other body they might as reasonably have called tom sternhold virgil and the resemblance would have held as well in his essay on satire he says and yet we know that in christian charity all offences are to be forgiven as we expect the like pardon for those we daily commit against almighty god and this consideration has often made me tremble when i was saying our lords prayer for the plain condition of the forgiveness which we beg is the pardoning of others the offences which they have done to us for which reason i have many times avoided the commission of that fault even when i have been notoriously provoked79 and in another passage he says with his usual wisdom good sense and goodnature are never separated though the ignorant world has thought otherwise goodnature by which i mean beneficence and candor is the product of right reason which of necessity will give allowance to the failings of others by considering that there is nothing perfect in mankind in the same essay he gives his own receipt for satire how easy it is to call rogue and villain and that wittily but how hard to make a man appear a fool a blockhead or a knave without using any of those opprobrious terms this is the mystery of that noble trade neither is it true that this fineness of raillery is offensive a witty man is tickled while he is hurt in this manner and a fool feels it not there is a vast difference between the slovenly butchering of a man and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body and leaves it standing in its place a man may be capable as jack ketchs wife said of his servant of a plain piece of work of a bare hanging but to make a malefactor die sweetly was only belonging to her husband i wish i could apply it to myself if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me the character of zimri in my absalom is in my opinion worth the whole poem it is not bloody but it is ridiculous enough and he for whom it was intended was too witty to resent it as an injury i avoided the mention of great crimes and applied myself to the representing of blind sides and little extravagances to which the wittier a man is he is genrally the more obnoxious  dryden thought his genius led him that way in his elegy on the satirist oldham whom hallam without reading him i suspect ranks next to dryden80 he says    for sure our souls were near allied and thine   cast in the same poetic mould with mine   one common note in either lyre did strike   and knaves and fools we both abhorred alike  his practice is not always so delicate as his theory but if he was sometimes rough he never took a base advantage he knocks his antagonist down and there an end pope seems to have nursed his grudge and then watching his chance to have squirted vitriol from behind a corner rather glad than otherwise if it fell on the women of those he hated or envied and if dryden is never dastardly as pope often was so also he never wrote anything so maliciously depreciatory as popes unprovoked attack on addison drydens satire is often coarse but where it is coarsest it is commonly in defence of himself against attacks that were themselves brutal then to be sure he snatches the first ready cudgel as in shadwells case though even then there is something of the goodhumor of conscious strength popes provocation was too often the mere opportunity to say a biting thing where he could do it safely if his victim showed fight he tried to smooth things over as with dennis dryden could forget that he had ever had a quarrel but he never slunk away from any least of all from one provoked by himself81 popes satire is too much occupied with the externals of manners habits personal defects and peculiarities dryden goes right to the rooted character of the man to the weaknesses of his nature as where he says of burnet    prompt to assail and careless of defence   invulnerable in his impudence   he dares the world and eager of a name   he thrusts about and justles into fame   so fond of loud report that not to miss   of being known his last and utmost bliss   he rather would be known for what he is  it would be hard to find in pope such compression of meaning as in the first or such penetrative sarcasm as in the second of the passages i have underscored drydens satire is still quoted for its comprehensiveness of application popes rather for the elegance of its finish and the point of its phrase than for any deeper qualities82 i do not remember that dryden ever makes poverty a reproach83 he was above it alike by generosity of birth and mind pope is always the parvenu always giving himself the airs of a fine gentleman and like horace walpole and byron affecting superiority to professional literature dryden like lessing was a hackwriter and was proud as an honest man has a right to be of being able to get his bread by his brains he lived in grub street all his life and never dreamed that where a man of genius lived was not the best quarter of the town tell his majesty said sturdy old jonson that his soul lives in an alley  drydens prefaces are a mine of good writing and judicious criticism his obiter dicta have often the penetration and always more than the equity of voltaires for dryden never loses temper and never altogether qualifies his judgment by his selflove he was a more universal writer than voltaire said horne tooke and perhaps it is true that he had a broader view though his learning was neither so extensive nor so accurate my space will not afford many extracts but i cannot forbear one or two he says of chaucer that he is a perpetual fountain of good sense84 and likes him better than ovida bold confession in that day he prefers the pastorals of theocritus to those of virgil virgils shepherds are too well read in the philosophy of epicurus and of plato there is a kind of rusticity in all those pompous verses somewhat of a holiday shepherd strutting in his country buskins85 theocritus is softer than ovid he touches the passions more delicately and performs all this out of his own fund without diving into the arts and sciences for a supply even his doric dialect has an incomparable sweetness in his clownishness like a fair shepherdess in her country russet talking in a yorkshire tone86 comparing virgils verse with that of some other poets he says that his numbers are perpetually varied to increase the delight of the reader so that the same sounds are never repeated twice together on the contrary ovid and claudian though they write in styles different from each other yet have each of them but one sort of music in their verses all the versification and little variety of claudian is included within the compass of four or five lines and then he begins again in the same tenor perpetually closing his sense at the end of a verse and that verse commonly which they call golden or two substantives and two adjectives with a verb betwixt them to keep the peace ovid with all his sweetness has as little variety of numbers and sound as he he is always as it were upon the handgallop and his verse runs upon carpetground87 what a dreary halfcentury would have been saved to english poetry could pope have laid these sentences to heart upon translation no one has written so much and so well as dryden in his various prefaces whatever has been said since is either expansion or variation of what he had said before his general theory may be stated as an aim at something between the literalness of metaphrase and the looseness of paraphase where i have enlarged he says i desire the false critics would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine but either they are secretly in the poet or may be fairly deduced from him coleridge with his usual cleverness of assimilation has condensed him in a letter to wordsworth there is no medium between a prose version and one on the avowed principle of compensation in the widest sense ie manner genius total effect88  i have selected these passages not because they are the best but because they have a near application to dryden himself his own characterization of chaucer though too narrow for the greatest but one of english poets is the best that could be given of himself he is a perpetual fountain of good sense and the other passages show him a close and openminded student of the art he professed has his influence on our literature but especially on our poetry been on the whole for good or evil if he could have been read with the liberal understanding which he brought to the works of others i should answer at once that it had been beneficial but his translations and paraphrases in some ways the best things he did were done like his plays under contract to deliver a certain number of verses for a specified sum the versification of which he had learned the art by long practice is excellent but his haste has led him to fill out the measure of lines with phrases that add only to dilute and thus the clearest the most direct the most manly versifier of his time became without meaning it the source fons et origo malorum of that poetic diction from which our poetry has not even yet recovered i do not like to say it but he has sometimes smothered the childlike simplicity of chaucer under featherbeds of verbiage what this kind of thing came to in the next century when everybody ceremoniously took a bushelbasket to bring a wrens egg to market in is only too sadly familiar it is clear that his natural taste led dryden to prefer directness and simplicity of style if he was too often tempted astray by artifice his love of nature betrays itself in many an almost passionate outbreak of angry remorse addison tells us that he took particular delight in the reading of our old english ballads what he valued above all things was force though in his haste he is willing to make a shift with its counterfeit effect as usual he had a good reason to urge for what he did i will not excuse but justify myself for one pretended crime for which i am liable to be charged by false critics not only in this translation but in many of my original poemsthat i latinize too much it is true that when i find an english word significant and sounding i neither borrow from the latin or any other language but when i want at home i must seek abroad if sounding words are not of our growth and manufacture who shall hinder me to import them from a foreign country i carry not out the treasure of the nation which is never to return but what i bring from italy i spend in england here it remains and here it circulates for if the coin be good it will pass from one hand to another i trade both with the living and the dead for the enrichment of our native language we have enough in england to supply our necessity but if we will have things of magnificence and splendor we must get them by commerce therefore if i find a word in a classic author i propose it to be naturalized by using it myself and if the public approve of it the bill passes but every man cannot distinguish betwixt pedantry and poetry every man therefore is not fit to innovate89 this is admirably said and with drydens accustomed penetration to the root of the matter the latin has given us most of our canorous words only they must not be confounded with merely sonorous ones still less with phrases that instead of supplementing the sense encumber it it was of latinizing in this sense that dryden was guilty instead of stabbing he with steel invades the life the consequence was that by and by we have dr johnsons poet savage telling us    in front a parlor meets my entering view   opposed a room to sweet refection due  dr blacklock making a forlorn maiden say of her dear who is out late    or by some apoplectic fit deprest   perhaps alas he seeks eternal rest  and mr bruce in a danish warsong calling on the vikings to assume their oars but it must be admitted of dryden that he seldom makes the second verse of a couplet the mere trainbearer to the first as pope was continually doing in dryden the rhyme waits upon the thought in pope and his school the thought courtesies to the tune for which it is written  dryden has also been blamed for his gallicisms90 he tried some it is true but they have not been accepted  i do not think he added a single word to the language unless as i suspect he first used magnetism in its present sense of moral attraction what he did in his best writing was to use the english as if it were a spoken and not merely an inkhorn language as if it were his own to do what he pleased with it as if it need not be ashamed of itself91  in this respect his service to our prose was greater than any other man has ever rendered he says he formed his style upon tillotsons bossuet on the other hand formed his upon corneilles but i rather think he got it at wills for its great charm is that it has the various freedom of talk92 in verse he had a pomp which excellent in itself became pompousness in his imitators but he had nothing of miltons ear for various rhythm and interwoven harmony he knew how to give new modulation sweetness and force to the pentameter but in what used to be called pindarics i am heretic enough to think he generally failed his so much praised alexanders feast in parts of it at least has no excuse for its slovenly metre and awkward expression but that it was written for music he himself tells us in the epistle dedicatory to king arthur that the numbers of poetry and vocal music are sometimes so contrary that in many places i have been obliged to cramp my verses and make them ragged to the reader that they may be harmonious to the hearer his renowned ode suffered from this constraint but this is no apology for the vulgarity of conception in too many passages93  drydens conversion to romanism has been commonly taken for granted as insincere and has therefore left an abiding stain on his character though the other mud thrown at him by angry opponents or rivals brushed off so soon as it was dry but i think his change of faith susceptible of several explanations none of them in any way discreditable to him where church and state are habitually associated it is natural that minds even of a high order should unconsciously come to regard religion as only a subtler mode of police94 dryden conservative by nature had discovered before joseph de maistre that protestantism so long as it justified its name by continuing to be an active principle was the abettor of republicanism i think this is hinted in more than one passage in his preface to the hind and panther he may very well have preferred romanism because of its elder claim to authority in all matters of doctrine but i think he had a deeper reason in the constitution of his own mind that he was naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy he tells us of himself in the preface to the religio laici but he was a sceptic with an imaginative side and in such characters scepticism and superstition play into each others hands this finds a curious illustration in a letter to his sons written four years before his death towards the latter end of this month september charles will begin to recover his perfect health according to his nativity which casting it myself i am sure is true and all things hitherto have happened accordingly to the very time that i predicted them have we forgotten montaignes votive offerings at the shrine of loreto  dryden was short of body inclined to stoutness and florid of complexion he is said to have had a sleepy eye but was handsome and of a manly carriage he was not a very genteel man he was intimate with none but poetical men95 he was said to be a very good man by all that knew him he was as plump as mr pitt of a fresh color and a down look and not very conversible so pope described him to spence he still reigns in literary tradition as when at wills his elbowchair had the best place by the fire in winter or on the balcony in summer and when a pinch from his snuffbox made a young author blush with pleasure as would nowadays a favorable notice in the saturday review what gave and secures for him this singular eminence to put it in a single word i think that his qualities and faculties were in that rare combination which makes character this gave flavor to whatever he wrotea very rare quality  was he then a great poet hardly in the narrowest definition but he was a strong thinker who sometimes carried common sense to a height where it catches the light of a diviner air and warmed reason till it had wellnigh the illuminating property of intuition certainly he is not like spenser the poets poet but other men have also their rights even the philistine is a man and a brother and is entirely right so far as he sees to demand more of him is to be unreasonable and he sees among other things that a man who undertakes to write should first have a meaning perfectly defined to himself and then should be able to set it forth clearly in the best words this is precisely drydens praise96 and amid the rickety sentiment looming big through misty phrase which marks so much of modern literature to read him is as bracing as a northwest wind he blows the mind clear in ripeness of mind and bluff heartiness of expression he takes rank with the best his phrase is always a shortcut to his sense for his estate was too spacious for him to need that trick of winding the path of his thought about and planting it out with clumps of epithet by which the landscapegardeners of literature give to a paltry halfacre the air of a park in poetry to be nextbest is in one sense to be nothing and yet to be among the first in any kind of writing as dryden certainly was is to be one of a very small company he had beyond most the gift of the right word and if he does not like one or two of the greater masters of song stir our sympathies by that indefinable aroma so magical in arousing the subtile associations of the soul he has this in common with the few great writers that the winged seeds of his thought embed themselves in the memory and germinate there if i could be guilty of the absurdity of recommending to a young man any author on whom to form his style i should tell him that next to having something that will not stay unsaid he could find no safer guide than dryden  cowper in a letter to mr unwin 5th january 1782 expresses what i think is the common feeling about dryden that with all his defects he had that indefinable something we call genius but i admire dryden most he had been speaking of pope who has succeeded by mere dint of genius and in spite of a laziness and a carelessness almost peculiar to himself his faults are numberless and so are his beauties his faults are those of a great man and his beauties are such at least sometimes as pope with all his touching and retouching could never equal but after all perhaps no man has summed him up so well as john dennis one of popes typical dunces a dull man outside of his own sphere as men are apt to be but who had some sound notions as a critic and thus became the object of popes fear and therefore of his resentment dennis speaks of him as his departed friend whom i infinitely esteemed when living for the solidity of his thought for the spring and the warmth and the beautiful turn of it for the power and variety and fulness of his harmony for the purity the perspicuity the energy of his expression and whenever these great qualities are required for the pomp and solemnity and majesty of his style97     footnotes      1 the dramatick works of john dryden esq in six volumes london     printed for

purer     faith cowley had all the faults that dryden loads him with and yet     his popularity was to some extent deserved he at least had a theory     that poetry should soar not creep and longed for some expedient in     the failure of natural wings by which he could lift himself away     from the conventional and commonplace by beating out the substance     of pindar very thin he contrived a

swift is no poet the dean     began his literary career by pindaric odes to athenian societies and     the likeperhaps the greatest mistake as to his own powers of which     an author was ever guilty it was very likely that he would send     these to his relative already distinguished for his opinion upon     them if this was so the justice of drydens judgment must have     added to the smart swift never forgot or forgave dryden was     careless enough to do the one and large enough to do the other       30 both malone and scott accept this gentlemans evidence without     question but i confess suspicion of a memory that runs back more     than eightyone years and recollects a man before he had any claim     to remembrance dryden was never poor and there is at oxford a     portrait of him painted in 1664 which represents him in a superb     periwig and laced band this was before he had paid his court with     success to the great but the story is at least ben trovato and     morally true enough to serve as an illustration who the old     gentleman was has never been discovered of crowne who has some     interest for us as a sometime student at harvard he says many a

indeed is a good play18th january 1668       33 he is fond of this image in the maiden queen celadon tells     sabina that when he is with her rival florimel his heart is still     her prisoner it only draws a longer chain after it goldsmiths     fancy was taken by it and everybody admires in the traveller the     extraordinary conceit of a heart dragging a lengthening chain the     smoothness of too many rhymed pentameters is that of thin ice over     shallow water so long as we glide along rapidly all is well but if     we dwell a moment on any one spot we may find ourselves kneedeep in

haveimagination       34 see his epistle dedicatory to the rival ladies 1664 for the     other side see particularly a passage in his discourse on epic     poetry 1697       35 in the same way he had two years before assumed that shakespeare     was the first who to shun the pains of continued rhyming invented     that kind of writing which we call blank verse dryden was never i     suspect a very careful student of english literature he seems never     to have known that surrey translated a part of the aeneid and with     great spirit into blank verse indeed he was not a scholar in the     proper sense of the word but he had that faculty of rapid     assimilation without study so remarkable in coleridge and other rich     minds whose office is rather to impregnate than to invent these     brokers of thought perform a great office in literature second only     to that of originators       36 essay on satire what he has said just before this about butler     is worth noting butler had had a chief hand in the rehearsal but     dryden had no grudges where the question was of giving its just     praise to merit       37 the conclusion of the second canto of book third is the best

that of the thumb and     forefinger for the shades the disposition of colors the beauty of     the figures he has as good as no sense whatever the critical parts     of his life of dryden seem to me the best of his writing in this     kind there is little to be gleaned after him he had studied his     author which he seldom did and his criticism is sympathetic a     thing still rarer with him as illustrative of his own habits his     remarks on drydens reading are curious       40 perhaps the hint was given by a phrase of corneille monarque     en peinture dryden seldom borrows unless from shakespeare without     improving and he borrowed a great deal thus in don sebastian of     suicide        brutus and cato might discharge their souls       and give them furloughs for the other world       but we like sentries are obliged to stand       in starless nights and wait the appointed hour      the thought is ciceros but how it is intensified by the starless     nights dryden i suspect

witchcraft98  credulity as a mental and moral phenomenon manifests itself in widely different ways according as it chances to be the daughter of fancy or terror the one lies warm about the heart as folklore fills moonlit dells with dancing fairies sets out a meal for the brownie hears the tinkle of airy bridlebells as tamlane rides away with the queen of dreams changes pluto and proserpine into oberon and titania and makes friends with unseen powers as good folk the other is a bird of night whose shadow sends a chill among the roots of the hair it sucks with the vampire gorges with the ghoule is choked by the nighthag pines away under the witchs charm and commits uncleanness with the embodied principle of evil giving up the fair realm of innocent belief to a murky throng from the slums and stews of the debauched brain both have vanished from among educated men and such superstition as comes to the surface nowadays is the harmless jacobitism of sentiment pleasing itself with the fiction all the more because there is no exacting reality behind it to impose a duty or demand a sacrifice and as jacobitism survived the stuarts so this has outlived the dynasty to which it professes an afterdinner allegiance it nails a horseshoe over the door but keeps a rattle by its bedside to summon a more substantial watchman it hangs a crape on the beehives to get a taste of ideal sweetness but obeys the teaching of the latest beebook for material and marketable honey this is the aesthetic variety of the malady or rather perhaps it is only the old complaint robbed of all its pain and lapped in waking dreams by the narcotism of an age of science to the world at large it is not undelightful to see the poetical instincts of friends and neighbors finding some other vent than that of verse but there has been a superstition of very different fibre of more intense and practical validity the deformed child of faith peopling the midnight of the mind with fearful shapes and phrenetic suggestions a monstrous brood of its own begetting and making even good men ferocious in imagined selfdefence  imagination has always been and still is in a narrower sense the great mythologizer but both its mode of manifestation and the force with which it reacts on the mind are one thing in its crude form of childlike wonder and another thing after it has been more or less consciously manipulated by the poetic faculty a mythology that broods over us in our cradles that mingles with the lullaby of the nurse and the winterevening legends of the chimneycorner that brightens day with the possibility of divine encounters and darkens night with intimations of demonic ambushes is of other substance than one which we take down from our bookcase sapless as the shelf it stood on and remote from all present sympathy with man or nature as a town history it is something like the difference between live metaphor and dead personification primarily the action of the imagination is the same in the mythologizer and the poet that is it forces its own consciousness on the objects of the senses and compels them to sympathize with its own momentary impressions when shakespeare in his lucrece makes    the threshold grate the door to have him heard  his mind is acting under the same impulse that first endowed with human feeling and then with human shape all the invisible forces of nature and called into being those    fair humanities of old religion  whose loss the poets mourn so also shakespeare no doubt projected himself in his own creations but those creations never became so perfectly disengaged from him so objective or as they used to say extrinsical to him as to react upon him like real and even alien existences i mean permanently for momentarily they may and must have done so but before mans consciousness had wholly disentangled itself from outward objects all nature was but a manysided mirror which gave back to him a thousand images more or less beautified or distorted magnified or diminished of himself till his imagination grew to look upon its own incorporations as having an independent being thus by degrees it became at last passive to its own creations you may see imaginative children every day anthropomorphizing in this way and the dupes of that superabundant vitality in themselves which bestows qualities proper to itself on everything about them there is a period of development in which grown men are childlike in such a period the fables which endow beasts with human attributes first grew up and we luckily read them so early as never to become suspicious of any absurdity in them the finnic epos of kalewala is a curious illustration of the same fact in that every thing has the affections passions and consciousness of men when the mother of lemminkäinen is seeking her lost son    sought she many days the lost one   sought him ever without finding   then the roadways come to meet her   and she asks them with beseeching   roadways ye whom god hath shapen   have ye not my son beholden   nowhere seen the golden apple   him my darling staff of silver   prudently they gave her answer   thus to her replied the roadways   for thy son we cannot plague us   we have sorrows too a many   since our own lot is a hard one   and our fortune is but evil   by dogs feet to be run over   by the wheeltire to be wounded   and by heavy heels downtrampled  it is in this tendency of the mind under certain conditions to confound the objective with subjective or rather to mistake the one for the other that mr tylor in his early history of mankind is fain to seek the origin of the supernatural as we somewhat vaguely call whatever transcends our ordinary experience and this no doubt will in many cases account for the particular shapes assumed by certain phantasmal appearances though i am inclined to doubt whether it be a sufficient explanation of the abstract phenomenon it is easy for the arithmetician to make a key to the problems that he has devised to suit himself an immediate and habitual confusion of the kind spoken of is insanity and the hypochondriac is tracked by the black dog of his own mind disease itself is of course in one sense natural as being the result of natural causes but if we assume health as the mean representing the normal poise of all the mental facilities we must be content to call hypochondria subternatural because the tone of the instrument is lowered and to designate as supernatural only those ecstasies in which the mind under intense but not unhealthy excitement is snatched sometimes above itself as in poets and other persons of imaginative temperament in poets this liability to be possessed by the creations of their own brains is limited and proportioned by the artistic sense and the imagination thus truly becomes the shaping faculty while in less regulated or coarser organizations it dwells forever in the nifelheim of phantasmagoria and dream a thaumaturge half cheat half dupe what mr tylor has to say on this matter is ingenious and full of valuable suggestion and to a certain extent solves our difficulties nightmare for example will explain the testimony of witnesses in trials for witchcraft that they had been hagridden by the accused but to prove the possibility nay the probability of this confusion of objective with subjective is not enough it accounts very well for such apparitions as those which appeared to dion to brutus and to curtius rufus in such cases the imagination is undoubtedly its own doppelgänger and sees nothing more than the projection of its own deceit but i am puzzled i confess to explain the appearance of the first ghost especially among men who thought death to be the endall here below the thing once conceived of it is easy on mr tylors theory to account for all after the first if it was originally believed that only the spirits of those who had died violent deaths were permitted to wander99 the conscience of a remorseful murderer may have been haunted by the memory of his victim till the imagination infected in its turn gave outward reality to the image on the inward eye after putting to death boëtius and symmachus it is said that theodoric saw in the head of a fish served at his dinner the face of symmachus grinning horribly and with flaming eyes whereupon he took to his bed and died soon after in great agony of mind it is not safe perhaps to believe all that is reported of an arian but supposing the story to be true there is only a short step from such a delusion of the senses to the complete ghost of popular legend but in some of the most trustworthy stories of apparitions they have shown themselves not only to persons who had done them no wrong in the flesh but also to such as had never even known them the eidolon of james haddock appeared to a man named taverner that he might interest himself in recovering a piece of land unjustly kept from the dead mans infant son if we may trust defoe bishop jeremy taylor twice examined taverner and was convinced of the truth of his story in this case taverner had formerly known haddock but the apparition of an old gentleman which entered the learned dr scotts study and directed him where to find a missing deed needful in settling what had lately been its estate in the west of england chose for its attorney in the business an entire stranger who had never even seen its original in the flesh  whatever its origin a belief in spirits seems to have been common to all the nations of the ancient world who have left us any record of themselves ghosts began to walk early and are walking still in spite of the shrill cockcrow of wir haben ja aufgeklärt even the ghost in chains which one would naturally take to be a fashion peculiar to convicts escaped from purgatory is older than the belief in that reforming penitentiary the younger pliny tells a very good story to this effect there was at athens a large and spacious house which lay under the disrepute of being haunted in the dead of the night a noise resembling the clashing of iron was frequently heared which if you listened more attentively sounded like the rattling of chains at first it seemed at a distance but approached nearer by degrees immediately afterward a spectre appeared in the form of an old man extremely meagre and ghastly with a long beard and dishevelled hair rattling the chains on his feet and hands by this means the house was at last deserted being judged by everybody to be absolutely uninhabitable so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost however in hopes that some tenant might be found who was ignorant of this great calamity which attended it a bill was put up giving notice that it was either to be let or sold it happened that the philosopher athenodorus came to athens at this time and reading the bill inquired the price the extraordinary cheapness raised his suspicion nevertheless when he heared the whole story he was so far from being discouraged that he was more strongly inclined to hire it and in short actually did so when it grew towards evening he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in the fore part of the house and after calling for a light together with his pen and tablets he directed all his people to retire but that his mind might not for want of employment be open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and spirits he applied himself to writing with the utmost attention the first part of the night passed with usual silence when at length the chains began to rattle however he neither lifted up his eyes nor laid down his pen but diverted his observation by pursuing his studies with greater earnestness the noise increased and advanced nearer till it seemed at the door and at last in the chamber he looked up and saw the ghost exactly in the manner it had been described to him it stood before him beckoning with the finger athenodorus made a sign with his hand that it should wait a little and threw his eyes again upon his papers but the ghost still rattling his chains in his ears he looked up and saw him beckoning as before upon this he immediately arose and with the light in his hand followed it the ghost slowly stalked along as if encumbered with his chains and turning into the area of the house suddenly vanished athenodorus being thus deserted made a mark with some grass and leaves where the spirit left him the next day he gave information of this to the magistrates and advised them to order that spot to be dug up this was accordingly done and the skeleton of a man in chains was there found for the body having lain a considerable time in the ground was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters the bones being collected together were publicly buried and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies the house was haunted no more100 this story has such a modern air as to be absolutely disheartening are ghosts then as incapable of invention as dramatic authors but the demeanor of athenodorus has the grand air of the classical period of one qui connaît son monde and feels the superiority of a living philosopher to a dead philistine how far above all modern armament is his prophylactic against his insubstantial fellowlodger nowadays men take pistols into haunted houses sterne and after him novalis discovered that gunpowder made all men equally tall but athenodorus had found out that pen and ink establish a superiority in spiritual stature as men of this world we feel our dignity exalted by his keeping an ambassador from the other waiting till he had finished his paragraph never surely did authorship appear to greater advantage athenodorus seems to have been of hamlets mind    i do not set my life at a pins fee   and for my soul what can it do to that   being a thing immortal as itself101  a superstition as its name imports is something that has been left to stand over like unfinished business from one session of the worlds witenagemot to the next the vulgar receive it implicitly on the principle of omne ignotum pro possibili a theory acted on by a much larger number than is commonly supposed and even the enlightened are too apt to consider it if not proved at least rendered probable by the hearsay evidence of popular experience particular superstitions are sometimes the embodiment by popular imagination of ideas that were at first mere poetic figments but more commonly the degraded and distorted relics of religious beliefs dethroned gods outlawed by the new dynasty haunted the borders of their old dominions lurking in forests and mountains and venturing to show themselves only after nightfall grimm and others have detected old divinities skulking about in strange disguises and living from hand to mouth on the charity of gammer grethel and mère loie cast out from olympus and asgard they were thankful for the hospitality of the chimneycorner and kept soul and body together by an illicit traffic between this world and the other while schiller was lamenting the gods of greece some of them were nearer neighbors to him than he dreamed and heine had the wit to turn them to delightful account showing himself perhaps the wiser of the two in saving what he could from the shipwreck of the past for present use on this prosaic juan fernandez of a scientific age instead of sitting down to bewail it to make the pagan divinities hateful they were stigmatized as cacodaemons and as the human mind finds a pleasure in analogy and system an infernal hierarchy gradually shaped itself as the convenient antipodes and counterpoise of the celestial one perhaps at the bottom of it all there was a kind of unconscious manicheism and satan as prince of darkness or of the powers of the air became at last a sovereign with his great feudatories and countless vassals capable of maintaining a not unequal contest with the king of heaven he was supposed to have a certain power of bestowing earthly prosperity but he was really after all nothing better than a james ii at st germains who could make dukes of perth and confer titular fiefs and garters as much as he liked without the unpleasant necessity of providing any substance behind the shadow that there should have been so much loyalty to him under these disheartening circumstances seems to me on the whole creditable to poor human nature in this case it is due at least in part to that instinct of the poor among the races of the north where there was a long winter and too often a scanty harvestand the poor have been always and everywhere a majoritywhich made a deity of wish the acherontamovebo impulse must have been pardonably strong in old women starving with cold and hunger and fathers with large families and a small winter stock of provision especially in the transition period from the old religion to the new the temptation must have been great to try ones luck with the discrowned dynasty when the intruder was deaf and blind to claims that seemed just enough so long as it was still believed that god personally interfered in the affairs of men on his deathbed says piers plowman    the poore dare plede and prove by reson   to have allowance of his lord by the law he it claimeth                                         thanne may beggaris as beestes after boote waiten   that al hir lif han lyved in langour and in defaute   but god sente hem som tyme som manere joye   outher here or ellis where kynde wolde it nevere  he utters the common feeling when he says that it were against nature but when a man has his choice between here and elsewhere it may be feared that the other world will seem too desperately far away to be waited for when hungry ruin has him in the wind and the chance on earth is so temptingly near hence the notion of a transfer of allegiance from god to satan sometimes by a written compact sometimes with the ceremony by which homage is done to a feudal superior  most of the practices of witchcraftsuch as the power to raise storms to destroy cattle to assume the shape of beasts by the use of certain ointments to induce deadly maladies in men by waxen images or love by means of charms and philtreswere inheritances from ancient paganism but the theory of a compact was the product of later times the result no doubt of the efforts of the clergy to inspire a horror of any lapse into heathenish rites by making devils of all the old gods christianity may be said to have invented the soul as an individual entity to be saved or lost and thus grosser wits were led to conceive of it as a piece of property that could be transferred by deed of gift or sale duly signed sealed and witnessed the earliest legend of the kind is that of theophilus chancellor of the church of adana in cilicia some time during the sixth century it is said to have been first written by eutychianus who had been a pupil of theophilus and who tells the story partly as an eyewitness partly from the narration of his master the nun hroswitha first treated it dramatically in the latter half of the tenth century some four hundred years later rutebeuf made it the theme of a french miracleplay his treatment of it is not without a certain poetic merit theophilus has been deprived by his bishop of a lucrative office in his despair he meets with saladin qui parloit au deable quant il voloit saladin tempts him to deny god and devote himself to the devil who in return will give him back all his old prosperity and more he at last consents signs and seals the contract required and is restored to his old place by the bishop but now remorse and terror come upon him he calls on the virgin who after some demur compels satan to bring back his deed from the infernal munimentchest which must have been fireproof beyond any skill of our modern safemakers and the bishop having read it aloud to the awestricken congregation theophilus becomes his own man again in this play the theory of devilish compact is already complete in all its particulars the paper must be signed with the blood of the grantor who does feudal homage or joing tes mains et si devien mes hom and engages to eschew good and do evil all the days of his life the devil however does not imprint any stigma upon his new vassal as in the later stories of witchcompacts the following passage from the opening speech of theophilus will illustrate the conception to which i have alluded of god as a liege lord against whom one might seek revenge on sufficient provocationand the only revenge possible was to rob him of a subject by going over to the great suzerain his deadly foe    nest riens que por avoir ne face   ne pris riens dieu et sa manace   irai me je noier ou pendre   ie ne men puis pas à dieu prendre   con ne puet à lui avenir                                         mès il sest en si haut lieu mis   por eschiver ses anemis   con ni puet trere ni lancier   se or pooie à lui tancier   et combattre et escrimir   la char li feroie fremir   or est là sus en son solaz   laz chetis et je sui ès laz   de povreté et de soufrete102  during the middle ages the story became a favorite topic with preachers while carvings and painted windows tended still further to popularize it and to render mens minds familiar with the idea which makes the nexus of its plot the plastic hands of calderon shaped it into a dramatic poem not surpassed perhaps hardly equalled in subtile imaginative quality by any other of modern times  in proportion as a belief in the possibility of this damnable merchandising with hell became general accusations of it grew more numerous among others the memory of pope sylvester ii was blackened with the charge of having thus bargained away his soul all learning fell under suspicion till at length the very grammar itself the last volume in the world one would say to conjure with gave to english the word gramary enchantment and in french became a book of magic under the alias of grimoire it is not at all unlikely that in an age when the boundary between actual and possible was not very well defined there were scholars who made experiments in this direction and signed contracts though they never had a chance to complete their bargain by an actual delivery i do not recall any case of witchcraft in which such a document was produced in court as evidence against the accused such a one it is true was ascribed to grandier but was not brought forward at his trial it should seem that grandier had been shrewd enough to take a bond to secure the fulfilment of the contract on the other side for we have the document in facsimile signed and sealed by lucifer beelzebub satan elimi leviathan and astaroth duly witnessed by baalberith secretary of the grand council of demons fancy the competition such a state paper as this would arouse at a sale of autographs commonly no security appears to have been given by the other party to these arrangements but the bare word of the devil which was considered no doubt every whit as good as his bond in most cases indeed he was the loser and showed a want of capacity for affairs equal to that of an average giant of romance never was comedy acted over and over with such sameness of repetition as the devil is an ass how often must he have exclaimed laughing in his sleeve    i to such blockheads set my wit   i damn such foolsgo go youre bit  in popular legend he is made the victim of some equivocation so gross that any court of equity would have ruled in his favor on the other hand if the story had been dressed up by some mediaeval tract society the virgin appears in person at the right moment ex machina and compels him to give up the property he had honestly paid for one is tempted to ask were there no attorneys then in the place he came from of whom he might have taken advice beforehand on the whole he had rather hard measure and it is a wonder he did not throw up the business in disgust sometimes however he was more lucky as with the unhappy dr faust and even so lately as 1695 he came in the shape of a tall fellow with black beard and periwig respectable looking and well dressed about two oclock in the afternoon to fly away with the maréchal de luxembourg which on the stroke of five he punctually did as per contract taking with him the window and its stone framing into the bargain the clothes and wig of the involuntary aeronaut were in the handsomest manner left upon the bed as not included in the bill of sale in this case also we have a copy of the articles of agreement twentyeight in number by the last of which the maréchal renounces god and devotes himself to the enemy this clause sometimes the only one always the most important in such compacts seems to show that they first took shape in the imagination while the struggle between paganism and christianity was still going on as the converted heathen was made to renounce his false gods none the less real for being false so the renegade christian must forswear the true deity it is very likely however that the whole thing may be more modern than the assumed date of theophilus would imply and if so the idea of feudal allegiance gave the first hint as it certainly modified the particulars of the ceremonial  this notion of a personal and private treaty with the evil one has something of dignity about it that has made it perennially attractive to the most imaginative minds it rather flatters than mocks our feeling of the dignity of man as we come down to the vulgar parody of it in the confessions of wretched old women on the rack our pity and indignation are mingled with disgust one of the most particular of these confessions is that of abel de la rue convicted in 1584 the accused was a novice in the franciscan convent at meaux having been punished by the master of the novices for stealing some apples and nuts in the convent garden the devil appeared to him in the shape of a black dog promising him his protection and advising him to leave the convent not long after going into the sacristy he saw a large volume fastened by a chain and further secured by bars of iron the name of this book was grimoire thrusting his hands through the bars he contrived to open it and having read a sentence which bodin carefully suppresses there suddenly appeared to him a man of middle stature with a pale and very frightful countenance clad in a long black robe of the italian fashion and with faces of men like his own on his breast and knees as for his feet they were like those of cows he could not have been the most agreeable of companions ayant le corps et haleine puante this man told him not to be afraid to take off his habit to put faith in him and he would give him whatever he asked then laying hold of him below the arms the unknown transported him under the gallows of meaux and then said to him with a trembling and broken voice and having a visage as pale as that of a man who has been hanged and a very stinking breath that he should fear nothing but have entire confidence in him that he should never want for anything that his own name was maître rigoux and that he would like to be his master to which de la rue made answer that he would do whatever he commanded and that he wished to be gone from the franciscans thereupon rigoux disappeared but returning between seven and eight in the evening took him round the waist and carried him back to the sacristy promising to come again for him the next day this he accordingly did and told de la rue to take off his habit get him gone from the convent and meet him near a great tree on the highroad from meaux to vaulxcourtois rigoux met him there and took him to a certain maître pierre who after a few words exchanged in an undertone with rigoux sent de la rue to the stable after his return whence he saw no more of rigoux thereupon pierre and his wife made him good cheer telling him that for the love of maître rigoux they would treat him well and that he must obey the said rigoux which he promised to do about two months after maître pierre who commonly took him to the fields to watch cattle said to him there that they must go to the assembly because he pierre was out of powders to which he made answer that he was willing three days later about christmas eve 1575 pierre having sent his wife to sleep out of the house set a long branch of broom in the chimneycorner and bade de la rue go to bed but not to sleep about eleven they heard a great noise as of an impetuous wind and thunder in the chimney which hearing maître pierre told him to dress himself for it was time to be gone then pierre took some grease from a little box and anointed himself under the armpits and de la rue on the palms of his hands which incontinently felt as if on fire and the said grease stank like a cat three weeks or a month dead then pierre and he bestriding the branch maître rigoux took it by the butt and drew it up chimney as if the wind had lifted them and the night being dark he saw suddenly a torch before them lighting them and maître rigoux was gone unless he had changed himself into the said torch arrived at a grassy place some five leagues from vaulxcourtois they found a company of some sixty people of all ages none of whom he knew except a certain pierre of dampmartin and an old woman who was executed as he had heard about five years ago for sorcery at lagny then suddenly he noticed that all except rigoux who was clad as before were dressed in linen though they had not changed their clothes then at command of the eldest among them who seemed about eighty years old with a white beard and almost wholly bald each swept the place in front of himself with his broom thereupon rigoux changed into a great hegoat black and stinking around whom they all danced backward with their faces outward and their backs towards the goat they danced about half an hour and then his master told him they must adore the goat who was the devil et ce fait et dict veit que ledict bouc courba ses deux pieds de deuant et leua son cul en haut et lors que certaines menues graines grosses comme testes despingles qui se conuertissoient en poudres fort puantes sentant le soulphre et poudre à canon et chair puant mesleés ensemble seroient tombeés sur plusieurs drappeaux en sept doubles then the oldest and so the rest in order went forward on their knees and gathered up their cloths with the powders but first each se seroit incliné vers le diable et iceluy baisé en la partie honteuse de son corps they went home on their broom lighted as before de la rue confessed also that he was at another assembly on the eve of st john baptist with the powders they could cause the death of men against whom they had a spite or their cattle rigoux before long began to tempt him to drown himself and though he lay down yet rolled him some distance towards the river it is plain that the poor fellow was mad or halfwitted or both and yet bodin the author of the de republica reckoned one of the ablest books of that age believed all this filthy nonsense and prefixes it to his démonomanie as proof conclusive of the existence of sorcerers  this was in 1587 just a century later glanvil one of the most eminent men of his day and henry more the platonist whose memory is still dear to the lovers of an imaginative mysticism were perfectly satisfied with evidence like that which follows elizabeth styles confessed in 1664 that the devil about ten years since appeared to her in the shape of a handsome man and after of a black dog that he promised her money and that she should live gallantly and have the pleasure of the world for twelve years if she would with her blood sign his paper which was to give her soul to him and observe his laws and that he might suck her blood this after four solicitations the examinant promised him to do upon which he pricked the fourth finger of her right hand between the middle and upper joynt where the sign at the examination remained and with a drop or two of her blood she signed the paper with an o upon this the devil gave her sixpence and vanished with the paper that since he hath appeared to her in the shape of a man and did so on wednesday sevennight past but more usually he appears in the likeness of a dog and cat and a fly like a millar in which last he usually sucks in the poll about four of the clock in the morning and did so jan 27 and that it is pain to her to be so suckt that when she hath a desire to do harm she calls the spirit by the name of robin to whom when he appeareth she useth these words o sathan give me my purpose she then tells him what she would have done and that he should so appear to her was part of her contract with him the devil in this case appeared as a black darkcomplexioned man in black clothes with a little banda very clericallooking personage before they are carried to their meetings they anoint their foreheads and handwrists with an oyl the spirit brings them which smells raw and then they are carried in a very short time using these words as they pass thout tout a tout throughout and about and when they go off from their meetings they say rentum tormentum that at every meeting before the spirit vanisheth away he appoints the next meeting place and time and at his departure there is a foul smell at their meeting they have usually wine or good beer cakes meat or the like they eat and drink really when they meet in their bodies dance also and have some musick the man in black sits at the higher end and anne bishop usually next him he useth some words before meat and none after his voice is audible but very low the man in black sometimes plays on a pipe or cittern and the company dance at last the devil vanisheth and all are carried to their several homes in a short space at their parting they say a boy merry meet merry part alice duke confessed that anne bishop persuaded her to go with her into the churchyard in the nighttime and being come thither to go backward round the church which they did three times in their first round they met a man in black cloths who went round the second time with them and then they met a thing in the shape of a great black toad which leapt up against the examinants apron in their third round they met somewhat in the shape of a rat which vanished away she also received sixpence from the devil and her familiar did commonly suck her right breast about seven at night in the shape of a little cat of a dunnish colour which is as smooth as a want mole and when she is suckt she is in a kind of trance poor christian green got only fourpence halfpenny for her soul but her bargain was made some years later than that of the others and quotations as the stockbrokers would say ranged lower her familiar took the shape of a hedgehog julian cox confessed that she had been often tempted by the devil to be a witch but never consented that one evening she walkt about a mile from her own house and there came riding towards her three persons upon three broomstaves born up about a yard and a half from the ground two of them she formerly knew which was a witch and a wizzard that were hanged for witchcraft several years before the third person she knew not he came in the shape of a black man and tempted her to give him her soul or to that effect and to express it by pricking her finger and giving her name in her blood in token of it on her trial judge archer told the jury he had heard that a witch could not repeat that petition in the lords prayer viz and lead us not into temptation and having this occasion he would try the experiment the jury were not in the least measure to guide their verdict according to it because it was not legal evidence accordingly it was found that the poor old trot could say only lead us into temptation or lead us not into no temptation probably she used the latter form first and finding she had blundered corrected herself by leaving out both the negatives the old english double negation seems never to have been heard of by the court janet douglass a pretended dumb girl by whose contrivance five persons had been burned at paisley in 1677 for having caused the sickness of sir george maxwell by means of waxen and other images having recovered her speech shortly after declared that she had some smattering knowledge of the lords prayer which she had heard the witches repeat it seems by her vision in the presence of the devil and at his desire which they observed they added to the word art the letter w which made it run our father which wart in heaven by which means the devil made the application of the prayer to himself she also showed on the arm of a woman named campbell an invisible mark which she had gotten from the devil the wife of one barton confessed that she had engaged in the devils service she renounced her baptism and did prostrate her body to the foul spirit and received his mark and got a new name from him and was called margaratus she was asked if she ever had any pleasure in his company never much says she but one night going to a dancing upon pentland hills in the likeness of a rough tanny tawny dog playing on a pair of pipes the spring he played says she was the silly bit chicken gar cast it a pickle and it will grow meikle103 in 1670 near seventy of both sexes among them fifteen children were executed for witchcraft at the village of mohra in sweden thirtysix children between the ages of nine and sixteen were sentenced to be scourged with rods on the palms of their hands once a week for a year the evidence in this case against the accused seems to have been mostly that of children being asked whether they were sure that they were at any time carried away by the devil they all declared they were begging of the commissioners that they might be freed from that intolerable slavery they used to go to a gravel pit which lay hardby a crossway and there they put on a vest over their heads and then danced round and after ran to the crossway and called the devil thrice first with a still voice the second time somewhat louder and the third time very loud with these words antecessour come and carry us to blockula whereupon immediately he used to appear but in different habits but for the most part they saw him in a gray coat and red and blue stockings he had a red beard a highcrowned hat with linnen of divers colours wrapt about it and long garters upon his stockings they must procure some scrapings of altars and filings of churchclocks bells and he gives them a horn with some salve in it wherewith they do anoint themselves being asked whether they were sure of a real personal transportation and whether they were awake when it was done they all answered in the affirmative and that the devil sometimes laid something down in the place that was very like them but one of them confessed that he did only take away her strength and her body lay still upon the ground yet sometimes he took even her body with him till of late they never had that power to carry away children but only this year and the last and the devil did at this time force them to it that heretofore it was sufficient to carry but one of their children or a strangers child which yet happened seldom but now he did plague them and whip them if they did not procure him children insomuch that they had no peace or quiet for him and whereas formerly one journey a week would serve their turn from their own town to the place aforesaid now they were forced to run to other towns and places for children and that they brought with them some fifteen some sixteen children every night for their journey they made use of all sorts of instruments of beasts of men of spits and posts according as they had opportunity if they do ride upon goats and have many children with them they have a way of lengthening the goat with a spit and then are anointed with the aforesaid ointment a little girl of elfdale confessed that naming the name of jesus as she was carried away she fell suddenly upon the ground and got a great hole in her side which the devil presently healed up again the first thing they must do at blockula was that they must deny all and devote themselves body and soul to the devil and promise to serve him faithfully and confirm all this with an oath hereupon they cut their fingers and with their bloud writ their name in his book he caused them to be baptized by such priests as he had there and made them confirm their baptism with dreadful oaths and imprecations hereupon the devil gave them a purse wherein their filings of clocks bells with a stone tied to it which they threw into the water and then they were forced to speak these words as these filings of the clock do never return to the clock from which they are taken so may my soul never return to heaven the diet they did use to have there was broth with colworts and bacon in it oatmealbread spread with butter milk and cheese sometimes it tasted very well sometimes very ill after meals they went to dancing and in the mean while swore and cursed most dreadfully and afterward went to fighting one with another the devil had sons and daughters by them which he did marry together and they did couple and brought forth toads and serpents if he hath a mind to be merry with them he lets them all ride upon spits before him takes afterwards the spits and beats them black and blue and then laughs at them they had seen sometimes a very great devil like a dragon with fire about him and bound with an iron chain and the devil that converses with them tells them that if they confess anything he will let that great devil loose upon them whereby all sweedland shall come into great danger the devil taught them to milk which was in this wise they used to stick a knife in the wall and hang a kind of label on it which they drew and stroaked and as long as this lasted the persons that they had power over were miserably plagued and the beasts were milked that way till sometimes they died of it the minister of elfdale declared that one night these witches were to his thinking upon the crown of his head and that from thence he had had a longcontinued pain of the head one of the witches confessed too that the devil had sent her to torment the minister and that she was ordered to use a nail and strike it into his head but it would not enter very deep they confessed also that the devil gives them a beast about the bigness and shape of a young cat which they call a carrier and that he gives them a bird too as big as a raven but white and these two creatures they can send anywhere and wherever they come they take away all sorts of victuals they can get what the bird brings they may keep for themselves but what the carrier brings they must reserve for the devil the lords commissioners were indeed very earnest and took great pains to persuade them to show some of their tricks but to no purpose for they did all unanimously confess that since they had confessed all they found that all their witchcraft was gone and that the devil at this time appeared to them very terrible with claws on his hands and feet and with horns on his head and a long tail behind at blockula the devil had a church such another as in the town of mohra when the commissioners were coming he told the witches they should not fear them for he would certainly kill them all and they confessed that some of them had attempted to murther the commissioners but had not been able to effect it  in these confessions we find included nearly all the particulars of the popular belief concerning witchcraft and see the gradual degradation of the once superb lucifer to the vulgar scarecrow with horns and tail the prince of darkness was a gentleman from him who had not lost all his original brightness to this dirty fellow who leaves a stench sometimes of brimstone behind him the descent is a long one for the dispersion of this foul odor dr henry more gives an odd reason the devil also as in other stories leaving an ill smell behind him seems to imply the reality of the business those adscititious particles he held together in his visible vehicle being loosened at his vanishing and so offending the nostrils by their floating and diffusing themselves in the open air in all the stories vestiges of paganism are not indistinct the three principal witch gatherings of the year were held on the days of great pagan festivals which were afterwards adopted by the church maury supposes the witches sabbath to be derived from the rites of bacchus sabazius and accounts in this way for the devils taking the shape of a hegoat but the name was more likely to be given from hatred of the jews and the goat may have a much less remote origin bodin assumes the identity of the devil with pan and in the popular mythology both of kelts and teutons there were certain hairy wooddemons called by the former dus and by the latter scrat our common names of deuse and old scratch are plainly derived from these and possibly old harry is a corruption of old hairy by latinization they became satyrs here at any rate is the source of the cloven hoof the belief in the devils appearing to his worshippers as a goat is very old possibly the fact that this animal was sacred to thor the god of thunder may explain it certain it is that the traditions of vulcan thor and wayland104 converged at last in satan like vulcan he was hurled from heaven and like him he still limps across the stage in mephistopheles though without knowing why in germany he has a horses and not a cloven foot105 because the horse was a frequent pagan sacrifice and therefore associated with devilworship under the new dispensation hence the horror of hippophagism which some french gastronomes are striving to overcome everybody who has read tom brown or wordsworths sonnet on a german stove remembers the saxon horse sacred to woden the raven was also his peculiar bird and grimm is inclined to think this the reason why the witchs familiar appears so often in that shape it is true that our old nick is derived from nikkar one of the titles of that divinity but the association of the evil one with the raven is older and most probably owing to the illomened character of the bird itself already in the apocryphal gospel of the infancy the demoniac son of the chief priest puts on his head one of the swaddlingclothes of christ which mary has hung out to dry and forthwith the devils began to come out of his mouth and to fly away as crows and serpents  it will be noticed that the witches underwent a form of baptism as the system gradually perfected itself among the least imaginative of men as the superstitious are apt to be they could do nothing better than describe satans world as in all respects the reverse of that which had been conceived by the orthodox intellect as divine have you an illustrated bible of the last century very good turn it upside down and you find the prints on the whole about as near nature as ever and yet pretending to be something new by a simple device that saves the fancy a good deal of trouble for while it is true that the poetic fancy plays yet the faculty which goes by that pseudonyme in prosaic minds and it was by such that the details of this satanic commerce were pieced together is hard put to it for invention and only too thankful for any laborsaving contrivance whatsoever accordingly all it need take the trouble to do was to reverse the ideas of sacred things already engraved on its surface and behold a kingdom of hell with all the merit and none of the difficulty of originality uti

should ring while the demon is conveying home his witch he lets her drop in the confession of agnes simpson the meeting place was north berwick kirk the devil started up himself in the pulpit like a meikle black man and calling the row roll every one answered here at his command they opened up three graves and cutted off from the dead corpses the joints of their fingers toes and nose and parted them amongst them and the said agnes simpson got for her part a windingsheet and two joints the devil commanded them to keep the joints upon them while till they were dry and then to make a powder of them to do evil withal this confession is sadly memorable for it was made before james i then king of scots and is said to have convinced him of the reality of witchcraft hence the act passed in the first year of his reign in england and not repealed till 1736 under which perhaps in consequence of which so many suffered  the notion of these witchgatherings was first suggested there can be little doubt by secret conventicles of persisting or relapsed pagans or of heretics both perhaps contributed their share sometimes a mountain as in germany the blocksberg108 sometimes a conspicuous oak or linden and there were many such among both gauls and germans sacred of old to pagan rites and later a lonely heath a place where two roads crossed each other a cavern gravelpit or quarry the gallows or the churchyard was the place appointed for their diabolic orgies that the witch could be conveyed bodily to these meetings was at first admitted without any question but as the husbands of accused persons sometimes testified that their wives had not left their beds on the alleged night of meeting the witchmongers were put to strange shifts by way of accounting for it sometimes the devil imposed on the husband by a deceptio visus sometimes a demon took the place of the wife sometimes the body was left and the spirit only transported but the more orthodox opinion was in favor of corporeal deportation bodin appeals triumphantly to the cases of habbakuk now in the apocrypha but once making a part of the book of daniel and of philip in the acts of the apostles i find he says this ecstatic ravishment they talk of much more wonderful than bodily transport and if the devil has this power as they confess of ravishing the spirit out of the body is it not more easy to carry body and soul without separation or division of the reasonable part than to withdraw and divide the one from the other without death the author of de lamiis argues for the corporeal theory the evil angels have the same superiority of natural power as the good since by the fall they lost none of the gifts of nature but only those of grace now as we know that good angels can thus transport men in the twinkling of an eye it follows that evil ones may do the same he fortifies his position by a recent example from secular history no one doubts about john faust who dwelt at wittenberg in the time of the sainted luther and who seating himself on his cloak with his companions was conveyed away and borne by the devil through the air to distant kingdoms109 glanvin inclines rather to the spiritual than the material hypothesis and suggests that the witchs anointing herself before she takes her flight may perhaps serve to keep the body tenantable and in fit disposition to receive the spirit at its return aubrey whose miscellanies were published in 1696 had no doubts whatever as to the physical asportation of the witch he says that a gentleman of his acquaintance was in portugal anno 1655 when one was burnt by the inquisition for being brought thither from goa in east india in the air in an incredible short time as to the conveyance of witches through crevices keyholes chimneys and the like herr walburger discusses the question with such comical gravity that we must give his argument in the undiminished splendor of its jurisconsult latinity the first sentence is worthy of magister

and the ut ita loquar thrown in so carelessly as if with a deprecatory wave of the hand for using a less classical locution than usual strikes me as a very delicate touch indeed  grimm tells us that he does not know when broomsticks spits and similar utensils were first assumed to be the canonical instruments of this nocturnal equitation he thinks it comparatively modern but i suspect it is as old as the first child that ever bestrode his fathers staff and fancied it into a courser shod with wind like those of pindar alas for the poverty of human invention it cannot afford a hippogriff for an everyday occasion the poor old crones badgered by inquisitors into confessing they had been where they never were were involved in the further necessity of explaining how the devil they got there the only steed their parents had ever been rich enough to keep had been of this domestic sort and they no doubt had ridden in this inexpensive fashion imagining themselves the grand dames they saw sometimes flash by in the happy days of childhood now so far away forced to give a how and unable to conceive of mounting in the air without something to sustain them their bewildered wits naturally took refuge in some such simple subterfuge and the broomstave which might make part of the poorest houses furniture was the nearest at hand if youth and good spirits could put such life into a dead stick once why not age and evil spirits now moreover what so likely as an emeritus implement of this sort to become the staff of a withered beldame and thus to be naturally associated with her image i remember very well a poor halfcrazed creature who always wore a scarlet cloak and leaned on such a stay cursing and banning after a fashion that would infallibly have burned her two hundred years ago but apart from any adventitious associations of later growth it is certain that a very ancient belief gave to magic the power of imparting life or the semblance of it to inanimate things and thus sometimes making servants of them the wands of the egyptian magicians were turned to serpents still nearer to the purpose is the capital story of lucian out of which goethe made his zauberlehrling of the stick turned watercarrier the classical theory of the witchs flight was driven to no such vulgar expedients the ointment turning her into a bird for the nonce as in lucian and apuleius in those days too there was nothing known of any campmeeting of witches and wizards but each sorceress transformed herself that she might fly to her paramour according to some of the scotch stories the witch after bestriding her broomsticks must repeat the magic formula horse and hattork the flitting of these illomened nightbirds like nearly all the general superstitions relating to witchcraft mingles itself and is lost in a throng of figures more august110 diana bertha holda abundia befana once beautiful and divine the bringers of blessing while men slept became demons haunting the drear of

interesting to trace the gradual degeneration of a poetic faith into the ritual of unimaginative tupperism so it is amusing to see pedantry clinging faithfully to the traditions of its prosaic nature and holding sacred the dead shells that once housed a moral symbol what a divine thing the outside always has been and continues to be and how the cast clothes of the mind continue always to be in fashion we turn our coats without changing the cut of them but was it possible for a man to change not only his skin but his nature were there such things as versipelles lycanthropi werwolfs and

reproduced again as symbols no longer of physical but of moral truths by and by the professional poets in search of a subject are struck by the fund of picturesque material lying unused in them and

tandem posse fieri fuit constitum bodin must have been delighted with this story though perhaps as a protestant he might have vilipended the infallible decision of the pope in its favor as for lycanthropy that was too common in his own time to need any confirmation it was notorious to all men in livonia during the latter part of december a villain goes about summoning the sorcerers to meet at a certain place and if they fail the devil scourges them thither with an iron rod and that so sharply that the marks of it remain upon them their captain goes before and they to the number of several thousands follow him across a river which passed they change into wolves and casting themselves upon men and flocks do all manner of damage this we have on the authority of melancthons soninlaw gaspar peucerus moreover many books published in germany affirm that one of the greatest kings in christendom not long since dead was often changed into a wolf but what need of words the conclusive proof remains that many in our own day being put to the torture have confessed the fact and been burned alive accordingly the maintainers of the reality of witchcraft in the next century seem to have dropped the werwolf by common consent though supported by the same kind of evidence they relied on in other matters namely that of ocular witnesses the confession of the accused and general notoriety so lately as 1765 the french peasants believed the wild beast of the gevaudan to be a loupgarou and that i think is his last appearance  the particulars of the concubinage of witches with their familiars were discussed with a relish and a filthy minuteness worthy of sanchez could children be born of these devilish amours of course they could said one party are there not plenty of cases in authentic history who was the father of romulus and remus nay not so very long ago of merlin another party denied the possibility of the thing altogether among these was luther who declared the children either to be supposititious or else mere imps disguised as innocent sucklings and known as wechselkinder or changelings who were common enough as everybody must be aware of the intercourse itself luther had no doubts111 a third party took a middle ground and believed that vermin and toads might be the offspring of such amours and how did the demon a mere spiritual essence contrive himself a body some would have it that he entered into dead bodies by preference of course those of sorcerers it is plain from the confession of de la rue that this was the theory of his examiners this also had historical evidence in its favor there was the wellknown leading case of the bride of corinth for example and but yesterday as it were at crossen in silesia did not christopher monig an apothecarys servant come back after being buried and do duty as if nothing particular had happened putting up prescriptions as usual and pounding drugs in the mortar with a mighty noise apothecaries seem to have been special victims of these satanic pranks for another appeared at reichenbach not long before affirming that he had poisoned several men with his drugs which certainly gives an air of truth to the story accordingly the devil is represented as being unpleasantly cold to the touch caietan escrit quune sorciere demanda un iour au diable pourquoy il ne se rechauffoit qui fist response quil faisoit ce quil pouuoit poor devil but there are cases in which the demon is represented as so hot that his grasp left a seared spot as black as charcoal perhaps some of them came from the torrid zone of their broad empire and others from the thrilling regions of thickribbed ice those who were not satisfied with the deadbody theory contented themselves like dr more with that of adscititious particles which has to be sure a more metaphysical and scholastic flavor about it that the demons really came either corporeally or through some diabolic illusion that amounted to the same thing and that the witch devoted herself to him body and soul scarce anybody was bold enough to doubt to these familiars their venerable paramours gave endearing nicknames such as my little master or my dear martinthe latter probably after the heresy of luther and when the rack was popish the famous witchfinder hopkins enables us to lengthen the list considerably one witch whom he convicted after being kept from sleep two or three nights called in five of her devilish servitors the first was holt who came in like a white kitling the second jarmara like a fat spaniel without any legs at all the third vinegar tom who was like a longtailed greyhound with an head like an oxe with a long tail and broad eyes who when this discoverer spoke to and bade him to the place provided for him and his angells immediately transformed himself into the shape of a child of foure yeares old without a head and gave half a dozen turnes about the house and vanished at the doore the fourth sack and sugar like a black rabbet the fifth news like a polcat other names of his finding were elemauzer pywacket peckinthecrown grizzel and greedygut which he adds no mortal could invent the name of robin which we met with in the confession of alice duke has perhaps wider associations than the woman herself dreamed of for through robin des bois and robin hood it may be another of those scattered traces that lead us back to woden probably however it is only our old friend robin goodfellow whose namesake knecht ruprecht makes such a figure in the german fairy mythology possessed persons called

very well but were remarkably poor latinists knowing indeed almost as little of the language as if their youth had been spent in writing latin verses112 a shrewd scotch physician tried them with gaelic but they could make nothing of it  it was only when scepticism had begun to make itself uncomfortably inquisitive that the devil had any difficulty in making himself visible and even palpable in simpler times demons would almost seem to have made no inconsiderable part of the population trithemius tells of one who served as cook to the bishop of hildesheim one shudders to think of the school where he had graduated as cordon bleu and who delectebatur esse cum hominibus loquens interrogans respondens familiariter omnibus aliquando visibiliter aliquando invisibiliter apparens this last feat of appearing invisibly would have been worth seeing in 1554 the devil came of a christmas eve to lawrence doner a parish priest in saxony and asked to be confessed admissus horrendas adversus christum filium dei blasphemias evomuit verum cum virtute verbi dei a parocho victus esset intolerabili post se relicto foetore abiit splendidly dressed with two companions he frequented an honest mans house at rothenberg he brought with him a piper or fiddler and contrived feasts and dances under pretext of wooing the goodmans daughter he boasted that he was a foreign nobleman of immense wealth and for a time was as successful as an italian courier has been known to be at one of our fashionable wateringplaces but the importunity of the guest and his friends at length displicuit patrifamilias who accordingly one evening invited a minister of the word to meet them at supper and entered upon pious discourse with him from the word of god wherefore seeking other matter of conversation they said that there were many facetious things more suitable to exhilarate the suppertable than the interpretation of holy writ and begged that they might be no longer bored with scripture thoroughly satisfied by their singular way of thinking that his guests were diabolical paterfamilias cries out in latin worthy of father tom apagite vos scelerati nebulones this said the tartarean impostor and his companions at once vanished with a great tumult leaving behind them a most unpleasant foetor and the bodies of three men who had been hanged perhaps if the clergymancure were faithfully tried upon the next fortunehunting count with a large real estate in whiskers and an imaginary one in barataria he also might vanish leaving a strong smell of barbersshop and taking with him a body that will come to the gallows in due time it were worth trying luther tells of a demon who served as famulus in a monastery fetching beer for the monks and always insisting on honest measure for his money there is one case on record where the devil appealed to the courts for protection in his rights a monk going to visit his mistress fell dead as he was passing a bridge the good and bad angel came to litigation about his soul the case was referred by agreement to eichard duke of normandy who decided that the monks body should be carried back to the bridge and his soul restored to it by the claimants if he persevered in keeping his assignation the devil was to have him if not then the angel the monk thus put upon his guard turns back and saves his soul such as it was113 perhaps the most impudent thing the devil ever did was to open a school of magic in toledo the ceremony of graduation in this institution was peculiar the senior class had all to run through a narrow cavern and the venerable president was entitled to the hindmost if he could catch him sometimes it happened that he caught only his shadow and in that case the man who had been nimble enough to do what goethe pronounces impossible became the most profound magician of his year hence our proverb of the devil take the hindmost and chamissos story of peter schlemihl  there is no end of such stories they were repeated and believed by the gravest and wisest men down to the end of the sixteenth century they were received undoubtingly by the great majority down to the end of the seventeenth the devil was an easy way of accounting for what was beyond mens comprehension he was the simple and satisfactory answer to all the conundrums of nature and what the devil had not time to bestow his personal attention upon the witch was always ready to do for him was a doctor at a loss about a case how could he save his credit more cheaply than by pronouncing it witchcraft and turning it over to the parson to be exorcised did a mans cow die suddenly or his horse fall lame witchcraft did one of those writers of controversial quartos heavy as the stone of diomed feel a pain in the small of his back witchcraft unhappily there were always ugly old women and if you crossed them in any way or did them a wrong they were given to scolding and banning if within a year or two after anything should happen to you or yours why of course old mother bombie or goody blake must be at the bottom of it for it was perfectly well known that there were witches does not gods law say expressly suffer not a witch to live and that they could cast a spell by the mere glance of their eyes could cause you to pine away by melting a waxen image could give you a pain wherever they liked by sticking pins into the same could bring sickness into your house or into your barn by hiding a devils powder under the threshold and who knows what else worst of all they could send a demon into your body who would cause you to vomit pins hair pebbles knivesindeed almost anything short of a cathedralwithout any fault of yours utter through you the most impertinent things verbi ministro and in short make you the most important personage in the parish for the time being meanwhile you were an object of condolence and contribution to the whole neighborhood what wonder if a lazy apprentice or servantmaid bekker gives several instances of the kind detected by him should prefer being possessed with its attendant perquisites to drudging from morning till night and to any one who has observed how common a thing in certain states of mind selfconnivance is and how near it is to selfdeception it will not be surprising that some were to all intents and purposes really possessed who has never felt an almost irresistible temptation and seemingly not selforiginated to let himself go to let his mind gallop and kick and curvet and roll like a horse turned loose in short as we yankees say to speak out in meeting who never had it suggested to him by the fiend to break in at a funeral with a real character of the deceased instead of that mrs grundyfied view of him which the clergyman is so painfully elaborating in his prayer remove the pendulum of conventional routine and the mental machinery runs on with a whir that gives a delightful excitement to sluggish temperaments and is perhaps the natural relief of highly nervous organizations the tyrant will is dethroned and the sceptre snatched by his frolic sister whim this state of things if continued must become either insanity or imposture but who can say precisely where consciousness ceases and a kind of automatic movement begins the result of overexcitement the subjects of these strange disturbances have been almost always young women or girls at a critical period of their development many of the most remarkable cases have occurred in convents and both there and elsewhere as in other kinds of temporary nervous derangement have proved contagious sometimes as in the affair of the nuns of loudon there seems every reason to suspect a conspiracy but i am not quite ready to say that grandier was the only victim and that some of the energumens were not unconscious tools in the hands of priestcraft and revenge one thing is certain that in the dioceses of humanely sceptical prelates the cases of possession were sporadic only and either cured or at least hindered from becoming epidemic by episcopal mandate cardinal mazarin when papal vicelegate at avignon made an end of the trade of exorcism within his government  but scepticism down to the beginning of the eighteenth century was the exception undoubting and often fanatical belief was the rule it is easy enough to be astonished at it still easier to misapprehend it how could sane men have been deceived by such nurserytales still more how could they have suffered themselves on what seems to us such puerile evidence to consent to such atrocious cruelties nay to urge them on as to the belief we should remember that the human mind when it sails by dead reckoning without the possibility of a fresh observation perhaps without the instruments necessary to take one will sometimes bring up in very strange latitudes do we of the nineteenth century then always strike out boldly into the unlandmarked deep of speculation and shape our courses by the stars or do we not sometimes con our voyage by what seem to us the firm and familiar headlands of truth planted by god himself but which may after all be no more than an insubstantial mockery of cloud or airy juggle of mirage the refraction of our own atmosphere has by no means made an end of its tricks with the appearances of things in our little world of thought the men of that day believed what they saw or as our generation would put it what they thought they saw very good the vast majority of men believe and always will believe on the same terms when one comes along who can partly distinguish the thing seen from that travesty or distortion of it which the thousand disturbing influences within him and without him would make him see we call him a great philosopher all our intellectual charts are engraved according to his observations and we steer contentedly by them till some man whose brain rests on a still more unmovable basis corrects them still further by eliminating what his predecessor thought he saw we must account for many former aberrations in the moral world by the presence of more or less nebulous bodies of a certain gravity which modified the actual position of truth in its relation to the mind and which if they have now vanished have made way perhaps for others whose influence will in like manner be allowed for by posterity in their estimate of us in matters of faith astrology has by no means yet given place to astronomy nor alchemy become chemistry which knows what to seek for and how to find it in the days of witchcraft all science was still in the condition of maybe it is only just bringing itself to find a higher satisfaction in the imperturbable mustbe of law we should remember that what we call natural may have a very different meaning for one generation from that which it has for another the boundary between the other world and this ran till very lately and at some points runs still through a vast tract of unexplored borderland of very uncertain tenure even now the territory which reason holds firmly as lord warden of the marches during daylight is subject to sudden raids of imagination by night but physical darkness is not the only one that lends opportunity to such incursions and in midsummer 1692 when ebenezer bapson looking out of the fort at gloucester in broad day saw shapes of men sometimes in blue coats like indians sometimes in white waistcoats like frenchmen it seemed more natural to most men that they should be spectres than men of flesh and blood granting the assumed premises as nearly every one did the syllogism was perfect  so much for the apparent reasonableness of the belief since every mans logic is satisfied with a legitimate deduction from his own postulates causes for the cruelty to which the belief led are not further to seek toward no crime have men shown themselves so coldbloodedly cruel as in punishing difference of belief and the first systematic persecutions for witchcraft began with the inquisitors in the south of france in the thirteenth century it was then and there that the charge of sexual uncleanness with demons was first devised persecuted heretics would naturally meet in darkness and secret and it was easy to blacken such meetings with the accusation of deeds so foul as to shun the light of day and the eyes of men they met to renounce god and worship the devil but this was not enough to excite popular hatred and keep it fiercely alive fear must be mingled with it and this end was reached by making the heretic also a sorcerer who by the devils help could and would work all manner of fiendish mischief when by this means the belief in a league between witch and demon had become firmly established witchcraft grew into a welldefined crime hateful enough in itself to furnish pastime for the torturer and food for the fagot in the fifteenth century witches were burned by thousands and it may well be doubted if all paganism together was ever guilty of so many human sacrifices in the same space of time in the sixteenth these holocausts were appealed to as conclusive evidence of the reality of the crime terror was again aroused the more vindictive that its sources were so vague and intangible and cruelty was the natural consequence nothing but an abject panic in which the whole use of reason except as a mill to grind out syllogisms was altogether lost will account for some chapters in bodins démonomanie men were surrounded by a foreverrenewed conspiracy whose ramifications they could not trace though they might now and then lay hold on one of its associates protestant and catholic might agree in nothing else but they were unanimous in their dread of this invisible enemy if fright could turn civilized englishmen into savage iroquois during the imagined negro plots of new york in 1741 and of jamaica in 1865 if the same invisible omnipresence of fenianism shall be able to work the same miracle as it perhaps will next year in england itself why need we be astonished that the blows should have fallen upon many an innocent head when men were striking wildly in selfdefence as they supposed against the unindictable powers of darkness against a plot which could be carried on by human agents but with invisible accessories and by supernatural means in the seventeenth century an element was added which pretty well supplied the place of heresy as a sharpener of hatred and an awakener of indefinable suspicion scepticism had been born into the world almost more hateful than heresy because it had the manners of good society and contented itself with a smile a shrug an almost imperceptible lift of the eyebrowa kind of reasoning especially exasperating to disputants of the old school who still cared about victory even when they did not about the principles involved in the debate  the puritan emigration to new england took place at a time when the belief in diabolic agency had been hardly called in question much less shaken the early adventurers brought it with them to a country in every way fitted not only to keep it alive but to feed it into greater vigor the solitude of the wilderness and solitude alone by disfurnishing the brain of its commonplace associations makes it an apt theatre for the delusions of imagination the nightly forest noises the glimpse perhaps through the leaves of a painted savage face uncertain whether of redman or devil but more likely of the latter above all that measureless mystery of the unknown and conjectural stretching away illimitable on all sides and vexing the mind somewhat as physical darkness does with intimation and misgivingunder all these influences whatever seeds of superstition had in any way got over from the old world would find an only too congenial soil in the new the leaders of that emigration believed and taught that demons loved to dwell in waste and wooded places that the indians did homage to the bodily presence of the devil and that he was especially enraged against those who had planted an outpost of the true faith upon this continent hitherto all his own in the third generation of the settlement in proportion as living faith decayed the clergy insisted all the more strongly on the traditions of the elders and as they all placed the sources of goodness and religion in some inaccessible other world rather than in the soul of man himself they clung to every shred of the supernatural as proof of the existence of that other world and of its interest in the affairs of this they had the countenance of all the great theologians catholic as well as protestant of the leaders of the reformation and in their own day of such men as more and glanvil and baxter114 if to all these causes more or less operative in 1692 we add the harassing excitement of an indian war urged on by satan in his hatred of the churches with its daily and nightly apprehensions and alarms we shall be less astonished that the delusion in salem village rose so high than that it subsided so soon  i have already said that it was religious antipathy or clerical interest that first made heresy and witchcraft identical and cast them into the same expiatory fire the invention was a catholic one but it is plain that protestants soon learned its value and were not slow in making it a plague to the inventor it was not till after the reformation that there was any systematic hunting out of witches in england then no doubt the innocent charms and rhyming prayers of the old religion were regarded as incantations and twisted into evidence against miserable beldames who mumbled over in their dotage what they had learned at their mothers knee it is plain at least that this was one of agnes simpsons crimes  but as respects the frivolity of the proof adduced there was nothing to choose between catholic and protestant out of civil and canon law a net was woven through whose meshes there was no escape and into it the victims were driven by popular clamor suspicion of witchcraft was justified by general report by the illlooks of the suspected by being silent when accused by her mothers having been a witch by flight by exclaiming when arrested i am lost by a habit of using imprecations by the evidence of two witnesses by the accusation of a man on his deathbed by a habit of being away from home at night by fifty other things equally grave anybody might be an accusera personal enemy an infamous person a child parent brother or sister once accused the culprit was not to be allowed to touch the ground on the way to prison was not to be left alone there lest she have interviews with the devil and get from him the means of being insensible under torture was to be stripped and shaved in order to prevent her concealing some charm or to facilitate the finding of witchmarks her right thumb tied to her left greattoe and vice versa she was thrown into the water if she floated she was a witch if she sank and was drowned she was lucky this trial as old as the days of pliny the elder was gone out of fashion the author of de lamiis assures us in his day everywhere but in westphalia on halfproof or strong presumption says bodin the judge may proceed to torture if the witch did not shed tears under the rack it was almost conclusive of guilt on this topic of torture he grows eloquent the rack does very well but to thrust splinters between the nails and flesh of hands and feet is the most excellent gehenna of all and practised in turkey that of florence where they seat the criminal in a hanging chair so contrived that if he drop asleep it overturns and leaves him hanging by a rope which wrenches his arms backwards is perhaps even better for the limbs are not broken and without trouble or labor one gets out the truth it is well in carrying the accused to the chamber of torture to cause some in the next room to shriek fearfully as if on the rack that they may be terrified into confession it is proper to tell them that their accomplices have confessed and accused them though they have done no such thing that they may do the same out of revenge the judge may also with a good conscience lie to the prisoner and tell her that if she admit her guilt she may be pardoned this is bodins opinion but walburger writing a century later concludes that the judge may go to any extent citra mendacium this side of lying he may tell the witch that he will be favorable meaning to the commonwealth that he will see that she has a new house built for her that is a wooden one to burn her in that her confession will be most useful in saving her life to wit her life eternal there seems little difference between the germans white lies and the frenchmans black ones as to punishment bodin is fierce for burning though a protestant he quotes with evident satisfaction a decision of the magistrates that one who had eaten flesh on a friday should be burned alive unless he repented and if he repented yet he was hanged out of compassion a child under twelve who will not confess meeting with the devil should be put to death if convicted of the fact though bodin allows that satan made no express compact with those who had not arrived at puberty this he learned from the examination of jeanne harvillier who deposed that though her mother dedicated her to satan so soon as she was born yet she was not married to him nor did he demand that or her renunciation of god till she had attained the age of twelve  there is no more painful reading than this except the trials of the witches themselves these awaken by turns pity indignation disgust and dreaddread at the thought of what the human mind may be brought to believe not only probable but proven but it is well to be put upon our guard by lessons of this kind for the wisest man is in some respects little better than a madman in a straitwaistcoat of habit public opinion prudence or the like scepticism began at length to make itself felt but it spread slowly and was shy of proclaiming itself the orthodox party was not backward to charge with sorcery whoever doubted their facts or pitied their victims bodin says that it is good cause of suspicion against a judge if he turn the matter into ridicule or incline toward mercy the mob as it always is was orthodox it was dangerous to doubt it might be fatal to deny in 1453 guillaume de lure was burned at poitiers on his own confession of a compact with satan by which he agreed to preach and did preach that everything told of sorcerers was mere fable and that it was cruelly done to condemn them to death this contract was found among his papers signed with the devils own claw as howell says speaking of a similar case it is not to be wondered at that the earlier doubters were cautious there was literally a reign of terror and during such régimes men are commonly found more eager to be informers and accusers than of counsel for the defence peter of abano is reckoned among the earliest unbelievers who declared himself openly115 chaucer was certainly a sceptic as appears by the opening of the wife of baths tale wierus a german physician was the first to undertake 1563 a refutation of the facts and assumptions on which the prosecutions for witchcraft were based his explanation of the phenomena is mainly physiological mr leckie hardly states his position correctly in saying that he never dreamed of restricting the sphere of the supernatural wierus went as far as he dared no one can read his book without feeling that he insinuates much more than he positively affirms or denies he would have weakened his cause if he had seemed to disbelieve in demoniacal possession since that had the supposed warrant of scripture but it may be questioned whether he uses the words satan and demon in any other way than that in which many people still use the word nature he was forced to accept certain premises of his opponents by the line of his argument when he recites incredible stories without comment it is not that he believes them but that he thinks their absurdity obvious that he wrote under a certain restraint is plain from the colophon of his book where he says nihil autem hic ita assertum volo quod aequiori judicio catholicae christi ecclesiae non omnino submittam palinodia mox spontanea emendaturus si erroris alicubi convincar a great deal of latent and timid scepticism seems to have been brought to the surface by his work many eminent persons wrote to him in gratitude and commendation in the preface to his shorter treatise de lamiis which is a mere abridgment he thanks god that his labors had in many places caused the cruelty against innocent blood to slacken and that some more distinguished judges treat more mildly and even absolve from capital punishment the wretched old women branded with the odious name of witches by the populace in the pseudomonarchia daemonum he gives a kind of census of the diabolic kingdom116 but evidently with secret intention of making the whole thing ridiculous or it would not have so stirred the bile of bodin wierus was saluted by many contemporaries as a hercules who destroyed monsters and himself not immodestly claimed the civic wreath for having saved the lives of fellowcitizens posterity should not forget a man who really did an honest lifes work for humanity and the liberation of thought from one of the letters appended to his book we learn that jacobus savagius a physician of antwerp had twenty years before written a treatise with the same design but confining himself to the medical argument exclusively he was however prevented from publishing it by death it is pleasant to learn from bodin that alciato the famous lawyer and emblematist was one of those who laughed and made others laugh at the evidence relied on at the trials insisting that witchcraft was a thing impossible and fabulous and so softened the hearts of judges in spite of the fact that an inquisitor had caused to burn more than a hundred sorcerers in piedmont that all the accused escaped in england reginald scot was the first to enter the lists in behalf of those who had no champion his book published in 1584 is full of manly sense and spirit above all of a tender humanity that gives it a warmth which we miss in every other written on the same side in the dedication to sir roger manwood he says i renounce all protection and despise all friendship that might serve towards the suppressing or supplanting of truth to his kinsman sir thomas scot he writes my greatest adversaries are young ignorance and old custom for what folly soever tract of time hath fostered it is so superstitiously pursued of some as though no error could be acquainted with custom and in his preface he thus states his motives god that knoweth my heart is witness and you that read my book shall see that my drift and purpose in this enterprise tendeth only to these respects first that the glory and power of god be not so abridged and abased as to be thrust into the hand or lip of a lewd old woman whereby the work of the creator should be attributed to the power of a creature secondly that the religion of the gospel may be seen to stand without such peevish trumpery thirdly that lawful favor and christian compassion be rather used towards these poor souls than rigor and extremity because they which are commonly accused of witchcraft are the least sufficient of all other persons to speak for themselves as having the most base and simple education of all others the extremity of their age giving them leave to dote their poverty to beg their wrongs to chide and threaten as being void of any other way of revenge their humor melancholical to be full of imaginations from whence chiefly proceedeth the vanity of their confessions and for so much as the mighty help themselves together and the poor widows cry though it reach to heaven is scarce heard here upon earth i thought good according to my poor ability to make intercession that some part of common rigor and some points of hasty judgment may be advised upon the case is nowhere put with more point or urged with more sense and eloquence than by scot whose book contains also more curious matter in the way of charms incantations exorcisms and feats of legerdemain than any other of the kind  other books followed on the same side of which bekkers published about a century later was the most important it is well reasoned learned and tedious to a masterly degree but though the belief in witchcraft might be shaken it still had the advantage of being on the whole orthodox and respectable wise men as usual insisted on regarding superstition as of one substance with faith and objected to any scouring of the shield of religion lest like that of cornelius scriblerus it should suddenly turn out to be nothing more than a paltry old sconce with the nozzle broke off the devil continued to be the only recognized minister resident of god upon earth when we remember that one mans accusation on his deathbed was enough to constitute grave presumption of witchcraft it might seem singular that dying testimonies were so long of no avail against the common credulity but it should be remembered that men are mentally no less than corporeally gregarious and that public opinion the fetish even of the nineteenth century makes men whether for good or ill into a mob which either hurries the individual judgment along with it or runs over and tramples it into insensibility those who are so fortunate as to occupy the philosophical position of spectators ab extra are very few in any generation  there were exceptions it is true but the old cruelties went on in 1610 a case came before the tribunal of the tourelle and when the counsel for the accused argued at some length that sorcery was ineffectual and that the devil could not destroy life president seguier told him that he might spare his breath since the court had long been convinced on those points and yet two years later the grandvicars of the bishop of beauvais solemnly summoned beelzebuth satan motelu and briffaut with the four legions under their charge to appear and sign an agreement never again to enter the bodies of reasonable or other creatures under pain of excommunication if they refused they were to be given over to the power of hell to be tormented and tortured more than was customary three thousand years after the judgment under this proclamation they all came in like reconstructed rebels and signed whatever document was put before them toward the middle of the seventeenth century the safe thing was still to believe or at any rate to profess belief sir thomas browne though he had written an exposure of vulgar errors testified in court to his faith in the possibility of witchcraft sir kenelm digby in his observations on the religio medici takes perhaps as advanced ground as any when he says neither do i deny there are witches i only reserve my assent till i meet with stronger motives to carry it the position of even enlightened men of the world in that age might be called semisceptical la bruyère no doubt expresses the average of opinion que penser de la magie et du sortilége la théorie en est obscurcie les principes vagues incertains et qui approchent du visionnaire mais il y a des faits embarrassants affirmés par des hommes graves qui les ont vus les admettre tous ou les nier tous paraît un égal inconvénient et jose dire quen cela comme en toutes les choses

the parliament of bourdeaux his own city condemned a man to be burned as a noüeur daiguillettes so lately as 1718 indeed it was not says maury till the first quarter of the eighteenth century that one might safely publish his incredulity in france in scotland witches were burned for the last time in 1722 garinet cites the case of a girl near amiens possessed by three demonsmimi zozo and crapouletin 1816  the two beautiful volumes of mr upham are so far as i know unique in their kind it is in some respects a clinical lecture on human nature as well as on the special epidemical disease under which the patient is laboring he has written not merely a history of the socalled salem witchcraft but has made it intelligible by a minute account of the place where the delusion took its rise the persons concerned in it whether as actors or sufferers and the circumstances which led to it by deeds wills and the records of courts and churches by plans maps and drawings he has recreated salem village as it was two hundred years ago so that we seem wellnigh to talk with its people and walk over its fields or through its carttracks and bridleroads we are made partners in parish and village feuds we share in the chimneycorner gossip and learn for the first time how many mean and merely human motives whether consciously or unconsciously gave impulse and intensity to the passions of the actors in that memorable tragedy which dealt the deathblow in this country to the belief in satanic compacts mr uphams minute details which give us something like a photographic picture of the indoor and outdoor scenery that surrounded the events he narrates help us materially to understand their origin and the course they inevitably took in this respect his book is original and full of new interest to know the kind of life these people led the kind of place they dwelt in and the tenor of their thought makes much real to us that was conjectural before the influences of outward nature of remoteness from the main highways of the worlds thought of seclusion as the fostermother of traditionary beliefs of a hard life and unwholesome diet in exciting or obscuring the brain through the nerves and stomach have been hitherto commonly overlooked in accounting for the phenomena of witchcraft the great persecutions for this imaginary crime have always taken place in lonely places among the poor the ignorant and above all the illfed  one of the best things in mr uphams book is the portrait of parris the minister of salem village in whose household the children who under the assumed possession of evil spirits became accusers and witnesses began their tricks he is shown to us pedantic and something of a martinet in church discipline and ceremony somewhat inclined to magnify his office fond of controversy as he was skilful and rather unscrupulous in the conduct of it and glad of any occasion to make himself prominent was he the unconscious agent of his own superstition or did he take advantage of the superstition of others for purposes of his own the question is not an easy one to answer men will sacrifice everything sometimes even themselves to their pride of logic and their love of victory bodin loses sight of humanity altogether in his eagerness to make out his case and display his learning in the canon and civil law he does not scruple to exaggerate to misquote to charge his antagonists with atheism sorcery and insidious designs against religion and society that he may persuade the jury of europe to bring in a verdict of guilty118 yet there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his belief was parris equally sincere on the whole i think it likely that he was but if we acquit parris what shall we say of the demoniacal girls the probability seems to be that those who began in harmless deceit found themselves at length involved so deeply that dread of shame and punishment drove them to an extremity where their only choice was between sacrificing themselves or others to save themselves it is not unlikely that some of the younger girls were so far carried along by imitation or imaginative sympathy as in some degree to credit their own lie any one who has watched or made experiments in animal magnetism knows how easy it is to persuade young women of nervous temperaments that they are doing that by the will of another which they really do by an obscure volition of their own under the influence of an imagination adroitly guided by the magnetizer the marvellous is so fascinating that nine persons in ten if once persuaded that a thing is possible are eager to believe it probable and at last cunning in convincing themselves that it is proven but it is impossible to believe that the possessed girls in this case did not know how the pins they vomited got into their mouths mr upham has shown in the case of anne putnam jr an hereditary tendency to hallucination if not insanity one of her uncles had seen the devil by broad daylight in the novel disguise of a blue boar in which shape as a tavern sign he had doubtless proved more seductive than in his more ordinary transfigurations a great deal of light is let in upon the question of whether there was deliberate imposture or no by the narrative of rev mr turell of medford written in 1728 which gives us all the particulars of a case of pretended possession in littleton eight years before the eldest of three sisters began the game and found herself before long obliged to take the next in age into her confidence by and by the youngest finding her sisters pitied and caressed on account of their supposed sufferings while she was neglected began to play off the same tricks the usual phenomena followed they were convulsed they fell into swoons they were pinched and bruised they were found in the water on the top of a tree or of the barn to these places they said they were conveyed through the air and there were those who had seen them flying which shows how strong is the impulse which prompts men to conspire with their own delusion where the marvellous is concerned the girls did whatever they had heard or read that was common in such cases they even accused a respectable neighbor as the cause of their torments there were some doubters but so far as i can learn says turell the greater number believed and said they were under the evil hand or possessed by satan but the most interesting fact of all is supplied by the confession of the elder sister made eight years later under stress of remorse having once begun they found returning more tedious than going oer to keep up their cheat made life a burden to them but they could not stop thirty years earlier their juggling might have proved as disastrous as that at salem village there parish and boundary feuds had set enmity between neighbors and the girls called on to say who troubled them cried out upon those whom they had been wont to hear called by hard names at home they probably had no notion what a frightful ending their comedy was to have but at any rate they were powerless for the reins had passed out of their hands into the sterner grasp of minister and magistrate they were dragged deeper and deeper as men always are by their own lie  the proceedings at the salem trials are sometimes spoken of as if they were exceptionally cruel but in fact if compared with others of the same kind they were exceptionally humane at a time when baxter could tell with satisfaction of a reading parson eighty years old who after being kept awake five days and nights confessed his dealings with the devil it is rather wonderful that no mode of torture other than mental was tried at salem nor were the magistrates more besotted or unfair than usual in dealing with the evidence now and then it is true a man more sceptical or intelligent than common had exposed some pretended demoniac the bishop of orléans in 1598 read aloud to martha brossier the story of the ephesian widow and the girl hearing latin and taking it for scripture went forthwith into convulsions he found also that the devil who possessed her could not distinguish holy from profane water but that there were deceptions did not shake the general belief in the reality of possession the proof in such cases could not and ought not to be subjected to the ordinary tests if many natural things says bodin are incredible and some of them incomprehensible a fortiori the power of supernatural intelligences and the doings of spirits are incomprehensible but error has risen to its height in this that those who have denied the power of spirits and the doings of sorcerers have wished to dispute physically concerning supernatural or metaphysical things which is a notable incongruity that the girls were really possessed seemed to stoughton and his colleagues the most rational theorya theory in harmony with the rest of their creed and sustained by the unanimous consent of pious men as well as the evidence of that most cunning and least suspected of all sorcerers the pastand how confront or crossexamine invisible witnesses especially witnesses whom it was a kind of impiety to doubt evidence that would have been convincing in ordinary cases was of no weight against the general prepossession in 1659 the house of a man in brightling sussex was troubled by a demon who set it on fire at various times and was continually throwing things about the clergy of the neighborhood held a day of fasting and prayer in consequence a maidservant was afterwards detected as the cause of the missiles but this did not in the least stagger mr bennet minister of the parish who merely says there was a seeming blur cast though not on the whole yet upon some part of it for their servantgirl was at last found throwing some things and goes off into a eulogium on the efficacy of prayer  in one respect to which mr upham first gives the importance it deserves the salem trials were distinguished from all others though some of the accused had been terrified into confession yet not one persevered in it but all died protesting their innocence and with unshaken constancy though an acknowledgment of guilt would have saved the lives of all this martyr proof of the efficacy of puritanism in the character and conscience may be allowed to outweigh a great many sneers at puritan fanaticism it is at least a testimony to the courage and constancy which a profound religious sentiment had made common among the people of whom these sufferers were average representatives the accused also were not as was commonly the case abandoned by their friends in all the trials of this kind there is nothing so pathetic as the picture of jonathan cary holding up the weary arms of his wife during her trial and wiping away the sweat from her brow and the tears from her face another remarkable fact is this that while in other countries the delusion was extinguished by the incredulity of the upper classes and the interference of authority here the reaction took place among the people themselves and here only was an attempt made at some legislative restitution however inadequate mr uphams sincere and honest narrative while it never condescends to a formal plea is the best vindication possible of a community which was itself the greatest sufferer by the persecution which its credulity engendered  if any lesson may be drawn from the tragical and too often disgustful history of witchcraft it is not one of exultation at our superior enlightenment or shame at the shortcomings of the human intellect it is rather one of charity and selfdistrust when we see what inhuman absurdities men in other respects wise and good have clung to as the cornerstone of their faith in immortality and a divine ordering of the world may we not suspect that those who now maintain political or other doctrines which seem to us barbarous and unenlightened may be for all that in the main as virtuous and clearsighted as ourselves while we maintain our own side with an honest ardor of conviction let us not forget to allow for mortal incompetence in the other and if there are men who regret the good old times without too clear a notion of what they were they should at least be thankful that we are rid of that misguided energy of faith which justified conscience in making men unrelentingly cruel even mr leckie softens a little at the thought of the many innocent and beautiful beliefs of which a growing scepticism has robbed us in the decay of supernaturalism but we need not despair for after all scepticism is first cousin of credulity and we are not surprised to see the tough doubter montaigne hanging up his offerings in the shrine of our lady of loreto scepticism commonly takes up the room left by defect of imagination and is the very quality of mind most likely to seek for sensual proof of supersensual things if one came from the dead it could not believe and yet it longs for such a witness and will put up with a very dubious one so long as night is left and the helplessness of dream the wonderful will not cease from among men while we are the solitary prisoners of darkness the witch seats herself at the loom of thought and weaves strange figures into the web that looks so familiar and ordinary in the dry light of everyday just as we are flattering ourselves that the old spirit of sorcery is laid behold the tables are tipping and the floors drumming all over christendom the faculty of wonder is not defunct but is only getting more and more emancipated from the unnatural service of terror and restored to its proper function as a minister of delight a higher mode of belief is the best exorciser because it makes the spiritual at one with the actual world instead of hostile or at best alien it has been the grossly material interpretations of spiritual doctrine that have given occasion to the two extremes of superstition and unbelief while the resurrection of the body has been insisted on that resurrection from the body which is the privilege of all has been forgotten superstition in its baneful form was largely due to the enforcement by the church of arguments that involved a petitio principii for it is the miserable necessity of all false logic to accept of very ignoble allies fear became at length its chief expedient for the maintenance of its power and as there is a beneficent necessity laid upon a majority of mankind to sustain and perpetuate the order of things they are born into and to make all new ideas manfully prove their right first to be at all and then to be heard many even superior minds dreaded the tearing away of vicious accretions as dangerous to the whole edifice of religion and society but if this old ghost be fading away in what we regard as the dawn of a better day we may console ourselves by thinking that perhaps after all we are not so much wiser than our ancestors the rappings the trance mediums the visions of hands without bodies the sounding of musical instruments without visible fingers the miraculous inscriptions on the naked flesh the enlivenment of furniturewe have invented none of them they are all heirlooms there is surely room for yet another schoolmaster when a score of seers advertise themselves in boston newspapers and if the metaphysicians can never rest till they have taken their watch to pieces and have arrived at a happy positivism as to its structure though at the risk of bringing it to a nogo we may be sure that the majority will always take more satisfaction in seeing its hands mysteriously move on even if they

  little more credit to the enlightenment of the church of england in     this matter than it would seem fairly to deserve more and glanvil     were faithful sons of the church and if the persecution of witches     was especially rife during the ascendency of the puritans it was     because they happened to be in power while there was a reaction     against sadducism all the convictions were under

shakespeare once more  it may be doubted whether any language be rich enough to maintain more than one truly great poetand whether there be more than one period and that very short in the life of a language when such a phenomenon as a great poet is possible it may be reckoned one of the rarest pieces of goodluck that ever fell to the share of a race that as was true of shakespeare its most rhythmic genius its acutest intellect its profoundest imagination and its healthiest understanding should have been combined in one man and that he should have arrived at the full development of his powers at the moment when the material in which he was to workthat wonderful composite called english the best result of the confusion of tongueswas in its freshest perfection the englishspeaking nations should build a monument to the misguided enthusiasts of the plain of shinar for as the mixture of many bloods seems to have made them the most vigorous of modern races so has the mingling of divers speeches given them a language which is perhaps the noblest vehicle of poetic thought that ever existed  had shakespeare been born fifty years earlier he would have been cramped by a booklanguage not yet flexible enough for the demands of rhythmic emotion not yet sufficiently popularized for the natural and familiar expression of supreme thought not yet so rich in metaphysical phrase as to render possible that ideal representation of the great passions which is the aim and end of art not yet subdued by practice and general consent to a definiteness of accentuation essential to ease and congruity of metrical arrangement had he been born fifty years later his ripened manhood would have found itself in an england absorbed and angry with the solution of political and religious problems from which his whole nature was averse instead of in that elizabethan social system ordered and planetary in functions and degrees as the angelic hierarchy of the areopagite where his contemplative eye could crowd itself with various and brilliant picture and whence his impartial brainone lobe of which seems to have been normanly refined and the other saxonly sagaciouscould draw its morals of courtly and worldly wisdom its lessons of prudence and magnanimity in estimating shakespeare it should never be forgotten that like goethe he was essentially observer and artist and incapable of partisanship the passions actions sentiments whose character and results he delighted to watch and to reproduce are those of man in society as it existed and it no more occurred to him to question the right of that society to exist than to criticise the divine ordination of the seasons his business was with men as they were not with man as he ought to bewith the human soul as it is shaped or twisted into character by the complex experience of life not in its abstract essence as something to be saved or lost during the first half of the seventeenth century the centre of intellectual interest was rather in the other world than in this rather in the region of thought and principle and conscience than in actual life it was a generation in which the poet was and felt himself out of place sir thomas browne out most imaginative mind since shakespeare found breathingroom for a time among the o altitudines of religious speculation but soon descended to occupy himself with the exactitudes of science jeremy taylor who half a century earlier would have been fletchers rival compels his clipped fancy to the conventual discipline of prose maid marian turned nun and waters his poetic wine with doctrinal eloquence milton is saved from making total shipwreck of his largeutteranced genius on the desolate nomans land of a religious epic only by the lucky help of satan and his colleagues with whom as foiled rebels and republicans he cannot conceal his sympathy as purely poet shakespeare would have come too late had his lot fallen in that generation in mind and temperament too exoteric for a mystic his imagination could not have at once illustrated the influence of his epoch and escaped from it like that of browne the equilibrium of his judgment essential to him as an artist but equally removed from propagandism whether as enthusiast or logician would have unfitted him for the pulpit and his intellectual being was too sensitive to the wonder and beauty of outward life and nature to have found satisfaction as miltons could and perhaps only by reason of his blindness in a world peopled by purely imaginary figures we might fancy him becoming a great statesman but he lacked the social position which could have opened that career to him what we mean when we say shakespeare is something inconceivable either during the reign of henry the eighth or the commonwealth and which would have been impossible after the restoration  all favorable stars seem to have been in conjunction at his nativity the reformation had passed the period of its vinous fermentation and its clarified results remained as an element of intellectual impulse and exhilaration there were small signs yet of the acetous and putrefactive stages which were to follow in the victory and decline of puritanism old forms of belief and worship still lingered all the more touching to fancy perhaps that they were homeless and attainted the light of sceptic day was baffled by depths of forest where superstitious shapes still cowered creatures of immemorial wonder the raw material of imagination the invention of printing without yet vulgarizing letters had made the thought and history of the entire past contemporaneous while a crowd of translators put every man who could read in inspiring contact with the select souls of all the centuries a new world was thus opened to intellectual adventure at the very time when the keel of columbus had turned the first daring furrow of discovery in that unmeasured ocean which still girt the known earth with a beckoning horizon of hope and conjecture which was still fed by rivers that flowed down out of primeval silences and which still washed the shores of dreamland under a wise cultivated and firmhanded monarch also the national feeling of england grew rapidly more homogeneous and intense the rather as the womanhood of the sovereign stimulated a more chivalric loyaltywhile the new religion of which she was the defender helped to make england morally as it was geographically insular to the continent of europe  if circumstances could ever make a great national poet here were all the elements mingled at meltingheat in the alembic and the lucky moment of projection was clearly come if a great national poet could ever avail himself of circumstances this was the occasionand fortunately shakespeare was equal to it above all we may esteem it lucky that he found words ready to his use original and untarnishedtypes of thought whose sharp edges were unworn by repeated impressions in reading hakluyts voyages we are almost startled now and then to find that even common sailors could not tell the story of their wanderings without rising to an almost odyssean strain and habitually used a diction that we should be glad to buy back from desuetude at any cost those who look upon language only as anatomists of its structure or who regard it as only a means of conveying abstract truth from mind to mind as if it were so many algebraic formulae are apt to overlook the fact that its being alive is all that gives it poetic value we do not mean what is technically called a living languagethe contrivance hollow as a speakingtrumpet by which breathing and moving bipeds even now sailing oer lifes solemn main are enabled to hail each other and make known their mutual shortness of mental storesbut one that is still hot from the hearts and brains of a people not hardened yet but moltenly ductile to new shapes of sharp and clear relief in the moulds of new thought so soon as a language has become literary so soon as there is a gap between the speech of books and that of life the language becomes so far as poetry is concerned almost as dead as latin and as in writing latin verses a mind in itself essentially original becomes in the use of such a medium of utterance unconsciously reminiscential and reflective lunar and not solar in expression and even in thought for words and thoughts have a much more intimate and genetic relation one with the other than most men have any notion of and it is one thing to use our mothertongue as if it belonged to us and another to be the puppets of an overmastering vocabulary ye know not says ascham what hurt ye do to learning that care not for words but for matter and so make a divorce betwixt the tongue and the heart lingua toscana in bocca romana is the italian proverb and that of poets should be the tongue of the people in the mouth of the scholar i imply here no assent to the early theory or at any rate practice of wordsworth who confounded plebeian modes of thought with rustic forms of phrase and then atoned for his blunder by absconding into a diction more latinized than that of any poet of his century  shakespeare was doubly fortunate saxon by the father and norman by the mother he was a representative englishman a country boy he learned first the rough and ready english of his rustic mates who knew how to make nice verbs and adjectives courtesy to their needs going up to london he acquired the lingua aulica precisely at the happiest moment just as it was becoming in the strictest sense of the word modernjust as it had recruited itself by fresh impressments from the latin and latinized languages with new words to express the new ideas of an enlarging intelligence which printing and translation were fast making cosmopolitanwords which in proportion to their novelty and to the fact that the mothertongue and the foreign had not yet wholly mingled must have been used with a more exact appreciation of their meaning119 it was in london and chiefly by means of the stage that a thorough amalgamation of the saxon norman and scholarly elements of english was brought about already puttenham in his arte of english poesy declares that the practice of the capital and the country within sixty miles of it was the standard of correct diction the jus et norma loquendi already spenser had almost recreated english poetryand it is interesting to observe that scholar as he was the archaic words which he was at first overfond of introducing are often provincialisms of purely english original already marlowe had brought the english unrhymed pentameter which had hitherto justified but half its name by being always blank and never verse to a perfection of melody harmony and variety which has never been surpassed shakespeare then found a language already to a certain extent established but not yet fetlocked by dictionary and grammar mongersa versification harmonized but which had not yet exhausted all its modulations nor been set in the stocks by critics who deal judgment on refractory feet that will dance to orphean measures of which their judges are insensible that the language was established is proved by its comparative uniformity as used by the dramatists who wrote for mixed audiences as well as by ben jonsons satire upon marstons neologisms that it at the same time admitted foreign words to the rights of citizenship on easier terms than now is in good measure equally true what was of greater import no arbitrary line had been drawn between high words and low vulgar then meant simply what was common poetry had not been aliened from the people by the establishment of an upper house of vocables alone entitled to move in the stately ceremonials of verse and privileged from arrest while they forever keep the promise of meaning to the ear and break it to the sense the hot conception of the poet had no time to cool while he was debating the comparative respectability of this phrase or that but he snatched what word his instinct prompted and saw no indiscretion in making a king speak as his country nurse might have taught him120 it was waller who first learned in france that to talk in rhyme alone comported with the state of royalty in the time of shakespeare the living tongue resembled that tree which father huc saw in tartary whose leaves were languagedand every hidden root of thought every subtilest fibre of feeling was mated by new shoots and leafage of expression fed from those unseen sources in the common earth of human nature  the cabalists had a notion that whoever found out the mystic word for anything attained to absolute mastery over that thing the reverse of this is certainly true of poetic expression for he who is thoroughly possessed of his thought who imaginatively conceives an idea or image becomes master of the word that shall most amply and fitly utter it heminge and condell tell us accordingly that there was scarce a blot in the manuscripts they received from shakespeare and this is the natural corollary from the fact that such an imagination as his is as unparalleled as the force variety and beauty of the phrase in which it embodied itself121 we believe that shakespeare like all other great poets instinctively used the dialect which he found current and that his words are not more wrested from their ordinary meaning than followed necessarily from the unwonted weight of thought or stress of passion they were called on to support he needed not to mask familiar thoughts in the weeds of unfamiliar phraseology for the life that was in his mind could transfuse the language of every day with an intelligent vivacity that makes it seem lambent with fiery purpose and at each new reading a new creation he could say with dante that no word had ever forced him to say what he would not though he had forced many a word to say what it would notbut only in the sense that the mighty magic of his imagination had conjured out of it its uttermost secret of power or pathos when i say that shakespeare used the current language of his day i mean only that he habitually employed such language as was universally comprehensiblethat he was not run away with by the hobby of any theory as to the fitness of this or that component of english for expressing certain thoughts or feelings that the artistic value of a choice and noble diction was quite as well understood in his day as in ours is evident from the praises bestowed by his contemporaries on drayton and by the epithet welllanguaged applied to daniel whose poetic style is as modern as that of tennyson but the endless absurdities about the comparative merits of saxon and normanfrench vented by persons incapable of distinguishing one tongue from the other were as yet unheard of hasty generalizers are apt to overlook the fact that the saxon was never to any great extent a literary language accordingly it held its own very well in the names of common things but failed to answer the demands of complex ideas derived from them the author of piers ploughman wrote for the peoplechaucer for the court we open at random and count the latin122 words in ten verses of the vision and ten of the romaunt of the rose a translation from the french and find the proportion to be seven in the former and five in the latter  the organs of the saxon have always been unwilling and stiff in learning languages he acquired only about as many british words as we have indian ones and i believe that more french and latin was introduced through the pen and the eye than through the tongue and the ear for obvious reasons the question is one that must be decided by reference to prosewriters and not poets and it is we think pretty well settled that more words of latin original were brought into the language in the century between 1550 and 1650 than in the whole period before or sinceand for the simple reason that they were absolutely needful to express new modes and combinations of thought123 the language has gained immensely by the infusion in richness of synonyme and in the power of expressing nice shades of thought and feeling but more than all in lightfooted polysyllables that trip singing to the music of verse there are certain cases it is true where the vulgar saxon word is refined and the refined latin vulgar in poetryas in sweat and perspiration but there are vastly more in which the latin bears the bell perhaps there might be a question between the old english againrising and resurrection but there can be no doubt that conscience is better than inwit and remorse than againbite should we translate the title of wordsworths famous ode intimations of immortality into hints of deathlessness it would hiss like an angry gander if instead of shakespeares            age cannot wither her   nor custom stale her infinite variety  we should say her boundless manifoldness the sentiment would suffer in exact proportion with the music what homebred english could ape the high roman fashion of such togated words as    the multitudinous sea incarnadine  where the huddling epithet implies the tempesttossed soul of the speaker and at the same time pictures the wallowing waste of ocean more vividly than the famous phrase of aeschylus does its rippling sunshine again sailor is less poetical than mariner as campbell felt when he wrote    ye mariners of england  and coleridge when he chose    it was an ancient mariner  rather than    it was an elderly seaman  for it is as much the charm of poetry that it suggest a certain remoteness and strangeness as familiarity and it is essential not only that we feel at once the meaning of the words in themselves but also their melodic meaning in relation to each other and to the sympathetic variety of the verse a word once vulgarized can never be rehabilitated we might say now a buxom lass or that a chambermaid was buxom but we could not use the term as milton did in its original sense of bowsomethat is lithe gracefully bending124  but the secret of force in writing lies not so much in the pedigree of nouns and adjectives and verbs as in having something that you believe in to say and making the parts of speech vividly conscious of it it is when expression becomes an act of memory instead of an unconscious necessity that diction takes the place of warm and hearty speech it is not safe to attribute special virtues as bosworth for example does to the saxon to words of whatever derivation at least in poetry because lears oakcleaving thunderbolts and the alldreaded thunderstone in cymbeline are so fine we would not give up miltons virgilian fulmined over greece where the verb in english conveys at once the idea of flash and reverberation but avoids that of riving and shattering in the experiments made for casting the great bell for the westminster tower it was found that the superstition which attributed the remarkable sweetness and purity of tone in certain old bells to the larger mixture of silver in their composition had no foundation in fact it was the cunning proportion in which the ordinary metals were balanced against each other the perfection of form and the nice gradations of thickness that wrought the miracle and it is precisely so with the language of poetry the genius of the poet will tell him what word to use else what use in his being poet at all and even then unless the proportion and form whether of parts or whole be all that art requires and the most sensitive taste finds satisfaction in he will have failed to make what shall vibrate through all its parts with a silvery unisonin other words a poem  i think the component parts of english were in the latter years of elizabeth thus exquisitely proportioned one to the other yet bacon had no faith in his mothertongue translating the works on which his fame was to rest into what he called the universal language and affirming that english would bankrupt all our books he was deemed a master of it nevertheless and it is curious that ben jonson applies to him in prose the same commendation which he gave shakespeare in verse saying that he performed that in our tongue which may be compared or preferred either to insolent greece or haughty rome and he adds this pregnant sentence in short within his view and about his time were all the wits born that could honor a language or help study now things daily fall wits grow downwards eloquence grows backwards ben had good reason for what he said of the wits not to speak of science of galileo and kepler the sixteenth century was a spendthrift of literary genius an attack of immortality in a family might have been looked for then as scarletfever would be now montaigne tasso and cervantes were born within fourteen years of each other and in england while spenser was still delving over the propria quae maribus and raleigh launching paper navies shakespeare was stretching his baby hands for the moon and the little bacon chewing on his coral had discovered that impenetrability was one quality of matter it almost takes ones breath away to think that hamlet and the novum organon were at the risk of teething and measles at the same time but ben was right also in thinking that eloquence had grown backwards he lived long enough to see the language of verse become in a measure traditionary and conventional it was becoming so partly from the necessary order of events partly because the most natural and intense expression of feeling had been in so many ways satisfied and exhaustedbut chiefly because there was no man left to whom as to shakespeare perfect conception gave perfection of phrase dante among modern poets his only rival in condensed force says optimis conceptionibus optima loquela conveniet sed optimae conceptiones non possunt esse nisi ubi scientia et ingenium est  et sic non omnibus versificantibus optima loquela convenit cum plerique sine scientiâ et ingenio versificantur125  shakespeare must have been quite as well aware of the provincialism of english as bacon was but he knew that great poetry being universal in its appeal to human nature can make any language classic and that the men whose appreciation is immortality will mine through any dialect to get at an original soul he had as much confidence in his homebred speech as bacon had want of it and exclaims    not marble nor the gilded monuments    of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme  he must have been perfectly conscious of his genius and of the great trust which he imposed upon his native tongue as the embodier and perpetuator of it as he has avoided obscurities in his sonnets he would do so a fortiori in his plays both for the purpose of immediate effect on the stage and of future appreciation clear thinking makes clear writing and he who has shown himself so eminently capable of it in one case is not to be supposed to abdicate intentionally in others the difficult passages in the plays then are to be regarded either as corruptions or else as phenomena in the natural history of imagination whose study will enable us to arrive at a clearer theory and better understanding of it  while i believe that our language had two periods of culmination in poetic beautyone of nature simplicity and truth in the ballads which deal only with narrative and feelinganother of art or nature as it is ideally reproduced through the imagination of stately amplitude of passionate intensity and elevation in spenser and the greater dramatistsand that shakespeare made use of the latter as he found it i by no means intend to say that he did not enrich it or that any inferior man could have dipped the same words out of the great poets inkstand but he enriched it only by the natural expansion and exhilaration of which it was conscious in yielding to the mastery of a genius that could turn and wind it like a fiery pegasus making it feel its life in every limb he enriched it through that exquisite sense of music never approached but by marlowe to which it seemed eagerly obedient as if every word said to him    bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear  as if every latent harmony revealed itself to him as the gold to brahma when he walked over the earth where it was hidden crying here am i lord do with me what thou wilt that he used language with that intimate possession of its meaning possible only to the most vivid thought is doubtless true but that he wantonly strained it from its ordinary sense that he found it too poor for his necessities and accordingly coined new phrases or that from haste or carelessness he violated any of its received proprieties i do not believe i have said that it was fortunate for him that he came upon an age when our language was at its best but it was fortunate also for us because our costliest poetic phrase is put beyond reach of decay in the gleaming precipitate in which it united itself with his thought  that the propositions i have endeavored to establish have a direct bearing in various ways upon the qualifications of whoever undertakes to edit the works of shakespeare will i think be apparent to those who consider the matter the hold which shakespeare has acquired and maintained upon minds so many and so various in so many vital respects utterly unsympathetic and even incapable of sympathy with his own is one of the most noteworthy phenomena in the history of literature that he has had the most inadequate of editors that as his own falstaff was the cause of the wit so he has been the cause of the foolishness that was in other men as where malone ventured to discourse upon his metres and dr johnson on his imagination must be apparent to every oneand also that his genius and its manifestations are so various that there is no commentator but has been able to illustrate him from his own peculiar point of view or from the results of his own favorite studies but to show that he was a good common lawyer that he understood the theory of colors that he was an accurate botanist a master of the science of medicine especially in its relation to mental disease a profound metaphysician and of great experience and insight in politicsall these while they may very well form the staple of separate treatises and prove that whatever the extent of his learning the range and accuracy of his knowledge were beyond precedent or later parallel are really outside the province of an editor  we doubt if posterity owe a greater debt to any two men living in 1623 than to the two obscure actors who in that year published the first folio edition of shakespeares plays but for them it is more than likely that such of his works as had remained to that time unprinted would have been irrecoverably lost and among them were julius caesar the tempest and macbeth but are we to believe them when they assert that they present to us the plays which they reprinted from stolen and surreptitious copies cured and perfect of their limbs and those which are original in their edition absolute in their numbers as he shakespeare conceived them alas we have read too many theatrical announcements have been taught too often that the value of the promise was in an inverse ratio to the generosity of the exclamationmarks too easily to believe that nay we have seen numberless processions of healthy kine enter our native village unheralded save by the lusty shouts of drovers while a wretched calf cursed by stepdame nature with two heads was brought to us in a triumphal car avantcouriered by a band of music as abnormal as itself and announced as the greatest wonder of the age if a double allowance of vituline brains deserve such honor there are few commentators on shakespeare that would have gone afoot and the trumpets of messieurs heminge and condell call up in our minds too many monstrous and deformed associations  what then is the value of the first folio as an authority for eighteen of the plays it is the only authority we have and the only one also for four others in their complete form it is admitted that in several instances heminge and condell reprinted the earlier quarto impressions with a few changes sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse and it is most probable that copies of those editions whether surreptitious or not had taken the place of the original prompters books as being more convenient and legible even in these cases it is not safe to conclude that all or even any of the variations were made by the hand of shakespeare himself and where the players printed from manuscript is it likely to have been that of the author the probability is small that a writer so busy as shakespeare must have been during his productive period should have copied out their parts for the actors himself or that one so indifferent as he seems to have been to the immediate literary fortunes of his works should have given much care to the correction of copies if made by others the copies exclusively in the hands of heminge and condell were it is manifest in some cases very imperfect whether we account for the fact by the burning of the globe theatre or by the necessary wear and tear of years and what is worthy of notice they are plainly more defective in some parts than in others measure for measure is an example of this and we are not satisfied with being told that its ruggedness of verse is intentional or that its obscurity is due to the fact that shakespeare grew more elliptical in his style as he grew older profounder in thought he doubtless became though in a mind like his we believe that this would imply only a more absolute supremacy in expression but from whatever original we suppose either the quartos or the first folio to have been printed it is more than questionable whether the proofsheets had the advantage of any revision other than that of the printingoffice steevens was of opinion that authors in the time of shakespeare never read their own proofsheets and mr spedding in his recent edition of bacon comes independently to the same conclusion126 we may be very sure that heminge and condell did not as vicars take upon themselves a disagreeable task which the author would have been too careless to assume  nevertheless however strong a case may be made out against the folio of 1623 whatever sins of omission we may lay to the charge of heminge and condell or of commission to that of the printers it remains the only text we have with any claims whatever to authenticity it should be deferred to as authority in all cases where it does not make shakespeare write bad sense uncouth metre or false grammar of all which we believe him to have been more supremely incapable than any other man who ever wrote english yet we would not speak unkindly even of the blunders of the folio they have put bread into the mouth of many an honest editor publisher and printer for the last century and a half and he who loves the comic side of human nature will find the serious notes of a variorum edition of shakespeare as funny reading as the funny ones are serious scarce a commentator of them all for more than a hundred years but thought as alphonso of castile did of creation that if he had only been at shakespeares elbow he could have given valuable advice scarce one who did not know offhand that there was never a seaport in bohemiaas if shakespeares world were one which mercator could have projected scarce one but was satisfied that his ten fingertips were a sufficient key to those astronomic wonders of poise and counterpoise of planetary law and cometary seemingexception in his metres scarce one but thought he could gauge like an alefirkin that intuition whose edging shallows may have been sounded but whose abysses stretching down amid the sunless roots of being and consciousness mock the plummet scarce one but could speak with condescending approval of that prodigious intelligence so utterly without congener that our baffled language must coin an adjective to qualify it and none is so audacious as to say shakesperian of any other and yet in the midst of our impatience we cannot help thinking also of how much healthy mental activity this one man has been the occasion how much good he has indirectly done to society by withdrawing men to investigations and habits of thought that secluded them from baser attractions for how many he has enlarged the circle of study and reflection since there is nothing in history or politics nothing in art or science nothing in physics or metaphysics that is not sooner or later taxed for his illustration this is partially true of all great minds open and sensitive to truth and beauty through any large arc of their circumference but it is true in an unexampled sense of shakespeare the vast round of whose balanced nature seems to have been equatorial and to have had a southward exposure and a summer sympathy at every point so that life society statecraft serve us at last but as commentaries on him and whatever we have gathered of thought of knowledge and of experience confronted with his marvellous page shrinks to a mere footnote the steppingstone to some hitherto inaccessible verse we admire in homer the blind placid mirror of the worlds young manhood the bard who escapes from his misfortune in poems all memory all life and bustle adventure and picture we revere in dante that compressed force of lifelong passion which could make a private experience cosmopolitan in its reach and everlasting in its significance we respect in goethe the aristotelian poet wise by weariless observation witty with intention the stately geheimerrath of a provincial court in the empire of nature as we study these we seem in our limited way to penetrate into their consciousness and to measure and master their methods but with shakespeare it is just the other way the more we have familiarized ourselves with the operations of our own consciousness the more do we find in reading him that he has been beforehand with us and that while we have been vainly endeavoring to find the door of his being he has searched every nook and cranny of our own while other poets and dramatists embody isolated phases of character and work inward from the phenomenon to the special law which it illustrates he seems in some strange way unitary with human nature itself and his own soul to have been the law and lifegiving power of which his creations are only the phenomena we justify or criticise the characters of other writers by our memory and experience and pronounce them natural or unnatural but he seems to have worked in the very stuff of which memory and experience are made and we recognize his truth to nature by an innate and unacquired sympathy as if he alone possessed the secret of the ideal form and universal mould and embodied generic types rather than individuals in this cervantes alone has approached him and don quixote and sancho like the men and women of shakespeare are the contemporaries of every generation because they are not products of an artificial and transitory society but because they are animated by the primeval and unchanging forces of that humanity which underlies and survives the foreverfickle creeds and ceremonials of the parochial corners which we who dwell in them sublimely call the world  that shakespeare did not edit his own works must be attributed we suspect to his premature death that he should not have intended it is inconceivable is there not something of selfconsciousness in the breaking of prosperos wand and burying his booka sort of sad prophecy based on selfknowledge of the nature of that man who after such thaumaturgy could go down to stratford and live there for years only collecting his dividends from the globe theatre lending money on mortgage and leaning over his gate to chat and bandy quips with neighbors his mind had entered into every phase of human life and thought had embodied all of them in living creationshad he found all empty and come at last to the belief that genius and its works were as phantasmagoric as the rest and that fame was as idle as the rumor of the pit however this may be his works have come down to us in a condition of manifest and admitted corruption in some portions while in others there is an obscurity which may be attributed either to an idiosyncratic use of words and condensation of phrase to a depth of intuition for a proper coalescence with which ordinary language is inadequate to a concentration of passion in a focus that consumes the lighter links which bind together the clauses of a sentence or of a process of reasoning in common parlance or to a sense of music which mingles music and meaning without essentially confounding them we should demand for a perfect editor then first a thorough glossological knowledge of the english contemporary with shakespeare second enough logical acuteness of mind and metaphysical training to enable him to follow recondite processes of thought third such a conviction of the supremacy of his author as always to prefer his thought to any theory of his own fourth a feeling for music and so much knowledge of the practice of other poets as to understand that shakespeares versification differs from theirs as often in kind as in degree fifth an acquaintance with the world as well as with books and last what is perhaps of more importance than all so great a familiarity with the working of the imaginative faculty in general and of its peculiar operation in the mind of shakespeare as will prevent his thinking a passage dark with excess of light and enable him to understand fully that the gothic shakespeare often superimposed upon the slender column of a single word that seems to twist under it but does notlike the quaint shafts in cloistersa weight of meaning which the modern architects of sentences would consider wholly unjustifiable by correct principle  many years ago while yet fancy claimed that right in me which fact has since to my no small loss so successfully disputed i pleased myself with imagining the play of hamlet published under some alias and as the work of a new candidate in literature then i played as the children say that it came in regular course before some wellmeaning doer of criticisms who had never read the original no very wild assumption as things go and endeavored to conceive the kind of way in which he would be likely to take it i put myself in his place and tried to write such a perfunctory notice as i thought would be likely in filling his column to satisfy his conscience but it was a tour de force quite beyond my power to execute without grimace i could not arrive at that artistic absorption in my own conception which would enable me to be natural and found myself like a bad actor continually betraying my selfconsciousness by my very endeavor to hide it under caricature the path of nature is indeed a narrow one and it is only the immortals that seek it and when they find it do not find themselves cramped therein my result was a dead failuresatire instead of comedy i could not shake off that strange accumulation which we call self and report honestly what i saw and felt even to myself much less to others  yet i have often thought that unless we can so far free ourselves from our own prepossessions as to be capable of bringing to a work of art some freshness of sensation and receiving from it in turn some new surprise of sympathy and admirationsome shock even it may be of instinctive distaste and repulsionthough we may praise or blame weighing our pros and cons in the nicest balances sealed by proper authority yet we shall not criticise in the highest sense on the other hand unless we admit certain principles as fixed beyond question we shall be able to render no adequate judgment but only to record our impressions which may be valuable or not according to the greater or less ductility of the senses on which they are made charles lamb for example came to the old english dramatists with the feeling of a discoverer he brought with him an alert curiosity and everything was delightful simply because it was strange like other early adventurers he sometimes mistook shining sand for gold but he had the great advantage of not feeling himself responsible for the manners of the inhabitants he found there and not thinking it needful to make them square with any westminster catechism of aesthetics best of all he did not feel compelled to compare them with the greeks about whom he knew little and cared less he took them as he found them described them in a few pregnant sentences and displayed his specimens of their growth and manufacture when he arrived at the dramatists of the restoration so far from being shocked he was charmed with their pretty and unmoral ways and what he says of them reminds us of blunt captain dampier who in his account of the island of timor remarks as a matter of no consequence that the natives take as many wives as they can maintain and as for religion they have none  lamb had the great advantage of seeing the elder dramatists as they were it did not lie within his province to point out what they were not himself a fragmentary writer he had more sympathy with imagination where it gathers into the intense focus of passionate phrase than with that higher form of it where it is the faculty that shapes gives unity of design and balanced gravitation of parts and yet it is only this higher form of it which can unimpeachably assure to any work the dignity and permanence of a classic for it results in that exquisite something called style which like the grace of perfect breeding everywhere pervasive and nowhere emphatic makes itself felt by the skill with which it effaces itself and masters us at last with a sense of indefinable completeness on a lower plane we may detect it in the structure of a sentence in the limpid expression that implies sincerity of thought but it is only where it combines and organizes where it eludes observation in particulars to give the rarer delight of perfection as a whole that it belongs to art then it is truly ideal the forma mentis aeterna not as a passive mould into which the thought is poured but as the conceptive energy which finds all material plastic to its preconceived design mere vividness of expression such as makes quotable passages comes of the complete surrender of self to the impression whether spiritual or sensual of the moment it is a quality perhaps in which the young poet is richer than the mature his very inexperience making him more venturesome in those leaps of language that startle us with their rashness only to bewitch us the more with the happy ease of their accomplishment for this there are no existing laws of rhetoric for it is from such felicities that the rhetoricians deduce and codify their statutes it is something which cannot be improved upon or cultivated for it is immediate and intuitive but this power of expression is subsidiary and goes only a little way toward the making of a great poet imagination where it is truly creative is a faculty and not a quality it looks before and after it gives the form that makes all the parts work together harmoniously toward a given end its seat is in the higher reason and it is efficient only as a servant of the will imagination as it is too often misunderstood is mere fantasy the imagemaking power common to all who have the gift of dreams or who can afford to buy it in a vulgar drug as de quincey bought it  the true poetic imagination is of one quality whether it be ancient or modern and equally subject to those laws of grace of proportion of design in whose free service and in that alone it can become art those laws are something which do not                alter when they alteration find   and bend with the remover to remove  and they are more clearly to be deduced from the eminent examples of greek literature than from any other source it is the advantage of this select company of ancients that their works are defecated of all turbid mixture of contemporaneousness and have become to us pure literature our judgment and enjoyment of which cannot be vulgarized by any prejudices of time or place this is why the study of them is fitly called a liberal education because it emancipates the mind from every narrow provincialism whether of egoism or tradition and is the apprenticeship that every one must serve before becoming a free brother of the guild which passes the torch of life from age to age there would be no dispute about the advantages of that greek culture which schiller advocated with such generous eloquence if the great authors of antiquity had not been degraded from teachers of thinking to drillers in grammar and made the ruthless pedagogues of root and inflection instead of companions for whose society the mind must put on her highest mood the discouraged youth too naturally transfers the epithet of dead from the languages to the authors that wrote in them what concern have we with the shades of dialect in homer or theocritus provided they speak the spiritual lingua franca that abolishes all alienage of race and makes whatever shore of time we land on hospitable and homelike there is much that is deciduous in books but all that gives them a title to rank as literature in the highest sense is perennial their vitality is the vitality not of one or another blood or tongue but of human nature their truth is not topical and transitory but of universal acceptation and thus all great authors seem the coevals not only of each other but of whoever reads them growing wiser with him as he grows wise and unlocking to him one secret after another as his own life and experience give him the key but on no other condition their meaning is absolute not conditional it is a property of theirs quite irrespective of manners or creed for the highest culture the development of the individual by observation reflection and study leads to one result whether in athens or in london the more we know of ancient literature the more we are struck with its modernness just as the more we study the maturer dramas of shakespeare the more we feel his nearness in certain primary qualities to the antique and classical yet even in saying this i tacitly make the admission that it is the greeks who must furnish us with our standard of comparison their stamp is upon all the allowed measures and weights of aesthetic criticism nor does a consciousness of this nor a constant reference to it in any sense reduce us to the mere copying of a bygone excellence for it is the test of excellence in any department of art that it can never be bygone and it is not mere difference from antique models but the way in which that difference is shown the direction it takes that we are to consider in our judgment of a modern work the model is not there to be copied merely but that the study of it may lead us insensibly to the same processes of thought by which its purity of outline and harmony of parts were attained and enable us to feel that strength is consistent with repose that multiplicity is not abundance that grace is but a more refined form of power and that a thought is none the less profound that the limpidity of its expression allows us to measure it at a glance to be possessed with this conviction gives us at least a determinate point of view and enables us to appeal a case of taste to a court of final judicature whose decisions are guided by immutable principles when we hear of certain productions that they are feeble in design but masterly in parts that they are incoherent to be sure but have great merits of style we know that it cannot be true for in the highest examples we have the master is revealed by his plan by his power of making all accessories each in its due relation subordinate to it and that to limit style to the rounding of a period or a distich is wholly to misapprehend its truest and highest function donne is full of salient verses that would take the rudest march winds of criticism with their beauty of thoughts that first tease us like charades and then delight us with the felicity of their solution but these have not saved him he is exiled to the limbo of the formless and the fragmentary to take a more recent instancewordsworth had in some respects a deeper insight and a more adequate utterance of it than any man of his generation but it was a piecemeal insight and utterance his imagination was feminine not masculine receptive and not creative his longer poems are egyptian sandwastes with here and there an oasis of exquisite greenery a grand image sphinxlike half buried in drifting commonplaces or the solitary pompeys pillar of some towering thought but what is the fate of a poet who owns the quarry but cannot build the poem ere the century is out he will be nine parts dead and immortal only in that tenth part of him which is included in a thin volume of beauties already moxon has felt the need of extracting this essential oil of him and his memory will be kept alive if at all by the precious material rather than the workmanship of the vase that contains his heart and what shall we forebode of so many modern poems full of splendid passages beginning everywhere and leading nowhere reminding us of nothing so much as the amateur architect who planned his own house and forgot the staircase that should connect one floor with another putting it as an afterthought on the outside  lichtenberg says somewhere that it was the advantage of the ancients to write before the great art of writing ill had been invented and shakespeare may be said to have had the good luck of coming after spenser to whom the debt of english poetry is incalculable had reinvented the art of writing well but shakespeare arrived at a mastery in this respect which sets him above all other poets he is not only superior in degree but he is also different in kind in that less purely artistic sphere of style which concerns the matter rather than the form his charm is often unspeakable how perfect his style is may be judged from the fact that it never curdles into mannerism and thus absolutely eludes imitation though here if anywhere the style is the man yet it is noticeable only like the images of brutus by its absence so thoroughly is he absorbed in his work while he fuses thought and word indissolubly together till all the particles cohere by the best virtue of each with perfect truth he has said of himself that he writes               all one ever the same   putting invention in a noted weed   that every word doth almost tell his name  and yet who has so succeeded in imitating him as to remind us of him by even so much as the gait of a single verse127 those magnificent crystallizations of feeling and phrase basaltic masses molten and interfused by the primal fires of passion are not to be reproduced by the slow experiments of the laboratory striving to parody creation with artifice mr matthew arnold seems to think that shakespeare has damaged english poetry i wish he had it is true he lifted dryden above himself in all for love but it was dryden who said of him by instinctive conviction rather than judgment that within his magic circle none dared tread but he is he to blame for the extravagances of modern diction which are but the reaction of the brazen age against the degeneracy of art into artifice that has characterized the silver period in every literature we see in them only the futile effort of misguided persons to torture out of language the secret of that inspiration which should be in themselves we do not find the extravagances in shakespeare himself we never saw a line in any modern poet that reminded us of him and will venture to assert that it is only poets of the second class that find successful imitators and the reason seems to us a very plain one the genius of the great poet seeks repose in the expression of itself and finds it at last in style which is the establishment of a perfect mutual understanding between the worker and his material128 the secondary intellect on the other hand seeks for excitement in expression and stimulates itself into mannerism which is the wilful obtrusion of self as style is its unconscious abnegation no poet of the first class has ever left a school because his imagination is incommunicable while just as surely as the thermometer tells of the neighborhood of an iceberg you may detect the presence of a genius of the second class in any generation by the influence of his mannerism for that being an artificial thing is capable of reproduction dante shakespeare goethe left no heirs either to the form or mode of their expression while milton sterne and wordsworth left behind them whole regiments uniformed with all their external characteristics we do not mean that great poetic geniuses may not have influenced thought though we think it would be difficult to show how shakespeare had done so directly and wilfully but that they have not infected contemporaries or followers with mannerism the quality in him which makes him at once so thoroughly english and so thoroughly cosmopolitan is that aëration of the understanding by the imagination which he has in common with all the greater poets and which is the privilege of genius the modern school which mistakes violence for intensity seems to catch its breath when it finds itself on the verge of natural expression and to say to itself good heavens i had almost forgotten i was inspired but of shakespeare we do not even suspect that he ever remembered it he does not always speak in that intense way that flames up in lear and macbeth through the rifts of a soil volcanic with passion he allows us here and there the repose of a commonplace character the consoling distraction of a humorous one he knows how to be equable and grand without effort so that we forget the altitude of thought to which he has led us because the slowly receding slope of a mountain stretching downward by ample gradations gives a less startling impression of height than to look over the edge of a ravine that makes but a wrinkle in its flank  shakespeare has been sometimes taxed with the barbarism of profuseness and exaggeration but this is to measure him by a sophoclean scale the simplicity of the antique tragedy is by no means that of expression but is of form merely in the utterance of great passions something must be indulged to the extravagance of nature the subdued tones to which pathos and sentiment are limited cannot express a tempest of the soul the range between the piteous no more but so in which ophelia compresses the heartbreak whose compression was to make her mad and that sublime appeal of lear to the elements of nature only to be matched if matched at all in the prometheus is a wide one and shakespeare is as truly simple in the one as in the other the simplicity of poetry is not that of prose nor its clearness that of ready apprehension merely to a subtile sense a sense heightened by sympathy those sudden fervors of phrase gone ere one can say it lightens that show us macbeth groping among the complexities of thought in his conscienceclouded mind and reveal the intricacy rather than enlighten it while they leave the eye darkened to the literal meaning of the words yet make their logical sequence the grandeur of the conception and its truth to nature clearer than sober daylight could there is an obscurity of mist rising from the undrained shallows of the mind and there is the darkness of thundercloud gathering its electric masses with passionate intensity from the clear element of the imagination not at random or wilfully but by the natural processes of the creative faculty to brood those flashes of expression that transcend rhetoric and are only to be apprehended by the poetic instinct  in that secondary office of imagination where it serves the artist not as the reason that shapes but as the interpreter of his conceptions into words there is a distinction to be noticed between the higher and lower mode in which it performs its function it may be either creative or pictorial may body forth the thought or merely image it forth with shakespeare for example imagination seems immanent in his very consciousness with milton in his memory in the one it sends as if without knowing it a fiery life into the verse    sei die braut das wort   bräutigam der geist  in the other it elaborates a certain pomp and elevation accordingly the bias of the former is toward overintensity of the latter toward overdiffuseness shakespeares temptation is to push a willing metaphor beyond its strength to make a passion overinform its tenement of words milton cannot resist running a simile on into a fugue one always fancies shakespeare in his best verses and milton at the keyboard of his organ shakespeares language is no longer the mere vehicle of thought it has become part of it its very flesh and blood the pleasure it gives us is unmixed direct like that from the smell of a flower or the flavor of a fruit milton sets everywhere his little pitfalls of bookish association for the memory i know that miltons manner is very grand it is slow it is stately moving as in triumphal procession with music with historic banners with spoils from every time and every region and captive epithets like huge sicambrians thrust their broad shoulders between us and the thought whose pomp they decorate but it is manner nevertheless as is proved by the ease with which it is parodied by the danger it is in of degenerating into mannerism whenever it forgets itself fancy a parody of shakespearei do not mean of his words but of his tone for that is what distinguishes the master you might as well try it with the venus of melos in shakespeare it is always the higher thing the thought the fancy that is preeminent it is caesar that draws all eyes and not the chariot in which he rides or the throng which is but the reverberation of his supremacy if not how explain the charm with which he dominates in all tongues even under the disenchantment of translation among the most alien races he is as solidly at home as a mountain seen from different sides by many lands itself superbly solitary yet the companion of all thoughts and domesticated in all imaginations  in description shakespeare is especially great and in that instinct which gives the peculiar quality of any object of contemplation in a single happy word that colors the impression on the sense with the mood of the mind most descriptive poets seem to think that a hogshead of water caught at the spout will give us a livelier notion of a thundershower than the sullen muttering of the first big drops upon the roof they forget that it is by suggestion not cumulation that profound impressions are made upon the imagination miltons parsimony so rare in him makes the success of his    sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops   wept at completion of the mortal sin  shakespeare understood perfectly the charm of indirectness of making his readers seem to discover for themselves what he means to show them if he wishes to tell that the leaves of the willow are gray on the under side he does not make it a mere fact of observation by bluntly saying so but makes it picturesquely reveal itself to us as it might in nature    there is a willow grows athwart the flood   that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream  where he goes to the landscape for a comparison he does not ransack wood and field for specialties as if he were gathering simples but takes one image obvious familiar and makes it new to us either by sympathy or contrast with his own immediate feeling he always looked upon nature with the eyes of the mind thus he can make the melancholy of autumn or the gladness of spring alike pathetic    that time of year thou mayst in me behold   when yellow leaves or few or none do hang   upon those boughs that shake against the cold   bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang  or again    from thee have i been absent in the spring   when proudpied april dressed in all his trim   hath put a spirit of youth in everything   that heavy saturn leaped and laughed with him  but as dramatic poet shakespeare goes even beyond this entering so perfectly into the consciousness of the characters he himself has created that he sees everything through their peculiar mood and makes every epithet as if unconsciously echo and reecho it theseus asks hermia    can you endure the livery of a nun   for aye to be in shady cloister mewed   to live a barren sister all your life   chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon  when romeo must leave juliet the private pang of the lovers becomes a property of nature herself and                                envious streaks   do lace the severing clouds in yonder east  but even more striking is the following instance from macbeth                 the raven himself is hoarse   that croaks the fatal enterance of duncan   under your battlements  here shakespeare with his wonted tact makes use of a vulgar superstition of a type in which mortal presentiment is already embodied to make a common ground on which the hearer and lady macbeth may meet after this prelude we are prepared to be possessed by her emotion more fully to feel in her ears the dull tramp of the blood that seems to make the ravens croak yet hoarser than it is and to betray the stealthy advance of the mind to its fell purpose for lady macbeth hears not so much the voice of the bodeful bird as of her own premeditated murder and we are thus made her shuddering accomplices before the fact every image receives the color of the mind every word throbs with the pulse of one controlling passion the epithet fatal makes us feel the implacable resolve of the speaker and shows us that she is tampering with her conscience by putting off the crime upon the prophecy of the weird sisters to which she alludes in the word battlements too not only is the fancy led up to the perch of the raven but a hostile image takes the place of a hospitable for men commonly speak of receiving a guest under their roof or within their doors that this is not overingenuity seeing what is not to be seen nor meant to be seen is clear to me from what follows when duncan and banquo arrive at the castle their fancies free from all suggestion of evil call up only gracious and amiable images the raven was but the fantastical creation of lady macbeths overwrought brain    this castle hath a pleasant seat the air   nimbly and sweetly doth commend itself   unto our gentle senses                                             this guest of summer   the templehaunting martlet doth approve   by his loved mansionry that the heavens breath   smells wooingly here no jutty frieze   buttress or coigne of vantage but this bird   hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle  the contrast here cannot but be as intentional as it is marked every image is one of welcome security and confidence the summer one may well fancy would be a very different hostess from her whom we have just seen expecting them and why templehaunting unless because it suggests sanctuary o immaginativa che si ne rubi delle cose di fuor how infinitely more precious are the inward ones thou givest in return if all this be accident it is at least one of those accidents of which only this man was ever capable i divine something like it now and then in aeschylus through the mists of a language which will not let me be sure of what i see but nowhere else shakespeare it is true had as i have said as respects english the privilege which only firstcomers enjoy the language was still fresh from those sources at too great a distance from which it becomes fit only for the service of prose wherever he dipped it came up clear and sparkling undefiled as yet by the drainage of literary factories or of those dyehouses where the machinewoven fabrics of sham culture are colored up to the last desperate style of sham sentiment those who criticise his diction as sometimes extravagant should remember that in poetry language is something more than merely the vehicle of thought that it is meant to convey the sentiment as much as the sense and that if there is a beauty of use there is often a higher use of beauty  what kind of culture shakespeare had is uncertain how much he had is disputed that he had as much as he wanted and of whatever kind he wanted must be clear to whoever considers the question dr farmer has proved in his entertaining essay that he got everything at secondhand from translations and that where his translator blundered he loyally blundered too but goethe the man of widest acquirement in modern times did precisely the same thing in his character of poet he set as little store by useless learning as shakespeare did he learned to write hexameters not from homer but from voss and voss found them faulty yet somehow hermann und dorothea is more readable than luise so far as all the classicism then attainable was concerned shakespeare got it as cheap as goethe did who always bought it readymade for such purposes of mere aesthetic nourishment goethe always milked other mindsif minds those ruminators and digesters of antiquity into asses milk may be called there were plenty of professors who were forever assiduously browsing in vales of enna and on pentelican slopes among the vestiges of antiquity slowly secreting lacteous facts and not one of them would have raised his head from that exquisite pasturage though pan had made music through his pipe of reeds did goethe wish to work up a greek theme he drove out herr böttiger for example among that fodder delicious to him for its very dryness that sapless arcadia of scholiasts let him graze ruminate and go through all other needful processes of the antiquarian organism then got him quietly into a corner and milked him the product after standing long enough mantled over with the rich goethean cream from which a butter could be churned if not precisely classic quite as good as the ancients could have made out of the same material but who has ever read the achilleis correct in all unessential particulars as it probably is  it is impossible to conceive that a man who in other respects made such booty of the world around him whose observation of manners was so minute and whose insight into character and motives as if he had been one of gods spies was so unerring that we accept it without question as we do nature herself and find it more consoling to explain his confessedly immense superiority by attributing it to a happy instinct rather than to the conscientious perfecting of exceptional powers till practice made them seem to work independently of the will which still directed themit is impossible that such a man should not also have profited by the converse of the cultivated and quickwitted men in whose familiar society he lived that he should not have over and over again discussed points of criticism and art with them that he should not have had his curiosity so alive to everything else excited about those ancients whom university men then no doubt as now extolled without too much knowledge of what they really were that he should not have heard too much rather than too little of aristotles poetics quinctilians rhetoric horaces art of poetry and the unities especially from ben jonsonin short that he who speaks of himself as    desiring this mans art and that mans scope   with what he most enjoyed contented least  and who meditated so profoundly on every other topic of human concern should never have turned his thought to the principles of that art which was both the delight and business of his life the breadwinner alike for soul and body was there no harvest of the ear for him whose eye had stocked its garners so full as wellnigh to forestall all aftercomers did he who could so counsel the practisers of an art in which he never arrived at eminence as in hamlets advice to the players never take counsel with himself about that other art in which the instinct of the crowd no less than the judgment of his rivals awarded him an easy preeminence if he had little latin and less greek might he not have had enough of both for every practical purpose on this side pedantry the most extraordinary one might almost say contradictory attainments have been ascribed to him and yet he has been supposed incapable of what was within easy reach of every boy at westminster school there is a knowledge that comes of sympathy as living and genetic as that which comes of mere learning is sapless and unprocreant and for this no profound study of the languages is needed  if shakespeare did not know the ancients i think they were at least as unlucky in not knowing him but is it incredible that he may have laid hold of an edition of the greek tragedians graecè et latinè and then with such poor wits as he was master of contrived to worry some considerable meaning out of them there are at least one or two coincidences which whether accidental or not are curious and which i do not remember to have seen noticed in the electra of sophocles which is almost identical in its leading motive with hamlet the chorus consoles electra for the supposed death of orestes in the same commonplace way which hamlets uncle tries with him    greek thnaetou pephukas patros aelektra phronei   thnaetos d orestaes oste mae lian stene   pasin gar aemin tout opheiletai pathein           your father lost a father   that father lost lost his                   but to perséver   in obstinate condolement is a course   of impious stubbornness       t is common all that live must die  shakespeare expatiates somewhat more largely but the sentiment in both cases is almost verbally identical the resemblance is probably a chance one for commonplace and consolation were always twin sisters whom always to escape is given to no man but it is nevertheless curious here is another from the oedipus coloneus    greek tois toi dikaiois cho brachus nika megan    thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just  hamlets prophetic soul may be matched with the greek promantis thumos of peleus eurip androm 1075 and his sea of troubles with the greek kakon pelagos of theseus in the hippolytus or of the chorus in the hercules furens and for manner and tone compare the speeches of pheres in the alcestis and jocasta in the phoenissae with those of claudio in measure for measure and ulysses in troilus and cressida  the greek dramatists were somewhat fond of a trick of words in which there is a reduplication of sense as well as of assonance as in the electra    greek alektra gaeraskousan anumenaia te  so shakespeare    unhouseled disappointed unaneled  and milton after him or more likely after the greek    unrespited unpitied unreprieved129  i mention these trifles in passing because they have interested me and therefore may interest others i lay no stress upon them for if once the conductors of shakespeares intelligence had been put in connection with those attic brains he would have reproduced their message in a form of his own they would have inspired and not enslaved him his resemblance to them is that of consanguinity more striking in expression than in mere resemblance of feature the likeness between the clytemnestragreek gunaikos androboulon elpizon kearof aeschylus and the lady macbeth of shakespeare was too remarkable to have escaped notice that between the two poets in their choice of epithets is as great though more difficult of proof yet i think an attentive student of shakespeare cannot fail to be reminded of something familiar to him in such phrases as flameeyed fire flaxwinged ships starneighboring peaks the rock salmydessus                  rude jaw of the sea   harsh hostess of the seaman stepmother   of ships  and the beacon with its speaking eye of fire surely there is more than a verbal there is a genuine similarity between the greek anaerithmon gelasma and the unnumbered beach and multitudinous sea aeschylus it seems to me is willing just as shakespeare is to risk the prosperity of a verse upon a lucky throw of words which may come up the sices of hardy metaphor or the ambsace of conceit there is such a difference between farreaching and farfetching poetry to be sure is always that daring one step beyond which brings the right man to fortune but leaves the wrong one in the ditch and its law is be bold once and again yet be not overbold it is true also that masters of language are a little apt to play with it but whatever fault may be found with shakespeare in this respect will touch a tender spot in aeschylus also does he sometimes overload a word so that the language not merely as dryden says bends under him but fairly gives way and lets the readers mind down with the shock as of a false step in taste he has nothing worse than greek pelagos anthoun nekrois a criticism shallow in human nature however deep in campbells rhetoric has blamed him for making persons under great excitement of sorrow or whatever other emotion parenthesize some trifling play upon words in the very height of their passion those who make such criticisms have either never felt a passion or seen one in action or else they forget the exaltation of sensibility during such crises so that the attention whether of the senses or the mind is arrested for the moment by what would be overlooked in ordinary moods the more forceful the current the more sharp the ripple from any alien substance interposed a passion that looks forward like revenge or lust or greed goes right to its end and is straightforward in its expression but a tragic passion which is in its nature unavailing like disappointment regret of the inevitable or remorse is reflective and liable to be continually diverted by the suggestions of fancy the one is a concentration of the will which intensifies the character and the phrase that expresses it in the other the will is helpless and as in insanity while the flow of the mind sets imperatively in one direction it is liable to almost ludicrous interruptions and diversions upon the most trivial hint of involuntary association i am ready to grant that shakespeare sometimes allows his characters to spend time that might be better employed in carving some cherrystone of a quibble130 that he is sometimes tempted away from the natural by the quaint that he sometimes forces a partial even a verbal analogy between the abstract thought and the sensual image into an absolute identity giving us a kind of serious pun in a pun our pleasure arises from a gap in the logical nexus too wide for the reason but which the ear can bridge in an instant is that your own hare or a wig the fancy is yet more tickled where logic is treated with a mock ceremonial of respect    his head was turned and so he chewed      his pigtail till he died  now when this kind of thing is done in earnest the result is one of those illdistributed syllogisms which in rhetoric are called conceits    hard was the hand that struck the blow      soft was the heart that bled  i have seen this passage from warner cited for its beauty though i should have thought nothing could be worse had i not seen general morriss    her heart and morning broke together      in tears  of course i would not rank with these gloucesters    what will the aspiring blood of lancaster   sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted  though as mere rhetoric it belongs to the same class131  it might be defended as a bit of ghastly humor characteristic of the speaker but at any rate it is not without precedent in the two greater greek tragedians in a chorus of the seven against thebes we have                  greek en de gaia   zoa phonoruto   memiktai karta d eis omaimoi  and does not sophocles make ajax in his despair quibble upon his own name quite in the shakespearian fashion under similar circumstances nor does the coarseness with which our great poet is reproached lack an aeschylean parallel even the nurse in romeo and juliet would have found a true gossip in her of the agamemnon who is so indiscreet in her confidences concerning the nursery life of orestes whether raleigh is right or not in warning historians against following truth too close upon the heels the caution is a good one for poets as respects truth to nature but it is a mischievous fallacy in historian or critic to treat as a blemish of the man what is but the common tincture of his age it is to confound a spatter of mud with a moral stain  but i have been led away from my immediate purpose i did not intend to compare shakespeare with the ancients much less to justify his defects by theirs shakespeare himself has left us a pregnant satire on dogmatical and categorical aesthetics which commonly in discussion soon lose their ceremonious tails and are reduced to the internecine dog and cat of their bald first syllables in the cloudscene between hamlet and polonius suggesting exquisitely how futile is any attempt at a castiron definition of those perpetually metamorphic impressions of the beautiful whose source is as much in the man who looks as in the thing he sees in the fine arts a thing is either good in itself or it is nothing it neither gains nor loses by having it shown that another good thing was also good in itself any more than a bad thing profits by comparison with another that is worse the final judgment of the world is intuitive and is based not on proof that a work possesses some of the qualities of another whose greatness is acknowledged but on the immediate feeling that it carries to a high point of perfection certain qualities proper to itself one does not flatter a fine pear by comparing it to a fine peach nor learn what a fine peach is by tasting ever so many poor ones the boy who makes his first bite into one does not need to ask his father if or how or why it is good because continuity is a merit in some kinds of writing shall we refuse ourselves to the authentic charm of montaignes want of it i have heard people complain of french tragedies because they were so very french this though it may not be to some particular tastes and may from one point of view be a defect is from another and far higher a distinguished merit it is their flavor as direct a telltale of the soil whence they drew it as that of french wines is suppose we should tax the elgin marbles with being too greek when will people nay when will even critics get over this selfdefrauding trick of cheapening the excellence of one thing by that of another this conclusive style of judgment which consists simply in belonging to the other parish as one grows older one loses many idols perhaps comes at last to have none at all though he may honestly enough uncover in deference to the worshippers before any shrine but for the seeming loss the compensation is ample these saints of literature descend from their canopied remoteness to be even more precious as men like ourselves our companions in field and street speaking the same tongue though in many dialects and owning one creed under the most diverse masks of form  much of that merit of structure which is claimed for the ancient tragedy is due if i am not mistaken to circumstances external to the drama itselfto custom to convention to the exigencies of the theatre it is formal rather than organic the prometheus seems to me one of the few greek tragedies in which the whole creation has developed itself in perfect proportion from one central germ of living conception the motive of the ancient drama is generally outside of it while in the modern at least in the english it is necessarily within goethe in a thoughtful essay132 written many years later than his famous criticism of hamlet in wilhelm meister says that the distinction between the two is the difference between sollen and wollen that is between must and would he means that in the greek drama the catastrophe is foreordained by an inexorable destiny while the element of freewill and consequently of choice is the very axis of the modern the definition is conveniently portable but it has its limitations goethes attention was too exclusively fixed on the fate tragedies of the greeks and upon shakespeare among the moderns in the spanish drama for example custom loyalty honor and religion are as imperative and as inevitable as doom in the antigone on the other hand the crisis lies in the character of the protagonist in this sense it is modern and is the first example of true characterpainting in tragedy but from whatever cause that exquisite analysis of complex motives and the display of them in action and speech which constitute for us the abiding charm of fiction were quite unknown to the ancients they reached their height in cervantes and shakespeare and though on a lower plane still belong to the upper region of art in le sage molière and fielding the personages of the greek tragedy seem to be commonly rather types than individuals in the modern tragedy certainly in the four greatest of shakespeares tragedies there is still something very like destiny only the place of it is changed it is no longer above man but in him yet the catastrophe is as sternly foredoomed in the characters of lear othello macbeth and hamlet as it could be by an infallible oracle in macbeth indeed the weird sisters introduce an element very like fate but generally it may be said that with the greeks the character is involved in the action while with shakespeare the action is evolved from the character in the one case the motive of the play controls the personages in the other the chief personages are in themselves the motive to which all else is subsidiary in any comparison therefore of shakespeare with the ancients we are not to contrast him with them as unapproachable models but to consider whether he like them did not consciously endeavor under the circumstances and limitations in which he found himself to produce the most excellent thing possible a model also in its own kindwhether higher or lower in degree is another question the only fair comparison would be between him and that one of his contemporaries who endeavored to anachronize himself so to speak and to subject his art so far as might be to the laws of classical composition ben jonson was a great man and has sufficiently proved that he had an eye for the external marks of character but when he would make a whole of them he gives us instead either a bundle of humors or an incorporated idea with shakespeare the plot is an interior organism in jonson an external contrivance it is the difference between man and tortoise in the one the osseous structure is out of sight indeed but sustains the flesh and blood that envelop it while the other is boxed up and imprisoned in his bones  i have been careful to confine myself to what may be called shakespeares ideal tragedies in the purely historical or chronicle plays the conditions are different and his imagination submits itself to the necessary restrictions on its freedom of movement outside the tragedies also the tempest makes an exception worthy of notice if i read it rightly it is an example of how a great poet should write allegorynot embodying metaphysical abstractions but giving us ideals abstracted from life itself suggesting an undermeaning everywhere forcing it upon us nowhere tantalizing the mind with hints that imply so much and tell so little and yet keep the attention all eye and ear with eager if fruitless expectation here the leading characters are not merely typical but symbolicalthat is they do not illustrate a class of persons they belong to universal nature consider the scene of the play shakespeare is wont to take some familiar story to lay his scene in some place the name of which at least is familiarwell knowing the reserve of power that lies in the familiar as a background when things are set in front of it under a new and unexpected light but in the tempest the scene is laid nowhere or certainly in no country laid down on any map nowhere then at once nowhere and anywherefor it is in the soul of man that still vexed island hung between the upper and the nether world and liable to incursions from both there is scarce a play of shakespeares in which there is such variety of character none in which character has so little to do in the carrying on and development of the story but consider for a moment if ever the imagination has been so embodied as in prospero the fancy as in ariel the brute understanding as in caliban who the moment his poor wits are warmed with the glorious liquor of stephano plots rebellion against his natural lord the higher reason miranda is mere abstract womanhood as truly so before she sees ferdinand as eve before she was wakened to consciousness by the echo of her own nature coming back to her the same and yet not the same from that of adam ferdinand again is nothing more than youth compelled to drudge at something he despises till the sacrifice of will and abnegation of self win him his ideal in miranda the subordinate personages are simply types sebastian and antonio of weak character and evil ambition gonzalo of average sense and honesty adrian and francisco of the walking gentlemen who serve to fill up a world they are not characters in the same sense with iago falstaff shallow or leontius and it is curious how every one of them loses his way in this enchanted island of life all the victims of one illusion after another except prospero whose ministers are purely ideal the whole play indeed is a succession of illusions winding up with those solemn words of the great enchanter who had summoned to his service every shape of merriment or passion every figure in the great tragicomedy of life and who was now bidding farewell to the scene of his triumphs for in prospero shall we not recognize the artist himself    that did not better for his life provide   than public means which public manners breeds   whence comes it that his name receives a brand  who has forfeited a shining place in the worlds eye by devotion to his art and who turned adrift on the ocean of life in the leaky carcass of a boat has shipwrecked on that fortunate island as men always do who find their true vocation where he is absolute lord making all the powers of nature serve him but with ariel and caliban as special ministers of whom else could he have been thinking when he says                                     graves at my command   have waked their sleepers oped and let them forth   by my so potent art  was this man so extraordinary from whatever side we look at him who ran so easily through the whole scale of human sentiment from the homely commonsense of when two men ride of one horse one must ride behind to the transcendental subtilty of    no time thou shalt not boast that i do change   thy pyramids built up with newer might   to me are nothing novel nothing strange   they are but dressings of a former sight  was he alone so unconscious of powers some part of whose magic is recognized by all mankind from the schoolboy to the philosopher that he merely sat by and saw them go without the least notion what they were about was he an inspired idiot vôtre bizarre shakespeare a vast irregular genius a simple rustic warbling his native woodnotes wild in other words insensible to the benefits of culture when attempts have been made at various times to prove that this singular and seemingly contradictory creature not one but all mankinds epitome was a musician a lawyer a doctor a catholic a protestant an atheist an irishman a discoverer of the circulation of the blood and finally that he was not himself but somebody else is it not a little odd that the last thing anybody should have thought of proving him was an artist nobody believes any longer that immediate inspiration is possible in modern times as if god had grown oldat least nobody believes it of the prophets of those days of john of leyden or reeves or muggletonand yet everybody seems to take it for granted of this one man shakespeare he somehow or other without knowing it was able to do what none of the rest of them though knowing it all too perfectly well could begin to do everybody seems to get afraid of him in turn voltaire plays gentleman usher for him to his countrymen and then perceiving that his countrymen find a flavor in him beyond that of zaïre or mahomet discovers him to be a sauvage ivre sans le moindre étincelle de bon goût et sans le moindre connoissance des règles goethe who tells us that götz von berlichingen was written in the shakespearian mannerand we certainly should not have guessed it if he had not blabbedcomes to the final conclusion that shakespeare was a poet but not a dramatist châteaubriand thinks that he has corrupted art if to attain he says the height of tragic art it be enough to heap together disparate scenes without order and without connection to dovetail the burlesque with the pathetic to set the watercarrier beside the monarch and the hucksterwench beside the queen who may not reasonably flatter himself with being the rival of the greatest masters whoever should give himself the trouble to retrace a single one of his days  to keep a journal from hour to hour would have made a drama in the fashion of the english poet but there are journals and journals as the french say and what goes into them depends on the eye that gathers for them it is a long step from st simon to dangeau from pepys to thoresby from shakespeare even to the marquis de châteaubriand m hugo alone convinced that as founder of the french romantic school there is a kind of family likeness between himself and shakespeare stands boldly forth to prove the father as extravagant as the son calm yourself m hugo you are no more a child of his than will davenant was but after all is it such a great crime to produce something absolutely new in a world so tedious as ours and so apt to tell its old stories over again i do not mean new in substance but in the manner of presentation surely the highest office of a great poet is to show us how much variety freshness and opportunity abides in the obvious and familiar he invents nothing but seems rather to rediscover the world about him and his penetrating vision gives to things of daily encounter something of the strangeness of new creation meanwhile the changed conditions of modern life demand a change in the method of treatment the ideal is not a straitwaistcoat because alexis and dora is so charming shall we have no paul and virginia it was the idle endeavor to reproduce the old enchantment in the old way that gave us the pastoral sent to the garret now with our grandmothers achievements of the same sort in worsted every age says to its poets like a mistress to her lover tell me what i am like and he who succeeds in catching the evanescent expression that reveals characterwhich is as much as to say what is intrinsically humanwill be found to have caught something as imperishable as human nature itself aristophanes by the vital and essential qualities of his humorous satire is already more nearly our contemporary than molière and even the trouvères careless and trivial as they mostly are could fecundate a great poet like chaucer and are still delightful reading  the attic tragedy still keeps its hold upon the loyalty of scholars through their imagination or their pedantry or their feeling of an exclusive property as may happen and however alloyed with baser matter this loyalty is legitimate and well bestowed but the dominion of the shakespearian is even wider it pushes forward its boundaries from year to year and moves no landmark backward here alfieri and leasing own a common allegiance and the loyalty to him is one not of guild or tradition but of conviction and enthusiasm can this be said of any other modern of robust corneille of tender racine of calderon even with his tropical warmth and vigor of production the greeks and he are alike and alone in this and for the same reason that both are unapproachably the highest in their kind call him gothic if you like but the inspiring mind that presided over the growth of these clustered masses of arch and spire and pinnacle and buttress is neither greek nor gothicit is simply genius lending itself to embody the new desire of mans mind as it had embodied the old after all to be delightful is to be classic and the chaotic never pleases long but manifoldness is not confusion any more than formalism is simplicity if shakespeare rejected the unities as i think he who complains of art made tonguetied by authority might very well deliberately do it was for the sake of an imaginative unity more intimate than any of time and place the antique in itself is not the ideal though its remoteness from the vulgarity of everyday associations helps to make it seem so the true ideal is not opposed to the real nor is it any artificial heightening thereof but lies in it and blessed are the eyes that find it it is the mens divinior which hides within the actual transfiguring matteroffact into matterofmeaning for him who has the gift of secondsight in this sense hogarth is often more truly ideal than raphael shakespeare often more truly so than the greeks i think it is a more or less conscious perception of this ideality as it is a more or less wellgrounded persuasion of it as respects the greeks that assures to him as to them and with equal justice a permanent supremacy over the minds of men this gives to his characters their universality to his thought its irradiating property while the artistic purpose running through and combining the endless variety of scene and character will alone account for his power of dramatic effect goethe affirmed that without schröders prunings and adaptations shakespeare was too undramatic for the german theatrethat if the theory that his plays should be represented textually should prevail he would be driven from the boards the theory has prevailed and he not only holds his own but is acted oftener than ever it is not irregular genius that can do this for surely germany need not go abroad for what her own werners could more than amply supply her with  but i would much rather quote a fine saying than a bad prophecy of a man to whom i owe so much goethe in one of the most perfect of his shorter poems tells us that a poem is like a painted window seen from without and he accordingly justifies the philistine who never looks at them otherwise they seem dingy and confused enough but enter and then    da ists auf einmal farbig helle   geschicht und zierath glänzt in schnelle  with the same feeling he says elsewhere in prose that there is a destructive criticism and a productive the former is very easy for one has only to set up in his mind any standard any model however narrow let us say the greeks and then boldly assert that the work under review does not match with it and therefore is good for nothingthe matter is settled and one must at once deny its claim productive criticism is a great deal more difficult it asks what did the author propose to himself is what he proposes reasonable and comprehensible and how far has he succeeded in carrying it out it is in applying this latter kind of criticism to shakespeare that the germans have set us an example worthy of all commendation if they have been sometimes oversubtile they at least had the merit of first looking at his works as wholes as something that very likely contained an idea perhaps conveyed a moral if we could get at it the illumination lent us by most of the english commentators reminds us of the candles which guides hold up to show us a picture in a dark place the smoke of which gradually makes the work of the artist invisible under its repeated layers lessing as might have been expected opened the first glimpse in the new direction goethe followed with his famous exposition of hamlet aw schlegel took a more comprehensive view in his lectures which coleridge worked over into english adding many fine criticisms of his own on single passages and finally gervinus has devoted four volumes to a comment on the plays full of excellent matter though pushing the moral exegesis beyond all reasonable bounds133 with the help of all these and especially of the last i shall apply this theory of criticism to hamlet not in the hope of saying anything new but of bringing something to the support of the thesis that if shakespeare was skilful as a playwright he was even greater as a dramatistthat if his immediate business was to fill the theatre his higher object was to create something which by fulfilling the conditions and answering the requirements of modern life should as truly deserve to be called a work of art as others had deserved it by doing the same thing in former times and under other circumstances supposing him to have acceptedconsciously or not is of little importancethe new terms of the problem which makes character the pivot of dramatic action and consequently the key of dramatic unity how far did he succeed  before attempting my analysis i must clear away a little rubbish are such anachronisms as those of which voltaire accuses shakespeare in hamlet such as the introduction of cannon before the invention of gunpowder and making christians of the danes three centuries too soon of the least bearing aesthetically i think not but as they are of a piece with a great many other criticisms upon the great poet it is worth while to dwell upon them a moment  the first demand we make upon whatever claims to be a work of art and we have a right to make it is that it shall be in keeping now this propriety is of two kinds either extrinsic or intrinsic in the first i should class whatever relates rather to the body than the soul of the work such as fidelity to the facts of history wherever that is important congruity of costume and the likein short whatever might come under the head of picturesque truth a departure from which would shock too rudely our preconceived associations i have seen an indian chief in french boots and he seemed to me almost tragic but put upon the stage in tragedy he would have been ludicrous lichtenberg writing from london in 1775 tells us that garrick played hamlet in a suit of the french fashion then commonly worn and that he was blamed for it by some of the critics but he says one hears no such criticism during the play nor on the way home nor at supper afterwards nor indeed till the emotion roused by the great actor has had time to subside he justifies garrick though we should not be able to endure it now yet nothing would be gained by trying to make hamlets costume true to the assumed period of the play for the scene of it is laid in a denmark that has no dates  in the second and more important category i should put first coordination of character that is a certain variety in harmony of the personages of a drama as in the attitudes and coloring of the figures in a pictorial composition so that while mutually relieving and setting off each other they shall combine in the total impression second that subordinate truth to nature which makes each character coherent in itself and third such propriety of costume and the like as shall satisfy the superhistoric sense to which and to which alone the higher drama appeals all these come within the scope of imaginative truth to illustrate my third head by an example tieck criticises john kembles dressing for macbeth in a modern highland costume as being ungraceful without any countervailing merit of historical exactness i think a deeper reason for his dissatisfaction might be found in the fact that this garb with its purely modern and british army associations is out of place on fores heath and drags the weird sisters down with it from their proper imaginative remoteness in the gloom of the past to the disenchanting glare of the footlights it is not the antiquarian but the poetic conscience that is wounded to this exactness so far as concerns ideal representation may not only not be truth but may even be opposed to it anachronisms and the like are in themselves of no account and become important only when they make a gap too wide for our illusion to cross unconsciously that is when they are anacoluthons to the imagination the aim of the artist is psychologic not historic truth it is comparatively easy for an author to get up any period with tolerable minuteness in externals but readers and audiences find more difficulty in getting them down though oblivion swallows scores of them at a gulp the saving truth in such matters is a truth to essential and permanent characteristics the ulysses of shakespeare like the ulysses of dante and tennyson more or less harmonizes with our ideal conception of the wary longconsidering though adventurous son of laertes yet simon lord lovat is doubtless nearer the original type in hamlet though there is no denmark of the ninth century shakespeare has suggested the prevailing rudeness of manners quite enough for his purpose we see it in the single combat of hamlets father with the elder fortinbras in the vulgar wassail of the king in the english monarch being expected to hang rosencrantz and guildenstern out of hand merely to oblige his cousin of denmark in laertes sent to paris to be made a gentleman of becoming instantly capable of any the most barbarous treachery to glut his vengeance we cannot fancy ragnar lodbrog or eric the red matriculating at wittenberg but it was essential that hamlet should be a scholar and shakespeare sends him thither without more ado all through the play we get the notion of a state of society in which a savage nature has disguised itself in the externals of civilization like a maori deacon who has only to strip and he becomes once more a tattooed pagan with his mouth watering for a sparerib of his pastor historically at the date of hamlet the danes were in the habit of burning their enemies alive in their houses with as much of their family about them as might be to make it comfortable shakespeare seems purposely to have dissociated his play from history by changing nearly every name in the original legend the motive of the playrevenge as a religious dutybelongs only to a social state in which the traditions of barbarism are still operative but with infallible artistic judgment shakespeare has chosen not untamed nature as he found it in history but the period of transition a period in which the times are always out of joint and thus the irresolution which has its root in hamlets own character is stimulated by the very incompatibility of that legacy of vengeance he has inherited from the past with the new culture and refinement of which he is the representative one of the few books which shakespeare is known to have possessed was florios montaigne and he might well have transferred the frenchmans motto que sçais je to the front of his tragedy nor can i help fancying something more than accident in the fact that hamlet has been a student at wittenberg whence those new ideas went forth of whose results in unsettling mens faith and consequently disqualifying them for promptness in action shakespeare had been not only an eyewitness but which he must actually have experienced in himself  one other objection let me touch upon here especially as it has been urged against hamlet and that is the introduction of low characters and comic scenes in tragedy even garrick who had just assisted at the stratford jubilee where shakespeare had been pronounced divine was induced by this absurd outcry for the proprieties of the tragic stage to omit the gravediggers scene from hamlet leaving apart the fact that shakespeare would not have been the representative poet he is if he had not given expression to this striking tendency of the northern races which shows itself constantly not only in their literature but even in their mythology and their architecture the gravediggers scene always impresses me as one of the most pathetic in the whole tragedy that shakespeare introduced such scenes and characters with deliberate intention and with a view to artistic relief and contrast there can hardly be a doubt we must take it for granted that a man whose works show everywhere the results of judgment sometimes acted with forethought i find the springs of the profoundest sorrow and pity in this hardened indifference of the gravediggers in their careless discussion as to whether ophelias death was by suicide or no in their singing and jesting at their dreary work    a pickaxe and a spade a spade   forand a shroudingsheet   o a pit of clay for to be made   for such a guest is meet  we know who is to be the guest of this earthen hospitalityhow much beauty love and heartbreak are to be covered in that pit of clay all we remember of ophelia reacts upon us with tenfold force and we recoil from our amusement at the ghastly drollery of the two delvers with a shock of horror that the unconscious hamlet should stumble on this grave of all others that it should be here that he should pause to muse humorously on death and decayall this prepares us for the revulsion of passion in the next scene and for the frantic confession    i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers   could not with all their quantity of love   make up my sum  and it is only here that such an asseveration would be true even to the feeling of the moment for it is plain from all we know of hamlet that he could not so have loved ophelia that he was incapable of the selfabandonment of a true passion that he would have analyzed this emotion as he does all others would have peeped and botanized upon it till it became to him a mere matter of scientific interest all this force of contrast and this horror of surprise were necessary so to intensify his remorseful regret that he should believe himself for once in earnest the speech of the king o he is mad laertes recalls him to himself and he at once begins to rave    zounds show me what thoult do   woult weep woult fight woult fast woult tear thyself   woult drink up eysil eat a crocodile  it is easy to see that the whole plot hinges upon the character of hamlet that shakespeares conception of this was the ovum out of which the whole organism was hatched and here let me remark that there is a kind of genealogical necessity in the charactera thing not altogether strange to the attentive reader of shakespeare hamlet seems the natural result of the mixture of father and mother in his temperament the resolution and persistence of the one like sound timber wormholed and made shaky as it were by the others infirmity of will and discontinuity of purpose in natures so imperfectly mixed it is not uncommon to find vehemence of intention the prelude and counterpoise of weak performance the conscious nature striving to keep up its selfrespect by a triumph in words all the more resolute that it feels assured beforehand of inevitable defeat in action as in such slipshod housekeeping men are their own largest creditors they find it easy to stave off utter bankruptcy of conscience by taking up one unpaid promise with another larger and at heavier interest till such selfswindling becomes habitual and by degrees almost painless how did coleridge discount his own notes of this kind with less and less specie as the figures lengthened on the paper as with hamlet so it is with ophelia and laertes the fathers feebleness comes up again in the wasting heartbreak and gentle lunacy of the daughter while the son shows it in a rashness of impulse and act a kind of crankiness of whose essential feebleness we are all the more sensible as contrasted with a nature so steady on its keel and drawing so much water as that of horatiothe foil at once in different ways to both him and hamlet it was natural also that the daughter of selfconceited old polonius should have her softness stiffened with a fibre of obstinacy for there are two kinds of weakness that which breaks and that which bends ophelias is of the former kind hero is her counterpart giving way before calamity and rising again so soon as the pressure is removed  i find two passages in dante that contain the exactest possible definition of that habit or quality of hamlets mind which justifies the tragic turn of the play and renders it natural and unavoidable from the beginning the first is from the second canto of the inferno    e quale è quei che disvuol ciò che volle   e per nuovi pensier sangia proposta   si che del cominciar tutto si tolle   tal mi fec io in quella oscura costa   perchè pensando consumai la impresa   che fu nel cominciar cotanto tosta    and like the man who unwills what he willed   and for new thoughts doth change his first intent   so that he cannot anywhere begin   such became i upon that slope obscure   because with thinking i consumed resolve   that was so ready at the setting out  again in the fifth of the purgatorio    che sempre l uomo in cui pensier rampoglia   sovra pensier da sè dilunga il segno   perchè la foga l un dell altro insolla    for always he in whom one thought buds forth   out of another farther puts the goal   for each has only force to mar the other  dante was a profound metaphysician and as in the first passage he describes and defines a certain quality of mind so in the other he tells us its result in the character and life namely indecision and failurethe goal farther off at the end than at the beginning it is remarkable how close a resemblance of thought and even of expression there is between the former of these quotations and a part of hamlets famous soliloquy    thus conscience ie consciousness doth make cowards of us all   and thus the native hue of resolution   is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought   and enterprises of great pitch and moment   with this regard their currents turn awry   and lose the name of action  it is an inherent peculiarity of a mind like hamlets that it should be conscious of its own defect men of his type are forever analyzing their own emotions and motives they cannot do anything because they always see two ways of doing it they cannot determine on any course of action because they are always as it were standing at the crossroads and see too well the disadvantages of every one of them it is not that they are incapable of resolve but somehow the band between the motive power and the operative faculties is relaxed and loose the engine works but the machinery it should drive stands still the imagination is so much in overplus that thinking a thing becomes better than doing it and thought with its easy perfection capable of everything because it can accomplish everything with ideal means is vastly more attractive and satisfactory than deed which must be wrought at best with imperfect instruments and always falls short of the conception that went before it if to do says portia in the merchant of veniceif to do were as easy as to know what t were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces hamlet knows only too well what t were good to do but he palters with everything in a double sense he sees the grain of good there is in evil and the grain of evil there is in good as they exist in the world and finding that he can make those featherweighted accidents balance each other infers that there is little to choose between the essences themselves he is of montaignes mind and says expressly that there is nothing good or ill but thinking makes it so he dwells so exclusively in the world of ideas that the world of facts seems trifling nothing is worth the while and he has been so long objectless and purposeless so far as actual life is concerned that when at last an object and an aim are forced upon him he cannot deal with them and gropes about vainly for a motive outside of himself that shall marshal his thoughts for him and guide his faculties into the path of action he is the victim not so much of feebleness of will as of an intellectual indifference that hinders the will from working long in any one direction he wishes to will but never wills his continual iteration of resolve shows that he has no resolution he is capable of passionate energy where the occasion presents itself suddenly from without because nothing is so irritable as conscious irresolution with a duty to perform but of deliberate energy he is not capable for there the impulse must come from within and the blade of his analysis is so subtile that it can divide the finest hair of motive twixt north and northwest side leaving him desperate to choose between them the very consciousness of his defect is an insuperable bar to his repairing it for the unity of purpose which infuses every fibre of the character with will available whenever wanted is impossible where the mind can never rest till it has resolved that unity into its component elements and satisfied itself which on the whole is of greater value a critical instinct so insatiable that it must turn upon itself for lack of something else to hew and hack becomes incapable at last of originating anything except indecision it becomes infallible in what not to do how easily he might have accomplished his task is shown by the conduct of laertes when he has a death to avenge he raises a mob breaks into the palace bullies the king and proves how weak the usurper really was  the world is the victim of splendid parts and is slow to accept a rounded whole because that is something which is long in completing still longer in demonstrating its completion we like to be surprised into admiration and not logically convinced that we ought to admire we are willing to be delighted with success though we are somewhat indifferent to the homely qualities which insure it our thought is so filled with the rockets burst of momentary splendor so far above us that we forget the poor stick useful and unseen that made its climbing possible one of these homely qualities is continuity of character and it escapes present applause because it tells chiefly in the long run in results with his usual tact shakespeare has brought in such a character as a contrast and foil to hamlet horatio is the only complete man in the playsolid wellknit and true a noble quiet nature with that highest of all qualities judgment always sane and prompt who never drags his anchors for any wind of opinion or fortune but grips all the closer to the reality of things he seems one of those calm undemonstrative men whom we love and admire without asking to know why crediting them with the capacity of great things without any test of actual achievement because we feel that their manhood is a constant quality and no mere accident of circumstance and opportunity such men are always sure of the presence of their highest self on demand hamlet is continually drawing bills on the future secured by his promise of himself to himself which he can never redeem his own somewhat feminine nature recognizes its complement in horatio and clings to it instinctively as naturally as horatio is attracted by that fatal gift of imagination the absence of which makes the strength of his own character as its overplus does the weakness of hamlets it is a happy marriage of two minds drawn together by the charm of unlikeness hamlet feels in horatio the solid steadiness which he misses in himself horatio in hamlet that need of service and sustainment to render which gives him a consciousness of his own value hamlet fills the place of a woman to horatio revealing him to himself not only in what he says but by a constant claim upon his strength of nature and there is great psychological truth in making suicide the first impulse of this quiet undemonstrative man after hamlets death as if the very reason for his being were taken away with his friends need of him in his grief he for the first and only time speaks of himself is first made conscious of himself by his loss if this manly reserve of horatio be true to nature not less so are the communicativeness of hamlet and his tendency to soliloquize if selfconsciousness be alien to the one it is just as truly the happiness of the other like a musician distrustful of himself he is forever tuning his instrument first overstraining this cord a little and then that but unable to bring them into unison or to profit by it if he could  we do not believe that horatio ever thought he was not a pipe for fortunes finger to play what stop she please till hamlet told him so that was fortunes affair not his let her try it if she liked he is unconscious of his own peculiar qualities as men of decision commonly are or they would not be men of decision when there is a thing to be done they go straight at it and for the time there is nothing for them in the whole universe but themselves and their object hamlet on the other hand is always studying himself this world and the other too are always present to his mind and there in the corner is the little black kobold of a doubt making mouths at him he breaks down the bridges before him not behind him as a man of action would do but there is something more than this he is an ingrained sceptic though his is the scepticism not of reason but of feeling whose root is want of faith in himself in him it is passive a malady rather than a function of the mind we might call him insincere not that he was in any sense a hypocrite but only that he never was and never could be in earnest never could be because no man without intense faith in something ever can even if he only believed in himself that were better than nothing for it will carry a man a great way in the outward successes of life nay will even sometimes give him the archimedean fulcrum for moving the world but hamlet doubts everything he doubts the immortality of the soul just after seeing his fathers spirit and hearing from its mouth the secrets of the other world he doubts horatio even and swears him to secrecy on the cross of his sword though probably he himself has no assured belief in the sacredness of the symbol he doubts ophelia and asks her are you honest he doubts the ghost after he has had a little time to think about it and so gets up the play to test the guilt of the king and how coherent the whole character is with what perfect tact and judgment shakespeare in the advice to the players makes him an exquisite critic for just here that part of his character which would be weak in dealing with affairs is strong a wise scepticism is the first attribute of a good critic he must not believe that the fireinsurance offices will raise their rates of premium on charles river because the new volume of poems is printing at riverside or the university press he must not believe so profoundly in the ancients as to think it wholly out of the question that the world has still vigor enough in its loins to beget some one who will one of these days be as good an ancient as any of them  another striking quality in hamlets nature is his perpetual inclination to irony i think this has been generally passed over too lightly as if it were something external and accidental rather assumed as a mask than part of the real nature of the man it seems to me to go deeper to be something innate and not merely factitious it is nothing like the grave irony of socrates which was the weapon of a man thoroughly in earnestthe boomerang of argument which one throws in the opposite direction of what he means to hit and which seems to be flying away from the adversary who will presently find himself knocked down by it it is not like the irony of timon which is but the wilful refraction of a clear mind twisting awry whatever enters itor of iago which is the slime that a nature essentially evil loves to trail over all beauty and goodness to taint them with distrust it is the halfjest halfearnest of an inactive temperament that has not quite made up its mind whether life is a reality or no whether men were not made in jest and which amuses itself equally with finding a deep meaning in trivial things and a trifling one in the profoundest mysteries of being because the want of earnestness in its own essence infects everything else with its own indifference if there be now and then an unmannerly rudeness and bitterness in it as in the scenes with polonius and osrick we must remember that hamlet was just in the condition which spurs men to sallies of this kind dissatisfied at one neither with the world nor with himself and accordingly casting about for something out of himself to vent his spleen upon but even in these passages there is no hint of earnestness of any purpose beyond the moment they are mere catspaws of vexation and not the deepraking groundswell of passion as we see it in the sarcasm of lear  the question of hamlets madness has been much discussed and variously decided high medical authority has pronounced as usual on both sides of the question but the induction has been drawn from too narrow premises being based on a mere diagnosis of the case and not on an appreciation of the character in its completeness we have a case of pretended madness in the edgar of king lear and it is certainly true that that is a charcoal sketch coarsely outlined compared with the delicate drawing the lights shades and halftints of the portraiture in hamlet but does this tend to prove that the madness of the latter because truer to the recorded observation of experts is real and meant to be real as the other to be fictitious not in the least as it appears to me hamlet among all the characters of shakespeare is the most eminently a metaphysician and psychologist he is a close observer continually analyzing his own nature and that of others letting fall his little drops of acid irony on all who come near him to make them show what they are made of even ophelia is not too sacred osrick not too contemptible for experiment if such a man assumed madness he would play his part perfectly if shakespeare himself without going mad could so observe and remember all the abnormal symptoms as to be able to reproduce them in hamlet why should it be beyond the power of hamlet to reproduce them in himself if you deprive hamlet of reason there is no truly tragic motive left he would be a fit subject for bedlam but not for the stage we might have pathology enough but no pathos ajax first becomes tragic when he recovers his wits if hamlet is irresponsible the whole play is a chaos that he is not so might be proved by evidence enough were it not labor thrown away  this feigned madness of hamlets is one of the few points in which shakespeare has kept close to the old story on which he founded his play and as he never decided without deliberation so he never acted without unerring judgment hamlet drifts through the whole tragedy he never keeps on one tack long enough to get steerageway even if in a nature like his with those electric streamers of whim and fancy forever wavering across the vault of his brain the needle of judgment would point in one direction long enough to strike a course by the scheme of simulated insanity is precisely the one he would have been likely to hit upon because it enabled him to follow his own bent and to drift with an apparent purpose postponing decisive action by the very means he adopts to arrive at its accomplishment and satisfying himself with the show of doing something that he may escape so much the longer the dreaded necessity of really doing anything at all it enables him to play with life and duty instead of taking them by the rougher side where alone any firm grip is possibleto feel that he is on the way toward accomplishing somewhat when he is really paltering with his own irresolution nothing i think could be more finely imagined than this voltaire complains that he goes mad without any sufficient object or result perfectly true and precisely what was most natural for him to do and accordingly precisely what shakespeare meant that he should do it was delightful to him to indulge his imagination and humor to prove his capacity for something by playing a part the one thing he could not do was to bring himself to act unless when surprised by a sudden impulse of suspicionas where he kills polonius and there he could not see his victim he discourses admirably of suicide but does not kill himself he talks daggers but uses none he puts by the chance to kill the king with the excuse that he will not do it while he is praying lest his soul be saved thereby though it is more than doubtful whether he believed it himself he allows himself to be packed off to england without any motive except that it would for the time take him farther from a present duty the more disagreeable to a nature like his because it was present and not a mere matter for speculative consideration when goethe made his famous comparison of the acorn planted in a vase which it bursts with its growth and says that in like manner hamlet is a nature which breaks down under the weight of a duty too great for it to bear he seems to have considered the character too much from one side had hamlet actually killed himself to escape his too onerous commission goethes conception of him would have been satisfactory enough but hamlet was hardly a sentimentalist like werther on the contrary he saw things only too clearly in the dry northlight of the intellect it is chance that at last brings him to his end it would appear rather that shakespeare intended to show us an imaginative temperament brought face to face with actualities into any clear relation of sympathy with which it cannot bring itself the very means that shakespeare makes use of to lay upon him the obligation of actingthe ghostreally seems to make it all the harder for him to act for the spectre but gives an additional excitement to his imagination and a fresh topic for his scepticism  i shall not attempt to evolve any high moral significance from the play even if i thought it possible for that would be aside from the present purpose the scope of the higher drama is to represent life not everyday life it is true but life lifted above the plane of breadandbutter associations by nobler reaches of language by the influence at once inspiring and modulating of verse by an intenser play of passion condensing that misty mixture of feeling and reflection which makes the ordinary atmosphere of existence into flashes of thought and phrase whose brief but terrible illumination prints the outworn landscape of everyday upon our brains with its little motives and mean results in lines of telltale fire the moral office of tragedy is to show us our own weaknesses idealized in grander figures and more awful resultsto teach us that what we pardon in our selves as venial faults if they seem to have but slight influence on our immediate fortunes have arms as long as those of kings and reach forward to the catastrophe of our lives that they are dryrotting the very fibre of will and conscience so that if we should be brought to the test of a great temptation or a stringent emergency we must be involved in a ruin as sudden and complete as that we shudder at in the unreal scene of the theatre but the primary object of a tragedy is not to inculcate a formal moral representing life it teaches like life by indirection by those nods and winks that are thrown away on us blind horses in such profusion we may learn to be sure plenty of lessons from shakespeare we are not likely to have kingdoms to divide crowns foretold us by weird sisters a fathers death to avenge or to kill our wives from jealousy but lear may teach us to draw the line more clearly between a wise generosity and a loosehanded weakness of giving macbeth how one sin involves another and forever another by a fatal parthenogenesis and that the key which unlocks forbidden doors to our will or passion leaves a stain on the hand that may not be so dark as blood but that will not out hamlet that all the noblest gifts of person temperament and mind slip like sand through the grasp of an infirm purpose othello that the perpetual silt of some one weakness the eddies of a suspicious temper depositing their one impalpable layer after another may build up a shoal on which an heroic life and an otherwise magnanimous nature may bilge and go to pieces all this we may learn and much more and shakespeare was no doubt well aware of all this and more but i do not believe that he wrote his plays with any such didactic purpose he knew human nature too well not to know that one thorn of experience is worth a whole wilderness of warningthat where one man shapes his life by precept and example there are a thousand who have it shaped for them by impulse and by circumstances he did not mean his great tragedies for scarecrows as if the nailing of one hawk to the barndoor would prevent the next from coming down souse into the henyard no it is not the poor bleaching victim hung up to moult its draggled feathers in the rain that he wishes to show us he loves the hawknature as well as the hennature and if he is unequalled in anything it is in that sunny breadth of view that impregnability of reason that looks down all ranks and conditions of men all fortune and misfortune with the equal eye of the pure artist  whether i have fancied anything into hamlet which the author never dreamed of putting there i do not greatly concern myself to inquire poets are always entitled to a royalty on whatever we find in their works for these fine creations as truly build themselves up in the brain as they are built up with deliberate forethought praise art as we will that which the artist did not mean to put into his work but which found itself there by some generous process of nature of which he was as unaware as the blue river is of its rhyme with the blue sky has somewhat in it that snatches us into sympathy with higher things than those which come by plot and observation goethe wrote his faust in its earliest form without a thought of the deeper meaning which the exposition of an age of criticism was to find in it without foremeaning it he had impersonated in mephistopheles the genius of his century shall this subtract from the debt we owe him not at all if originality were conscious of itself it would have lost its right to be original i believe that shakespeare intended to impersonate in hamlet not a mere metaphysical entity but a man of flesh and blood yet it is certainly curious how prophetically typical the character is of that introversion of mind which is so constant a phenomenon of these latter days of that overconsciousness which wastes itself in analyzing the motives of action instead of acting  the old painters had a rule that all compositions should be pyramidal in forma central figure from which the others slope gradually away on the two sides shakespeare probably had never heard of this rule and if he had would not have been likely to respect it more than he has the socalled classical unities of time and place but he understood perfectly the artistic advantages of gradation contrast and relief taking hamlet as the keynote we find in him weakness of character which on the one hand is contrasted with the feebleness that springs from overweening conceit in polonius and with frailty of temperament in ophelia while on the other hand it is brought into fuller relief by the steady force of horatio and the impulsive violence of laertes who is resolute from thoughtlessness just as hamlet is irresolute from overplus of thought  if we must draw a moral from hamlet it would seem to be that will is fate and that will once abdicating the inevitable successor in the regency is chance had hamlet acted instead of musing how good it would be to act the king might have been the only victim as it is all the main actors in the story are the fortuitous sacrifice of his irresolution we see how a single great vice of character at last draws to itself as allies and confederates all other weaknesses of the man as in civil wars the timid and the selfish wait to throw themselves upon the stronger side    in lifes small things be resolute and great   to keep thy muscles trained knowst thou when fate   thy measure takes or when shell say to thee   i find thee worthy do this thing for me  i have said that it was doubtful if shakespeare had any conscious moral intention in his writings i meant only that he was purely and primarily poet and while he was an english poet in a sense that is true of no other his method was thoroughly greek yet with this remarkable differencethat while the greek dramatists took purely national themes and gave them a universal interest by their mode of treatment he took what may be called cosmopolitan traditions legends of human nature and nationalized them by the infusion of his perfectly anglican breadth of character and solidity of understanding wonderful as his imagination and fancy are his perspicacity and artistic discretion are more so this country tradesmans son coming up to london could set highbred wits like beaumont uncopiable lessons in drawing gentlemen such as are seen nowhere else but on the canvas of titian he could take ulysses away from homer and expand the shrewd and crafty islander into a statesman whose words are the pith of history but what makes him yet more exceptional was his utterly unimpeachable judgment and that poise of character which enabled him to be at once the greatest of poets and so unnoticeable a good citizen as to leave no incidents for biography his material was never farsought it is still disputed whether the fullest head of which we have record were cultivated beyond the range of grammarschool precedent but he used it with a poetic instinct which we cannot parallel identified himself with it yet remained always its born and questionless master he finds the clown and fool upon the stagehe makes them the tools of his pleasantry his satire and even his pathos he finds a fading rustic superstition and shapes out of it ideal pucks titanias and ariels in whose existence statesmen and scholars believe forever always poet he subjects all to the ends of his art and gives in hamlet the churchyard ghost but with the cothurnus onthe messenger of gods revenge against murder always philosopher he traces in macbeth the metaphysics of apparitions painting the shadowy banquo only on the oerwrought brain of the murderer and staining the hand of his wifeaccomplice because she was the more refined and higher nature with the disgustful bloodspot that is not there we say he had no moral intention for the reason that as artist it was not his to deal with the realities but only with the shows of things yet with a temperament so just an insight so inevitable as his it was impossible that the moral reality which underlies the mirage of the poets vision should not always be suggested his humor and satire are never of the destructive kind what he does in that way is suggestive onlynot breaking bubbles with thors hammer but puffing them away with the breath of a clown or shivering them with the light laugh of a genial cynic men go about to prove the existence of a god was it a bit of phosphorus that brain whose creations are so real that mixing with them we feel as if we ourselves were but fleeting magiclantern shadows  but higher even than the genius we rate the character of this unique man and the grand impersonality of what he wrote what has he told us of himself in our selfexploiting nineteenth century with its melancholy livercomplaint how serene and high he seems if he had sorrows he has made them the woof of everlasting consolation to his kind and if as poets are wont to whine the outward world was cold to him its biting air did but trace itself in loveliest frostwork of fancy on the many windows of that selfcentred and cheerful soul     footnotes      119 as where ben jonson is able to say          man may securely sin but safely never       120 vulgarem locutionem anpellamus cam qua infantes

and in characters as beneficent as they are enduring in the old world national pride feeds itself with the record of battles and conquestsbattles which proved nothing and settled nothing conquests which shifted a boundary on the map and put one ugly head instead of another on the coin which the people paid to the taxgatherer but wherever the newenglander travels among the sturdy commonwealths which have sprung from the seed of the mayflower churches schools colleges tell him where the men of his race have been or their influence penetrated and an intelligent freedom is the monument of conquests whose results are not to be measured in square miles next to the fugitives whom moses led out of egypt the little shipload of outcasts who landed at plymouth two centuries and a half ago are destined to influence the future of the world the spiritual thirst of mankind has for ages been quenched at hebrew fountains but the embodiment in human institutions of truths uttered by the son of man eighteen centuries ago was to be mainly the work of puritan thought and puritan selfdevotion leave new england out in the cold while you are plotting it she sits by every fireside in the land where there is piety culture and free thought  faith in god faith in man faith in workthis is the short formula in which we may sum up the teaching of the founders of new england a creed ample enough for this life and the next if their municipal regulations smack somewhat of judaism yet there can be no nobler aim or more practical wisdom than theirs for it was to make the law of man a living counterpart of the law of god in their highest conception of it were they too earnest in the strife to save their souls alive that is still the problem which every wise and brave man is lifelong in solving if the devil take a less hateful shape to us than to our fathers he is as busy with us as with them and if we cannot find it in our hearts to break with a gentleman of so much worldly wisdom who gives such admirable dinners and whose manners are so perfect so much the worse for us  looked at on the outside new england history is dry and unpicturesque there is no rustle of silks no waving of plumes no clink of golden spurs our sympathies are not awakened by the changeful destinies the rise and fall of great families whose doom was in their blood instead of all this we have the homespun fates of cephas and prudence repeated in an infinite series of peaceable sameness and finding space enough for record in the family bible we have the noise of axe and hammer and saw an apotheosis of dogged work where reversing the fairytale nothing is left to luck and if there be any poetry it is something that cannot be helpedthe waste of the water over the dam extrinsically it is prosaic and plebeian intrinsically it is poetic and noble for it is perhaps the most perfect incarnation of an idea the world has ever seen that idea was not to found a democracy nor to charter the city of new jerusalem by an act of the general court as gentlemen seem to think whose notions of history and human nature rise like an exhalation from the good things at a pilgrim society dinner not in the least they had no faith in the divine institution of a system which gives teague because he can dig as much influence as ralph because he can think nor in personal at the expense of general freedom their view of human rights was not so limited that it could not take in human relations and duties also they would have been likely to answer the claim i am as good as anybody by a quiet yes for some things but not for others as good doubtless in your place where all things are good what the early settlers of massachusetts did intend and what they accomplished was the founding here of a new england and a better one where the political superstitions and abuses of the old should never have leave to take root so much we may say they deliberately intended no nobles either lay or cleric no great landed estates and no universal ignorance as the seedplot of vice and unreason but an elective magistracy and clergy land for all who would till it and reading and writing will ye nill ye instead here at last it would seem simple manhood is to have a chance to play his stake against fortune with honest dice uncogged by those three hoary sharpers prerogative patricianism and priestcraft whoever has looked into the pamphlets published in england during the great rebellion cannot but have been struck by the fact that the principles and practice of the puritan colony had begun to react with considerable force on the mother country and the policy of the retrograde party there after the restoration in its dealings with new england finds a curious parallel as to its motives time will show whether as to its results in the conduct of the same party towards america during the last four years135 this influence and this fear alike bear witness to the energy of the principles at work here  we have said that the details of new england history were essentially dry and unpoetic everything is near authentic and petty there is no mist of distance to soften outlines no mirage of tradition to give characters and events an imaginative loom so much downright work was perhaps never wrought on the earths surface in the same space of time as during the first forty years after the settlement but mere work is unpicturesque and void of sentiment irving instinctively divined and admirably illustrated in his knickerbocker the humorous element which lies in this nearness of view this clear prosaic daylight of modernness and this poverty of stage properties which makes the actors and the deeds they were concerned in seem ludicrously small when contrasted with the semimythic grandeur in which we have clothed them as we look backward from the crowned result and fancy a cause as majestic as our conception of the effect there was indeed one poetic side to the existence otherwise so narrow and practical and to have conceived this however partially is the one original and american thing in cooper this diviner glimpse illumines the lives of our daniel boones the man of civilization and oldworld ideas confronted with our forest solitudesconfronted too for the first time with his real self and so led gradually to disentangle the original substance of his manhood from the artificial results of culture here was our new adam of the wilderness forced to name anew not the visible creation of god but the invisible creation of man in those forms that lie at the base of social institutions so insensibly moulding personal character and controlling individual action here is the protagonist of our new world epic a figure as poetic as that of achilles as ideally representative as that of don quixote as romantic in its relation to our homespun and plebeian mythus as arthur in his to the mailed and plumed cycle of chivalry we do not mean of course that coopers leatherstocking is all this or anything like it but that the character typified in him is ideally and potentially all this and more  but whatever was poetical in the lives of the early newenglanders had something shy if not sombre about it if their natures flowered it was out of sight like the fern it was in the practical that they showed their true quality as englishmen are wont it has been the fashion lately with a few feebleminded persons to undervalue the new england puritans as if they were nothing more than gloomy and narrowminded fanatics but all the charges brought against these largeminded and farseeing men are precisely those which a really able fanatic joseph de maistre lays at the door of protestantism neither a knowledge of human nature nor of history justifies us in confounding as is commonly done the puritans of old and new england or the english puritans of the third with those of the fifth decade of the seventeenth century fanaticism or to call it by its milder name enthusiasm is only powerful and active so long as it is aggressive establish it firmly in power and it becomes conservatism whether it will or no a sceptre once put in the hand the grip is instinctive and he who is firmly seated in authority soon learns to think security and not progress the highest lesson of statecraft from the summit of power men no longer turn their eyes upward but begin to look about them aspiration sees only one side of every question possession many and the english puritans after their revolution was accomplished stood in even a more precarious position than most successful assailants of the prerogative of whatever is to continue in being they had carried a political end by means of a religious revival the fulcrum on which they rested their lever to overturn the existing order of things as history always placidly calls the particular forms of disorder for the time being was in the soul of man they could not renew the fiery gush of enthusiasm when once the molten metal had begun to stiffen in the mould of policy and precedent the religious element of puritanism became insensibly merged in the political and its one great man taken away it died as passions have done before of possession it was one thing to shout with cromwell before the battle of dunbar now lord arise and let thine enemies be scattered and to snuffle rise lord and keep us safe in our benefices our sequestered estates and our five per cent puritanism meant something when captain hodgson riding out to battle through the morning mist turns over the command of his troop to a lieutenant and stays to hear the prayer of a cornet there was so much of god in it become traditional repeating the phrase without the spirit reading the present backward as if it were written in hebrew translating jehovah by i was instead of i amit was no more like its former self than the hollow drum made of ziscas skin was like the grim captain whose soul it had once contained  yet the change was inevitable for it is not safe to confound the things of caesar with the things of god some honest republicans like ludlow were never able to comprehend the chilling contrast between the ideal aim and the material fulfilment and looked askance on the strenuous reign of oliverthat rugged boulder of primitive manhood lying lonely there on the dead level of the centuryas if some crooked changeling had been laid in the cradle instead of that fair babe of the commonwealth they had dreamed truly there is a tide in the affairs of men but there is no gulfstream setting forever in one direction and those waves of enthusiasm on whose crumbling crests we sometimes see nations lifted for a gleaming moment are wont to have a gloomy trough before and behind  but the founders of new england though they must have sympathized vividly with the struggles and triumphs of their brethren in the mother country were never subjected to the same trials and temptations never hampered with the same lumber of usages and tradition they were not driven to win power by doubtful and desperate ways nor to maintain it by any compromises of the ends which make it worth having from the outset they were builders without need of first pulling down whether to make room or to provide material for thirty years after the colonization of the bay they had absolute power to mould as they would the character of their adolescent commonwealth during this time a whole generation would have grown to manhood who knew the old world only by report in whose habitual thought kings nobles and bishops would be as far away from all present and practical concern as the figures in a fairytale and all whose memories and associations all their unconscious training by eye and ear were new english wholly nor were the men whose influence was greatest in shaping the framework and the policy of the colony in any true sense of the word fanatics enthusiasts perhaps they were but with then the fermentation had never gone further than the ripeness of the vinous stage disappointment had never made it acetous nor had it ever putrefied into the turbid zeal of fifth monarchism and sectarian whimsey there is no better ballast for keeping the mind steady on its keel and saving it from all risk of crankiness than business and they were business men men of facts and figures no less than of religious earnestness the sum of two hundred thousand pounds had been invested in their undertakinga sum for that time truly enormous as the result of private combination for a doubtful experiment that their enterprise might succeed they must show a balance on the right side of the countinghouse ledger as well as in their private accounts with their own souls the liberty of praying when and how they would must be balanced with an ability of paying when and as they ought nor is the resulting fact in this case at variance with the a priori theory they succeeded in making their thought the life and soul of a body politic still powerful still benignly operative after two centuries a thing which no mere fanatic ever did or ever will accomplish sober earnest and thoughtful men it was no utopia no new atlantis no realization of a splendid dream which they had at heart but the establishment of the divine principle of authority on the common interest and the common consent the making by a contribution from the freewill of all a power which should curb and guide the freewill of each for the general good if they were stern in their dealings with sectaries it should be remembered that the colony was in fact the private property of the massachusetts company that unity was essential to its success and that john of leyden had taught them how unendurable by the nostrils of honest men is the corruption of the right of private judgment in the evil and selfish hearts of men when no thorough mental training has developed the understanding and given the judgment its needful means of comparison and correction they knew that liberty in the hands of feebleminded and unreasoning persons and all the worse if they are honest means nothing more than the supremacy of their particular form of imbecility means nothing less therefore than downright chaos a bedlamchaos of monomaniacs and bores what was to be done with men and women who bore conclusive witness to the fall of man by insisting on walking up the broadaisle of the meetinghouse in a costume which that event had put forever out of fashion about their treatment of witches too there has been a great deal of ignorant babble puritanism had nothing whatever to do with it they acted under a delusion which with an exception here and there and those mainly medical men like wierus and webster darkened the understanding of all christendom dr henry more was no puritan and his letter to glanvil prefixed to the third edition of the sadducismus triumphatus was written in 1678 only fourteen years before the trials at  salem bekkers bezauberte welt was published in 1693 and in the preface he speaks of the difficulty of overcoming the prejudices in which not only ordinary men but the learned also are obstinate in hathaways case 1702 chiefjustice holt in charging the jury expresses no disbelief in the possibility of witchcraft and the indictment implies its existence indeed the natural reaction from the salem mania of 1692 put an end to belief in devilish compacts and demoniac possessions sooner in new england than elsewhere the last we hear of it there is in 1720 when rev mr turell of medford detected and exposed an attempted cheat by two girls even in 1692 it was the foolish breath of cotton mather and others of the clergy that blew the dying embers of this ghastly superstition into a flame and they were actuated partly by a desire to bring about a religious revival which might stay for a while the hastening lapse of their own authority and still more by that credulous scepticism of feebleminded piety which dreads the cutting away of an orthodox tumor of misbelief as if the lifeblood of faith would follow and would keep even a stumblingblock in the way of salvation if only enough generations had tripped over it to make it venerable the witches were condemned on precisely the same grounds that in our day led to the condemnation of essays and reviews  but puritanism was already in the decline when such things were possible what had been a wondrous and intimate experience of the soul a flash into the very crypt and basis of mans nature from the fire of trial had become ritual and tradition in prosperous times the faith of one generation becomes the formality of the next the necessity of a reformation set forth by order of the synod which met at cambridge in 1679 though no doubt overstating the case shows how much even at that time the ancient strictness had been loosened the country had grown rich its commerce was large and wealth did its natural work in making life softer and more worldly commerce in deprovincializing the minds of those engaged in it but puritanism had already done its duty as there are certain creatures whose whole being seems occupied with an egglaying errand they are sent upon incarnate ovipositors their bodies but bags to hold this precious deposit their legs of use only to carry them where they may safeliest be rid of it so sometimes a generation seems to have no other end than the conception and ripening of certain germs its blind stirrings its apparently aimless seeking hither and thither are but the driving of an instinct to be done with its parturient function toward these principles of future life and power puritanism believing itself quick with the seed of religious liberty laid without knowing it the egg of democracy the english puritans pulled down church and state to rebuild zion on the ruins and all the while it was not zion but america they were building but if their millennium went by like the rest and left men still human if they like so many saints and martyrs before them listened in vain for the sound of that trumpet which was to summon all souls to a resurrection from the body of this death which men call lifeit is not for us at least to forget the heavy debt we owe them it was the drums of naseby and dunbar that gathered the minutemen on lexington common it was the red dint of the axe on charless block that marked one in our era the puritans had their faults they were narrow ungenial they could not understand the text i have piped to you and ye have not danced nor conceive that saving ones soul should be the cheerfullest and not the dreariest of businesses their preachers had a way like the painful mr perkins of pronouncing the word damn with such an emphasis as left a doleful echo in their auditors ears a good while after and it was natural that men who captained or accompanied the exodus from existing forms and associations into the doubtful wilderness that led to the promised land should find more to their purpose in the old testament than in the new as respects the new england settlers however visionary some of their religious tenets may have been their political ideas savored of the realty and it was no nephelococcygia of which they drew the plan but of a commonwealth whose foundation was to rest on solid and familiar earth if what they did was done in a corner the results of it were to be felt to the ends of the earth and the figure of winthrop should be as venerable in history as that of romulus is barbarously grand in legend  i am inclined to think that many of our national characteristics which are sometimes attributed to climate and sometimes to institutions are traceable to the influences of puritan descent we are apt to forget how very large a proportion of our population is descended from emigrants who came over before 1660 those emigrants were in great part representatives of that element of english character which was most susceptible of religious impressions in other words the most earnest and imaginative our people still differ from their english cousins as they are fond of calling themselves when they are afraid we may do them a mischief in a certain capacity for enthusiasm a devotion to abstract principle an openness to ideas a greater aptness for intuitions than for the slow processes of the syllogism and as derivative from this in minds of looser texture a lightarmed skirmishing habit of thought and a positive preference of the birds in the bushan excellent quality of character before you have your bird in the hand  there have been two great distributing centres of the english race on this continent massachusetts and virginia each has impressed the character of its early legislators on the swarms it has sent forth their ideas are in some fundamental respects the opposites of each other and we can only account for it by an antagonism of thought beginning with the early framers of their respective institutions new england abolished caste in virginia they still talk of quality folks but it was in making education not only common to all but in some sense compulsory on all that the destiny of the free republics of america was practically settled every man was to be trained not only to the use of arms but of his wits also and it is these which alone make the others effective weapons for the maintenance of freedom you may disarm the hands but not the brains of a people and to know what should be defended is the first condition of successful defence simple as it seems it was a great discovery that the key of knowledge could turn both ways that it could open as well as lock the door of power to the many the only things a newenglander was ever locked out of were the jails it is quite true that our republic is the heir of the english commonwealth but as we trace events backward to their causes we shall find it true also that what made our revolution a foregone conclusion was that act of the general court passed in may 1647 which established the system of common schools to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers in church and commonwealth the lord assisting our endeavors it is therefore ordered by this court and authority thereof that every township in this jurisdiction after the lord hath increased them to fifty householders shall then forthwith appoint one within their towns to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read  passing through some massachusetts village perhaps at a distance from any house it may be in the midst of a piece of woods where four roads meet one may sometimes even yet see a small square onestory building whose use would not be long doubtful it is summer and the flickering shadows of forestleaves dapple the roof of the little porch whose door stands wide and shows hanging on either hand rows of straw hats and bonnets that look as if they had done good service as you pass the open windows you hear whole platoons of highpitched voices discharging words of two or three syllables with wonderful precision and unanimity then there is a pause and the voice of the officer in command is heard reproving some raw recruit whose vocal musket hung fire then the drill of the small infantry begins anew but pauses again because some urchinwho agrees with voltaire that the superfluous is a very necessary thinginsists on spelling subtraction with an s too much  if you had the good fortune to be born and bred in the bay state your mind is thronged with halfsad halfhumorous recollections the ab abs of little voices long since hushed in the mould or ringing now in the pulpit at the bar or in the senatechamber come back to the ear of memory you remember the high stool on which culprits used to be elevated with the tall paper foolscap on their heads blushing to the ears and you think with wonder how you have seen them since as men climbing the worlds penancestools of ambition without a blush and gladly giving everything for lifes caps and bells and you have pleasanter memories of going after pondlilies of angling for hornpoutsthat queer bat among the fishesof nutting of walking over the creaking snowcrust in winter when the warm breath of every household was curling up silently in the keen blue air you wonder if life has any rewards more solid and permanent than the spanish dollar that was hung around your neck to be restored again next day and conclude sadly that it was but too true a prophecy and emblem of all worldly success but your moralizing is broken short off by a rattle of feet and the pouring forth of the whole swarmthe boys dancing and shoutingthe mere effervescence of the fixed air of youth and animal spirits uncorkedthe sedater girls in confidential twos and threes decanting secrets out of the mouth of one capebonnet into that of another times have changed since the jackets and trousers used to draw up on one side of the road and the petticoats on the other to salute with bow and courtesy the white neckcloth of the parson or the squire if it chanced to pass during intermission  now this little building and others like it were an original kind of fortification invented by the founders of new england they are the martellotowers that protect our coast this was the great discovery of our puritan forefathers they were the first lawgivers who saw clearly and enforced practically the simple moral and political truth that knowledge was not an alms to be dependent on the chance charity of private men or the precarious pittance of a trustfund but a sacred debt which the commonwealth owed to every one of her children the opening of the first grammarschool was the opening of the first trench against monopoly in church and state the first row of trammels and pothooks which the little shearjashubs and elkanahs blotted and blubbered across their copybooks was the preamble to the declaration of independence the men who gave every man the chance to become a landholder who made the transfer of land easy and put knowledge within the reach of all have been called narrowminded because they were intolerant but intolerant of what of what they believed to be dangerous nonsense which if left free would destroy the last hope of civil and religious freedom they had not come here that every man might do that which seemed good in his own eyes but in the sight of god toleration moreover is something which is won not granted it is the equilibrium of neutralized forces the puritans had no notion of tolerating mischief they looked upon their little commonwealth as upon their own private estate and homestead as they had a right to do and would no more allow the devils religion of unreason to be preached therein than we should permit a prizefight in our gardens they were narrow in other words they had an edge to them as men that serve in great emergencies must for a gordian knot is settled sooner with a sword than a beetle  the founders of new england are commonly represented in the afterdinner oratory of their descendants as men before their time as it is called in other words deliberately prescient of events resulting from new relations of circumstances or even from circumstances new in themselves and therefore altogether alien from their own experience of course such a class of men is to be reckoned among those nonexistent human varieties so gravely catalogued by the ancient naturalists if a man could shape his action with reference to what should happen a century after his death surely it might be asked of him to call in the help of that easier foreknowledge which reaches from one day to the nexta power of prophecy whereof we have no example i do not object to a wholesome pride of ancestry though a little mythical if it be accompanied with the feeling that noblesse oblige and do not result merely in a placid selfsatisfaction with our own mediocrity as if greatness like righteousness could be imputed we can pardon it even in conquered races like the welsh and irish who make up to themselves for present degradation by imaginary empires in the past whose boundaries they can extend at will carrying the bloodless conquests of fancy over regions laid down upon no map and concerning which authentic history is enviously dumb those long beadrolls of keltic kings cannot tyrannize over us and we can be patient so long as our own crowns are uncracked by the shillalah sceptres of their actual representatives in our own case it would not be amiss perhaps if we took warning by the example of teague and taffy at least i think it would be wise in our orators not to put forward so prominently the claim of the yankee to universal dominion and his intention to enter upon it forthwith if we do our duties as honestly and as much in the fear of god as our forefathers did we need not trouble ourselves much about other titles to empire the broad foreheads and long heads will win the day at last in spite of all heraldry and it will be enough if we feel as keenly as our puritan founders did that those organs of empire may be broadened and lengthened by culture136 that our selfcomplacency should not increase the complacency of outsiders is not to be wondered at as we sometimes take credit to ourselves since all commendation of our ancestry is indirect selfflattery for what the puritans fathers never were so there are others who to gratify a spite against their descendants blame them for not having been what they could not be namely before their time in such matters as slavery witchcraft and the like the view whether of friend or foe is equally unhistorical nay without the faintest notion of all that makes history worth having as a teacher that our grandfathers shared in the prejudices of their day is all that makes them human to us and that nevertheless they could act bravely and wisely on occasion makes them only the more venerable if certain barbarisms and superstitions disappeared earlier in new england than elsewhere not by the decision of exceptionally enlightened or humane judges but by force of public opinion that is the fact that is interesting and instructive for us i never thought it an abatement of hawthornes genius that he came lineally from one who sat in judgment on the witches in 1692 it was interesting rather to trace something hereditary in the sombre character of his imagination continually vexing itself to account for the origin of evil and baffled for want of that simple solution in a personal devil  but i have no desire to discuss the merits or demerits of the puritans having long ago learned the wisdom of saving my sympathy for more modern objects than hecuba my object is to direct the attention of my readers to a collection of documents where they may see those worthies as they were in their daily living and thinking the collections of our various historical and antiquarian societies can hardly be said to be published in the strict sense of the word and few consequently are aware how much they contain of interest for the general reader no less than the special student the several volumes of winthrop papers in especial are a mine of entertainment here we have the puritans painted by themselves and while we arrive at a truer notion of the characters of some among them and may accordingly sacrifice to that dreadful superstition of being usefully employed which makes so many bores and bored we can also furtively enjoy the oddities of thought and speech the humors of the time which our local historians are too apt to despise as inconsidered trifles for myself i confess myself heretic to the established theory of the gravity of history and am not displeased with an opportunity to smile behind my hand at any ludicrous interruption of that sometimes wearisome ceremonial i am not sure that i would not sooner give up raleigh spreading his cloak to keep the royal dians feet from the mud than that awful judgment upon the courtier whose atlantean thighs leaked away in bran through the rent in his trunkhose the painful fact that fisher had his head cut off is somewhat mitigated to me by the circumstance that the pope should have sent him of all things in the world a cardinals hat after that incapacitation theology herself becomes less unamiable to me when i find the supreme pontiff writing to the council of trent that they should begin with original sin maintaining yet a due respect for the emperor that infallibility should thus courtesy to decorum shall make me think better of it while i live i shall accordingly endeavor to give my readers what amusement i can leaving it to themselves to extract solid improvement from the volumes before us which include a part of the correspondence of three generations of winthrops  let me premise that there are two men above all others for whom our respect is heightened by these lettersthe elder john winthrop and roger williams winthrop appears throughout as a truly magnanimous and noble man in an unobtrusive waya kind of greatness that makes less noise in the world but is on the whole more solidly satisfying than most othersa man who has been dipped in the river of god a surer baptism than styx or dragons blood till his character is of perfect proof and who appears plainly as the very soul and life of the young colony very reverend and godly he truly was and a respect not merely ceremonious but personal a respect that savors of love shows itself in the letters addressed to him charity and tolerance flow so naturally from the pen of williams that it is plain they were in his heart he does not show himself a very strong or very wise man but a thoroughly gentle and good one his affection for the two winthrops is evidently of the warmest we suspect that he lived to see that there was more reason in the drumhead religious discipline which made him against his will the founder of a commonwealth than he may have thought at first but for the fanaticism as it is the fashion to call the sagacious straitness of the abler men who knew how to root the english stock firmly in this new soil on either side of him his little plantation could never have existed and he himself would have been remembered only if at all as one of the jarring atoms in a chaos of otherwisemindedness  two other men emanuel downing and hugh peter leave a positively unpleasant savor in the nostrils each is selfish in his own waydowning with the shrewdness of an attorney peter with that clerical unction which in a vulgar nature so easily degenerates into greasiness neither of them was the man for a forlorn hope and both returned to england when the civil war opened prospect of preferment there both we suspect were inclined to value their puritanism for its rewards in this world rather than the next downings son sir george was basely prosperous making the good cause pay him so long as it was solvent and then selling out in season to betray his old commander colonel okey to the shambles at charing cross peter became a colonel in the parliaments army and under the protectorate one of cromwells chaplains on his trial after the restoration he made a poor figure in striking contrast to some of the brave men who suffered with him at his execution a shocking brutality was shown when mr cook was cut down and brought to be quartered one they called colonel turner calling to the sheriffs men to bring mr peters near that he might see it and by and by the hangman came to him all besmeared in blood and rubbing his bloody hands together he tauntingly asked come how do you like this mr peters how do you like this work137 this colonel turner can hardly have been other than the one who four years later came to the hangmans hands for robbery and whose behavior both in the dock and at the gallows makes his trial one of the most entertaining as a display of character peter would seem to have been one of those men gifted with what is sometimes called eloquence that is the faculty of stating things powerfully from momentary feeling and not from that conviction of the higher reason which alone can give force and permanence to words his letters show him subject like others of like temperament to fits of hypocondriacal melancholy and the only witness he called on his trial was to prove that he was confined to his lodgings by such an attack on the day of the kings beheading he seems to have been subject to this malady at convenience as some women to hysterics honest john endicott plainly had small confidence in him and did not think him the right man to represent the colony in england there is a droll resolve in the massachusetts records by which he is desired to write to holland for 500l worth of peter  40l worth of match it is with a match that we find him burning his fingers in the present correspondence  peter seems to have entangled himself somehow with a mrs deliverance sheffield whether maid or widow nowhere appears but presumably the latter the following statement of his position is amusing enough i have sent mrs d sh letter which puts mee to new troubles for though shee takes liberty upon my cossen downings speeches yet good sir let mee not be a foole in israel i had many good answers to yesterdays worke a fast and amongst the rest her letter which if her owne doth argue more wisedome than i thought shee had you have often sayd i could not leave her what to doe is very considerable could i with comfort  credit desist this seemes best could i goe on  content myselfe that were good for though i now seeme free agayne yet the depth i know not had shee come over with me i thinke i had bin quieter this shee may know that i have sought god earnestly that the nexte weeke i shall bee riperi doubt shee gaynes most by such writings  shee deserves most where shee is further of if you shall amongst you advise mee to write to hir i shall forthwith our towne lookes upon mee contracted  so i have sayd myselfe what wonder the charge change would make i know not again still pardon my offensive boldnes i know not well whither mrs sh have set mee at liberty or not my conclusion is that if you find i cannot make an honorable retreat then i shall desire to advance greek sun theo of you i now expect your last advise viz whither i must goe on or of saluo evangelij honore if shee bee in good earnest to leave all agitations this way then i stand still  wayt gods mind concerning mee if i had much mony i would part with it to her free till wee heare what england doth supposing i may bee called to some imployment that will not suit a marryed estate here another mode of escape presents itself and he goes on for indeed sir some must looke out  i have very strong thoughts to speake with the duitch governor  lay some way there for a supply c at the end of the letter an objection to the lady herself occurs to him once more for mrs sh i had from mr hibbins  others her fellowpassengers sad discouragements where they saw her in her trim i would not come of with dishonor nor come on with griefe or ominous hesitations on all this shillyshally we have a shrewd comment in a letter of endicott i cannot but acquaint you with my thoughts concerning mr peter since hee receaued a letter from mrs sheffield which was yesterday in the eveninge after the fast shee seeming in her letter to abate of her affeccions towards him  dislikinge to come to salem vppon such termes as he had written i finde now that hee begins to play her parte  if i mistake not you will see him as greatly in loue with her if shee will but hold of a little as euer shee was with him but he conceales it what he can as yett the begininge of the next weeke you will heare further from him the widow was evidently more than a match for poor peter  it should appear that a part of his trouble arose from his having coquetted also with a certain mrs ruth about whom he was dealt with by mrs amee mr phillips  2 more of the church our elder being one when mr phillips with much violence  sharpnes charged mee home  that i should hinder the mayd of a match at london which was not so could not thinke of any kindnes i euer did her though shee haue had above 300li through my fingers so as if god uphold me not after an especiall manner it will sinke me surely  hee told me he would not stop my intended marriage but assured mee it would not bee good  all which makes mee reflect upon my rash proceedings with mrs sh panurges doubts and difficulties about matrimony were not more entertainingly contradictory of course peter ends by marrying the widow and presently we have a comment on her trim in january 1639 he writes to winthrop my wife is very thankfull for her apples  desires much the new fashioned shooes eight years later we find him writing from england where he had been two years i am coming over if i must my wife comes of necessity to new england having run her selfe out of breath here and then in the postscript bee sure you never let my wife come away from thence without my leave  then you love mee but life is never pure comedy and the end in this case is tragical roger williams after his return from england in 1654 writes to john winthrop jr your brother flourisheth in good esteeme  is eminent for maintaining the freedome of the conscience as to matters of beliefe religion  worship your father peters preacheth the same doctrine though not so zealously as some years since yet cries out against new english rigidities  persecutions their civil injuries  wrongs to himselfe  their unchristian dealing with him in excommunicating his distracted wife all this he tould me in his lodgings at whitehall those lodgings which i was tould were canterburies the archbishop but he himselfe tould me that that library wherein we were together was canterburies  given him by the parliament his wife lives from him not wholy but much distracted he tells me he had but 200 a yeare  he allowed her 4 score per annum of it surely sir the most holy lord is most wise in all the trialls he exerciseth his people with he tould me that his affliction from his wife stird him up to action abroad  when successe tempted him to pride the bitternes in his bozomecomforts was a cooler  a bridle to him truly the whirligig of time brings about strange revenges peter had been driven from england by the persecutions of laud a few years later he stood armed on the scaffold when that prelate was beheaded and now we find him installed in the archiepiscopal lodgings dr palfrey it appears to me gives altogether too favorable an opinion both of peters character and abilities i conceive him to have been a vain and selfish man he may have had the bravery of passionate impulse but he wanted that steady courage of character which has such a beautiful constancy in winthrop he always professed a longing to come back to new england but it was only a way he had of talking that he never meant to come is plain from these letters nay when things looked prosperous in england he writes to the younger winthrop my counsell is you should come hither with your family for certaynly you will bee capable of a comfortable living in this free commonwealth i doo seriously advise it g downing is worth 500l per annum but 4l per diemyour brother stephen worth 2000l  a maior i pray come but when he is snugly ensconced in whitehall and may be presumed to have some influence with the prevailing powers his zeal cools i wish you  all friends to stay there  rather looke to the west indyes if they remoue for many are here to seeke when they come ouer to me peters highest promotion seems to have been that he walked with john milton at the protectors funeral he was i suspect one of those men to borrow a charitable phrase of roger williams who feared god in the main that is whenever it was not personally inconvenient william coddington saw him in his glory in 1651 soe wee toucke the tyme to goe to viset mr petters at his chamber i was mery with him  called him the arch bp of canterberye in regard to his adtendance by ministers  gentlemen  it passed very well considering certain charges brought against peter though he is said when under sentence of death to have denied the truth of them coddingtons statement that he liked to have gentlewomen waite of him in his lodgings has not a pleasant look one last report of him we get september 1659 in a letter of john davenportthat mr hugh peters is distracted  under sore horrors of conscience crying out of himselfe as damned  confessing haynous actings  occasionally these letters give us interesting glimpses of persons and things in england in the letter of williams just cited there is a lesson for all parties raised to power by exceptional causes surely sir youre father  all the people of god in england  are now in the sadle  at the helme so high that non datus descensus nisi cadendo some cheere up their spirits with the impossibilitie of another fall or turne so doth major g harrison  a very gallant most deserving heavenly man but most highflowne for the kingdom of the saints  the 5th monarchie now risen  their sun never to set againe c others as to my knowledge the protector  are not so full of that faith of miracles but still imagine changes  persecutions  the very slaughter of the witnesses before that glorious morning so much desired of a worldly kingdome if ever such a kingdome as literally it is by so many expounded be to arise in this present world  dispensation poor general harrison lived to be one of the witnesses so slaughtered the practical good sense of cromwell is worth noting the english understanding struggling against judaic trammels williams gives us another peep through the keyhole of the past it pleased the lord to call me for some time  with some persons to practice the hebrew the greeke latine french  dutch the secretarie of the councell mr milton for my dutch i read him read me many more languages grammar rules begin to be esteemed a tyrannie i taught 2 young gentlemen a parliament mans sons as we teach our children english by words phrazes  constant talke c it is plain that milton had talked over with williams the theory put forth in his tract on education and made a convert of him we could wish that the good baptist had gone a little more into particulars but which of us knows among the men he meets whom time will dignify by curtailing him of the mr and reducing him to a bare patronymic as being a kind by himself we have a glance or two at oliver who is always interesting the late renowned oliver confest to me in close discourse about the protestants aifaires c that he yet feard great persecutions to the protestants from the romanists before the downfall of the papacie writes williams in 1660 this close discourse must have been six years before when williams was in england within a year after oliver interfered to some purpose in behalf of the protestants of piedmont and mr milton wrote his famous sonnet of the war with spain williams reports from his letters out of england in 1656 this diversion against the spaniard hath turnd the face  thoughts of many english so that the saying now is crowne the protector with gould138 though the sullen yet cry crowne him with thornes  again in 1654 i know the protector had strong thoughts of hispaniola  cuba mr cottons interpreting of euphrates to be the west indies the supply of gold to take off taxes  the provision of a warmer diverticulum  receptaculum then n england is will make a footing into those parts very precious  if it shall please god to vouchsafe successe to this fleete i looke to hear of an invitation at least to these parts for removall from his highnes who lookes on n e only with an eye of pitie as poore cold  useless the mixture of euphrates and taxes of the transcendental and practical prophecy taking precedence of thrift is characteristic and recalls cromwells famous rule of fearing god and keeping your powder dry in one of the protectors speeches139 he insists much on his wish to retire to a private life there is a curious confirmation of his sincerity in a letter of william hooke then belonging to his household dated the 13th of april 1657 the question of the kingly title was then under debate and hookes account of the matter helps to a clearer understanding of the reasons for cromwells refusing the title the protector is urged utrinque  i am ready to think willing enough to betake himself to a private life if it might be he is a godly man much in prayer  good discourses delighting in good men  good ministers selfdenying  ready to promote any good work for christ140 on the 5th of february 1654 captain john mason of pequot memory writes a word or twoe of newes as it comes from mr eaton viz that the parliament sate in september last they chose their old speaker  clarke the protectour told them they were a free parliament  soe left them that day they considering where the legislative power resided concluded to vote it on the morrow  to take charge of the militia the protectour hereing of it sent for some numbers of horse went to the parliament house nayld up the doores sent for them to the painted chamber told them they should attend the lawes established  that he would wallow in his blood before he would part with what was conferd upon him tendering them an oath 140 engaged now it is curious that mr eaton himself from whom mason got his news wrote only two days before an account differing in some particulars and especially in tone from masons of the speech he says that it gave such satisfaction that about 200 have since ingaged to owne the present government yet carlyle gives the same number of signers 140 as mason and there is a sentence in cromwells speech as reported by carlyle of precisely the same purport as that quoted by mason to me that wallow in my blood has rather more of the cromwellian ring in it more of the quality of spontaneous speech than the rolled into my grave and buried with infamy of the official reporter john haynes 24th july 1653 reports newes from england of astonishing nature concerning the dissolution of the rump we quote his story both as a contemporaneous version of the event and as containing some particulars that explain the causes that led to it it differs in some respects from carlyle and is hardly less vivid as a picture the parliament of england  councell of state are both dissolved by whom  the manner this the lord cromwell generall went to the house  asked the speaker  bradshaw by what power they sate ther they answered by the same power that he woare his sword hee replied they should know they did not  said they should sitt noe longer demanding an account of the vast sommes of money they had received of the commons they said the matter was of great consequence  they would give him accompt in tenn dayes he said noe they had sate too long already  might now take their ease for ther inriching themselves  impoverishing the commons  then seazed uppon all the records immediatly lambert livetenant generall  hareson maior generall for they two were with him tooke the speaker lenthall by the hands lift him out of the chaire  ledd him out of the house  commanded the rest to depart which fortwith was obeied  the generall tooke the keyes  locked the doore he then goes on to give the reasons assigned by different persons for the act some said that the general scented their purpose to declare themselves perpetual and to get rid of him by ordering him to scotland others say this that the cries of the oppressed proveiled much with him  hastned the declaracion of that ould principle salus populi suprema lex c the general in the heat of his wrath himself snatching the keys and locking the door has a look of being drawn from the life cromwell in a letter to general fortescue november1655 speaks sharply of the disorders and debauchedness profaneness and wickedness commonly practised amongst the army sent out to the west indies major mason gives us a specimen it is here reported that some of the soldiers belonging to the ffleet at boston ffell upon the watch after some bickering they comanded them to goe before the governour they retorned that they were cromwells boyes have we not in these days heard of shermans boys  belonging properly to the winthrop papers but printed in an earlier volume third series vol i pp 185198 is a letter of john maidstone which contains the best summary of the civil war that i ever read indeed it gives a clearer insight into its causes and a better view of the vicissitudes of the commonwealth and protectorate than any one of the more elaborate histories there is a singular equity and absence of party passion in it which gives us faith in the authors judgment he was olivers steward of the household and his portrait of him as that of an eminently fairminded man who knew him well is of great value carlyle has not copied it and as many of my readers may never have seen it i reproduce it here before i pass further pardon me in troubling you with the character of his person which by reason of my nearness to him i had opportunity well to observe his body was well compact and strong his stature under six feet i believe about two inches his head so shaped as you might see it a storehouse and shop both of a vast treasury of natural parts his temper exceeding fiery as i have known but the flame of it kept down for the most part or soon allayed with those moral endowments he had he was naturally compassionate towards objects in distress even to an effeminate measure though god had made him a heart wherein was left little room for any fear but what was due to himself of which there was a large proportion yet did he exceed in tenderness toward sufferers a larger soul i think hath seldom dwelt in a house of clay than his was i do believe if his story were impartially transmitted and the unprejudiced world well possessed with it she would add him to her nine worthies and make that number a decemviri he lived and died in comfortable communion with god as judicious persons near him well observed he was that mordecai that sought the welfare of his people and spake peace to his seed yet were his temptations such as it appeared frequently that he that hath grace enough for many men may have too little for himself the treasure he had being but in an earthen vessel and that equally defiled with original sin as any other mans nature is there are phrases here that may be matched with the choicest in the life of agricola and indeed the whole letter superior to tacitus in judicial fairness of tone goes abreast of his best writing in condensation nay surpasses it in this that while in tacitus the intensity is of temper here it is the clear residuum left by the ferment and settling of thought just before speaking of the dissolution of olivers last parliament maidstone says that was the last which sat during his life he being compelled to wrestle with the difficulties of his place so well as he could without parliamentary assistance and in it met with so great a burthen as i doubt not to say it drank up his spirits of which his natural constitution yielded a vast stock and brought him to his grave his interment being the seedtime of his glory and englands calamity hooke in a letter of april 16 1658 has a passage worth quoting the dissolucion of the last parliament puts the supreme powers upon difficulties though the trueth is the nacion is so ill spirited that little good is to be expected from these generall assemblies they the supreme powers to wit cromwell have been much in counsell since this disappointment  god hath been sought by them in the effectuall sense of the need of help from heaven  of the extreme danger impendent on a miscarriage of their advises but our expences are so vast that i know not how they can avoyde a recurrence to another session  to make a further tryall the land is full of discontents  the cavaleerish party doth still expect a day  nourish hopes of a revolucion the quakers do still proceed  are not yet come to their period the presbyterians do abound i thinke more than ever  are very bold  confident because some of their masterpieces lye unanswered particularly theire jus divinum regiminis ecclesiastici which i have sent to mr davenporte it hath been extant without answer these many years only four brother hooke if we may trust the titlepage the anabaptists abound likewise  mr tombes hath pretended to have answered all the bookes extant against his opinion i saw him presenting it to the protectour of late the episcopall men ply the commonprayer booke with much more boldness then ever since these turnes of things even in the open face of the city in severall places i have spoken of it to the protectour but as yet nothing is done in order to their being suppressed it should teach us to distrust the apparent size of objects which is a mere cheat of their nearness to us that we are so often reminded of how small account things seem to one generation for which another was ready to die a copy of the jus divinum held too close to the eyes could shut out the universe with its infinite chances and changes its splendid indifference to our ephemeral fates cromwell we should gather had found out the secret of this historical perspective to distinguish between the blaze of a burning tarbarrel and the final conflagration of all things he had learned tolerance by the possession of powera proof of his capacity for rule in 1652 haynes writes ther was a catechise lately in print ther that denied the divinity of christ yett ther was motions in the house by some to have it lycenced by authority cromwell mainly oposed  at last it was voted to bee burnt which causes much discontent of somme six years had made cromwell wiser  one more extract from a letter of hookes 30th march 1659 is worth giving after speaking of olivers death he goes on to say many prayers were put up solemnly for his life  some of great  good note were too confident that he would not die i suppose himselfe had thoughts that he should have outlived this sickness till near his dissolution perhaps a day or two before which i collect partly by some words which he was said to speak   partly from his delaying almost to the last to nominate his successor to the wonderment of many who began sooner to despair of his life his eldest son succeedeth him being chosen by the council the day following his fathers death whereof he had no expectation i have heard him say he had thought to have lived as a country gentleman  that his father had not employed him in such a way as to prepare him for such employment which he thought he did designedly i suppose his meaning was lest it should have been apprehended ha had prepared  appointed him for such a place the burthen whereof i have several times heard him complaining under since his coming to the government the weighty occasions whereof with continuall oppressing cares had drunk up his fathers spirits in whose body very little blood was found when he was opened the greatest defect visible was in his heart which was flaccid  shrunk together yet he was one that could bear much without complaining as one of a strong constitution of brain as appeared when he was dissected  likewise of body his son seemeth to be of another frame soft  tender  penetrable with easier cares by much yet he is of a sweete countenance vivacious  candid as is the whole frame of his spirit only naturally inclined to choler his reception of multitudes of addresses from towns cities  counties doth declare among several other indiciums more of ability in him than could ordinarily have been expected from him he spake also with general acceptation  applause when he made his speech before the parliament even far beyond the lord fynes141  if this assembly miss it we are like to be in an ill condition the old ways  customs of england as to worshipe are in the hearts of the most who long to see the days again which once they saw the hearts of very many are for the house of the stewarts  there is a speech as if they would attempt to call the late kings judges into question the city i hear is full of cavaliers poor richard appears to have inherited little of his father but the inclination to choler that he could speak far beyond the lord fynes seems to have been not much to the purpose rhetoric was not precisely the medicine for such a case as he had to deal with such were the glimpses which the new england had of the old ishmael must erelong learn to shift for himself  the temperance question agitated the fathers very much as it still does the children we have never seen the antiprohibition argument stated more cogently than in a letter of thomas shepard minister of cambridge to winthrop in 1639 this also i doe humbly intreat that there may be no sin made of drinking in any case one to another for i am confident he that stands here will fall  be beat from his grounds by his own arguments as also that the consequences will be very sad and the thing provoking to god  man to make more sins than as yet is seene god himself hath made a principle as wise now as it was then our ancestors were also harassed as much as we by the difficulties of domestic service in a country where land might be had for the asking it was not easy to keep hold of servants brought over from england emanuel downing always the hard practical man would find a remedy in negro slavery a warr with the narraganset he writes to winthrop in 1645 is verie considerable to this plantation ffor i doubt whither it be not synne in us having power in our hands to suffer them to maynteyne the worship of the devill which their pawwawes often doe 2lie if upon a just warre the lord should deliver them into our hands wee might easily have men woemen  children enough to exchange for moores which wilbe more gaynefull pilladge for us than wee conceive for i doe not see how wee can thrive untill wee gett into a stock of slaves sufficient to doe all our buisenes for our childrens children will hardly see this great continent filled with people soe that our servants will still desire freedome to plant for them selves  not stay but for verie great wages and i suppose you know verie well how wee shall maynteyne 20 moores cheaper than one englishe servant the doubt whether it be not sin in us longer to tolerate their devilworship considering how much need we have of them as merchandise is delicious the way in which hugh peter grades the sharp descent from the apostolic to the practical with an et cetera in the following extract has the same charm sir mr endecot  myself salute you in the lord jesus c wee have heard of a dividence of women  children in the bay  would bee glad of a share viz a young woman or girle  a boy if you thinke good peter seems to have got what he asked for and to have been worse off than before for we find him writing two years later my wife desires my daughter to send to hanna that was her mayd now at charltowne to know if shee would dwell with us for truly wee are so destitute having now but an indian that wee know not what to doe let any housewife of our day who does not find the keltic element in domestic life so refreshing as to mr arnold in literature imagine a household with one wild pequot woman communicated with by signs for its maid of all work and take courage those were serious times indeed when your cook might give warning by taking your scalp or chignon as the case might be and making off with it into the woods the fewness and dearness of servants made it necessary to call in temporary assistance for extraordinary occasions and hence arose the common use of the word help as the great majority kept no servants at all and yet were liable to need them for work to which the family did not suffice as for instance in harvest the use of the word was naturally extended to all kinds of service that it did not have its origin in any false shame at the condition itself induced by democratic habits is plain from the fact that it came into use while the word servant had a much wider application than now and certainly implied no social stigma downing and hooke each at different times one of them so late as 1667 wished to place a son as servant with one of the winthrops roger williams writes of his daughter that she desires to spend some time in service  liked much mrs brenton who wanted this was no doubt in order to be well drilled in housekeeping an example which might be followed still to advantage john tinker himself the servant or steward of the second winthrop makes use of help in both the senses we have mentioned and shows the transition of the word from its restricted to its more general application we have fallen a pretty deal of timber  drawn some by goodman rogerss team but unless your worship have a good team of your own  a man to go with them i shall be much distracted for help   when our business is most in haste we shall be most to seek again writing at harvest as appears both by the date and by an elaborate puni received the sithes you sent but in that there came not also yourself it maketh me to sigthhe says help is scarce and hard to get difficult to please uncertain c means runneth out  wages on  i cannot make choice of my help  it may be some consolation to know that the complaint of a decline in the quality of servants is no modern thing shakespeare makes orlando say to adam    o good old man how well in thee appears   the constant service of the antique world   when service sweat for duty not for meed   thou art not of the fashion of these times   when none will sweat but for promotion  when the faithful old servant is brought upon the stage we may be sure he was getting rare a century later we have explicit testimony that things were as bad in this respect as they are now don manuel gonzales who travelled in england in 1730 says of london servants as to common menial servants they have great wages are well kept and cloathed but are notwithstanding the plague of almost every house in town they form themselves into societies or rather confederacies contributing to the maintenance of each other when out of place and if any of them cannot manage the family where they are entertained as they please immediately they give notice they will be gone there is no speaking to them they are above correction and if a master should attempt it he may expect to be handsomely drubbed by the creature he feeds and harbors or perhaps an action brought against him for it it is become a common saying if my servant bent a thief if he be but honest i can bear with other things and indeed it is very rare in london to meet with an honest servant142 southey writes to his daughter edith in 1824 all the maids eloped because i had turned a man out of the kitchen at eleven oclock on the preceding night nay hugh rhodes in his boke of nurture1577 speaks of servants ofte fleeting ie leaving one master for another  one of the most curious things revealed to us in these volumes is the fact that john winthrop jr was seeking the philosophers stone that universal elixir which could transmute all things to its own substance this is plain from the correspondence of edward howes howes goes to a certain doctor professedly to consult him about the method of making a cement for earthen vessels no doubt crucibles his account of him is amusing and reminds one of ben jonsons subtle this was one of the many quacks who gulled men during that twilight through which alchemy was passing into chemistry this dr for a dr he is brags that if he have but the hint or notice of any useful thing not yet invented he will undertake to find it out except some few which he hath vowed not to meddle with as vitrum maliabile perpet motus via proxima ad indos  lapis philosi all or anything else he will undertake but for his private gain to make a monopoly thereof  to sell the use or knowledge thereof at too high rates this breed of pedlers in science is not yet extinct the exceptions made by the doctor show a becoming modesty again i have been 2 or 3 times with the dr  can get but small satisfaction about your queries yet i must confess he seemed very free to me only in the main he was mystical this he said that when the will of god is you shall know what you desire it will come with such a light that it will make a harmony among all your authors causing them sweetly to agree  put you forever out of doubt  question in another letter i cannot discover into terram incognitam but i have had a ken of it showed unto me the way to it is for the most part horrible  fearful the dangers none worse to them that are destinati filii sometimes i am travelling that way i think i have spoken with some that have been there  howes writes very cautiously dear friend i desire with all my heart that i might write plainer to you but in discovering the mystery i may diminish its majesty  give occasion to the profane to abuse it if it should fall into unworthy hands by and by he begins to think his first doctor a humbug but he finds a better howes was evidently a man of imaginative temper fit to be captivated by the alchemistic theory of the unity of composition in nature which was so attractive to goethe perhaps the great poet was himself led to it by his rosicrucian studies when writing the first part of faust howes tells his friend that there is all good to be found in unity  all evil in duality  multiplicity phoenix illa admiranda sola semper existit therefore while a man  she is two he shall never see hera truth of very wide application and too often lost sight of or never seen at all the arabian philos i writ to you of he was styled among us dr lyon the best of all the rosicrucians143 that ever i met withal far beyond dr ewer they that are of his strain are knowing men they pretend ie claim to live in free light they honor god  do good to the people among whom they live  i conceive you are in the right that they had their learning from arabia  howes is a very interesting person a mystic of the purest kind and that while learning to be an attorney with emanuel downing how little that perfunctory person dreamed of what was going on under his noseas little as of the spiritual wonders that lay beyond the tip of it howes was a swedenborgian before swedenborg take this for example but to our sympathetical business whereby we may communicate our minds one to another though the diameter of the earth interpose diana non est centrum omnium i would have you so good a geometrician as to know your own centre did you ever yet measure your everlasting self the length of your life the breadth of your love the depth of your wisdom  the height of your light let truth be your centre  you may do it otherways not i could wish you would now begin to leave off being altogether an outward man this is but casa regentis the ruler can draw you straight lines from your centre to the confines of an infinite circumference by which you may pass from any part of the circumference to another without obstacle of earth or secation of lines if you observe  keep but one  the true  only centre to pass by it from it  to it methinks i now see you intus et extra  talk to you but you mind me not because you are from home you are not

within in the centre of truth from thence you may behold  understand the innumerable divers emanations within the circumference  still within for without are falsities lies untruths dogs c howes was tolerant also not from want of faith but from depth of it the relation of your fight with the indians i have read in print but of the fight among yourselves bellum linguarum the strife of tongues i have heard much but little to the purpose i wonder your people that pretend to know so much doe not know that love is the fulfilling of the law  that against love there is no law howes forgot that what might cause only a ripple in london might overwhelm the tiny colony in boston two years later he writes more philosophically and perhaps with a gentle irony concerning two monstrous births  a general earthquake he hints that the people of the bay might perhaps as well take these signs to themselves as lay them at the door of mrs hutchinson and what not where is there such another people then as in new england that labors might  main to have christ formed in them yet would give or appoint him his shape  clothe him too it cannot be denied that we have conceived many monstrous imaginations of christ jesus the one imagination says lo here he is the other says lo there he is multiplicity of conceptions but is there any one true shape of him and if one of many produce a shape it is not the shape of the son of god but an ugly horrid metamorphosis neither is it a living shape but a dead one yet a crow thinks her own bird the fairest  most prefer their own wisdom before gods antichrist before christ howes had certainly arrived at that centre of which he speaks and was before his time as a man of speculation never a man of action may sometimes be he was fitter for plotinuss colony than winthrops he never came to new england yet there was always a leaven of his style of thinkers here  howes was the true adept seeking what spiritual ore there might be among the dross of the hermetic philosophy what he says sincerely and inwardly was the cant of those outward professors of the doctrine who were content to dwell in the material part of it forever in jonathan brewster we have a specimen of these wagners is it not curious that there should have been a balneum mariae at new london two hundred years ago that la recherche de labsolu should have been going on there in a loghut under constant fear that the indians would put out not merely the flame of one little life but far worse the fire of our furnace and so rob the world of this divine secret just on the point of revealing itself alas poor brewsters secret was one that many have striven after before and since who did not call themselves alchemiststhe secret of getting gold without earning ita chase that brings some men to a fourinhand on shoddy avenue and some to the penitentiary in both cases advertising its utter vanity brewster is a capital specimen of his class who are better than the average because they do mix a little imagination with their sordidness and who have also their representatives among us in those who expect the jennings and other ideal estates in england if hawthorne had but known of him and yet how perfectly did his genius divine that ideal element in our early new england life conceiving what must have been without asking proof of what actually was  an extract or two will sufficiently exhibit brewster in his lunes sending back some alchemistic book to winthrop he tells him that if his name be kept secret i will write as clear a light as far as i dare to in finding the first ingredience the first figure in flamonell doth plainly resemble the first ingredience what it is  from whence it comes  how gotten as there you may plainly see set forth by 2 resemblances held in a mans hand for the confections there named is a delusion for they are but the operations of the work after some time set as the scum of the red sea which is the virgins milk upon the top of the vessel white red sea is the sun  moon calcinated  brought  reduced into water mineral which in some time  most of the whole time is red 2ndly the fat of mercurial wind that is the fat or quintessence of sun  moon earth  water drawn out from them both  flies aloft  bore up by the operation of our mercury that is our fire which is our air or wind this is as satisfactory as lepiduss account of the generation of the crocodile your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile after describing the three kinds of fire that of the lamp that of ashes and that against nature which last is the fire of fire that is the secret fire drawn up being the quintessence of the sun  moon with the other mercurial water joined with  together which is fire elemental he tells us that these fires are  doth contain the whole mystery of the work the reader perhaps thinks that he has nothing to do but forthwith to turn all the lead he can lay his hands on into gold but no if you had the first ingredience  the proportion of each yet all were nothing if you had not the certain times  seasons of the planets  signs when to give more or less of this fire namely a hot  dry a cold  moist fire which you must use in the mercurial water before it comes to black  after into white  then red which is only done by these fires which when you practise you will easily see  perceive that you shall stand amazed  admire at the great  admirable wisdom of god that can produce such a wonderful efficacious powerful thing as this is to convert all metallic bodies to its own nature which may be well called a first essence i say by such weak simple means of so little value  so little  easy labor  skill that i may say with artephus 200 page it is of a worke so easy  short fitter for women  young children than sage  grave men i thank the lord i understand the matter perfectly in the said book yet i could desire to have it again 12 months hence for about that time i shall have occasion to peruse whenas i come to the second working which is most difficult which will be some three or 4 months before the perfect white  afterwards as artephus saith i may burn my books for he saith it is one regiment as well for the red as for the white the lord in mercy give me life to see the end of itan exclamation i more than once made in the course of some of brewsters periods  again under pledge of profound secrecy he sends winthrop a manuscript which he may communicate to the owner of the volume formerly lent because it gave me such light in the second work as i should not readily have found out by study also  especially how to work the elixir fit for medicine  healing all maladies which is clean another way of working than we held formerly also a light given how to dissolve any hard substance into the elixir which is also another work and many other things which in ribley ripley i could not find out more works of the same i would gladly see  for sir so it is that any book of this subject i can understand it though never so darkly written having both knowledge  experience of the world144 that now easily i may understand their envious carriages to hide it you may marvel why i should give any light to others in this thing before i have perfected my own this know that my work being true thus far by all their writings it cannot fail  for if c c you cannot miss if you would except you break your glass he confesses he is mistaken as to the time required which he now as well as i can make out reckons at about ten years i fear i shall not live to see it finished in regard partly of the indians who i fear will raise wars as also i have a conceit that god sees me not worthy of such a blessing by reason of my manifold miscarriages therefore he will shortly write all the whole work in few words plainly which may be done in 20 lines from the first to the last  seal it up in a little box  subscribe it to yourself   will so write it that neither wife nor children shall know thereof if winthrop should succeed in bringing the work to perfection brewster begs him to remember his wife and children i mean if this my work should miscarry by wars of the indians for i may not remove it till it be perfected otherwise i should so unsettle the body by removing sun  moon out of their settled places that there would then be no other afterworking once more he inculcates secrecy and for a most comical reason for it is such a secret as is not fit for every one either for secrecy or for parts to use it as gods secret for his glory to do good there with or else they may do a great deal of hurt spending  employing it to satisfy sinful lusts therefore i intreat you sir spare to use my name  let my letters i send either be safely kept or burned that i write about it for indeed sir i am more than before sensible of the evil effects that will arise by the publishing of it i should never be at quiet neither at home nor abroad for one or other that would be enquiring  seeking after knowledge thereof that i should be tired out  forced to leave the place nay it would be blazed abroad into europe how much more comic is nature than any comedy mutato nomine de te take heart ambitious youth the sun and moon will be no more disconcerted by any effort of yours than by the pots and pans of jonathan brewster it is a curious proof of the duality so common yet so often overlooked in human character that brewster was all this while manager of the plymouth tradingpost near what is now new london the only professors of the transmutation of metals who still impose on mankind are to be found in what is styled the critical department of literature their materia prima or universal solvent serves equally for the lead of tupper or the brass of swinburne  in a letter of sir kenelm digby to j winthrop jr we find some odd prescriptions for all sorts of agues i have of late tried the following magnetical experiment with infallible success pare the patients nails when the fit is coming on  put the parings into a little bag of fine linen or sarsenet  tie that about a live eels neck in a tub of water the eel will die  the patient will recover and if a dog or hog eat that eel they will also die    the man recovered of the bite       the dog it was that died  i have known one that cured all deliriums  frenzies whatsoever  at once taking with an elixir made of dew nothing but dew purified  nipped up in a glass  digested 15 months till all of it was become a gray powder not one drop of humidity remaining this i know to be true  that first it was as black as ink then green then gray  at 22 months end it was as white  lustrous as any oriental pearl but it cured manias at 15 months end poor brewster would have been the better for a dose of it as well as some in our day who expect to cure men of being men by act of congress in the same letter digby boasts of having made known the properties of quinquina and also of the sympathetic powder with which latter he wrought a famous cure of pleasant james howell author of the letters i do not recollect that howell anywhere alludes to it in the same letter digby speaks of the books he had sent to harvard college and promises to send more in all paris he cannot find a copy of blaise viginere des chiffres i had it in my library in england but at the plundering of my house i lost it with many other good books i have laid out in all places for it the words we have underscored would be called a yankeeism now the house was gatehurst a fine elizabethan dwelling still or lately standing digby made his peace with cromwell and professes his readiness to spend his blood for him he kept well with both sides and we are not surprised to find hooke saying that he hears no good of him from any  the early colonists found it needful to bring over a few trained soldiers both as drillmasters and engineers underhill patrick and gardner had served in the low countries probably also mason as paris has been said to be not precisely the place for a deacon so the camp of the prince of orange could hardly have been the best trainingschool for puritans in practice however it may have been for masters of casuistic theology the position of these rough warriors among a people like those of the first emigration must have been a droll one that of captain underhill certainly was in all our early history there is no figure so comic full of the pedantry of his profession and fond of noble phrases he is a kind of cross between dugald dalgetty and ancient pistol with a slight relish of the miles gloriosus underhill had taken side with mr wheelwright in his heretical opinions and there is every reason why he should have maintained with all the ardor of personal interest the efficiency of a covenant of grace without reference to the works of the subject of it coming back from a visit to england in 1638 he was questioned for some speeches uttered by him in the ship viz that they at boston were zealous as the scribes and pharisees were and as paul was before his conversion which he denying they were proved to his face by a sober woman whom he had seduced in the ship and drawn to his opinion but she was afterwards better informed in the truth among other passages he told her how he came by his assurance saying that having long lain under a spirit of bondage and continued in a legal way near five years he could get no assurance till at length as he was taking a pipe of the good creature tobacco the spirit fell home upon his heart an absolute promise of free grace with such assurance and joy as he never doubted since of his good estate neither should he whatsoever sin he should fall intoa good preparative for such motions as he familiarly used to make to some of that sex the next day he was called again and banished the lords day after he made a speech in the assembly showing that as the lord was pleased to convert paul as he was persecuting c so he might manifest himself to him as he was making moderate use of the good creature called tobacco a week later he was privately dealt with upon suspicion of incontinency  but his excuse was that the woman was in great trouble of mind and some temptations and that he resorted to her to comfort her he went to the eastward and having run himself out there thought it best to come back to boston and reinstate himself by eating his leek he came in his worst clothes being accustomed to take great pride in his bravery and neatness without a band in a foul linen cap pulled close to his eyes and standing upon a form he did with many deep sighs and abundance of tears lay open his wicked course his adultery his hypocrisy c he spake well save that his blubbering c interrupted him we hope he was a sincere penitent but men of his complexion are apt to be pleased with such a tragicomedy of selfabasement if only they can be chief actors and conspicuous enough therein in the correspondence before us underhill appears in full turkeycock proportions not having been advanced according to his own opinion of his merits he writes to governor winthrop with an oblique threat that must have amused him somewhat i profess sir till i know the cause i shall not be satisfied but i hope god will subdue me to his will yet this i say that such handling of officers in foreign parts hath so far subverted some of them as to cause them turn public rebels against their state  kingdom which god forbid should ever be found once so much as to appear in my breast why then the worlds mine oyster which i with sword will open next we hear him on a point of military discipline at salem it is this how they have of their own appointment made them a captain lieutenant  ensign  after such a manner as was never heard of in any school of war nor in no kingdom under heaven for my part if there should not be a reformation in this disordered practise i would not acknowledge such officers if officers should be of no better esteem than for constables to place them  martial discipline to proceed disorderly i would rather lay down my command than to shame so noble a prince from whom we came again whereas it is somewhat questionable whether the three months i was absent as well in the service of the country as of other particular persons my request therefore is that this honored court would be pleased to decide this controversy myself alleging it to be the custom of nations that if a commander be lent to another state by that state to whom he is a servant both his place  means is not detained from him so long as he doth not refuse the call of his own state to which he is a servant in case they shall call him home then bringing up again his ancient suit for a grant of land he throws in a neat touch of piety  if the honored court shall vouchsafe to make some addition that which hath not been deserved by the same power of god may be in due season in a postscript he gives a fine philosophical reason for this desired addition which will go to the hearts of many in these days of high prices and wasteful taxation the time was when a little went far then much was not known nor desired the reason of the difference lieth only in the error of judgment for nature requires no more to uphold it now than when it was satisfied with less the valiant captain interprets the law of nations as sovereign powers are wont to do to suit his advantage in the special case we find a parallel case in a letter of bryan rosseter to john winthrop jr pleading for a remission of taxes the lawes of nations exempt allowed phisitians from personall services  their estates from rates  assessments in the declaration of the town of southampton on long island 1673 the dignity of constable is valued at a juster rate than underhill was inclined to put upon it the dutch it seems demanded of them to deliver up to them the badge of civil  military power namely the constables staffe  the colonels mayor munroe of new orleans did not more effectually magnify his office when he surrendered the city to general butler  underhills style is always of the finest his spelling was under the purest covenant of grace i must give a single specimen of it from a letter whose high moral tone is all the more diverting that it was written while he was under excommunication for the sin which he afterwards confessed it is addressed to winthrop and dudley honnored in the lord youer silenc one more admirse me i youse chrischan playnnes i know you love it

admirably chosen when we consider the means of making people tractable which the magistrates of the bay had in their hands and were not slow to exercise as underhill himself had experienced  i cannot deny myself the pleasure of giving one more specimen of the captains granddelinquent style as i once heard such fine writing called by a person who little dreamed what a hit he had made so far as i have observed our public defaulters and others who have nothing to say for themselves always rise in style as they sink in selfrespect he is speaking of one scott who had laid claim to certain lands and had been called on to show his title if he break the comand of the asembli  bring not in the counterfit portreture of the king imprest in yello waxe anext to his false perpetuiti of 20 mile square where by he did chet the town of brouckhaven he is to induer the sentance of the court of asisies pistol would have been charmed with that splendid amplification of the great seal we have seen nothing like it in our day except in a speech made to mr george peabody at danvers if i recollect while that gentleman was so elaborately concealing from his left hand what his right had been doing as examples of captain underhills adroitness in phonetic spelling i offer fafarabel and poseschonse and  reluctantly leave him  another very entertaining fellow for those who are willing to work through a pretty thick husk of tiresomeness for a genuine kernel of humor underneath is coddington the elder winthrop endured many trials but i doubt if any were sharper than those which his son had to undergo in the correspondence of this excellently tiresome man tantae molis romanam condere gentem the dulness of coddington always that of no ordinary man became irritable and aggressive after being stung by the gadfly of quakerism running counter to its proper nature it made him morbidly uneasy already an anabaptist his brain does not seem to have been large enough to lodge two maggots at once with any comfort to himself fancy john winthrop jr with all the affairs of the connecticut colony on his back expected to prescribe alike for the spiritual and bodily ailments of all the hypochondriacs in his government and with philips war impendingfancy him exposed also to perpetual trials like this gf george fox hath sent thee a book of his by jere bull  two more now which thou mayest communicate to thy council  officers also i remember before thy last being in england i sent thee a book written by francis howgall against persecution by joseph nicallson which book thou lovingly accepted and communicated to the commissioners of the united colonies as i desired also jn thou entertained with a loving respect which encouraged me fatal hospitalityas a token of that ancient love that for this 42 years i have had for thee i have sent thee three manuscripts one of 5 queries other is of 15 about the love of jesus c the 3d is why we cannot come to the worship which was not set up by christ jesus which i desire thee to communicate to the priests to answer in thy jurisdiction the massachusetts new plymouth or elsewhere  send their answer in writing to me also two printed papers to set up in thy house its reported in barbadoes that thy brother sammuell shall be sent governour to antego what a mere dust of sugar in the last sentence for such a portentous pill in his next letter he has other writings of g f not yet copied which if thou desireth when i hear from thee i may convey them unto thee also sence g ffox departure william edmondson is arrived at this island who having given out a paper to all in authority which my wife having copied i have here inclosed presented thee therewith books and manuscripts were not all coddington was also glad to bestow on winthrop any wandering tediousness in the flesh that came to hand i now understand of john stubbs freedom to visit thee with the said jo b he is a larned man as witness the battle door145 on 35 languagesa terrible man this capable of inflicting himself on three dozen different kindreds of men it will be observed that coddington with his thou desireths is not quite so well up in the grammar of his theeandthouing as my lord coke indeed it is rather pleasant to see that in his alarm about the enemy in 1673 he backslides into the second person plural if winthrop ever looked over his fathers correspondence he would have read in a letter of henry jacie the following dreadful example of retribution the last news we heard was that the bores in bavaria slew about 300 of the swedish forces  took about 200 prisoners of which they put out the eyes of some  cut out the tonges of others  so sent them to the king of sweden which caused him to lament bytterly for an hour then he sent an army  destroyed those bores about 200 or 300 of their towns thus we hear think of that master coddington could the sinful heart of man always suppress the wish that a gustavus might arise to do judgment on the bores of rhode island the unkindest part of it was that on coddingtons own statement winthrop had never persecuted the quakers and had even endeavored to save robinson and stevenson in 1659  speaking of the execution of these two martyrs to the bee in their bonnets john davenport gives us a capital example of the way in which divine judgments may be made to work both ways at the pleasure of the interpreter as the crowd was going home from the hanging a drawbridge gave way and some lives were lost the quakers of course made the most of this lesson to the pontifices in the bearing power of timber claiming it as a proof of gods wrath against the persecutors this was rather hard since none of the magistrates perished and the popular feeling was strongly in favor of the victims of their severity but davenport gallantly captures these quaker guns and turns them against the enemy himself sir the hurt that befell so many by their own rashness at the draw bridge in boston being on the day that the quakers were executed was not without gods special providence in judgment  wrath i fear against the quakers  their abettors who will be much hardened thereby this is admirable especially as his parenthesis about their own rashness assumes that the whole thing was owing to natural causes the pity for the quakers too implied in the i fear is a nice touch it is always noticeable how much more liberal those who deal in gods command without his power are of his wrath than of his mercy but we should never understand the puritans if we did not bear in mind that they were still prisoners in that religion of fear which casts out love the nearness of god was oftener a terror than a comfort to them yet perhaps in them was the last apparition of faith as a wonderworker in human affairs take away from them what you will you cannot deny them that and its constant presence made them great in a way and measure of which this generation it is to be feared can have but a very inadequate conception if men nowadays find their tone antipathetic it would be modest at least to consider whether the fault be wholly theirswhether it was they who lacked or we who have lost whether they were right or wrong in their dealing with the quakers is not a question to be decided glibly after two centuries struggle toward a conception of toleration very imperfect even yet perhaps impossible to human nature if they did not choose what seems to us the wisest way of keeping the devil out of their household they certainly had a very honest will to keep him out which we might emulate with advantage however it be in other cases historic toleration must include intolerance among things to be tolerated  the false notion which the first settlers had of the savages by whom the continent was beflead rather than inhabited arose in part from what they had heard of mexico and peru in part from the splendid exaggerations of the early travellers who could give their readers an el dorado at the cheap cost of a good lie hence the kings dukes and earls who were so plenty among the red men pride of descent takes many odd shapes none odder than when it hugs itself in an ancestry of filthy barbarians who daubed themselves for ornament with a mixture of bearsgrease and soot or colored clay and were called emperors by captain john smith and his compeers the droll contrast between this imaginary royalty and the squalid reality is nowhere exposed with more ludicrous unconsciousness than in the following passage of a letter from fitzjohn winthrop to his father november 1674 the bearer hereof mr danyell one of the royal indian blood  does desire me to give an account to yourself of the late unhappy accident which has happened to him a little time since a careless girl playing with fire at the door it immediately took hold of the mats  in an instant consumed it to ashes with all the common as well as his ladys chamber furniture  his own wardrobe  armory indian plate  money to the value as is credibly reported in his estimation of more than an hundred pounds indian the indians have handsomely already built him a good house  brought him in several necessaries for his present supply but that which takes deepest melancholy impression upon him is the loss of an excellent masathuset cloth cloak  hat which was only seen upon holy days  their general sessions his journey at this time is only to intreat your favor  the gentlemen there for a kind relief in his necessity having no kind of garment but a short jerkin which was charitably given him by one of his commoncouncilmen he principally aims at a cloak  hat    king stephen was a worthy peer   his breeches cost him but a crown  but it will be observed that there is no allusion to any such article of dress in the costume of this prince of pequot some light is perhaps thrown on this deficiency by a line or two in one of williamss letters where he says i have long had scruples of selling the natives ought but what may tend or bring to civilizing i therefore neither brought nor shall sell them loose coats nor breeches precisely the opposite course was deemed effectual with the highland scotch between whom and our indians there was a very close analogy they were compelled by law to adopt the usages of gallia braccata and sansculottism made a penal offence what impediment to civilization williams had discovered in the offending garment it is hard to say it is a question for herr teufelsdröck royalty at any rate in our day is dependent for much of its success on the tailor williamss opportunities of studying the indian character were perhaps greater than those of any other man of his time he was always an advocate for justice toward them but he seems to have had no better opinion of them than mr parkman146 calling them shortly and sharply wolves endowed with mens brains the same change of feeling has followed the same causes in their case as in that of the highlandersthey have become romantic in proportion as they ceased to be dangerous  as exhibitions of the writers character no letters in the collection have interested us more than those of john tinker who for many years was a kind of steward for john winthrop and his son they show him to have been a thoroughly faithful grateful and unselfish servant he does not seem to have prospered except in winning respect for when he died his funeral charges were paid by the public we learn from one of his letters that john winthrop jr had a negro presumably a slave at paquanet for he says that a mad cow there had almost spoiled the neger  made him ferfull to tend the rest of the cattell that such slaves must have been rare however is plain from his constant complaints about the difficulty of procuring help some of which we have already quoted his spelling of the word ferfull shows that the new england pronunciation of that word had been brought from the old country he also uses the word creatures for kine and the like precisely as our farmers do now there is one very comical passage in a letter of the 2nd of august 1660 where he says there hath been a motion by some the chief of the town new london for my keeping an ordinary or rather under the notion of a tavern which though it suits not with my genius yet am almost persuaded to accept for some good grounds tinkers modesty is most creditable to him and we wish it were more common now no people on the face of the earth suffer so much as we from impostors who keep inconveniences under the notion of a tavern without any call of natural genius thereto none endure with such unexemplary patience the superb indifference of innkeepers and the condescending inattention of their gentlemanly deputies we are the thralls of our railroads and hotels and we deserve it  richard saltonstall writes to john winthrop jr in 1636 the best thing that i have to beg your thoughts for at this present is a motto or two that mr prynne hath writ upon his chamber walls in the tower we copy a few phrases chiefly for the contrast they make with lovelaces famous verses to althea nothing could mark more sharply the different habits of mind in puritan and cavalier lovelace is very charming but he sings    the sweetness mercy majesty     and glories of his king  to wit charles i to him stone walls do not a prison make so long as he has freedom in his love and in his soul is free prynnes king was of another and higher kind carcer excludit mundum includit deum deus est turris etiam in turre turris libertatis in turre angustiae turris quietis in turre molestice arctari non potest qui in ipsa dei infinitate incarceratus spatiatur nil crus sentit in nervo si animus sit in coelo nil corpus patitur in ergastulo si anima sit in christo if lovelace has the advantage in fancy prynne has it as clearly in depth of sentiment there could be little doubt which of the parties represented by these men would have the better if it came to a deathgrapple  there is curiously little sentiment in these volumes most of the letters except where some point of doctrine is concerned are those of shrewd practical men busy about the affairs of this world and earnest to build their new jerusalem on something more solid than cloud the truth is that men anxious about their souls have not been by any means the least skilful in providing for the wants of the body it was far less the enthusiasm than the common sense of the puritans which made them what they were in politics and religion that a great change should be wrought in the settlers by the circumstances of their position was inevitable that this change should have had some disillusion in it that it should have weaned them from the ideal and wonted them to the actual was equally so in 1664 not much more than a generation after the settlement williams prophesies when we that have been the eldest are rotting tomorrow or next day a generation will act i fear far unlike the first winthrops and their models of love i fear that the common trinity of the world profit preferment pleasure will here be the tria omnia as in all the world beside that prelacy and papacy too will in this wilderness predominate that god land will be as now it is as great a god with us english as god gold was with the spaniards while we are here noble sir let us viriliter hoc agere rem agere humanam divinam christianam which i believe is all of a most public genius or as we should now say true patriotism if williams means no play on the word humanam and divinam the order of precedence in which he marshals them is noticeable a generation later what williams had predicted was in a great measure verified but what made new england puritanism narrow was what made scotch cameronianism narrowits being secluded from the great movement of the nation till 1660 the colony was ruled and mostly inhabited by englishmen closely connected with the party dominant in the mother country and with their minds broadened by having to deal with questions of state and european policy after that time they sank rapidly into provincials narrow in thought in culture in creed such a pedantic portent as cotton mather would have been impossible in the first generation he was the natural growth of the thirdthe manifest judgment of god on a generation who thought words a saving substitute for things perhaps some injustice has been done to men like the second governor dudley and it should be counted to them rather as a merit than a fault that they wished to bring new england back within reach of the invigorating influence of national sympathies and to rescue it from a tradition which had become empty formalism puritanism was dead and its profession had become a wearisome cant before the revolution of 1688 gave it that vital force in politics which it had lost in religion  i have gleaned all i could of what is morally picturesque or characteristic from these volumes but new england history has rather a gregarious than a personal interest here by inherent necessity rather than design was made the first experiment in practical democracy and accordingly hence began that reaction of the new world upon the old whose result can hardly yet be estimated there is here no temptation to make a hero who shall sum up in his own individuality and carry forward by his own will that purpose of which we seem to catch such bewitching glances in history which reveals itself more clearly and constantly perhaps in the annals of new england than elsewhere and which yet at best is but tentative doubtful of itself turned this way and that by chance made up of instinct and modified by circumstance quite as much as it is directed by deliberate forethought such a purpose or natural craving or result of temporary influences may be misguided by a powerful character to his own ends or if he be strongly in sympathy with it may be hastened toward its own fulfilment but there is no such heroic element in our drama and what is remarkable is that under whatever government democracy grew with the growth of the new england colonies and was at last potent enough to wrench them and the better part of the continent with them from the mother country it is true that jefferson embodied in the declaration of independence the speculative theories he had learned in france but the impulse to separation came from new england and those theories had been long since embodied there in the practice of the people if they had never been formulated in distinct propositions  i have little sympathy with declaimers about the pilgrim fathers who look upon them all as men of grand conceptions and superhuman foresight an entire ships company of columbuses is what the world never saw it is not wise to form any theory and fit our facts to it as a man in a hurry is apt to cram his travellingbag with a total disregard of shape or texture but perhaps it may be found that the facts will only fit comfortably together on a single plan namely that the fathers did have a conception which those will call grand who regard simplicity as a necessary element of grandeur of founding here a commonwealth on those two eternal bases of faith and work that they had indeed no revolutionary ideas of universal liberty but yet what answered the purpose quite as well an abiding faith in the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god and that they did not so much propose to make all things new as to develop the latent possibilities of english law and english character by clearing away the fences by which the abuse of the one was gradually discommoning the other from the broad fields of natural right they were not in advance of their age as it is called for no one who is so can ever work profitably in it but they were alive to the highest and most earnest thinking of their time     footnotes      135 written in december 1864       136 it is curious that when cromwell proposed to transfer a     colony from new england to ireland one of the conditions insisted on     in massachusetts was that a college should be established       137 state trials ii 409 one would not reckon too closely with a     man on trial for his life but there is something pitiful in peters     representing himself as coming back to england out of the west     indias in order to evade any complicity

jesuits in north america     lessing147  when burnss humor gave its last pathetic flicker in his john dont let the awkward squad fire over me was he thinking of actual brothervolunteers or of possible biographers did his words betray only the rhythmic sensitiveness of poetic nerves or were they a foreboding of that helpless future when the poet lies at the mercy of the plodderof that bivoluminous shape in which dulness overtakes and revenges itself on genius at last certainly burns has suffered as much as most largenatured creatures from wellmeaning efforts to account for him to explain him away to bring him into harmony with those wellregulated minds which during a good part of the last century found out a way through rhyme to snatch a prosiness beyond the reach of prose nay he has been wronged also by that other want of true appreciation which deals in panegyric and would put asunder those two things which god has joinedthe poet and the manas if it were not the same rash improvidence that was the happiness of the verse and the misfortune of the gauger but his deathbed was at least not haunted by the unappeasable apprehension of a german for his biographer and that the fame of lessing should have four times survived this cunningest assault of oblivion is proof enough that its base is broad and deepset  there seems to be in the average german mind an inability or a disinclination to see a thing as it really is unless it be a matter of science it finds its keenest pleasure in divining a profound significance in the most trifling things and the number of maresnests that have been stared into by the german gelehrter through his spectacles passes calculation they are the one object of contemplation that makes that singular being perfectly happy and they seem to be as common as those of the stork in the dark forest of aesthetics particularly he finds them at every turnfanno tutto il loco varo if the greater part of our english criticism is apt only to skim the surface the german by way of being profound too often burrows in delighted darkness quite beneath its subject till the reader feels the ground hollow beneath him and is fearful of caving into unknown depths of stagnant metaphysic air at every step the commentary on shakespeare of gervinus a really superior man reminds one of the roman campagna penetrated underground in all directions by strange winding caverns the work of human borers in search of we know not what above are the divine poets larks and daisies his incommunicable skies his broad prospects of life and nature and meanwhile our teutonic teredo worms his way below and offers to be our guide into an obscurity of his own contriving the reaction of language upon style and even upon thought by its limitations on the one hand and its suggestions on the other is so apparent to any one who has made even a slight study of comparative literature that we have sometimes thought the german tongue at least an accessory before the fact if nothing more in the offences of german literature the language has such a fatal genius for going sternforemost for yawing and for not minding the helm without some ten minutes notice in advance that he must be a great sailor indeed who can safely make it the vehicle for anything but imperishable commodities vischers aesthetik the best treatise on the subject ancient or modern is such a book as none but a german could write and it is written as none but a german could have written it the abstracts of its sections are sometimes nearly as long as the sections themselves and it is as hard to make out which head belongs to which tail as in a knot of snakes thawing themselves into sluggish individuality under a spring sun the average german professor spends his life in making lanterns fit to guide us through the obscurest passages of all the ologies and ysics and there are none in the world of such honest workmanship they are durable they have intensifying glasses reflectors of the most scientific make capital sockets in which to set a light and a handsome lump of potentially illuminating tallow is thrown in but in order to see by them the explorer must make his own candle supply his own cohesive wick of commonsense and light it himself and yet the admirable thoroughness of the german intellect we should be ungrateful indeed if we did not acknowledge that it has supplied the raw material in almost every branch of science for the defter wits of other nations to work on yet we have a suspicion that there are certain lighter departments of literature in which it may be misapplied and turn into something very like clumsiness delightful as jean pauls humor is how much more so would it be if he only knew when to stop ethereally deep as is his sentiment should we not feel it more if he sometimes gave us a little less of itif he would only not always deal out his wine by beermeasure so thorough is the german mind that might it not seem now and then to work quite through its subject and expatiate in cheerful unconsciousness on the other side thereof  with all its merits of a higher and deeper kind it yet seems to us that german literature has not quite satisfactorily answered that so longstanding question of the french abbé about esprit hard as it is for a german to be clear still harder to be light he is more than ever awkward in his attempts to produce that quality of style so peculiarly french which is neither wit nor liveliness taken singly but a mixture of the two that must be drunk while the effervescence lasts and will not bear exportation into any other language german criticism excellent in other respects and immeasurably superior to that of any other nation in its constructive faculty in its instinct for getting at whatever principle of life lies at the heart of a work of genius is seldom lucid almost never entertaining it may turn its light if we have patience into every obscurest cranny of its subject one after another but it never flashes light out of the subject itself as saintebeuve for example so often does and with such unexpected charm we should be inclined to put julian schmidt at the head of living critics in all the more essential elements of his outfit but with him is not one conscious at too frequent intervals of the professorial grindof that german tendency to bear on too heavily where a french critic would touch and go with such exquisite measure the great nation as  it cheerfully calls itself is in nothing greater than its talent for saying little things agreeably which is perhaps the very top of mere culture and in literature is the next best thing to the power of saying great things as easily as if they were little german learning like the elephants of pyrrhus is always in danger of turning upon what it was intended to adorn and reinforce and trampling it ponderously to death and yet what do we not owe it mastering all languages all records of intellectual man it has been able or has enabled others to strip away the husks of nationality and conventionalism from the literatures of many races and to disengage that kernel of human truth which is the germinating principle of them all nay it has taught us to recognize also a certain value in those very husks whether as shelter for the unripe or food for the fallen seed  that the general want of style in german authors is not wholly the fault of the language is shown by heine a man of mixed blood who can be daintily light in german that it is not altogether a matter of race is clear from the graceful airiness of erasmus and reuchlin in latin and of grimm in french the sense of heaviness which creeps over the reader from so many german books is mainly due we suspect to the language which seems wellnigh incapable of that aerial perspective so delightful in firstrate french and even english writing but there must also be in the national character an insensibility to proportion a want of that instinctive discretion which we call tact nothing short of this will account for the perpetual groping of german imaginative literature after some foreign mould in which to cast its thought or feeling now trying a louis quatorze pattern then something supposed to be shakespearian and at last going back to ancient greece or even persia goethe himself limpidly perfect as are many of his shorter poems often fails in giving artistic coherence to his longer works leaving deeper qualities wholly out of the question wilhelm meister seems a mere aggregation of episodes if compared with such a masterpiece as paul and virginia or even with a happy improvisation like the vicar of wakefield the second part of faust too is rather a reflection of goethes own changed view of life and mans relation to it than an harmonious completion of the original conception full of placid wisdom and exquisite poetry it certainly is but if we look at it as a poem it seems more as if the author had striven to get in all he could than to leave out all he might we cannot help asking what business have paper money and political economy and geognosy here we confess that thales and the homunculus weary us not a little unless indeed a poem be nothing after all but a prolonged conundrum many of schillers lyrical poemsthough the best of them find no match in modern verse for rapid energy the very axles of language kindling with swiftnessseem disproportionately long in parts and the thought too often has the life wellnigh squeezed out of it in the sevenfold coils of diction dappled though it be with splendid imagery  in german sentiment which runs over so easily into sentimentalism a foreigner cannot help being struck with a certain incongruousness what can be odder for example than the mixture of sensibility and sausages in some of goethes earlier notes to frau von stein unless to be sure the publishing them it would appear that germans were less sensible to the ludicrousand we are far from saying that this may not have its compensatory advantagesthan either the english or the french and what is the source of this sensibility if it be not an instinctive perception of the incongruous and disproportionate among all races the english has ever shown itself most keenly alive to the fear of making itself ridiculous and among all none has produced so many humorists only one of them indeed so profound as cervantes yet all masters in their several ways what englishspeaking man except boswell could have arrived at weimar as goethe did in that absurd werthermontirung and where out of germany could he have found a reigning grand duke to put his whole court into the same sentimental livery of blue and yellow leather breeches boots and all excepting only herder and that not on account of his clerical profession but of his age to be sure it might be asked also where else in europe was a prince to be met with capable of manly friendship with a man whose only decoration was his genius but the comicality of the other fact no less remains certainly the german character is in no way so little remarkable as for its humor if we were to trust the evidence of herr hubs dreary deutsche komische und humoristische dichtung we should believe that no german had even so much as a suspicion of what humor meant unless the book itself as we are half inclined to suspect be a joke in three volumes the want of fun being the real point thereof if german patriotism can be induced to find a grave delight in it we congratulate herr hubs publishers and for ourselves advise any soberminded man who may hereafter be merry not to sing psalms but to read hub as the more serious amusement of the two there are epigrams there that make life more solemn and if taken in sufficient doses would make it more precarious even jean paul the greatest of german humorous authors and never surpassed in comic conception or in the pathetic quality of humor is not to be named with his master sterne as a creative humorist what are siebenkäs fixlein schmelzle and fibel a single layfigure to be draped at will with whimsical sentiment and reflection and put in various attitudes compared with the living reality of walter shandy and his brother toby characters which we do not see merely as puppets in the authors mind but poetically projected from it in an independent being of their own heine himself the most graceful sometimes the most touching of modern poets and clearly the most easy of german humorists seems to me wanting in a refined perception of that inward propriety which is only another name for poetic proportion and shocks us sometimes with an unfläthigkeit as at the end of his deutschland which if it make germans laugh as we should be sorry to believe makes other people hold their noses such things have not been possible in english since swift and the persifleur heine cannot offer the same excuse of savage cynicism that might be pleaded for the irishman  i have hinted that herr stahrs life of lessing is not precisely the kind of biography that would have been most pleasing to the man who could not conceive that an author should be satisfied with anything more than truth in praise or anything less in criticism my respect for what lessing was and for what he did is profound in the history of literature it would be hard to find a man so stalwart so kindly so sincere148 so capable of great ideas whether in their influence on the intellect or the life so unswervingly true to the truth so free from the common weaknesses of his class since luther germany has given birth to no such intellectual athleteto no son so german to the core greater poets she has had but no greater writer no nature more finely tempered nay may we not say that great character is as rare a thing as great genius if it be not even a nobler form of it for surely it is easier to embody fine thinking or delicate sentiment or lofty aspiration in a book than in a life the written leaf if it be as some few are a safekeeper and conductor of celestial fire is secure poverty cannot pinch passion swerve or trial shake it but the man lessing harassed and striving lifelong always poor and always hopeful with no patron but his own righthand the very shuttlecock of fortune who saw ruins ploughshare drive through the hearth on which his first homefire was hardly kindled and who through all was faithful to himself to his friend to his duty and to his ideal is something more inspiring for us than the most glorious utterance of merely intellectual power the figure of goethe is grand it is rightfully preeminent it has something of the calm and something of the coldness of the immortals but the valhalla of german letters can show one form in its simple manhood statelier even than his  manliness and simplicity if they are not necessary coefficients in producing character of the purest tone were certainly leading elements in the lessing who is still so noteworthy and lovable to us when eightysix years have passed since his bodily presence vanished from among men he loved clearness he hated exaggeration in all its forms he was the first german who had any conception of style and who could be full without spilling over on all sides herr stahr we think is not just the biographer he would have chosen for himself his book is rather a panegyric than a biography there is sometimes an almost comic disproportion between the matter and the manner especially in the epic details of lessings onslaughts on the nameless herd of german authors it is as if sophocles should have given a strophe to every bullock slain by ajax in his mad foray upon the grecian commissary stores he is too fond of striking an attitude and his tone rises unpleasantly near a scream as he calls the personal attention of heaven and earth to something which lessing himself would have thought a very matterofcourse affair he who lays it down as an axiom that genius loves simplicity would hardly have been pleased to hear the letters on literature called the burning thunderbolts of his annihilating criticism or the antigötze pamphlets the hurtling arrows that sped from the bow of the immortal hero nor would he with whom accuracy was a matter of conscience have heard patiently that the letters appeared in a period distinguished for its lofty tone of mind and in their own towering boldness they are a true picture of the intrepid character of the age149 if the age was what herr stahr represents it to have been where is the great merit of lessing he would have smiled we suspect a little contemptuously at herr stahrs repeatedly quoting a certificate from the historian of the proud britons that he was the first critic in europe whether we admit or not lord macaulays competence in the matter we are sure that lessing would not have thanked his biographer for this soupticket to a ladleful of fame if ever a man stood firmly on his own feet and asked help of none that man was gotthold ephraim lessing  herr stahrs desire to make a hero of his subject and his love for sonorous sentences like those we have quoted above are apt to stand somewhat in the way of our chance at taking a fair measure of the man and seeing in what his heroism really lay he furnishes little material for a comparative estimate of lessing or for judging of the foreign influences which helped from time to time in making him what he was nothing is harder than to worry out a date from herr stahrs haystacks of praise and quotation yet dates are of special value in tracing the progress of an intellect like lessings which little actuated by an inward creative energy was commonly stirred to motion by the impulse of other minds and struck out its brightest flashes by collision with them he himself tells us that a critic should first seek out some one with whom he can contend and quotes in justification from one of aristotles commentators solet aristoteles quaerere pugnam in suis libris this lessing was always wont to do he could only feel his own strength and make others feel itcould only call it into full play in an intellectual wrestlingbout he was always anointed and ready for the ring but with this distinction that he was no mere prizefighter or bully for the side that would pay him best nor even a contender for mere sentiment but a selfforgetful champion for the truth as he saw it nor is this true of him only as a critic his more purely imaginative workshis minna his emilia his nathanwere all written not to satisfy the craving of a poetic instinct nor to rid head and heart of troublous guests by building them a lodging outside himself as goethe used to do but to prove some thesis of criticism or morals by which truth could be served his zeal for her was perfectly unselfish does one write then for the sake of being always in the right i think i have been as serviceable to truth he says when i miss her and my failure is the occasion of anothers discovering her as if i had discovered her myself150 one would almost be inclined to think from herr stahrs account of the matter that lessing had been an autochthonous birth of the german soil without intellectual ancestry or helpful kindred that this is the sufficient natural history of no original mind we need hardly say since originality consists quite as much in the power of using to purpose what it finds ready to its hand as in that of producing what is absolutely new perhaps we might say that it was nothing more than the faculty of combining the separate and therefore ineffectual conceptions of others and making them into living thought by the breath of its own organizing spirit a great man without a past if he be not an impossibility will certainly have no future he would be like those conjectural miltons and cromwells of grays imaginary hamlet the only privilege of the original man is that like other sovereign princes he has the right to call in the current coin and reissue it stamped with his own image as was the practice of lessing  herr stahrs overintensity of phrase is less offensive than amusing when applied to lessings early efforts in criticism speaking of poor old gottsched he says lessing assailed him sometimes with cutting criticism and again with exquisite humor in the notice of gottscheds poems he says among other things the exterior of the volume is so handsome that it will do great credit to the bookstores and it is to be hoped that it will continue to do so for a long time but to give a satisfactory idea of the interior surpasses our powers and in conclusion he adds these poems cost two thalers and four groschen the two thalers pay for the ridiculous and the four groschen pretty much for the useful again he tells us that lessing concludes his notice of klopstocks ode to god with these inimitably roguish words what presumption to beg thus earnestly for a woman does not a whole book of criticism lie in these nine words for a young man of twentytwo lessings criticisms show a great deal of independence and maturity of thought but humor he never had and his wit was always of the bluntestcrushing rather than cutting the mace and not the scymitar was his weapon let herr stahr put all lessings inimitably roguish words together and compare them with these few intranslatable lines from voltaires letter to rousseau thanking him for his discours sur linégalite on na jamais employé tant desprit à vouloir nous rendre bêtes il prend enviede marcher à quatre pattes quand on lit votre ouvrage lessing from the first was something far better than a wit force was always much more characteristic of him than cleverness sometimes herr stahrs heroworship leads him into positive misstatement for example speaking of lessings preface to the contributions to the history and reform of the theatre he tells us that his eye was directed chiefly to the english theatre and shakespeare lessing at that time 1749 was only twenty and knew little more than the names of any foreign dramatists except the french in this very preface his english list skips from shakespeare to dryden and in the spanish he omits calderon tirso de molina and alarcon accordingly we suspect that the date is wrongly assigned to lessings translation of toda la vida es sueño his mind was hardly yet ready to feel the strange charm of this most imaginative of calderons dramas  even where herr stahr undertakes to give us light on the sources of lessing it is something of the dimmest he attributes miss sara sampson to the influence of the merchant of london as mr evans translates it literally from the german meaning our old friend george barnwell but we are strongly inclined to suspect from internal evidence that moores more recent gamester gave the prevailing impulse and if herr stahr must needs tell us anything of the tragedy of middleclass life he ought to have known that on the english stage it preceded lillo by more than a centurywitness the yorkshire tragedyand that something very like it was even much older in france we are inclined to complain also that he does not bring out more clearly how much lessing owed to diderot both as dramatist and critic nor give us so much as a hint of what already existing english criticism did for him in the way of suggestion and guidance but though we feel it to be our duty to say so much of herr stahrs positive faults and negative shortcomings yet we leave him in very good humor while he is altogether too full upon certain points of merely transitory importancesuch as the quarrel with klotzyet we are bound to thank him both for the abundance of his extracts from lessing and for the judgment he has shown in the choice of them any one not familiar with his writings will be able to get a very good notion of the quality of his mind and the amount of his literary performance from these volumes and that after all is the chief matter as to the absolute merit of his works other than critical herr stahrs judgment is too much at the mercy of his partiality to be of great value  of mr evanss translation we can speak for the most part with high commendation there are great difficulties in translating german prose and whatever other good things herr stahr may have learned from lessing terseness and clearness are not among them we have seldom seen a translation which read more easily or was generally more faithful that mr evans should nod now and then we do not wonder nor that he should sometimes choose the wrong word we have only compared him with the original where we saw reason for suspecting a slip but though we have not found much to complain of we have found enough to satisfy us that his book will gain by a careful revision we select a few oversights mainly from the first volume as examples on page 34 comparing lessing with goethe on arriving at the university mr evans we think obscures if he does not wholly lose the meaning when he translates leben by social relations and is altogether wrong in rendering patrizier by aristocrat at the top of the next page too suspicious is not the word for bedenklich had he been writing english he would surely have said questionable on page 47 overtrodden shoes is hardly so good as the idiomatic down at the heel on page 104 a very humorous representation is oddly made to confirm the documentary evidence the reverse is meant on page 115 the sentence beginning the tendency in both needs revising on page 138 mr evans speaks of the poetical villageyounker of destouches this we think is hardly the english of le poète campagnard and almost recalls lieberkühns theory of translation toward which lessing was so unrelentingwhen i do not understand a passage why i translate it word for word on page 149 miss sara sampson is called the first social tragedy of the german drama all tragedies surely are social except the prometheus bürgerliche tragödie means a tragedy in which the protagonist is taken from common life and perhaps cannot be translated clearly into english except by tragedy of middleclass life so on page 170 we find emilia galotti called a virginia bourgeoise and on page 172 a hospital becomes a lazaretto on page 190 we have a sentence ending in this strange fashion in an episode of the english original which wieland omitted entirely one of its characters nevertheless appeared in the german tragedy on page 205 we have the seven years war called a bloody process this is mere carelessness for mr evans in the second volume translates it rightly lawsuit what english reader would know what you are intriguing me means on page 228 on page 264 vol ii we find a passage inaccurately rendered which we consider of more consequence because it is a quotation from lessing o out upon the man who claims almighty god to be a preacher of thy word and yet so impudently asserts that in order to attain thy purposes there was only one way in which it pleased thee to make thyself known to him this is very far from nur den einzigen weg gehabt den du dir gefallen lassen ihm kund zu machen the ihm is scornfully emphatic we hope professor evans will go over his version for a second edition much more carefully than we have had any occasion to do he has done an excellent service to our literature for which we heartily thank him in choosing a book of this kind to translate and translating it so well we would not look such a gift horse too narrowly in the mouth  let us now endeavor to sum up the result of lessings life and labor with what success we may  gotthold ephraim lessing was born january 22 1729 at camenz in upper lusatia the second child and eldest son of john gottfried lessing a lutheran clergyman those who believe in the persistent qualities of race or the cumulative property of culture will find something to their purpose in his saxon blood and his clerical and juristic ancestry it is worth mentioning that his grandfather in the thesis for his doctors degree defended the right to entire freedom of religious belief the name first comes to the surface in parson clement lessigk nearly three centuries ago and survives to the present day in a painter of some distinction it has almost passed into a proverb that the mothers of remarkable children have been something beyond the common if there be any truth in the theory the case of lessing was an exception as might have been inferred perhaps from the peculiarly masculine type of his character and intellect his mother was in no wise superior but his father seems to have been a man somewhat above the pedantic average of the provincial clergymen of his day and to have been a scholar in the ampler meaning of the word besides the classics he had possessed himself of french and english and was somewhat versed in the oriental languages the temper of his theology may be guessed from his having been as his son tells us with some pride one of the earliest translators of tillotson we can only conjecture him from the letters which lessing wrote to him from which we should fancy him as on the whole a decided and even choleric old gentleman in whom the wig though not a predominant was yet a notable feature and who was like many other fathers permanently astonished at the fruit of his loins he would have preferred one of the socalled learned professions for his sontheology above alland would seem to have never quite reconciled himself to his sons distinction as being in none of the three careers which alone were legitimate lessings bearing towards him always independent is really beautiful in its union of respectful tenderness with unswerving selfassertion when he wished to evade the maternal eye gotthold used in his letters to set up a screen of latin between himself and her and we conjecture the worthy pastor primarius playing over again in his study at camenz with some scruples of conscience the old trick of chaucers fox    mulier est hominis confusio   madam the sentence of this latin is   woman is mannës joy and mannës bliss  he appears to have snatched a fearful and but illconcealed joy from the sight of the first collected edition of his sons works unlike tillotson as they certainly were ah had they only been opera yet were they not volumes after all and able to stand on their own edges beside the immortals if nothing more  after grinding with privatetutor mylius the requisite time lessing entered the school of camenz and in his thirteenth year was sent to the higher institution at meissen we learn little of his career there except that theophrastus plautus and terence were already his favorite authors that he once characteristically distinguished himself by a courageous truthfulness and that he wrote a latin poem on the valor of the saxon soldiers which his father very sensibly advised him to shorten in 1750 four years after leaving the school he writes to his father i believed even when i was at meissen that one must learn much there which he cannot make the least use of in real life der welt and i now after trying leipzig and wittenberg see it all the more clearlya melancholy observation which many other young men have made under similar circumstances sent to leipzig in his seventeenth year he finds himself an awkward ungainly lad and sets diligently to perfecting himself in the somewhat unscholastic accomplishments of riding dancing and fencing he also sedulously frequents the theatre and wrote a play the young scholar which attained the honor of representation meanwhile his most intimate companion was a younger brother of his old tutor mylius a young man of more than questionable morals and who had even written a satire on the elders of camenz for whichoverconfidently trusting himself in the outraged cityhe had been fined and imprisoned so little could the german muse celebrated by klopstock for her swiftness of foot protect her son with this scandalous person and with playactors more than probably of both sexes did the young lessing share a christmas cake sent him by his mother such news was not long in reaching camenz and we can easily fancy how tragic it seemed in the little parsonage there to what cabinet councils it gave rise in the paternal study to what ominous shaking of the clerical wig in that domestic olympus a pious fraud is practised on the boy who hurries home thinly clad through the winter weather his illeaten christmas cake wringing him with remorseful indigestion to receive the last blessing if such a prodigal might hope for it of a brokenhearted mother he finds the good dame in excellent health and softened toward him by a cold he has taken on his pious journey he remains at home several months now writing anacreontics of such warmth that his sister as volunteer representative of the common hangman burns them in the family stove now composing sermons to convince his mother that he could be a preacher any daya theory of that sacred office unhappily not yet extinct at easter 1747 he gets back to leipzig again with some scant supply of money in his pocket but is obliged to make his escape thence between two days somewhere toward the middle of the next year leaving behind him some histrionic debts chiefly we fear of a certain mademoiselle lorenz for which he had confidingly made himself security stranded by want of floating or other capital at wittenberg he enters himself with help from home as a student there but soon migrates again to berlin which had been his goal when making his hegira from leipzig in berlin he remained three years applying himself to his chosen calling of author at all work by doing whatever honest job offered itselfverse criticism or translationand profitably studious in a very wide range of languages and their literature above all he learned the great secret which his stalwart english contemporary johnson also acquired of being able to dine heartily for threepence  meanwhile he continues in a kind of colonial dependence on the parsonage at camenz the bonds gradually slackening sometimes shaken a little rudely and always giving alarming hints of approaching and inevitable autonomy from the few home letters of lessing which remain covering the period before 1753 there are only eight in all we are able to surmise that a pretty constant maternal cluck and shrill paternal warning were kept up from the home coop we find lessing defending the morality of the stage and his own private morals against charges and suspicions of his parents and even making the awful confession that he does not consider the christian religion itself as a thing to be taken on trust nor a christian by mere tradition so valuable a member of society as one who has prudently doubted and by the way of examination has arrived at conviction or at least striven to arrive boyish scepticism of the superficial sort is a common phenomenon enough but the lessing variety of it seems to us sufficiently rare in a youth of twenty what strikes us mainly in the letters of these years is not merely the maturity they show though that is remarkable but the tone we see already in them the cheerful and never overweening selfconfidence which always so pleasantly distinguished lessing and that strength of tackle so seldom found in literary men which brings the mind well home to its anchor enabling it to find holding ground and secure riding in any sea what care i to live in plenty he asks gayly if i only live indeed lessing learned early and never forgot that whoever would be lifes master and not its drudge must make it a means and never allow it to become an end he could say more truly than goethe mein acker ist die zeit since he not only sowed in it the seed of thought for other men and other times but cropped it for his daily bread above all we find lessing even thus early endowed with the power of keeping his eyes wide open to what he was after to what would help or hinder hima much more singular gift than is commonly supposed among other jobs of this first berlin period he had undertaken to arrange the library of a certain herr rüdiger getting therefor his meals and other receipts whatever they may have been his father seems to have heard with anxiety that this arrangement had ceased and lessing writes to him i never wished to have anything to do with this old man longer than until i had made myself thoroughly acquainted with his great library this is now accomplished and we have accordingly parted this was in his twentyfirst year and we have no doubt from the range of scholarship which lessing had at command so young that it was perfectly true all through his life he was thoroughly german in this respect also that he never quite smelted his knowledge clear from some slag of learning  in the early part of the first berlin residence pastor primarius lessing hearing that his son meditated a movement on vienna was much exercised with fears of the temptation to popery he would be exposed to in that capital we suspect that the attraction thitherward had its source in a perhaps equally catholic but less theological magnetthe mademoiselle lorenz above mentioned let us remember the perfectly innocent passion of mozart for an actress and be comforted there is not the slightest evidence that lessings life at this time or any other though careless was in any way debauched no scandal was ever coupled with his name nor is any biographic chemistry needed to bleach spots out of his reputation what cannot be said of wieland of goethe of schiller of jean paul may be safely affirmed of this busy and singleminded man the parental fear of popery brought him a seasonable supply of money from home which enabled him to clothe himself decently enough to push his literary fortunes and put on a bold front with publishers poor enough he often was but never in so shabby a pass that he was forced to write behind a screen like johnson  it was during this first stay in berlin that lessing was brought into personal relations with voltaire through an acquaintance with the great mans secretary richier he was employed as translator in the scandalous hirschel lawsuit so dramatically set forth by carlyle in his life of frederick though lessings share in it seems to have been unknown to him the service could hardly have been other than distasteful to him but it must have been with some thrill of the anche io kind that the poor youth just fleshing his maiden pen in criticism stood face to face with the famous author with whose name all europe rang from side to side this was in february 1751 young as he was we fancy those cool eyes of his making some strange discoveries as to the real nature of that lean nightmare of jesuits and dunces afterwards the same secretary lent him the manuscript of the siècle de louis xiv and lessing thoughtlessly taking it into the country with him it was not forthcoming when called for by the author voltaire naturally enough danced with rage screamed all manner of unpleasant things about robbery and the like cashiered the secretary and was we see no reason to doubt really afraid of a pirated edition this time his cry of wolf must have had a quaver of sincerity in it herr stahr who can never keep separate the lessing as he then was and the lessing as he afterwards became takes fire at what he chooses to consider an unworthy suspicion of the frenchman and treats himself to some rather cheap indignation on the subject for ourselves we think voltaire altogether in the right and we respect lessings honesty too much to suppose with his biographer that it was this which led him years afterwards to do such severe justice to merope and other tragedies of the same author the affair happened in december 1751 and a year later lessing calls voltaire a great man and says of his amalie that it has not only beautiful passages it is beautiful throughout and the tears of a reader of feeling will justify our judgment surely there is no resentment here our only wonder would be at its being written after the hirschel business at any rate we cannot allow herr stahr to shake our faith in the sincerity of lessings motives in criticismhe could not in the soundness of the criticism itselfby tracing it up to a spring at once so petty and so personal  during a part of 1752151 lessing was at wittenberg again as student of medicine the parental notion of a strictly professional career of some kind not having yet been abandoned we must give his father the credit of having done his best in a wellmeaning paternal fashion to make his son over again in his own image and to thwart the design of nature by coaxing or driving him into the pinfold of a prosperous obscurity but gotthold with all his gifts had no talent whatever for contented routine his was a mind always in solution which the divine order of things as it is called could not precipitate into any of the traditional forms of crystallization and in which the time to come was already fermenting the principle of growth was in the young literary hack and he must obey it or die his was to the last a natura naturans never a naturata lessing seems to have done what he could to be a dutiful failure but there was something in him stronger and more sacred than even filial piety and the good old pastor is remembered now only as the father of a son who would have shared the benign oblivion of his own theological works if he could only have had his wise way with him even after never so many biographies and review articles genius continues to be a marvellous and inspiring thing at the same time considering the then condition of what was pleasantly called literature in germany there was not a little to be said on the paternal side of the question though it may not seem now a very heavy mulct to give up one son out of ten to immortalityat least the fates seldom decimate in this way lessing had now if we accept the common standard in such matters completed his education and the result may be summed up in his own words to michaelis 16th october 1754 i have studied at the fürstenschule at meissen and after that at leipzig and wittenberg but i should be greatly embarrassed if i were asked to tell what as early as his twentieth year he had arrived at some singular notions as to the uses of learning on the 20th of january 1749 he writes to his mother i found out that books indeed would make me learned but never make me a man like most men of great knowledge as distinguished from mere scholars he seems to have been always a rather indiscriminate reader and to have been fond as johnson was of browsing in libraries johnson neither in amplitude of literature nor exactness of scholarship could be deemed a match for lessing but they were alike in the power of readily applying whatever they had learned whether for purposes of illustration or argument they resemble each other also in a kind of absolute commonsense and in the force with which they could plant a direct blow with the whole weight both of their training and their temperament behind it as a critic johnson ends where lessing begins the one is happy in the lower region of the understanding the other can breathe freely in the ampler air of reason alone johnson acquired learning and stopped short from indolence at a certain point lessing assimilated it and accordingly his education ceased only with his life both had something of the intellectual sluggishness that is apt to go with great strength and both had to be baited by the antagonism of circumstances or opinions not only into the exhibition but into the possession of their entire force both may be more properly called original men than in the highest sense original writers  from 1752 to 1760 with an interval of something over two years spent in leipzig to be near a good theatre lessing was settled in berlin and gave himself wholly and earnestly to the life of a man of letters a thoroughly healthy cheerful nature he most surely had with something at first of the careless lightheartedness of youth healthy he was not always to be not always cheerful often very far from lighthearted but manly from first to last he eminently was downcast he could never be for his strongest instinct invaluable to him also as a critic was to see things as they really are and this not in the sense of a cynic but of one who measures himself as well as his circumstanceswho loves truth as the most beautiful of all things and the only permanent possession as being of one substance with the soul in a man like lessing whose character is even more interesting than his works the tone and turn of thought are what we like to get glimpses of and for this his letters are more helpful than those of most authors as might be expected of one who said of himself that in his more serious work he must profit by his first heat to accomplish anything he began we say lightheartedly he did not believe that one should thank god only for good things he who is only in good health and is willing to work has nothing to fear in the world what another man would call want i call comfort must not one often act thoughtlessly if one would provoke fortune to do something for him in his first inexperience the life of the sparrow on the housetop which we find oddly translated roof was the one he would choose for himself later in life when he wished to marry he was of another mind and perhaps discovered that there was something in the old fathers notion of a fixed position the life of the sparrow on the housetop is only right good if one need not expect any end to it if it cannot always last every day it lasts too longhe writes to ebert in 1770 yet even then he takes the manly view everything in the world has its time everything may be overlived and overlooked if one only have health nor let any one suppose that lessing full of courage as he was found professional authorship a garden of alcinoüs from creative literature he continually sought refuge and even repose in the driest drudgery of mere scholarship on the 26th of april 1768 he writes to his brother with something of his old gayety thank god the time will soon come when i cannot call a penny in the world my own but i must first earn it i am unhappy if it must be by writing and again in may 1771 among all the wretched i think him the most wretched who must work with his head even if he is not conscious of having one but what is the good of complaining lessings life if it is a noble example so far as it concerned himself alone is also a warning when another is to be asked to share it he too would have profited had he earlier learned and more constantly borne in mind the profound wisdom of that old saying si sit prudentia let the young poet however he may believe of his art that all other pleasures are not worth its pains consider well what it is to call down fire from heaven to keep the pot boiling before he commit himself to a life of authorship as something fine and easy that fire will not condescend to such office though it come without asking on ceremonial days to the free service of the altar  lessing however never would even if he could have so desecrated his better powers for a bare livelihood he always went sturdily to the market of hackwork where his learning would fetch him a price but it was only in extremest need that he would claim that benefit of clergy i am worried he writes to his brother karl 8th april 1773 and work because working is the only means to cease being so but you and vess are very much mistaken if you think that it could ever be indifferent to me under such circumstances on what i work nothing less true whether as respects the work itself or the principal object wherefor i work i have been in my life before now in very wretched circumstances yet never in such that i would have written for bread in the true meaning of the word i have begun my contributions because this work helps me  to live from one day to another it is plain that he does not call this kind of thing in any high sense writing of that he had far other notions for though he honestly disclaimed the title yet his dream was always to be a poet but he was willing to work as he claimed to be because he had one ideal higher than that of being a poet namely to be thoroughly a man to nicolai he writes in 1758 all ways of earning his bread are alike becoming to an honest man whether to split wood or to sit at the helm of state it does not concern his conscience how useful he is but how useful he would be goethes poetic sense was the minotaur to which he sacrificed everything to make a study he would soil the maiden petals of a womans soul to get the delicious sensation of a reflex sorrow he would wring a heart all that saves his egoism from being hateful is that with its immense reaches it cheats the sense into a feeling of something like sublimity a patch of sand is unpleasing a desert has all the awe of ocean lessing also felt the duty of selfculture but it was not so much for the sake of feeding fat this or that faculty as of strengthening characterthe only soil in which real mental power can root itself and find sustenance his advice to his brother karl who was beginning to write for the stage is two parts moral to one literary study ethics diligently learn to express yourself well and correctly and cultivate your own character without that i cannot conceive a good dramatic author marvellous counsel this will seem to those who think that wisdom is only to be found in the fools paradise of bohemia  we said that lessings dream was to be a poet in comparison with success as a dramatist he looked on all other achievement as inferior in kind in 1767 he writes to gleim speaking of his call to hamburg such circumstances were needed to rekindle in me an almost extinguished love for the theatre i was just beginning to lose myself in other studies which would have made me unfit for any work of genius my laocoon is now a secondary labor and yet he never fell into the mistake of overvaluing what he valued so highly his unflinching commonsense would have saved him from that as it afterwards enabled him to see that something was wanting in him which must enter into the making of true poetry whose distinction from prose is an inward one of nature and not an outward one of form while yet under thirty he assures mendelssohn that he was quite right in neglecting poetry for philosophy because only a part of our youth should be given up to the arts of the beautiful we must practise ourselves in weightier things before we die an old man who lifelong has done nothing but rhyme and an old man who lifelong has done nothing but pass his breath through a stick with holes in iti doubt much whether such an old man has arrived at what he was meant for  this period of lessings life was a productive one though none of its printed results can be counted of permanent value except his share in the letters on german literature and even these must be reckoned as belonging to the years of his apprenticeship and training for the masterworkman he afterwards became the small fry of authors and translators were hardly fitted to call out his full strength but his vivisection of them taught him the value of certain structural principles to one dissection of the fore quarter of an ass says haydon in his diary i owe my information yet even in his earliest criticisms we are struck with the same penetration and steadiness of judgment the same firm grasp of the essential and permanent that were afterwards to make his opinions law in the courts of taste for example he says of thomson that as a dramatic poet he had the fault of never knowing when to leave off he lets every character talk so long as anything can be said accordingly during these prolonged conversations the action stands still and the story becomes tedious of roderick random he says that its author is neither a richardson nor a fielding he is one of those writers of whom there are plenty among the germans and french we cite these merely because their firmness of tone seems to us uncommon in a youth of twentyfour in the letters the range is much wider and the application of principles more consequent he had already secured for himself a position among the literary men of that day and was beginning to be feared for the inexorable justice of his criticisms his fables and his miss sara sampson had been translated into french and had attracted the attention of grimm who says of them december 1754 these fables commonly contain in a few lines a new and profound moral meaning m lessing has much wit genius and invention the dissertations which follow the fables prove moreover that he is an excellent critic in berlin lessing made friendships especially with mendelssohn von kleist nicolai gleim and ramler for mendelssohn and von kleist he seems to have felt a real love for the others at most a liking as the best material that could be had it certainly was not of the juiciest he seems to have worked hard and played hard equally at home in his study and baumanns winecellar he was busy poor and happy  but he was restless we suspect that the necessity of forever picking up crumbs and their occasional scarcity made the life of the sparrow on the housetop less agreeable than he had expected the imagined freedom was not quite so free after all for necessity is as short a tether as dependence or official duty or what not and the regular occupation of grubhunting is as tame and wearisome as another moreover lessing had probably by this time sucked his friends dry of any intellectual stimulus they could yield him and when friendship reaches that pass it is apt to be anything but inspiring except mendelssohn and von kleist they were not men capable of rating him at his true value and lessing was one of those who always burn up the fuel of life at a fearful rate admirably dry as the supplies of ramler and the rest no doubt were they had not substance enough to keep his mind at the high temperature it needed and he would soon be driven to the cutting of green stuff from his own woodlot more rich in smoke than fire besides this he could hardly have been at ease among intimates most of whom could not even conceive of that intellectual honesty that total disregard of all personal interests where truth was concerned which was an innate quality of lessings mind their theory of criticism was truth or even worse if possible for all who do not belong to our set for us that delicious falsehood which is no doubt a slow poison but then so very slow their nerves were unbraced by that fierce democracy of thought trampling on all prescription all tradition in which lessing loved to shoulder his way and advance his insupportable foot what is called a heretic he says in his preface to berengarius has a very good side it is a man who at least wishes to see with his own eyes and again i know not if it be a duty to offer up fortune and life to the truth  but i know it is a duty if one undertake to teach the truth to teach the whole of it or none at all such men as gleim and ramler were mere dilettanti and could have no notion how sacred his convictions are to a militant thinker like lessing his creed as to the rights of friendship in criticism might be put in the words of selden the firm tread of whose mind was like his own opinion and affection extremely differ opinion is something wherein i go about to give reason why all the world should think as i think affection is a thing wherein i look after the pleasing of myself how little his friends were capable of appreciating this view of the matter is plain from a letter of ramler to gleim cited by herr stahr lessing had shown up the weaknesses of a certain work by the abbé batteux long ago gathered to his literary fathers as conclusively as poor old ramler himself without regard to the important fact that the abbés book had been translated by a friend horrible to think of at best thrice horrible when the friends name was ramler the impression thereby made on the friendly heart may be conceived a ray of light penetrated the rather opaque substance of herr ramlers mind and revealed to him the dangerous character of lessing i know well he says that herr lessing means to speak his own opinion andwhat is the dreadful inferenceand by suppressing others to gain air and make room for himself this disposition is not to be overcome152 fortunately not for lessings opinion always meant something and was worth having gleim no doubt sympathized deeply with the sufferer by this treason for he too had been shocked at some disrespect for la fontaine as a disciple of whom he had announced himself  berlin was hardly the place for lessing if he could not take a step in any direction without risk of treading on somebodys gouty foot this was not the last time that he was to have experience of the fact that the critics pen the more it has of truths celestial temper the more it is apt to reverse the miracle of the archangels spear and to bring out whatever is toadlike in the nature of him it touches we can well understand the sadness with which he said                der blick des forschers fand   nicht selten mehr als er zu finden wünschte  here better than anywhere we may cite something which he wrote of himself to a friend of klotz lessing it will be remembered had literally suppressed klotz what do you apprehend then from me the more faults and errors you point out to me so much the more i shall learn of you the more i learn of you the more thankful shall i bei wish you knew me more thoroughly if the opinion you have of my learning and genius geist should perhaps suffer thereby yet i am sure the idea i would like you to form of my character would gain i am not the insufferable unmannerly proud slanderous man herr klotz proclaims me it cost me a great deal of trouble and compulsion to be a little bitter against him153 ramler and the rest had contrived a nice little society for mutual admiration much like that described by goldsmith if indeed he did not convey it from the french as was not uncommon with him what have you never heard of the admirable brandellius or the ingenious mogusius one the eye and the other the heart of our university known all over the world never cried the traveller but pray inform me what brandellius is particularly remarkable for you must be little acquainted with the republic of letters said the other to ask such a question brandellius has written a most sublime panegyric on mogusius and prithee what has mogusius done to deserve so great a favor he has written an excellent poem in praise of brandellius lessing was not the man who could narrow himself to the proportions of a clique lifelong he was the terror of the brandellii and mogusii and at the signal given by him                they but now who seemed   in bigness to surpass earths giant sons   now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room   throng numberless  besides whatever other reasons leasing may have had for leaving berlin we fancy that his having exhausted whatever means it had of helping his spiritual growth was the chief nine years later he gave as a reason for not wishing to stay long in brunswick not that i do not like brunswick but because nothing comes of being long in a place which one likes154 whatever the reason leasing in 1760 left berlin for breslau where the post of secretary had been offered him under fredericks tough old general tauentzien i will spin myself in for a while like an ugly worm that i may be able to come to light again as a brilliant winged creature says his diary shortly after his leaving berlin he was chosen a member of the academy of sciences there herr stahr who has no little fondness for the footlight style of phrase says it may easily be imagined that he himself regarded his appointment as an insult rather than as an honor lessing himself merely says that it was a matter of indifference to him which is much more in keeping with his character and with the value of the intended honor  the seven years war began four years before lessing took up his abode in breslau and it may be asked how he as a saxon was affected by it we might answer hardly at all his position was that of armed neutrality long ago at leipzig he had been accused of prussian leanings now in berlin he was thought too saxon though he disclaimed any such sentiment as patriotism and called himself a cosmopolite it is plain enough that his position was simply that of a german love of country except in a very narrow parochial way was as impossible in germany then as in america during the colonial period lessing himself in the latter years of his life was librarian of one of those petty princelets who sold their subjects to be shot at in americacreatures strong enough to oppress too weak to protect their people whoever would have found a germany to love must have pieced it together as painfully as isis did the scattered bits of osiris yet he says that the true patriot is by no means extinguished in him it was the noisy ones that he could not abide and writing to gleim about his grenadier verses he advises him to soften the tone of them a little he himself being a declared enemy of imprecations which he would leave altogether to the clergy we think herr stahr makes too much of these antipatriot flings of lessing which with a single exception occur in his letters to gleim and with reference to a kind of verse that could not but be distasteful to him as needing no more brains than a drum nor other inspiration than serves a trumpet lessing undoubtedly had better uses for his breath than to spend it in shouting for either side in this bloody lawsuit as he called it in which he was not concerned he showed himself german enough and in the right way in his persistent warfare against the tyranny of french taste  he remained in breslau the better part of five years studying life in new phases gathering a library which as commonly happens he afterwards sold at great loss and writing his minna and his laocoön he accompanied tauentzien to the siege of schweidnitz where frederick was present in person he seems to have lived a rather freeandeasy life during his term of office kept shockingly late hours and learned among other things to gamblea fact for which herr stahr thinks it needful to account in a high philosophical fashion we prefer to think that there are some motives to which remarkable men are liable in common with the rest of mankind and that they may occasionally do a thing merely because it is pleasant without forethought of medicinal benefit to the mind lessings friends whose names were not as the reader might be tempted to suppose eliphaz bildad and zophar expected him to make something handsome out of his office but the pitiful result of those five years of opportunity was nothing more than an immortal book unthrifty lessing to have been so nice about your fingers and so near the mint too when your general was wise enough to make his fortune as if inkstains were the only ones that would wash out and no others had ever been covered with white kid from the sight of all reasonable men in july 1764 he had a violent fever which he turned to account in his usual cheerful way the serious epoch of my life is drawing nigh i am beginning to become a man and flatter myself that in this burning fever i have raved away the last remains of my youthful follies fortunate illness he had never intended to bind himself to an official career to his father he writes i have more than once declared that my present engagement could not continue long that i have not given up my old plan of living and that i am more than ever resolved to withdraw from any service that is not wholly to my mind i have passed the middle of my life and can think of nothing that could compel me to make myself a slave for the poor remainder of it i write you this dearest father and must write you this in order that you may not be astonished if before long you should see me once more very far removed from all hopes of or claims to a settled prosperity as it is called before the middle of the next year he was back in berlin again  there he remained for nearly two years trying the housetop way of life again but with indifferent success as we have reason to think indeed when the metaphor resolves itself into the plain fact of living just on the other side of the roofin the garret namelyand that from hand to mouth as was lessings case we need not be surprised to find him gradually beginning to see something more agreeable in a fixirtes glück than he had once been willing to allow at any rate he was willing and even heartily desirous that his friends should succeed in getting for him the place of royal librarian but frederick for some unexplained reason would not appoint him herr stahr thinks it had something to do with the old siècle manuscript business but this seems improbable for voltaires wrath was not directed against lessing and even if it had been the great king could hardly have carried the name of an obscure german author in his memory through all those anxious and warlike years whatever the cause lessing early in 1767 accepts the position of theatrical manager at hamburg as usual not too much vexed with disappointment but quoting gayly      quod non dant proceres dabit histrio  like burns he was always contented wi little and canty wi mair in connection with his place as manager he was to write a series of dramatic essays and criticisms it is to this we owe the dramaturgienext to the laocoön the most valuable of his works but lessingthough it is plain that he made his hand as light as he could and wrapped his lash in velvetsoon found that actors had no more taste for truth than authors he was obliged to drop his remarks on the special merits or demerits of players and to confine himself to those of the pieces represented by this his work gained in value and the latter part of it written without reference to a particular stage and devoted to the discussion of those general principles of dramatic art on which he had meditated long and deeply is far weightier than the rest there are few men who can put forth all their muscle in a losing race and it is characteristic of lessing that what he wrote under the dispiritment of failure should be the most lively and vigorous circumstances might be against him but he was incapable of believing that a cause could be lost which had once enlisted his conviction  the theatrical enterprise did not prosper long but lessing had meanwhile involved himself as partner in a publishing business which harassed him while it lasted and when it failed as was inevitable left him hampered with debt help came in his appointment 1770 to take charge of the duke of brunswicks library at wolfenbüttel with a salary of six hundred thalers a year this was the more welcome as he soon after was betrothed with eva könig widow of a rich manufacturer155 her husbands affairs however had been left in confusion and this with lessings own embarrassments prevented their being married till october 1776 eva könig was every way worthy of him clever womanly discreet with just enough coyness of the will to be charming when it is joined with sweetness and good sense she was the true helpmate of such a manthe serious companion of his mind and the playfellow of his affections there is something infinitely refreshing to me in the loveletters of these two persons without wanting sentiment there is such a bracing air about them as breathes from the higher levels and strongholds of the soul they show that selfpossession which can alone reserve to love the power of new selfsurrenderof never cloying because never wholly possessed here is no invasion and conquest of the weaker nature by the stronger but an equal league of souls each in its own realm still sovereign turn from such letters as these to those of st preux and julie and you are stifled with the heavy perfume of a demireps boudoirto those of herder to his caroline and you sniff no doubtful odor of professional unction from the sermoncase manly old dr johnson who could be tender and true to a plain woman knew very well what he meant when he wrote that single poetic sentence of histhe shepherd in virgil grew at last acquainted with love and found him to be a native of the rocks  in january 1778 lessings wife died from the effects of a difficult childbirth the child a boy hardly survived its birth the few words wrung out of lessing by this double sorrow are to me as deeply moving as anything in tragedy i wished for once to be as happy es so gut haben as other men but it has gone ill with me and i was so loath to lose him this son my wife is dead and i have had this experience also i rejoice that i have not many more such experiences left to make and am quite cheerful if you had known her but they say that to praise ones wife is selfpraise well then i say no more of her but if you had known her quite cheerful on the 10th of august he writes to elise reimarushe is writing to a woman now an old friend of his and his wife and will be less restrained i am left here all alone i have not a single friend to whom i can wholly confide myself how often must i curse my ever wishing to be for once as happy as other men how often have i wished myself back again in my old isolated conditionto be nothing to wish nothing to do nothing but what the present moment brings with it yet i am too proud to think myself unhappy i just grind my teeth and let the boat go as pleases wind and waves enough that i will not overset it myself it is plain from this letter that suicide had been in his mind and with his antique way of thinking on many subjects he would hardly have looked on it as a crime but he was too brave a man to throw up the sponge to fate and had work to do yet within a few days of his wifes death he wrote to eschenburg i am right heartily ashamed if my letter betrayed the least despair despair is not nearly so much my failing as levity which often expresses itself with a little bitterness and misanthropy a stoic not from insensibility or cowardice as so many are but from stoutness of heart he blushes at a moments abdication of selfcommand and he will not roil the clear memory of his love with any tinge of the sentimentality so much the fashion and to be had so cheap in that generation there is a moderation of sincerity peculiar to lessing in the epithet of the following sentence how dearly must i pay for the single year i have lived with a sensible wife werther had then been published four years lessings grief has that pathos which he praised in sculpturehe may writhe but he must not scream nor is this a new thing with him on the death of a younger brother he wrote to his father fourteen years before why should those who grieve communicate their grief to each other purposely to increase it many mourn in death what they loved not living i will love in life what nature bids me love and after death strive to bewail it as little as i can  we think herr stahr is on his stilts again when he speaks of lessings position at wolfenbüttel he calls it an assuming the chains of feudal service being buried in a corner a martyrdom that consumed the best powers of his mind and crushed him in body and spirit forever to crush forever is rather a strong phrase herr stahr to apply to the spirit if one must ever give heed to the sense as well as the sound of what one is writing but eloquence has no bowels for its victims we have no doubt the duke of brunswick meant well by lessing and the salary he paid him was as large as he would have got from the frugal frederick but one whose trade it was to be a duke could hardly have had much sympathy with his librarian after he had once found out what he really was for even if he was not as herr stahr affirms a republican and we doubt very much if he was yet he was not a man who could play with ideas in the light french fashion at the ardent touch of his sincerity they took fire and grew dangerous to what is called the social fabric the logic of wit with its momentary flash is a very different thing from that consequent logic of thought pushing forward its deliberate sap day and night with a fixed object which belonged to lessing the men who attack abuses are not so much to be dreaded by the reigning house of superstition as those who as dante says syllogize hateful truths as for the chains of feudal service they might serve a fenian headcentre on a pinch but are wholly out of place here the slavery that lessing had really taken on him was that of a great library an alcina that could always too easily witch him away from the more serious duty of his genius that a mind like his could be buried in a corner is mere twaddle and of a kind that has done great wrong to the dignity of letters whereever lessing sat was the head of the table that he suffered at wolfenbüttel is true but was it nothing to be in love and in debt at the same time and to feel that his fruition of the one must be postponed for uncertain years by his own folly in incurring the other if the sparrowlife must end surely a wee bush is better than nae beild one cause of lessings occasional restlessness and discontent herr stahr has failed to notice it is evident from many passages in his letters that he had his share of the hypochondria which goes with an imaginative temperament but in him it only serves to bring out in stronger relief his deeprooted manliness he spent no breath in that melodious whining which beginning with rousseau has hardly yet gone out of fashion work of some kind was his medicine for the bluesif not always of the kind he would have chosen then the best that was to be had for the useful too had for him a sweetness of its own sometimes he found a congenial labor in rescuing as he called it the memory of some dead scholar or thinker from the wrongs of ignorance or prejudice or falsehood sometimes in fishing a manuscript out of the ooze of oblivion and giving it after a critical cleansing to the world now and then he warmed himself and kept his muscle in trim with buffeting soundly the champions of that shallow artificiality and unctuous wordiness one of which passed for orthodox in literature and the other in theology true religion and creative genius were both so beautiful to him that he could never abide the mediocre counterfeit of either and he who put so much of his own life into all he wrote could not but hold all scripture sacred in which a divine soul had recorded itself it would be doing lessing great wrong to confound his controversial writing with the paltry quarrels of authors his own personal relations enter into them surprisingly little for his quarrel was never with men but with falsehood cant and misleading tradition in whomsoever incarnated save for this they were no longer readable and might be relegated to that herbarium of billingsgate gathered by the elder disraeli  so far from being crushed in spirit at wolfenbüttel the years he spent there were among the most productive of his life emilia galotti begun in 1758 was finished there and published in 1771 the controversy with götze by far the most important he was engaged in and the one in which he put forth his maturest powers was carried on thence his nathan the wise 1779 by which almost alone he is known as a poet outside of germany was conceived and composed there the last few years of his life were darkened by illhealth and the depression which it brings his nathan had not the success he hoped it is sad to see the strong selfsufficing man casting about for a little sympathy even for a little praise it is really needful to me that you should have some small good opinion of it nathan in order to make me once more contented with myself he writes to elise reimarus in may 1779 that he was weary of polemics and dissatisfied with himself for letting them distract him from better things appears from his last pathetic letter to the old friend he loved and valued mostmendelssohn and in truth dear friend i sorely need a letter like yours from time to time if i am not to become wholly out of humor i think you do not know me as a man that has a very hot hunger for praise but the coldness with which the world is wont to convince certain people that they do not suit it if not deadly yet stiffens one with chill i am not astonished that all i have written lately does not please you at best a passage here and there may have cheated you by recalling our better days i too was then a sound slim sapling and am now such a rotten gnarled trunk this was written on the 19th of december 1780 and on the 15th of february 1781 lessing died not quite fiftytwo years old goethe was then in his thirtysecond year and schiller ten years younger                                       of lessings relation to metaphysics the reader will find ample discussion in herr stahrs volumes we are not particularly concerned with them because his interest in such questions was purely speculative and because he was more concerned to exercise the powers of his mind than to analyze them his chief business his master impulse always was to be a man of letters in the narrower sense of the term even into theology he only made occasional raids across the border as it were and that not so much with a purpose of reform as in defence of principles which applied equally to the whole domain of thought he had even less sympathy with heterodoxy than with orthodoxy and so far from joining a party or wishing to form one would have left belief a matter of choice to the individual conscience from the bottom of my heart i hate all those people who wish to found sects for it is not error but sectarian error yes even sectarian truth that makes men unhappy or would do so if truth would found a sect156 again he says that in his theological controversies he is much less concerned about theology than about sound commonsense and only therefore prefer the old orthodox at bottom tolerant theology to the new at bottom intolerant because the former openly conflicts with sound commonsense while the latter would fain corrupt it i reconcile myself with my open enemies in order the better to be on my guard against my secret ones157 at another time he tells his brother that he has a wholly false notion of his lessings relation to orthodoxy do you suppose i grudge the world that anybody should seek to enlighten itthat i do not heartily wish that every one should think rationally about religion i should loathe myself if even in my scribblings i had any other end than to help forward those great views but let me choose my own way which i think best for this purpose and what is simpler than this way i would not have the impure water which has long been unfit to use preserved but i would not have it thrown away before we know whence to get purer orthodoxy thank god we were pretty well done with a partitionwall had been built between it and philosophy behind which each could go her own way without troubling the other but what are they doing now they are tearing down this wall and under the pretext of making us rational christians are making us very irrational philosophers we are agreed that our old religious system is false but i cannot say with you that it is a patchwork of bunglers and halfphilosophers i know nothing in the world in which human acuteness has been more displayed or exercised than in that158 lessing was always for freedom never for looseness of thought still less for laxity of principle but it must be a real freedom and not that vain struggle to become a majority which if it succeed escapes from heresy only to make heretics of the other side abire ad plures would with him have meant not bodily but spiritual death he did not love the fanaticism of innovation a whit better than that of conservatism to his sane understanding both were equally hateful as different masks of the same selfish bully coleridge said that toleration was impossible till indifference made it worthless lessing did not wish for toleration because that implies authority nor could his earnest temper have conceived of indifference but he thought it as absurd to regulate opinion as the color of the hair here too he would have agreed with selden that it is a vain thing to talk of an heretic for a man for his heart cannot think any otherwise than he does think herr stahrs chapters on this point bating a little exaltation of tone are very satisfactory though in his desire to make a leader of lessing he almost represents him as being what he shunnedthe founder of a sect the fact is that lessing only formulated in his own way a general movement of thought and what mainly interests us is that in him we see a layman alike indifferent to clerisy and heresy giving energetic and pointed utterance to those opinions of his class which the clergy are content to ignore so long as they remain esoteric at present the world has advanced to where lessing stood while the church has done its best to stand stockstill and it would be a curious were it not a melancholy spectacle to see the indifference with which the laity look on while theologians thrash their wheatless straw utterly unconscious that there is no longer any common term possible that could bring their creeds again to any point of bearing on the practical life of men fielding never made a profounder stroke of satire than in squire westerns indignant art not in the pulpit now when art got up there i never mind what dost say  as an author lessing began his career at a period when we cannot say that german literature was at its lowest ebb only because there had not yet been any floodtide that may be said to have begun with him when we say german literature we mean so much of it as has any interest outside of germany that part of the literary histories which treats of the dead waste and middle of the eighteenth century reads like a collection of obituaries and were better reduced to the conciseness of epitaph though the authors of them seem to find a melancholy pleasure much like that of undertakers in the task by which they live gottsched reigned supreme on the legitimate throne of dulness in switzerland bodmer essayed a more republican form of the same authority at that time a traveller reports eight hundred authors in zürich alone young aspirant for lettered fame in imagination clear away the lichens from their forgotten headstones and read humbly the as i am so thou must be on all everybody remembers how goethe in the seventh book of his autobiography tells the story of his visit to gottsched he enters by mistake an inner room at the moment when a frightened servant brings the discrowned potentate a periwig large enough to reach to the elbows that awful emblem of pretentious sham seems to be the best type of the literature then predominant we always fancy it set upon a pole like gesslers hat with nothing in it that was not wooden for all men to bow down before the periwig style had its natural place in the age of louis xiv and there were certainly brains under it but it had run out in france as the tiewig style of pope had in england in germany it was the mere imitation of an imitation will it be believed that gottsched recommends his art of poetry to beginners in preference to breitingers because it will enable them to produce every species of poem in a correct style while out of that no one can learn to make an ode or a cantata whoever he says buys breitingers book in order to learn how to make poems will too late regret his money159 gottsched perhaps did some service even by his advocacy of french models by calling attention to the fact that there was such a thing as style and that it was of some consequence but not one of the authors of that time can be said to survive nor to be known even by name except to germans unless it be klopstock herder wieland and gellert and the latters immortality such as it is reminds us somewhat of that lady goslings whose obituary stated that she was mentioned by mrs barbauld in her life of richardson under the name of miss m afterwards lady g klopstock himself is rather remembered for what he was than what he isan immortality of unreadableness and we much doubt if many germans put the oberon in their trunks when they start on a journey herder alone survives if not as a contributor to literature strictly so called yet as a thinker and as part of the intellectual impulse of the day but at the time though there were two parties yet within the lines of each there was a loyal reciprocity of what is called on such occasions appreciation wig ducked to wig each blockhead had a brother and there was a universal apotheosis of the mediocrity of our set if the greatest happiness of the greatest number be the true theory this was all that could be desired even lessing at one time looked up to hagedorn as the german horace if hagedorn were pleased what mattered it to horace worse almost than this was the universal pedantry the solemn bray of one pedagogue was taken up and prolonged in a thousand echoes there was not only no originality but no desire for itperhaps even a dread of it as something that would break the entente cordiale of placid mutual assurance no great writer had given that tone of goodbreeding to the language which would gain it entrance to the society of european literature no man of genius had made it a necessity of polite culture it was still as rudely provincial as the scotch of allan ramsay frederick the great was to be forgiven if with his practical turn he gave himself wholly to french which had replaced latin as a cosmopolitan tongue it had lightness ease fluency elegancein short all the good qualities that german lacked the study of french models was perhaps the best thing for german literature before it got out of longclothes it was bad only when it became a tradition and a tyranny lessing did more than any other man to overthrow this foreign usurpation when it had done its work  the same battle had to be fought on english soil also and indeed is hardly over yet for the renewed outbreak of the old quarrel between classical and romantic grew out of nothing more than an attempt of the modern spirit to free itself from laws of taste laid down by the grand siècle but we must not forget the debt which all modern prose literature owes to france it is true that machiavelli was the first to write with classic pith and point in a living language but he is for all that properly an ancient montaigne is really the first modern writerthe first who assimilated his greek and latin and showed that an author might be original and charming even classical if he did not try too hard he is also the first modern critic and his judgments of the writers of antiquity are those of an equal he made the ancients his servants to help him think in gascon french and in spite of his endless quotations began the crusade against pedantry it was not however till a century later that the reform became complete in france and then crossed the channel milton is still a pedant in his prose and not seldom even in his great poem dryden was the first englishman who wrote perfectly easy prose and he owed his style and turn of thought to his french reading his learning sits easily on him and has a modern cut so far the french influence was one of unmixed good for it rescued us from pedantry it must have done something for germany in the same direction for its effect on poetry we cannot say as much and its traditions had themselves become pedantry in another shape when lessing made an end of it he himself certainly learned to write prose of diderot and whatever herr stahr may think of it his share in the letters on german literature got its chief inspiration from france  it is in the dramaturgie that lessing first properly enters as an influence into european literature he may be said to have begun the revolt from pseudoclassicism in poetry and to have been thus unconsciously the founder of romanticism wielands translation of shakespeare had it is true appeared in 1762 but lessing was the first critic whose profound knowledge of the greek drama and apprehension of its principles gave weight to his judgment who recognized in what the true greatness of the poet consisted and found him to be really nearer the greeks than any other modern this was because lessing looked always more to the life than the formbecause he knew the classics and did not merely cant about them but if the authority of lessing by making people feel easy in their admiration for shakespeare perhaps increased the influence of his works and if his discussions of aristotle have given a new startingpoint to modern criticism it may be doubted whether the immediate effect on literature of his own critical essays was so great as herr stahr supposes surely götz and the robbers are nothing like what he would have called shakespearian and the whole sturm und drang tendency would have roused in him nothing but antipathy fixed principles in criticism are useful in helping us to form a judgment of works already produced but it is questionable whether they are not rather a hindrance than a help to living production ben jonson was a fine critic intimate with the classics as few men have either the leisure or the strength of mind to be in this age of many books and built regular plays long before they were heard of in france but he continually trips and falls flat over his metewand of classical propriety his personages are abstractions and fortunately neither his precepts nor his practice influenced any one of his greater coevals160 in breadth of understanding and the gravity of purpose that comes of it he was far above fletcher or webster but how far below either in the subtler the incalculable qualities of a dramatic poet yet ben with his principles off could soar and sing with the best of them and there are strains in his lyrics which herrick the most catullian of poets since catullus could imitate but never match a constant reference to the statutes which taste has codified would only bewilder the creative instinct criticism can at best teach writers without genius what is to be avoided or imitated it cannot communicate life and its effect when reduced to rules has commonly been to produce that correctness which is so praiseworthy and so intolerable it cannot give taste it can only demonstrate who has had it lessings essays in this kind were of service to german literature by their manliness of style whose example was worth a hundred treatises and by the stimulus there is in all original thinking could he have written such a poem as he was capable of conceiving his influence would have been far greater it is the living soul and not the metaphysical abstraction of it that is genetic in literature if to do were as easy as to know what were good to be done it was out of his own failures to reach the ideal he saw so clearly that lessing drew the wisdom which made him so admirable a critic even here too genius can profit by no experience but its own  for in spite of herr stahrs protest we must acknowledge the truth of lessings own characteristic confession that he was no poet a man of genius he unquestionably was if genius may be claimed no less for force than fineness of mindfor the intensity of conviction that inspires the understanding as much as for that apprehension of beauty which gives energy of will to imaginationbut a poetic genius he was not his mind kindled by friction in the process of thinking not in the flash of conception and its delight is in demonstration not in bodying forth his prose can leap and run his verse is always thinking of its feet yet in his minna and his emilia161 he shows one faculty of the dramatist that of construction in a higher degree than any other german162 here his critical deductions served him to some purpose the action moves rapidly there is no speechifying and the parts are coherent both plays act better than anything of goethe or schiller but it is the story that interests us and not the characters these are not it is true the incorporation of certain ideas or still worse of certain dogmas but they certainly seem something like machines by which the motive of the play is carried on and there is nothing of that interplay of plot and character which makes shakespeare more real in the closet than other dramatists with all the helps of the theatre it is a striking illustration at once of the futility of mere critical insight and of lessings want of imagination that in the emilia he should have thought a roman motive consistent with modern habits of thought and that in nathan he should have been guilty of anachronisms which violate not only the accidental truth of fact but the essential truth of character even if we allowed him imagination it must be only on the lower plane of prose for of verse as anything more than so many metrical feet he had not the faintest notion of that exquisite sympathy with the movement of the mind with every swifter or slower pulse of passion which proves it another species from prose the very greek aphroditae kai lura of speech and not merely a higher one he wanted the fineness of sense to conceive if we compare the prose of dante or milton though both were eloquent with their verse we see at once which was the most congenial to them lessing has passages of freer and more harmonious utterance in some of his most careless prose essays than can be found in his nathan from the first line to the last in the numeris lege solutis he is often snatched beyond himself and becomes truly dithyrambic in his pentameters the march of the thought is comparatively hampered and irresolute his best things are not poetically delicate but have the tougher fibre of proverbs is it not enough then to be a great prosewriter they are as rare as great poets and if lessing have the gift to stir and to dilate that something deeper than the mind which genius only can reach what matter if it be not done to music of his minor poems we need say little verse was always more or less mechanical with him and his epigrams are almost all stiff as if they were bad translations from the latin many of them are shockingly coarse and in liveliness are on a level with those of our elizabethan period herr stahr of course cannot bear to give them up even though gervinus be willing the prettiest of his shorter poems die namenhas been appropriated by coleridge who has given it a grace which it wants in the original his nathan by a poor translation of which he is chiefly known to english readers is an essay on toleration in the form of a dialogue as a play it has not the interest of minna or emilia though the germans who have a praiseworthy national stoicism where one of their great writers is concerned find in seeing it represented a grave satisfaction like that of subscribing to a monument there is a sober lustre of reflection in it that makes it very good reading but it wants the molten interfusion of thought and phrase which only imagination can achieve  as lessings mind was continually advancingalways open to new impressions and capable as very few are of apprehending the manysidedness of truthas he had the rare quality of being honest with himselfhis works seem fragmentary and give at first an impression of incompleteness but one learns at length to recognize and value this very incompleteness as characteristic of the man who was growing lifelong and to whom the selfish thought that any share of truth could be exclusively his was an impossibility at the end of the ninetyfifth number of the dramaturgie he says i remind my readers here that these pages are by no means intended to contain a dramatic system i am accordingly not bound to solve all the difficulties which i raise i am quite willing that my thoughts should seem to want connectionnay even to contradict each otherif only there are thoughts in which they my readers find material for thinking themselves i wish to do nothing more than scatter the fermenta cognitionis that is lessings great praise and gives its chief value to his worksa value indeed imperishable and of the noblest kind no writer can leave a more precious legacy to posterity than this and beside this shining merit all mere literary splendors look pale and cold there is that life in lessings thought which engenders life and not only thinks for us but makes us think not sceptical but forever testing and inquiring it is out of the cloud of his own doubt that the flash comes at last with sudden and vivid illumination flashes they indeed are his finest intuitions and of very different quality from the equable northlight of the artist he felt it and said it of himself ever so many flashes of lightning do not make daylight we speak now of those more rememberable passages where his highest individuality reveals itself in what may truly be called a passion of thought in the laocoön there is daylight of the serenest temper and never was there a better example of the discourse of reason though even that is also a fragment  but it is as a nobly original man even more than as an original thinker that lessing is precious to us and that he is so considerable in german literature in a higher sense but in the same kind he is to germans what dr johnson is to usadmirable for what he was like johnsons too but still from a loftier plane a great deal of his thought has a direct bearing on the immediate life and interests of men his genius was not a st elmos fire as it so often is with mere poetsas it was in shelley for example playing in ineffectual flame about the points of his thoughtbut was interfused with his whole nature and made a part of his very being to the germans with their weak nerve of sentimentalism his brave commonsense is a far wholesomer tonic than the cynicism of heine which is after all only sentimentalism soured his jealousy for maintaining the just boundaries whether of art or speculation may warn them to check with timely dikes the tendency of their thought to diffuse inundation their fondness in aesthetic discussion for a nomenclature subtile enough to split a hair at which even a thomist would have despaired is rebuked by the clear simplicity of his style163 but he is no exclusive property of germany as a

only after death the dustcloud of notoriety which follows and envelopes the men who drive with the wind bewilders contemporary judgment lessing while he lived had little reward for his labor but the satisfaction inherent in all work faithfully done the highest no doubt of which human nature is capable and yet perhaps not so sweet as that sympathy of which the worlds praise is but an index but if to perpetuate herself beyond the grave in healthy and ennobling influences be the noblest aspiration of the mind and its fruition the only reward she would have deemed worthy of herself then is lessing to be counted thrice fortunate every year since he was laid prematurely in the earth has seen his power for good increase and made him more precious to the hearts and intellects of men lessing said goethe would have declined the lofty title of a genius but his enduring influence testifies against himself on the other hand we have in literature other and indeed important names of men who while they lived were esteemed great geniuses but whose influence ended with their lives and who accordingly were less than they and others thought for as i have said there is no genius without a productive power that continues forever operative164     footnotes      147 g e lessing sein leben und seine werke von adolf stahr     vermehrte und verbesserte volksausgabe dritte auflage berlin 1864

greek as would serve a sophomore that     shakespeare must through conversation have possessed himself of     whatever principles of art ben jonson and the other university men     had been able to deduce from their study of the classics that they     should not have discussed these matters over their sack at the     mermaid is incredible that shakespeare who left not a drop in any     orange he squeezed could not also have got all the juice out of this     one is even more so       161 in minna and emilia lessing followed the lead of diderot     in the preface to the second edition of diderots théâtre he says     i am very conscious that my taste without diderots example and     teaching would have taken quite another direction perhaps one more     my own yet hardly one with which my understanding would in the long     run have been so well content diderots choice of prose was     dictated and justified by the accentual poverty of his mothertongue     lessing certainly revised his judgment on this point for it was not     equally applicable to german and wrote his maturer nathan in what     he took for blank verse there was much kindred between the minds of     the two men diderot always seems to us a kind of deboshed lessing     lessing was also indebted to burke hume the two wartons and hurd     among other english writers not that he borrowed anything of them     but the quickening of his own thought it should be remembered that     rousseau was seventeen diderot and sterne sixteen and winckelmann     twelve years older than lessing wieland was four years younger

this     piece minnahad upon us young people it was in fact a shining     meteor it made us aware that something higher existed than anything     whereof that feeble literary epoch had a notion the first two acts     are truly a masterpiece of exposition from which one learned much     and can always learn       163 nothing can be droller than the occasional translation by     vischer of a sentence of lessing into his own jargon       164 eckermann gespräche mit goethe iii 229     rousseau and the sentimentalists165  we have had the great professor and founder of the philosophy of vanity in england as i had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almost from day to day he left no doubt in my mind that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart or to guide his understanding but vanity with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness benevolence to the whole species and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact form the character of the new philosophy setting up for an unsocial independence this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of common labor as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius and which when paid honors the giver and the receiver and then pleads his beggary as an excuse for his crimes he melts with tenderness for those only who touch him by the remotest relation and then without one natural pang casts away as a sort of offal and excrement the spawn of his disgustful amours and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings the bear loves licks and forms her young but bears are not philosophers  this was burkes opinion of the only contemporary who can be said to rival him in fervid and sustained eloquence to surpass him in grace and persuasiveness of style perhaps we should have been more thankful to him if he had left us instead a record of those proceedings almost from day to day which he had such good opportunities of knowing but it probably never entered his head that posterity might care as much about the doings of the citizen of geneva as about the sayings of even a british right honorable vanity eludes recognition by its victims in more shapes and more pleasing than any other passion and perhaps had mr burke been able imaginatively to translate swiss jean jacques into irish edmund he would have found no juster equivalent for the obnoxious trisyllable than righteous selfesteem for burke was himself also in the subtler sense of the word a sentimentalist that is a man who took what would now be called an aesthetic view of morals and politics no man who ever wrote english except perhaps mr ruskin more habitually mistook his own personal likes and dislikes tastes and distastes for general principles and this it may be suspected is the secret of all merely eloquent writing he hints at madness as an explanation of rousseau and it is curious enough that mr buckle was fain to explain him in the same way it is not we confess a solution that we find very satisfactory in this latter case burkes fury against the french revolution was nothing more than was natural to a desperate man in selfdefence it was his own life or at least all that made life dear to him that was in danger he had all that abstract political wisdom which may be naturally secreted by a magnanimous nature and a sensitive temperament absolutely none of that roughandtumble kind which is so needful for the conduct of affairs fastidiousness is only another form of egotism and all men who know not where to look for truth save in the narrow well of self will find their own image at the bottom and mistake it for what they are seeking burkes hatred of rousseau was genuine and instinctive it was so genuine and so instinctive as no hatred can be but that of self of our own weaknesses as we see them in another man but there was also something deeper in it than this there was mixed with it the natural dread in the political diviner of the political logicianin the empirical of the theoretic statesman burke confounding the idea of society with the form of it then existing would have preserved that as the only specific against anarchy rousseau assuming that society as it then existed was but another name for anarchy would have reconstituted it on an ideal basis the one has left behind him some of the profoundest aphorisms of political wisdom the other some of the clearest principles of political science the one clinging to divine right found in the fact that things were a reason that they ought to be the other aiming to solve the problem of the divine order would deduce from that abstraction alone the claim of anything to be at all there seems a mere oppugnancy of nature between the two and yet both were in different ways the dupes of their own imaginations  now let us hear the opinion of a philosopher who was a bear whether bears be philosophers or not boswell had a genuine relish for what was superior in any way from genius to claret and of course he did not let rousseau escape him one evening at the mitre johnson said sarcastically to me it seems sir you have kept very good company abroadrousseau and wilkes i answered with a smile my dear sir you dont call rousseau bad company do you really think him a bad man johnson sir if you are talking jestingly of this i dont talk with you if you mean to be serious i think him one of the worst of men a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society as he has been three or four nations have expelled him and it is a shame that he is protected in this country rousseau sir is a very bad man i would sooner sign a sentence for his transportation than that of any felon who has gone from the old bailey these many years yes i should like to have him work in the plantations we were the plantations then and rousseau was destined to work there in another and much more wonderful fashion than the gruff old ursa major imagined however there is always a refreshing heartiness in his growl a masculine bass with no snarl in it the doctors logic is of that fine old crusted port sort the native manufacture of the british conservative mind three or four nations have therefore england ought a few years later had the doctor been living if three or four nations had treated their kings as france did hers would he have thought the ergo a very stringent one for england  mr burke who could speak with studied respect of the prince of wales and of his vices with that charity which thinketh no evil and can afford to think no evil of so important a living member of the british constitution surely could have had no unmixed moral repugnance for rousseaus disgustful amours it was because they were his that they were so loathsome mr burke was a snob though an inspired one dr johnson the friend of that wretchedest of lewd fellows richard savage and of that gay man about town topham beauclerkhimself sprung from an amour that would have been disgustful had it not been royalmust also have felt something more in respect of rousseau than the mere repugnance of virtue for vice we must sometimes allow to personal temperament its right of peremptory challenge johnson had not that fine sensitiveness to the political atmosphere which made burke presageful of coming tempest but both of them felt that there was something dangerous in this man their dislike has in it somewhat of the energy of fear neither of them had the same feeling toward voltaire the man of supreme talent but both felt that what rousseau was possessed by was genius with its terrible force either to attract or repel    by the pricking of my thumbs   something wicked this way comes  burke and johnson were both of them sincere men both of them men of character as well as of intellectual force and we cite their opinions of rousseau with the respect which is due to an honest conviction which has apparent grounds for its adoption whether we agree with it or no but it strikes us as a little singular that one whose life was so full of moral inconsistency whose character is so contemptible in many ways in some we might almost say so revolting should yet have exercised so deep and lasting an influence and on minds so various should still be an object of minute and earnest discussionthat he should have had such vigor in his intellectual loins as to have been the father of châteaubriand byron lamartine george sand and many more in literature in politics of jefferson and thomas painethat the spots he had haunted should draw pilgrims so unlike as gibbon and napoleon nay should draw them still after the lapse of near a century surely there must have been a basis of sincerity in this man seldom matched if it can prevail against so many reasons for repugnance aversion and even disgust he could not have been the mere sentimentalist and rhetorician for which the roughandready understanding would at first glance be inclined to condemn him in a certain sense he was both of these but he was something more it will bring us a little nearer the point we are aiming at if we quote one other and more recent english opinion of him  mr thomas moore returning pleasantly in a travellingcarriage from a trip to italy in which he had never forgotten the poetical shop at home but had carefully noted down all the pretty images that occurred to him for future usemr thomas moore on his way back from a visit to his noble friend byron at venice who had there been leading a life so gross as to be talked about even amid the crash of napoleons fall and who was just writing don juan for the improvement of the worldmr thomas moore fresh from the reading of byrons memoirs which were so scandalous that by some hocuspocus three thousand guineas afterward found their way into his own pocket for consenting to suppress themmr thomas moore the cidevant friend of the prince regent and the author of littles poems among other objects of pilgrimage visits les charmettes where rousseau had lived with madame de warens so good an opportunity for occasional verses was not to be lost so good a text for a little virtuous moralizing not to be thrown away and accordingly mr moore pours out several pages of octosyllabic disgust at the sensuality of the dead man of genius there was no horror for byron toward him all was suavity and decorous bienséance that lively sense of benefits to be received made the irish anacreon wink with both his little eyes in the judgment of a liberal like mr moore were not the errors of a lord excusable but with poor rousseau the case was very different the son of a watchmaker an outcast from boyhood up always on the perilous edge of povertywhat right had he to indulge himself in any immoralities so it is always with the sentimentalists it is never the thing in itself that is bad or good but the thing in its relation to some conventional and mostly selfish standard moore could be a moralist in this case without any trouble and with the advantage of winning lord lansdownes approval he could write some graceful verses which everybody would buy and for the rest it is not hard to be a stoic in eightsyllable measure and a travellingcarriage the next dinner at bowood will taste none the worse accordingly he speaks of                  the mire the strife   and vanities of this mans life   who more than all that eer have glowed   with fancys flame and it was his   in fullest warmth and radiance showed   what an impostor genius is   how with that strong mimetic art   which forms its life and soul it takes   all shapes of thought all hues of heart   nor feels itself one throb it wakes   how like a gem its light may shine   oer the dark path by mortals trod   itself as mean a worm the while   as crawls at midnight oer the sod                                         how with the pencil hardly dry   from coloring up such scenes of love   and beauty as make young hearts sigh   and dream and think through heaven they rove c c  very spirited is it not one has only to overlook a little threadbareness in the similes and it is very good oratorical verse but would we believe in it we must never read mr moores own journal and find out how thin a piece of veneering his own life washow he lived in sham till his very nature had become subdued to it till he could persuade himself that a sham could be written into a reality and actually made experiment thereof in his diary  one verse in this diatribe deserves a special comment    what an impostor genius is  in two respects there is nothing to be objected to in it it is of eight syllables and is rhymes unexceptionably with his but is there the least filament of truth in it we venture to assert not the least it was not rousseaus genius that was an impostor it was the one thing in him that was always true we grant that in allowing that a man has genius talent is that which is in a mans power genius is that in whose power a man is that is the very difference between them we might turn the tables on moore the man of talent and say truly enough what an impostor talent is moore talks of the mimetic power with a total misapprehension of what it really is the mimetic power had nothing whatever to do with the affair rousseau had none of it shakespeare had it in excess but what difference would it make in our judgment of hamlet or othello if a manuscript of shakespeares memoirs should turn up and we should find out that he had been a pitiful fellow none in the world for he is not a professed moralist and his life does not give the warrant to his words but if demosthenes after all his philippies throws away his shield and runs we feel the contemptibleness of the contradiction with genius itself we never find any fault it would be an overnicety that would do that we do not get invited to nectar and ambrosia so often that we think of grumbling and saying we have better at home no the same genius that mastered him who wrote the poem masters us in reading it and we care for nothing outside the poem itself how the author lived what he wore how he lookedall that is mere gossip about which we need not trouble ourselves whatever he was or did somehow or other god let him be worthy to write this and that is enough for us we forgive everything to the genius we are inexorable to the man shakespeare goethe burnswhat have their biographies to do with us genius is not a question of character it may be sordid like the lamp of aladdin in its externals what care we while the touch of it builds palaces for us makes us rich as only men in dreamland are rich and lords to the utmost bound of imagination so when people talk of the ungrateful way in which the world treats its geniuses they speak unwisely there is no work of genius which has not been the delight of mankind no word of genius to which the human heart and soul have not sooner or later responded but the man whom the genius takes possession of for its pen for its trowel for its pencil for its chisel him the world treats according to his deserts does burns drink it sets him to gauging casks of gin for remember it is not to the practical world that the genius appeals it is the practical world which judges of the mans fitness for its uses and has a right so to judge no amount of patronage could have made distilled liquors less toothsome to robbie burns as no amount of them could make a burns of the ettrick shepherd  there is an old story in the gesta romanorum of a priest who was found fault with by one of his parishioners because his life was in painful discordance with his teaching so one day he takes his critic out to a stream and giving him to drink of it asks him if he does not find it sweet and pure water the parishioner having answered that it was is taken to the source and finds that what had so refreshed him flowed from between the jaws of a dead dog let this teach thee said the priest that the very best doctrine may take its rise in a very impure and disgustful spring and that excellent morals may be taught by a man who has no morals at all it is easy enough to see the fallacy here had the man known beforehand from what a carrion fountainhead the stream issued he could not have drunk of it without loathing had the priest merely bidden him to look at the stream and see how beautiful it was instead of tasting it it would have been quite another matter and this is precisely the difference between what appeals to our aesthetic and to our moral sense between what is judged of by the taste and the conscience  it is when the sentimentalist turns preacher of morals that we investigate his character and are justified in so doing he may express as many and as delicate shades of feeling as he likesfor this the sensibility of his organization perfectly fits him no other person could do it so wellbut the moment he undertakes to establish his feeling as a rule of conduct we ask at once how far are his own life and deed in accordance with what he preaches for every man feels instinctively that all the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action and that while tenderness of feeling and susceptibility to generous emotions are accidents of temperament goodness is an achievement of the will and a quality of the life fine words says our homely old proverb butter no parsnips and if the question be how to render those vegetables palatable an ounce of butter would be worth more than all the orations of cicero the only conclusive evidence of a mans sincerity is that he give himself for a principle words money all things else are comparatively easy to give away but when a man makes a gift of his daily life and practice it is plain that the truth whatever it may be has taken possession of him from that sincerity his words gain the force and pertinency of deeds and his money is no longer the pale drudge twixt man and man but by a beautiful magic what erewhile bore the image and superscription of caesar seems now to bear the image and superscription of god it is thus that there is a genius for goodness for magnanimity for selfsacrifice as well as for creative art and it is thus that by a more refined sort of platonism the infinite beauty dwells in and shapes to its own likeness the soul which gives it body and individuality but when moore charges genius with being an impostor the confusion of his ideas is pitiable there is nothing so true so sincere so downright and forthright as genius it is always truer than the man himself is greater than he if shakespeare the man had been as marvellous a creature as the genius that wrote his plays that genius so comprehensive in its intelligence so wise even in its play that its clowns are moralists and philosophers so penetrative that a single one of its phrases reveals to us the secret of our own character would his contemporaries have left us so wholly without record of him as they have done distinguishing him in no wise from his fellowplayers  rousseau no doubt was weak nay more than that was sometimes despicable but yet is not fairly to be reckoned among the herd of sentimentalists it is shocking that a man whose preaching made it fashionable for women of rank to nurse their own children should have sent his own as soon as born to the foundling hospital still more shocking that in a note to his discours sur linégalité he should speak of this crime as one of the consequences of our social system but for all that there was a faith and an ardor of conviction in him that distinguish him from most of the writers of his time nor were his practice and his preaching always inconsistent he contrived to pay regularly whatever his own circumstances were a pension of one hundred livres a year to a maternal aunt who had been kind to him in childhood nor was his asceticism a sham he might have turned his gift into laced coats and châteaux as easily as voltaire had he not held it too sacred to be bartered away in any such losing exchange  but what is worthy of especial remark is thisthat in nearly all that he wrote his leading object was the good of his kind and that through all the vicissitudes of a life which illness sensibility of temperament and the approaches of insanity rendered wretchedthe associate of infidels the foundling child as it were of an age without belief least of all in itselfhe professed and evidently felt deeply a faith in the goodness both of man and of god there is no such thing as scoffing in his writings on the other hand there is no stereotyped morality he does not ignore the existence of scepticism he recognizes its existence in his own nature meets it frankly face to face and makes it confess that there are things in the teaching of christ that are deeper than its doubt the influence of his early education at geneva is apparent here an intellect so acute as his trained in the school of calvin in a republic where theological discussion was as much the amusement of the people as the opera was at paris could not fail to be a good logician he had the fortitude to follow his logic wherever it led him if the very impressibility of character which quickened his perception of the beauties of nature and made him alive to the charm of music and musical expression prevented him from being in the highest sense an original writer and if his ideas were mostly suggested to him by books yet the clearness consecutiveness and eloquence with which he stated and enforced them made them his own there was at least that original fire in him which could fuse them and run them in a novel mould his power lay in this very ability of manipulating the thoughts of others fond of paradox he doubtless was but he had a way of putting things that arrested attention and excited thought it was perhaps this very sensibility of the surrounding atmosphere of feeling and speculation which made rousseau more directly influential on contemporary thought or perhaps we should say sentiment than any writer of his time and this is rarely consistent with enduring greatness in literature it forces us to remember against our will the oratorical character of his works they were all pleas and he a great advocate with europe in the jurybox enthusiasm begets enthusiasm eloquence produces conviction for the moment but it is only by truth to nature and the everlasting intuitions of mankind that those abiding influences are won that enlarge from generation to generation rousseau was in many respectsas great pleaders always area man of the day who must needs become a mere name to posterity yet he could not but have had in him some not inconsiderable share of that principle by which man eternizes himself for it is only to such that the night cometh not in which no man shall work and he is still operative both in politics and literature by the principles he formulated or the emotions to which he gave a voice so piercing and so sympathetic  in judging rousseau it would be unfair not to take note of the malarious atmosphere in which he grew up the constitution of his mind was thus early infected with a feverish taint that made him shiveringly sensitive to a temperature which hardier natures found bracing to him this rough world was but too literally a rack goodhumored mother nature commonly imbeds the nerves of her children in a padding of selfconceit that serves as a buffer against the ordinary shocks to which even a life of routine is liable and it would seem at first sight as if rousseau had been better cared for than usual in this regard but as his selfconceit was enormous so was the reaction from it proportionate and the fretting suspiciousness of temper sure mark of an unsound mind which rendered him incapable of intimate friendship while passionately longing for it became inevitably when turned inward a tormenting selfdistrust to dwell in unrealities is the doom of the sentimentalist but it should not be forgotten that the same fitful intensity of emotion which makes them real as the means of elation gives them substance also for torture too irritably jealous to endure the rude society of men he steeped his senses in the enervating incense that women are only too ready to burn if their friendship be a safeguard to the other sex their homage is fatal to all but the strongest and rousseau was weak both by inheritance and early training his father was one of those feeble creatures for whom a fine phrase could always satisfactorily fill the void that nonperformance leaves behind it if he neglected duty he made up for it by that cultivation of the finer sentiments of our common nature which waters flowers of speech with the brineless tears of a flabby remorse without one fibre of resolve in it and which impoverishes the character in proportion as it enriches the vocabulary he was a very apicius in that digestible kind of woe which makes no man leaner and had a favorite receipt for cooking you up a sorrow à la douleur inassouvie that had just enough delicious sharpness in it to bring tears into the eyes by tickling the palate when he said to me jean jacques let us speak of thy mother i said to him well father we are going to weep then and this word alone drew tears from him ah  said he groaning give her back to me console me for her fill the void she has left in my soul alas in such cases the void she leaves is only that she found the grief that seeks any other than its own society will erelong want an object this admirable parent allowed his son to become an outcast at sixteen without any attempt to reclaim him in order to enjoy unmolested a petty inheritance to which the boy was entitled in right of his mother this conduct rousseau tells us of a father whose tenderness and virtue were so well known to me caused me to make reflections on myself which have not a little contributed to make my heart sound i drew from it this great maxim of morals the only one perhaps serviceable in practice to avoid situations which put our duties in opposition to our interest and which show us our own advantage in the wrong of another sure that in such situations however sincere may be ones love of virtue it sooner or later grows weak without our perceiving it and that we become unjust and wicked in action without having ceased to be just and good in soul  this maxim may do for that fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and unbreathed that never sallies out and seeks its adversary which milton could not praisethat is for a manhood whose distinction it is not to be manlybut it is chiefly worth notice as being the characteristic doctrine of sentimentalism this disjoining of deed from will of practice from theory is to put asunder what god has joined by an indissoluble sacrament the soul must be tainted before the action become corrupt and there is no selfdelusion more fatal than that which makes the conscience dreamy with the anodyne of lofty sentiments while the life is grovelling and sensualwitness coleridge in his case we feel something like disgust but where as in his son hartley there is hereditary infirmity where the man sees the principle that might rescue him slip from the clutch of a nerveless will like a rope through the fingers of a drowning man and the confession of faith is the moan of despair there is room for no harsher feeling than pity rousseau showed through life a singular proneness for being convinced by his own eloquence he was always his own first convert and this reconciles his power as a writer with his weakness as a man he and all like him mistake emotion for conviction velleity for resolve the brief eddy of sentiment for the midcurrent of evergathering faith in duty that draws to itself all the affluents of conscience and will and gives continuity of purpose to life they are like men who love the stimulus of being under conviction as it is called who forever getting religion never get capital enough to retire upon and spend for their own need and the common service  the sentimentalist is the spiritual hypochondriac with whom fancies become facts while facts are a discomfort because they will not be evaporated into fancy in his eyes theory is too fine a dame to confess even a countrycousinship with coarse handed practice whose homely ways would disconcert her artificial world the very susceptibility that makes him quick to feel makes him also incapable of deep and durable feeling he loves to think he suffers and keeps a pet sorrow a bluedevil familiar that goes with him everywhere like paracelsuss black dog he takes good care however that it shall not be the true sulphurous article that sometimes takes a fancy to fly away with his conjurer rené says in my madness i had gone so far as even to wish i might experience a misfortune so that my suffering might at least have a real object but no selfishness is only active egotism and there is nothing and nobody with a single exception which this sort of creature will not sacrifice rather than give any other than an imaginary pang to his idol vicarious pain he is not unwilling to endure nay will even commit suicide by proxy like the german poet who let his wife kill herself to give him a sensation had young jerusalem been anything like goethes portrait of him in werther he would have taken very good care not to blow out the brains which he would have thought only too precious real sorrows are uncomfortable things but purely aesthetic ones are by no means unpleasant and i have always fancied the handsome young wolfgang writing those distracted letters to auguste stolberg with a lookingglass in front of him to give back an image of his desolation and finding it rather pleasant than otherwise to shed the tear of sympathy with self that would seem so bitter to his fair correspondent the tears that have real salt in them will keep they are the difficult manly tears that are shed in secret but the pathos soon evaporates from that freshwater with which a man can bedew a dead donkey in public while his wife is having a good cry over his neglect of her at home we do not think the worse of goethe for hypothetically desolating himself in the fashion aforesaid for with many constitutions it is as purely natural a crisis as dentition which the stronger worry through and turn out very sensible agreeable fellows but where there is an arrest of development and the heartbreak of the patient is audibly prolonged through life we have a spectacle which the toughest heart would wish to get as far away from as possible  we would not be supposed to overlook the distinction too often lost sight of between sentimentalism and sentiment the latter being a very excellent thing in its way as genuine things are apt to be sentiment is intellectualized emotion emotion precipitated as it were in pretty crystals by the fancy this is the delightful staple of the poets of social life like horace and béranger or thackeray when he too rarely played with verse it puts into words for us that decorous average of feeling to the expression of which society can consent without danger of being indiscreetly moved it is excellent for people who are willing to save their souls alive to any extent that shall not be discomposing it is even satisfying till some deeper experience has given us a hunger which what we so glibly call the world cannot sate just as a waterice is nourishment enough to a man who has had his dinner it is the sufficing lyrical interpreter of those lighter hours that should make part of every healthy mans day and is noxious only when it palls mens appetite for the truly profound poetry which is very passion of very soul sobered by afterthought and embodied in eternal types by imagination true sentiment is emotion ripened by a slow ferment of the mind and qualified to an agreeable temperance by that taste which is the conscience of polite society but the sentimentalist always insists on taking his emotion neat and as his sense gradually deadens to the stimulus increases his dose till he ends in a kind of moral deliquium at first the debaucher he becomes at last the victim of his sensations  among the ancients we find no trace of sentimentalism their masculine mood both of body and mind left no room for it and hence the bracing quality of their literature compared with that of recent times its tonic property that seems almost too astringent to palates relaxed by a daintier diet the first great example of the degenerate modern tendency was petrarch who may be said to have given it impulse and direction a more perfect specimen of the type has not since appeared an intellectual voluptuary a moral dilettante the first instance of that character since too common the gentleman in search of a sensation seeking a solitude at vaucluse because it made him more likely to be in demand at avignon praising philosophic poverty with a sharp eye to the next rich benefice in the gift of his patron commending a good life but careful first of a good living happy only in seclusion but making a dangerous journey to enjoy the theatrical show of a coronation in the capitol cherishing a fruitless passion which broke his heart three or four times a year and yet could not make an end of him till he had reached the ripe age of seventy and survived his mistress a quarter of a centurysurely a more exquisite perfection of inconsistency would be hard to find  when petrarch returned from his journey into the north of europe in 1332 he balanced the books of his unrequited passion and finding that he had now been in love seven years thought the time had at last come to call deliberately on death had death taken him at his word he would have protested that he was only in fun for we find him always taking good care of an excellent constitution avoiding the plague with commendable assiduity and in the very year when he declares it absolutely essential to his peace of mind to die for good and all taking refuge in the fortress of capranica from a wholesome dread of having his throat cut by robbers there is such a difference between dying in a sonnet with a cambric handkerchief at ones eyes and the prosaic reality of demise certified in the parish register practically it is inconvenient to be dead among other things it puts an end to the manufacture of sonnets but there seems to have been an excellent understanding between petrarch and death for he was brought to that grisly monarchs door so often that otherwise nothing short of a miracle or the nine lives of that animal whom love also makes lyrical could have saved him i consent he cries to live and die in africa among its serpents upon caucasus or atlas if while i live to breathe a pure air and after my death a little corner of earth where to bestow my body may be allowed me this is all i ask but this i cannot obtain doomed always to wander and to be a stranger everywhere o fortune fortune fix me at last to some one spot i do not covet thy favors let me enjoy a tranquil poverty let me pass in this retreat the few days that remain to me  the pathetic stop of petrarchs poetical organ was one he could pull out at pleasureand indeed we soon learn to distrust literary tears as the cheap subterfuge for want of real feeling with natures of this quality solitude with him was but the pseudonyme of notoriety poverty was the archdeaconry of parma with other ecclesiastical pickings during his retreat at vaucluse in the very height of that divine sonneteering love of laura of that sensitive purity which called avignon babylon and rebuked the sinfulness of clement he was himself begetting that kind of children which we spell with a b we believe that if messer francesco had been present when the woman was taken in adultery he would have flung the first stone without the slightest feeling of inconsistency nay with a sublime sense of virtue the truth is that it made very little difference to him what sort of proper sentiment he expressed provided he could do it elegantly and with unction  would any one feel the difference between his faint abstractions and the platonism of a powerful nature fitted alike for the withdrawal of ideal contemplation and for breasting the storms of lifewould any one know how wide a depth divides a noble friendship based on sympathy of pursuit and aspiration on that mutual help which souls capable of selfsustainment are the readiest to give or to take and a simulated passion true neither to the spiritual nor the sensual part of manlet him compare the sonnets of petrarch with those which michel angelo addressed to vittoria colonna in them the airiest pinnacles of sentiment and speculation are buttressed with solid masonwork of thought and of an actual not fancied experience and the depth of feeling is measured by the sobriety and reserve of expression while in petrarchs all ingenuousness is frittered away into ingenuity both are cold but the coldness of the one is selfrestraint while the other chills with pretence of warmth in michel angelos you feel the great architect in petrarchs the artist who can best realize his conception in the limits of a cherrystone and yet this man influenced literature longer and more widely than almost any other in modern times so great is the charm of elegance so unreal is the larger part of what is written  certainly i do not mean to say that a work of art should be looked at by the light of the artists biography or measured by our standard of his character nor do i reckon what was genuine in petrarchhis love of letters his refinement his skill in the superficial graces of language that rhetorical art by which the music of words supplants their meaning and the verse moulds the thought instead of being plastic to itafter any such fashion i have no ambition for that character of valet de chambre which is said to disenchant the most heroic figures into mere everyday personages for it implies a mean soul no less than a servile condition but we have a right to demand a certain amount of reality however small in the emotion of a man who makes it his business to endeavor at exciting our own we have a privilege of nature to shiver before a painted flame how cunningly soever the colors be laid on yet our love of minute biographical detail our desire to make ourselves spies upon the men of the past seems so much of an instinct in us that we must look for the spring of it in human nature and that somewhat deeper than mere curiosity or love of gossip it should seem to arise from what must be considered on the whole a creditable feeling namely that we value character more than any amount of talentthe skill to be something above that of doing anything but the best of its kind the highest creative genius and that only is privileged from arrest by this personality for there the thing produced is altogether disengaged from the producer but in natures incapable of this escape from themselves the author is inevitably mixed with his work and we have a feeling that the amount of his sterling character is the security for the notes he issues especially we feel so when truth to self which is always selfforgetful and not truth to nature makes an essential part of the value of what is offered us as where a man undertakes to narrate personal experience or to enforce a dogma this is particularly true as respects sentimentalists because of their intrusive selfconsciousness for there is no more universal characteristic of human nature than the instinct of men to apologize to themselves for themselves and to justify personal failings by generalizing them into universal laws a man would be the keenest devils advocate against himself were it not that he has always taken a retaining fee for the defence for we think that the indirect and mostly unconscious pleas in abatement which we read between the lines in the works of many authors are oftener written to set themselves right in their own eyes than in those of the world and in the real life of the sentimentalist it is the same he is under the wretched necessity of keeping up at least in public the character he has assumed till he at last reaches that last shift of bankrupt selfrespect to play the hypocrite with himself lamartine after passing round the hat in europe and america takes to his bed from wounded pride when the french senate votes him a subsidy and sheds tears of humiliation ideally he resents it in practical coin he will accept the shame without a wry face  george sand speaking of rousseaus confessions says that an autobiographer always makes himself the hero of his own novel and cannot help idealizing even if he would but the weak point of all sentimentalists is that they always have been and always continue under every conceivable circumstance to be their own ideals whether they are writing their own lives or no rousseau opens his book with the statement i am not made like any of those i have seen i venture to believe myself unlike any that exists if i am not worth more at least i am different o exquisite cunning of selfflattery it is this very imagined difference that makes us worth more in our own foolish sight for while all men are apt to think or to persuade themselves that they think all other men their accomplices in vice or weakness they are not difficult of belief that they are singular in any quality or talent on which they hug themselves more than this people who are truly original are the last to find it out for the moment we become conscious of a virtue it has left us or is getting ready to go originality does not consist in a fidgety assertion of selfhood but in the faculty of getting rid of it altogether that the truer genius of the man which commerces with universal nature and with other souls through a common sympathy with that may take all his powers wholly to itselfand the truly original man could no more be jealous of his peculiar gift than the grass could take credit to itself for being green what is the reason that all children are geniuses though they contrive so soon to outgrow that dangerous quality except that they never crossexamine themselves on the subject the moment that process begins their speech loses its gift of unexpectedness and they become as tediously impertinent as the rest of us  if there never was any one like him if he constituted a genus in himself to what end write confessions in which no other human being could ever be in a condition to take the least possible interest all men are interested in montaigne in proportion as all men find more of themselves in him and all men see but one image in the glass which the greatest of poets holds up to nature an image which at once startles and charms them with its familiarity fabulists always endow their animals with the passions and desires of men but if an ox could dictate his confessions what glimmer of understanding should we find in those bovine confidences unless on some theory of pre existence some blank misgiving of a creature moving about in worlds not realized the truth is that we recognize the common humanity of rousseau in the very weakness that betrayed him into this conceit of himself we find he is just like the rest of us in this very assumption of essential difference for among all animals man is the only one who tries to pass for more than he is and so involves himself in the condemnation of seeming less  but it would be sheer waste of time to hunt rousseau through all his doublings of inconsistency and run him to earth in every new paradox his first two books attacked one of them literature and the other society but this did not prevent him from being diligent with his pen nor from availing himself of his credit with persons who enjoyed all the advantages of that inequality whose evils he had so pointedly exposed indeed it is curious how little practical communism there has been how few professors it has had who would not have gained by a general dividend it is perhaps no frantic effort of generosity in a philosopher with ten crowns in his pocket when he offers to make common stock with a neighbor who has ten thousand of yearly income nor is it an uncommon thing to see such theories knocked clean out of a mans head by the descent of a thumping legacy but consistent or not rousseau remains permanently interesting as the highest and most perfect type of the sentimentalist of genius his was perhaps the acutest mind that was ever mated with an organization so diseased the brain most farreaching in speculation that ever kept itself steady and worked out its problems amid such disordered tumult of the nerves166 his letter to the archbishop of paris admirable for its lucid power and soberness of tone and his rousseau juge de jean jacques which no man can read and believe him to have been sane show him to us in his strength and weakness and give us a more charitable let us hope therefore a truer notion of him than his own apology for himself that he was a man of genius appears unmistakably in his impressibility by the deeper meaning of the epoch in which he lived before an eruption clouds steeped through and through with electric life gather over the crater as if in sympathy and expectation as the mountain heaves and cracks these vapory masses are seamed with fire as if they felt and answered the dumb agony that is struggling for utterance below just such flashes of eager sympathetic fire break continually from the cloudy volumes of rousseau the result at once and the warning of that convulsion of which paris was to be the crater and all europe to feel the spasm there are symptoms enough elsewhere of that want of faith in the existing order which made the revolution inevitableeven so shallow an observer as horace walpole could forebode it so early as 1765but rousseau more than all others is the unconscious expression of the groping after something radically new the instinct for a change that should be organic and pervade every fibre of the social and political body freedom of thought owes far more to the jester voltaire who also had his solid kernel of earnest than to the sombre genevese whose earnestness is of the deadly kind yet for good or evil the latter was the father of modern democracy and with out him our declaration of independence would have wanted some of those sentences in which the immemorial longings of the poor and the dreams of solitary enthusiasts were at last affirmed as axioms in the manifesto of a nation so that all the world might hear  though rousseau like many other fanatics had a remarkable vein of common sense in him witness his remarks on duelling on landscapegardening on french poetry and much of his thought on education we cannot trace many practical results to his teaching least of all in politics for the great difficulty with his system if system it may be called is that while it professes to follow nature it not only assumes as a startingpoint that the individual man may be made over again but proceeds to the conclusion that man himself that human nature must be made over again and governments remodelled on a purely theoretic basis but when something like an experiment in this direction was made in 1789 not only did it fail as regarded man in general but even as regards the particular variety of man that inhabited france the revolution accomplished many changes and beneficent ones yet it left france peopled not by a new race without traditions but by frenchmen still there could not but be a wonderful force in the words of a man who above all others had the secret of making abstractions glow with his own fervor and his ideasdispersed now in the atmosphere of thought have influenced perhaps still continue to influence speculative minds which prefer swift and sure generalization to hesitating and doubtful experience  rousseau has in one respect been utterly misrepresented and misunderstood even châteaubriand most unfilially classes him and voltaire together it appears to me that the inmost core of his being was religious had he remained in the catholic church he might have been a saint had he come earlier he might have founded an order his was precisely the nature on which religious enthusiasm takes the strongest holda temperament which finds a sensuous delight in spiritual things and satisfies its craving for excitement with celestial debauch he had not the iron temper of a great reformer and organizer like knox who true scotchman that he was found a way to weld this world and the other together in a castiron creed but he had as much as any man ever had that gift of a great preacher to make the oratorical fervor which persuades himself while it lasts into the abiding conviction of his hearers that very persuasion of his that the soul could remain pure while the life was corrupt is not unexampled among men who have left holier names than he his confessions also would assign him to that class with whom the religious sentiment is strong and the moral nature weak they are apt to believe that they may as special pleaders say confess and avoid hawthorne has admirably illustrated this in the penance of mr dimmesdale with all the soil that is upon rousseau i cannot help looking on him as one capable beyond any in his generation of being divinely possessed and if it happened otherwise when we remember the much that hindered and the little that helped in a life and time like his we shall be much readier to pity than to condemn it was his very fitness for being something better that makes him able to shock us so with what in too many respects he unhappily was less gifted he had been less hardly judged more than any other of the sentimentalists except possibly sterne he had in him a staple of sincerity compared with châteaubriand he is honesty compared with lamartine he is manliness itself his nearest congener in our own tongue is cowper  in the whole school there is a sickly taint the strongest mark which rousseau has left upon literature is a sensibility to the picturesque in nature not with nature as a strengthener and consoler a wholesome tonic for a mind ill at ease with itself but with nature as a kind of feminine echo to the mood flattering it with sympathy rather than correcting it with rebuke or lifting it away from its unmanly depression as in the wholesomer fellowfeeling of wordsworth they seek in her an accessary and not a reproof it is less a sympathy with nature than a sympathy with ourselves as we compel her to reflect us it is solitude nature for her estrangement from man not for her companionship with himit is desolation and ruin nature as she has triumphed over manwith which this order of mind seeks communion and in which it finds solace it is with the hostile and destructive power of matter and not with the spirit of life and renewal that dwells in it that they ally themselves and in human character it is the same st preux rené werther manfred quasimodo they are all anomalies distortions ruinsso much easier is it to caricature life from our own sickly conception of it than to paint it in its noble simplicity so much cheaper is unreality than truth  every man is conscious that he leads two livesthe one trivial and ordinary the other sacred and recluse one which he carries to society and the dinnertable the other in which his youth and aspiration survive for him and which is a confidence between himself and god both may be equally sincere and there need be no contradiction between them any more than in a healthy man between soul and body if the higher life be real and earnest its result whether in literature or affairs will be real and earnest too but no man can produce great things who is not thoroughly sincere in dealing with himself who would not exchange the finest show for the poorest reality who does not so love his work that he is not only glad to give himself for it but finds rather a gain than a sacrifice in the surrender the sentimentalist does not think of what he does so much as of what the world will think of what he does he translates should into would looks upon the spheres of duty and beauty as alien to each other and can never learn how life rounds itself to a noble completeness between these two opposite but mutually sustaining poles of what we long for and what we must  did rousseau then lead a life of this quality perhaps when we consider the contrast which every man who looks backward must feel between the life he planned and the life which circumstance within him and without him has made for him we should rather ask was this the life he meant to lead perhaps when we take into account his faculty of selfdeceptionit may be no greater than our ownwe should ask was this the life he believed he led have we any right to judge this man after our blunt english fashion and condemn him as we are wont to do on the finding of a jury of average householders is french reality precisely our reality could we tolerate tragedy in rhymed alexandrines instead of blank verse the whole life of rousseau is pitched on this heroic key and for the most trivial occasion he must be ready with the sublime sentiments that are supposed to suit him rather than it it is one of the most curious features of the sentimental ailment that while it shuns the contact of men it courts publicity in proportion as solitude and communion with self lead the sentimentalist to exaggerate the importance of his own personality he comes to think that the least event connected with it is of consequence to his fellowmen if he change his shirt he would have mankind aware of it victor hugo the greatest living representative of the class considers it necessary to let the world know by letter from time to time his opinions on every conceivable subject about which it is not asked nor is of the least value unless we concede to him an immediate inspiration we men of colder blood in whom selfconsciousness takes the form of pride and who have deified mauvaise honte as if our defect were our virtue find it especially hard to understand that artistic impulse of more southern races to pose themselves properly on every occasion and not even to die without some tribute of deference to the taste of the world they are leaving was not even mighty caesars last thought of his drapery let us not condemn rousseau for what seems to us the indecent exposure of himself in his confessions  those who allow an oratorical and purely conventional side disconnected with our private understanding of the facts and with life in which everything has a wholly parliamentary sense where truth is made subservient to the momentary exigencies of eloquence should be charitable to rousseau while we encourage a distinction which establishes two kinds of truth one for the world and another for the conscience while we take pleasure in a kind of speech that has no relation to the real thought of speaker or hearer but to the rostrum only we must not be hasty to condemn a sentimentalism which we do our best to foster we listen in public with the gravity or augurs to what we smile at when we meet a brother adept france is the native land of eulogy of truth padded out to the size and shape demanded by commeilfaut the french academy has perhaps done more harm by the vogue it has given to this style than it has done good by its literary purism for the best purity of a language depends on the limpidity of its source in veracity of thought rousseau was in many respects a typical frenchman and it is not to be wondered at if he too often fell in with the fashion of saying what was expected of him and what he thought due to the situation rather than what would have been true to his inmost consciousness perhaps we should allow something also to the influence of a calvinistic training which certainly helps men who have the least natural tendency towards it to set faith above works and to persuade themselves of the efficacy of an inward grace to offset an outward and visible defection from it  as the sentimentalist always takes a fanciful sometimes an unreal life for an ideal one it would be too much to say that rousseau was a man of earnest convictions but he was a man of fitfully intense ones as suited so mobile a temperament and his writings more than those of any other of his tribe carry with them that persuasion that was in him while he wrote in them at least he is as consistent as a man who admits new ideas can ever be the children of his brain he never abandoned but clung to them with paternal fidelity intellectually he was true and fearless constitutionally timid contradictory and weak but never if we understand him rightly false he was a little too credulous of sonorous sentiment but he was never like châteaubriand or lamartine the lackey of fine phrases if as some fanciful physiologists have assumed there be a masculine and feminine lobe of the brain it would seem that in men of sentimental turn the masculine half fell in love with and made an idol of the other obeying and admiring all the pretty whims of this folle du logis in rousseau the mistress had some noble elements of character and less taint of the demimonde than is visible in more recent cases of the same illicit relation     footnotes      165 histoire des idées morales et politiques en france au xviiime
