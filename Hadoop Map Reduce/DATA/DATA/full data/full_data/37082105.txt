in a canvas chair beside a teatable on the lawn in front of the cottage she had lately taken in the country her thin white dress displayed a slender and rather girlish form her dark hair emphasized the delicate coloring of her face which wore a nervous look as a matter of fact she felt disturbed clare olcott needed somebody to take care of her but she had few friends and her husband held a government appointment in west africa his pay was moderate and he had no private means his relatives justified their neglect of his wife by the reflection that he had married beneath him and this was why he had commended her with confidence to the protection of a friend  andrew allinson who had made olcotts acquaintance when serving as lieutenant of yeomanry during the boer campaign sat on a grassy bank near by with a teacup in his hand he was strongly built and negligently dressed in knickerbockers and shooting jacket the bicycle he had just ridden leaned against the hedge andrew had lately reached his twentyninth year he had large blue eyes that met you with a direct glance a broad forehead and a strong jaw on the whole he was a goodlooking man but his characteristic expression was one of rather heavy goodhumor though by no means stupid he had never done anything remarkable and most of the allinsons thought him slow  raising himself a little he looked slowly round beyond the hedge the white highroad climbed a bold ridge of moor that blazed in the strong sunshine with regal purple farther back smoothtopped hills faded into an ethereal haziness through varying shades of gray the head of the deep valley near the house was steeped in blue shadow but lower down oatfields gleamed with ocher and cadmium among broad squares of green there were flowers in the borders about the tiny lawn and creepers draped the front of the house the still air was filled with the drone of bees all was eminently peaceful  how do you like the place he asked its nicer than london in weather like this and youre looking better than you did when i saw you there  mrs olcott gave him a grateful smile  i havent regretted leaving town i was miserable and scarcely saw anybody after tom sailed our small flat was too far from the few people i knew and even if it had been nearer i couldnt entertain i was feeling very downhearted the day you called  andrew remembered having found her looking very forlorn in a dingy and shabbily furnished room she was sitting at a writingtable with a pile of bills before her about which she had made a naive confession  im glad you find things pleasant here i thought you would he said  its so fresh and green in the morning and at sunset the moorland airs like wine then the house is very pretty and remarkably cheap  she looked at him sharply for he had found the house for her but he answered with heavy calm  i dont think its dear  after that there was a few moments silence during which they heard the soft splash of a stream falling into the valley then he turned to her with a resolute air  and now about those bills you have put me off once or twice but i want to see them  mrs olcott colored and hesitated but she opened a drawer in the table and took out a bundle of papers which she handed to him to her surprise and consternation he counted them before he put them into his pocket  these are not all give me the others  i can manage about the rest she protested  let me have them you cant begin here in difficulties  mrs olcott rose and he watched her enter the house with quiet pity she was not a capable woman and he was thankful that she had not got into worse embarrassments she came back still somewhat flushed and gave him a few more papers  im afraid im a wretchedly bad manager she confessed as soon as my next remittance comes i will send you a check  when it suits you he said and added thoughtfully one of us should tell your husband about this perhaps it had better be you  she smiled for he was now and then boyishly ingenuous he sat directly opposite the gate where all passersby could see him and he had somehow an unfortunate air of being at home in the place  yes she said i will write by the first mail i feel less embarrassed because tom told me that if i was ever in any difficulty i might consult you he described you as the right sortand i have found it true  i suppose you know that i owe a good deal to your husband andrew answered awkwardly  he told me that you and he were in the field hospital together for a time and before then he helped you in some way when you were wounded but he never said much about it what did he do you may smoke while you tell me  i think you ought to know because it will show the claim tom has on me  andrew lighted a cigarette and began in a disjointed manner for he was not a fluent speaker  it was a dazzlingly bright morning and getting very hotour side had been badly cut up in the dark and we were getting back a mixed crowd of stragglers a few miles behind the brigade tom and sergeant carnally the canadian had no proper business with the wreck of my squadron but there they were anyhow only half of us were mounted and when we found ourselves cut off we tried to hold a kopjethe horses back in a hollow except mine which was shot as i dismounted i was fond of the poor faithful brute and i suppose that made me savage for i felt that i must get the fellow who killed it  he paused and his face hardened  there we were lying among the stones with the sun blazing down on us faint puffs of smoke on the opposite rise spirts of sand jumping up where the mauser bullets struck now and then a man dropped his rifle and the rest of us set our teeth it wasnt a spectacular fight and we kept it up in a very informal way two or three commissioned officers dismounted troopers and a few lost line tommies firing as they got a chance the man i wanted had gone to earth beside a big flat stone and i dropped the bullets close about it a hundred yards i made it and the light good i suppose i was so keen on my shooting that i didnt pay much attention when somebody said they were flanking us and the next thing i knew a boer had put a bullet in my leg anyhow i couldnt get up and when i looked round there was no one about then i must have shouted for tom came running back with the sand spirting all round carnally was behind him it looked like certain death but tom got hold of me and dragged me a few yards before carnally came up then we all dropped behind a big stone and im not clear about the rest somebody had heard the firing and detached a squadron with a gun but i can still picture tom running with his face set through the spirting sandone doesnt forget things like that  the blood crept into clare olcotts pale cheeks and her eyes shone no one could have doubted that she admired and loved her absent husband  were you not with carnally when he broke out of the prison camp she asked presently  i was our guard was friendly and careless and we picked up a hint of a movement we thought our army ought to know about we were caged in behind a very awkward fence but id found a wirenipper in the sandthey were used to cut defense entanglements then we held a council and decided that somebody must break out with the news but while two men might do so more would have no chance to dodge the guard carnally and i were picked and after waiting for a dark night we cut the wire and crawled out close behind a sentry we hadnt seen of course knowing what we did about the boers intentions we couldnt give up our plan  mrs olcott recognized that andrew allinson was not the man to abandon a duty though he was unarmed and the sentry carried a magazine rifle  well he resumed i crept up and seized the fellow by the leg he dropped his rifle and carnally slipped away wed arranged that if we got out one was not to stop for the other  but what happened to you did the boer pick up his rifle  no said andrew quietly i got it first  but said mrs olcott and stopped  andrew smiled  you see he had called out when i grabbed him and several of his friends were running up i didnt think hed noticed carnally who had got clear off and there was a chance of its being some time before they missed him then the fellow had shown us one or two small favorsgiven me some tobacco among other things he might have got into trouble for  ah said mrs olcott expressively so you let them take you back to prison but what about the canadian  he got through safely and they made a fuss over him offered him a commission which he was too sensible to take  tom came home promoted and got his west african appointment carnally could have had a commission and you went back to prison though of course they deserved it didnt it strike you that the rewards were not very fairly shared out  i believe my people were disappointed when i returned as undistinguished as i went out though i dont know that they were surprised so far as i was concerned it was an inglorious campaigntwice in a hospital and some months in a prison camp and yet ill admit that i left england determined on doing something brilliant  mrs olcott made no remark he did not seem to attach much importance to the incident that had secured his comrades escape his conduct was not of the kind that catches the public eye but her husband whose opinion was worth having believed in allinson  well he resumed ive stayed some time are you sure youre quite comfortable here theres nothing you feel short of  oh no she said i ought to be happy its perhaps a trifle quiet nobody has called on me yet  i dare say that can be altered he replied and though she did not suppose her solitude was likely to be enlivened at his request she gave him her hand gratefully and let him go  picking up his bicycle he wheeled it up the road which wound between yellow harvest fields and darkgreen clover to the long ascent of the moor here the gray stone walls broke off and the open heath ran up steeped in strong color the glowing crimson of the ling checkered with the purple of the heather mossy patches showing lemon and brightest green while the gaps from which peat was dug made blotches of rich chocolatebrown andrew noticed it all with quiet appreciation though he was thinking hard as he slowly climbed the hill he had made mrs olcott a promise and he meant to keep it but the thing was beginning to look more difficult than he had imagined his sisters might have helped him by recognizing the lonely woman but they had shown some prejudice against her and this was unfortunate for their attitude would have its effect on their neighbors  the allinsons were people of importance in the countryside and the history of the family was not without romance long ago an andrew allinson had become possessed by violence most probably of a strong stone peel half fortress half farmstead that commanded a fertile dale up which the scots mosstroopers often rode to the foray little was known of his descendants except that they held the peel for several generations and were buried with a coat of arms roughly cut upon their tombstones in a moorland kirkyard then had come a break when they were perhaps driven out by economic changes for the family vanished from the dale and next appeared as london goldsmiths in queen annes reign later andrews grandfather retiring from his banking business resumed the coat of arms bought back the peel and built a commodious house about it on his death it was discovered that his property had shrunk in value owing to changing times and his shrewd northcountry widow gave up the hall and coat of arms and made her son reopen the family business he had prospered and maintained the best traditions of the ancient firm for allinson  son was noted for caution decorum and strict probity the firm was eminently sound and carried on its business in an oldfashioned austere way  to its heads keen disappointment his only son andrew showed no aptitude for commerce and after two years in the countinghouse was allowed to follow his own devices then on the marriage of andrews sister to a clever young business man the latter was made a partner soon after this andrews father died leaving him a large share of his money which was however to remain in the business over which his brotherinlaw leonard hathersage now had control  when the gradient grew easier andrew mounted but got down again with a frown a few minutes later the boers nicked bullet had badly torn the muscles of his thigh and now and then the old wound troubled him though he loved horses he could no longer ride far with pleasure and being of active temperament had taken to the bicycle  he had not gone far before he saw a girl ride out from behind a grove of gnarled spruce firs and he joined her when she pulled up her horse to wait for him ethel hillyard looked well in the saddle tall and rather largely built she was nevertheless graceful and generally characterized by an air of dignified repose now however there was amusement in the fine gray eyes she fixed on andrew  you look moody and thats not usual she said  they were old friends and andrew answered her confidentially  ive been thinking and for another thing i found i couldnt get up this bit of a hill i suppose it oughtnt to worry me but it does you see a lameness that comes on when i least expect it is all i brought back from south africa  ethel gave him a sympathetic nod as she started her horse  its a pity but you might have suffered worse and after all distinction is sometimes cheaply gained  you dont win it by keeping people busy curing you and seeing that you dont break out of prison camps andrew retorted grimly  but what else were you thinking of that disturbed you  my thoughts were so to speak all of a pieceone led to another i did nothing in south africa and it has struck me lately that i havent done much anywhere else except to catch salmon in norway and shoot a few canadian deer now theres leonard whos not an allinson making money for all of us and managing the firm  leonard got money and the opportunity for making more from allinsons  thats true but it doesnt excuse me i ought to be a power in the firm and i dont suppose i could even keep one of its books properly  he walked on in silence for the next minute or two and his companion watched him with interest his brows were knit his brown face looked strong as well as thoughtful and ethel did not agree with his relatives who thought him a bit of a fool she was inclined to believe that leonard had spread that impression and the others had adopted it without consideration andrew had been idle but that was his worst fault and he might change there was however nothing significant in his taking her into his confidence he had often done so though she realized with half regretful acquiescence that it was only as a confidante that he thought of her he could not have chosen a better one for ethel hillyard was a girl of unusual character and she now determined to exert her influence for his benefit  isnt allinsons rather branching out of late she asked  it is the west african goldfield was a new kind of venture though its paying handsomely and were now taking up a mine in canada of course the old private banking business has gone under and one must move with the times but in a sense its a pity  ethel understood him her father had dealt with allinsons and she knew the firm had hitherto been dignified and conservative while leonard was essentially modern in his methods and what is known as pushing she foresaw disagreements if andrew ever took an active part in the business which he had a right to do  perhaps it isnt necessary that you should be good at bookkeeping she said is there no place for you in these new foreign schemes you have traveled in the canadian bush to shoot deer and you seemed to like it wouldnt it be as interesting if you went there to look for minerals or manage a mine you would have the free life in the wilds but with an object  theres something in that andrew replied thoughtfully i happen to know the country where the mine is and its unusually rough its curious that you have made a hazy idea ive had a little clearer ill think over the thing  ethel knew that she had said enough she would miss the man if he went away but it would be better for him and she knew that she would never have more than his liking  where is the mine she asked  its among the rocks some distance back from the lake of shadows in western ontario  the lake of shadows ethel exclaimed a friend i made in london used to go there with her father for fishing and shooting but thats not important  well said andrew ive talked enough about myself theres a favor i want to ask will you call on mrs olcott  ethel started mrs olcott was young and pretty nobody knew anything about her husband andrews visits had already excited comment  why should i call she inquired  he gave her the best reasons he could think of for befriending the lonely woman and she pondered them for a moment or two then she asked bluntly  how was it that mrs olcott chose this neighborhood where she knows nobody  i suggested it said andrew simply the firs was empty and she has few friends anywhere  though she had attached no importance to the remarks that had been made about him ethel found his unembarrassed candor reassuring he had however asked her to do something that was harder than he imagined and she hesitated  very well she said i will call  thanks i knew i could count on you  they had now reached the top of the hill and ethel took a crossroad while andrew mounted his bicycle but she turned her head and watched him ride across the moor andrew however did not look back at her and by and by she urged her horse to a trot     chapter ii  the family pride   the hall which andrews grandfather had built around the peel had for years been let with its shooting rights ghyllside however where andrew lived was a commodious house and leonard hathersage was frequently glad to spend a weekend there he and his wife had arrived on the previous evening and he was now busy in the library while andrew sat talking to his sisters on the terrace  though the light was fading it was not yet dark and the air was still and fragrant with flowers yew hedges and shrubberies were growing indistinct a clump of firs in a neighboring meadow loomed up black and shadowy but a band of pale saffron light still shone behind the hall on the edge of the moorland a mile away the square peel stood out harsh and sharp against the glow the rambling house with its tall chimneys trailing away into the gloom on its flanks  andrew who had early lost his mother had three sisters florence leonards wife his senior by several years was a tall prim and rather domineering woman gertrude who had married antony wannop a local gentleman was gentler and less decided than her sister hilda the youngest of all was little dark and impulsive  wannop leaned on the terrace wall between the flower urns with a cigar in his mouth he was stout and generally marked by a bluff geniality  where did you go this afternoon andrew when you wouldnt come with us to the warringtons hilda asked  andrew would have preferred to evade the question but that seemed impossible  i went to see mrs olcott  again exclaimed hilda who prided herself on being blunt  wannop chuckled softly but florence claimed andrews attention  dont you think you have been there often enough  it hasnt struck me in that light  then replied florence i feel its time it did  come now wannop broke in three to one is hardly fair dont be bullied andrew a bachelor can be independent  how do you make it three hilda asked only florence and i mentioned the matter  i am of course acquainted with gertrudes views wannop explained  hilda laughed antony with his characteristic maladroitness had somehow made things worse and andrews face hardened his sisters were generally candid with him but they had gone too far with a thoughtlessness he sometimes showed he had told them nothing about his acquaintance with clare olcotts husband  youre not much of an ally he said with a dry smile anyway as theres no reason why i shouldnt go to the firs im not likely to be deterred i may as well mention that i met ethel hillyard and begged her to call  on mrs olcott florence cried what did she say  she promised  the astonishment of the others was obvious but hilda was the only one who ventured to express it  andrew youre a wonder you havent the least idea of scheming and youd spoil the best plot you took a hand in and yet you have a funny blundering way of getting hard things done  you have hinted that i was a bit of a fool said andrew but i dont see why this should be hard  as an explanation was undesirable hilda let his remark pass and addressed the others  he has beaten us and we may as well give in gracefully if ethel goes all the people who count will follow her  theres more in andrew than his friends suspect wannop observed laughing  they let the subject drop and florence went in search of her husband  whats your opinion of allinsons new policy andrew wannop asked  i dont know what to think one can be too conservative nowadays but ill confess that i liked the firms oldfashioned staidness better even the old dingy offices somehow made you feel that the allinsons were sober responsible people the new place with its brasswork plateglass and gilding was somewhat of a shock to me but the business is flourishing mining speculation was quite out of my fathers line but leonard makes it pay  ive a few thousands in the african concern wannop remarked with complacent satisfaction as it looks as if id get my money back in about seven years i wish id put in twice as much  hilda let her eyes rest on the fading outline of the grim old peel  well she said i dont agree with leonards methods theyre vulgarly assertive and the new offices strike me as being out of place allinsons ought to be more dignified even when we stole cattle from the scots in the old days we did so in a gentlemanly way  is stealing ever gentlemanly wannop inquired  its sometimes less mean than it is at others though ive no doubt that we robbed the armstrongs and the elliots i cant think that we plundered our neighbors or took a bribe to shut our eyes when the scots mosstroopers were riding up the dale the allinsons couldnt have betrayed the english cause as some of the borderers did  no said wannop it would certainly have been against their traditions and in times that we know more about nobody has ever questioned the honor of the house  andrew looked up with a reserved smile  i dont think its likely that anybody ever will  he got up and started toward the house  i must have a talk with leonard he said  when he had left them wannop turned to the others  now and then you can see the old stock in andrew and after all he has a controlling interest in the firm  andrew may not do much good hilda declared but hell do allinsons no harm hell stick to the best of the old traditions she paused with a laugh perhaps were silly in our family pride and sometimes think ourselves better than our neighbors with very little reason but its a clean pride were a mercantile family but allinsons has always ranked with the bank of england  when andrew reached the library his brotherinlaw sat at a writingtable on which stood a tall silver lamp the light fell in a sharply defined circle on the polished floor which ran back beyond it into shadow the windows at the western end were open and for it was not quite dark yet the long rows of bookcases dimly visible against the wall emphasized the spaciousness of the room the scent of flowers that drifted in was mingled with the smell of a cigar and as andrews footsteps echoed through the room leonard laid down his pen the strong light fell upon him showing his thin face and tall spare figure his hair receded somewhat from his high forehead and he had the colorless complexion of a man who lives much indoors but his eyes were singularly penetrating dressed with fastidious neatness he had an air of elegance and by comparison made andrew who was of robuster build look heavy and awkward  im glad of an excuse for stopping he said will you sit down and smoke  what are you doing i thought you came here for a rest said andrew lighting a cigarette  the firm is a hard taskmaster and its difficult to get a few minutes undisturbed in town thats why i brought these papers down writing a prospectus is a business which demands both caution and imagination would you like to see the draft  i thought a boundless optimism was the most essential thing andrew replied taking the paper handed him youre moderate he continued when he had read it ten per cent is all you promise though as far as my experience goes twentys the more usual thing  allinsons does not promise more than it can fulfill  thats true and quite in accordance with my views until lately however prospectuses were very much out of our line  leonard was surprised and annoyed andrew was associating himself with the business in an unusual manner although he had a right to do so  if theres anything you wish to ask i shall be glad to explain it  these underwritten sharesi suppose youre letting the fellows have them below par is that because you expect any difficulty in getting the money  no any project were connected with will be taken up still when you launch a good thing its policy to let a few members of the ring in at bottom and give them a share of the pickings  andrew frowned  it sounds like a bribe but these pickings they must come out of the shareholders pockets  in the end they do  though im not a business man it seems to me that capital put into shafts and reducing plant stands a fair chance of being productive that spent in starting the concern is largely wasted  we are spending less than usual may i ask what your idea of the object of floating a company is  mine would be the expectation of getting a good dividend on the stock i took in it  leonard looked amused  excellent so far as it goes but theres sometimes a little more than that  andrew sat silent a while then he said  i gather that this new scheme will be subscribed for because allinsons guarantees it  its impossible to guarantee a mining scheme but in a sense youre right the firms name will count  well said andrew id like to go to canada and take some share in starting thingsyou see i know the country then as i suppose some of my money will be put into the business you might perhaps make me a director id be of no use in london but i might do something in canada  leonard was surprised but the suggestion pleased him the name of andrew allinson would have its influence on investors  it is not a bad idea he said well see what can be done  andrew then changed the subject  hows business generally  pretty fair we have made some profitable ventures in south america you will remember my bringing señor piñola down we made some money out of him  how andrew asked without much interest the fellow had a dash of the nigger or indian in him  he was dictator valhermosas secret agent  then you supported valhermosas administration during the unsuccessful revolution  we did they wanted to rearm the troops quietly in preparation piñola came over to buy new rifles and machineguns and as he couldnt pay ready money we arranged the matter there was a risk but we got some valuable concessions as security and turned them over afterward to a german syndicate on excellent terms  andrews face was grim when he looked up  and i gave piñola two days shooting instead of pitching him into the nearest bog to think of allinsons backing that brute valhermosa is somewhat of a shock  what do you know about him  a good deal warren the naturalist who was with me in canada spent some time in his country and has friends there he used to talk about the things hed seen and the memory of his stories makes me savage yet because i believe them i have other acquaintances who have lived in parts of the world that business men dont often reach if you dont know how rubbers collected and minerals are worked in countries where theres a subject native population youd better not find out andrew broke into a harsh laugh  you didnt suspect that while the firm helped the dictator i its sleeping partner gave warren a check for the rebels and id like to think that every cartridge my money bought accounted for one of the brutes who flog women to death and burn indians at the stake when the revenue falls off  leonard looked grieved  im sorry to hear this though its possible that warren was exaggerating anyway were out of it now the deal was a matter of businesswe couldnt be expected to know what was being done in the backcountry and after all its no concern of ours  lighting another cigarette andrew smoked half of it in silence  the thing will hardly bear speaking of he said finally and the fault is partly mine for not taking the interest in the firm i should have done  he paused and looked leonard steadily in the face  from what ive heard those concessions may be good for another two or three years and then when valhermosas victims revolt again if allinsons can take any hand in the matter it will be on the other side now well let the subject drop  leonard acquiesced with a tolerant gesture though he was disconcerted by andrews tone it implied that his opinions would have to be considered in the future  by the way leonard said theres a matter i must mention though its delicate i saw judson this morning and he grumbled about the liberality you have shown of late  judsons niggardliness has lost me one or two good tenants  its possible but he told me that you had let the firs to mrs olcott for ten pounds less than he could easily have obtained as hes a talkative fellow and nothing is kept secret here do you think you were wise in letting her have the place below its value  you have been given a hint leonard what do you know about mrs olcott  nothing the point is that nobody else seems to know anything i merely wished to suggest that it might be well to be more cautious  the color crept into andrews face  the next time you hear mrs olcott mentioned you may say that her husband is a friend of mine that he served with credit as captain through the recent war and that he now holds a government post in west africa though the climate compelled him to leave his wife at home now would you like a game of pool  leonard said that he would be busy for a while and when andrew went out he leaned back in his chair to think on the death of andrews father he had been left in control of the business though as he had not brought much capital into the firm his share of the profits was not large there was a good deal to be paid over to members of the family and getting tired of slow and steady progress he had of late launched out into bold speculations  since his first advancement he had looked on his brotherinlaw as an obstacle in his way and had quietly strengthened his own position he had made andrews brief business experience distasteful to him by seeing that the young man was kept busy at monotonous tasks that he could take no interest in afterward when andrew retired from the countinghouse he had missed no opportunity for suggesting that he was right in doing so because he was obviously unfitted for a commercial career now and then he went farther and hinted that the young man was not gifted with much intelligence it was however done cleverly nobody realized that the impression that andrew was something of a fool had originated with his brotherinlaw but in time it was generally held this promised to make leonards position safer because the firm was a family one and though andrew held a good deal of the capital his opinion would not have much weight with his relatives  nevertheless to some extent leonard was honest in what he had done andrew was undoubtedly not clever and leonard believed that for him to have any say in matters would be detrimental to the firm now that he was inclined to assert his rights it would be well to send him to canada this implied some risk as there were matters connected with the mine which leonard preferred to conceal but it was unlikely that andrew would make any undesirable discovery however as andrews inaptitude for business was taken for granted it might be wise to give the family a reason for entrusting him with the post and leonard thought it could be supplied by making the most of his acquaintance with mrs olcott having arrived at this conclusion he dismissed the matter and busied himself with the prospectus     chapter iii  a council   hot sunshine flooded the ghyllside lawn but there was a belt of shadow beneath a copper beech where a family group had gathered leonard sat in a basketchair talking to mrs fenwood an elderly widow with an austere expression his wife and gertrude wannop were whispering over their teacups wannop redfaced and burly stood beside robert allinson a solemnlooking clergyman  we have been here half an hour and not a word has been said yet upon the subject everybodys itching to talk about were a decorous lot wannop remarked surveying the others with amusement personally i should be glad if we were allowed to go home without its being broached its hardly the thing to discuss andrews shortcomings round his table  there are times when its a duty to overcome ones delicacy robert replied if i have been correctly informed the matter demands attention hitherto the allinsons have never given their neighbors cause to criticize their conduct  none of them i seem to remember  none of them robert interposed firmly there was once a malicious story about arthur but i am glad to say it was disproved but this mrs olcott whom i havent seeni suppose shes attractive  wannop smiled  distinctly so whats more she has a forlorn and pathetic air which is highly fetching still im convinced that theres no harm in her  a married woman living apart from her husband robert exclaimed severely i understand that andrew is at her house now and i must confess that after walking some distance i feel hurt at his not being here to receive us  he didnt know you were coming wannop pointed out and added with a roguish air we have all been young and i dont suppose you used to look the other way when you met a pretty girl but ill go bail andrew only visits her out of charity however if you are determined to have your say you may as well begin and get it over  robert left him and addressed leonard in a formal tone  i am told that andrew is going out to assist in the development of the new mine and wishes to be made a director as a relative and a shareholder may i ask if you consider him fit for the post  leonard had been waiting for an opening and he welcomed the inquiry  andrew has every right to demand the position which i could not refuse he paused for the next suggestion must be skilfully conveyed as it happens his abilities hardly enter into the question it is merely needful that we should have a representative on the spot to whom we can send instructions and i dare say he will get a good deal of the fishing and shooting he enjoys all matters of importance will be decided in london  then i take it that his inexperience and inaptitude can do the company no harm  leonard was grateful to him for so plainly expressing his meaning  oh no besides i imagine that the change will be beneficial in several ways  glancing at the others he knew that he had said enough it would have been difficult for any of the family to cite a remark of his in open disparagement of his brotherinlaw though he had cunningly fostered their disbelief in him his wife however was endowed with courage as well as candor  there is nothing to be gained by shutting ones eyes to the truth she observed we all know that andrews visits to this woman are being talked about what is more serious is that he induced her to come here and let her have the firs on purely nominal terms  is it so bad as that mrs fenwood with a shocked look turned to the clergyman as if begging him to deal with the painful situation  the thing must be stopped nipped in the bud said robert firmly i agree with leonard that our infatuated relative should be sent to canada at once  wannop smiled  it strikes me as fortunate that andrew is willing to go  its a favorable sign said mrs fenwood he may be struggling against the creatures influence in which case its our duty to assist him  that wasnt what i meant ive a suspicion that we have fallen into a habit of underestimating andrews abilities and determination wannop looked hard at leonard you are going to put him into a position of responsibility and teach him to use his power are you prepared for the possible consequences  nobody paid much attention to this and leonard after a moments hesitation dismissed the matter the allinsons regarded wannop as a thoughtless person whose moral code was somewhat lax nevertheless he was shrewd and had read andrews character better than leonard  if andrew ever wishes to have his say in business matters i should have neither the desire nor the authority to object leonard said  then we may rest assured that everything will be done to facilitate his departure for canada robert said decidedly there is only another pointi wonder whether mrs olcott could by any means be induced to leave the neighborhood  wannops eyes sparkled angrily he was easygoing but there was a chivalrous vein in him  it would be wiser to leave the hatching of the plot until andrew has sailed he said indignantly  plot is not the right word and you are mistaken if you imagine that any fear of andrews displeasure would deter me in a matter of duty with the welfare of the parish at heart  wannop checked him  dutys a good deal easier when it chimes with ones inclinations and the welfare of the parish isnt threatened by mrs olcott there are however one or two abuses you could put your finger on tomorrow if you liked though i dare say it would get you into trouble  robert reddened and mrs wannop made her husband a peremptory sign to stop  i think we neednt talk about the matter any more she said it is decided that andrew shall be sent to canada  they changed the subject and a few minutes later wannop left them crossing the lawn he met hilda in a shrubbery walk  where have you been he asked i havent seen you since we came  florence found me an errand that kept me out of the way said hilda pointedly now what have you and the others been talking about  i mustnt betray a confidence answered wannop with twinkling eyes still i dare say you can guess  of course they were discussing my erring brother arent they silly  i think so its curious that you and i whose opinions dont count for much should venture to differ with the rest  hilda gave him a grateful glance  but we are the ones who see most clearly i have always felt that you are to be trusted  he made her a humorous bow  i must try to deserve such confidence  dont be foolish this is serious they mean well but theyre all wrong about andrew of course i make fun of him now and then but im very fond of him its a mistake to think hes stupid and leonards responsible for it  ill admit that something of the kind has occurred to me wannop said  hilda hesitated  well she said i have never had much confidence in leonard though the others think him perfect ive an idea that all along he has been gently pushing andrew aside making him look silly and undermining the influence he ought to have now hes sending him to canadai very much wonder why he has some reason  wannop started  my dear your suspicions go a trifle farther than mine you may be right though its not nice to think so but where does all this lead  andrew may need supporters who dont altogether believe in the immaculate leonard some day i think if needful he could count on us  and on nobody else  not until the others understood and it would be hard to make them see  uncommonly hard wannop admitted well hilda you and i will be allies we can conspire together unsuspected because we are the two who are not supposed to countyou because youre too young and charming i because i havent the fine moral fastidiousness and air of distinction that marks the allinsons but ill let you into a secretgertrudes wavering in her ideas about andrew im perverting her  theres something id better tell you i met mrs olcott half an hour ago and i stopped and spoke i like herthere isnt the least reason why i shouldntand im sorry for her i know she feels being left alone and were going to be friends now if the others should try to make things unpleasant  i imagine robert means mischief  i was afraid of it said hilda of course hes as silly and unable to see things properly as an owl in daylight but solemn stupid people often pass for being wise and he might do harm if he tries can you stop him i know andrew would like it  wannop made a sign of rather dubious assent  as im unromantically stout getting elderly and devoid of personal charm i might perhaps venture to interfere in this matter after all theres a sense in which andrew is undoubtedly to blame why do you let him go to the firs so often  if i should give him a hint that people are talking it would only make him angry you know he really is slow at understanding now and then  they strolled back to the party which soon afterward broke up for although hilda begged them to wait for dinner nobody seemed anxious to meet andrew when they had gone hilda turned to leonard with a smile  had an interesting talk she asked you all looked so serious that i was afraid to join you  leonard glanced at her sharply  as you grow older youll find that there are matters which cant be treated humorously  its possible hilda agreed still that remark is too much in roberts style improving conversation is apt to get tiresome  she moved away and leonard watched her with thoughtful eyes he believed he enjoyed her sisters confidence but he was doubtful of hilda  three weeks later andrew sailed and soon after he had done so wannop called one afternoon at the firs where he was received by mrs olcott in the garden he thought she looked harassed but he had expected this  i believe you have met my wife he began taking the canvas chair she indicated  yes said mrs olcott she called on me and if i remember right stayed five minutes  this was not encouraging  you know my sisterinlaw hilda better wannop ventured  mrs olcotts expression softened  that is true i have reason to be grateful to her  hilda is a very nice girl i verily believe that we are fond of each other and as i am more than double her age she now and then favors me with her confidence in fact she suggested that i might be able to help you out of a difficulty  his hostess studied him carefully he was burly and looked hot after his walk but he had a reassuring smile and his red face seemed to indicate goodnature she thought that he could be trusted  its about the house she said i dont know where else to go and it looks as if i might be turned out  that this should distress her hinted at some degree of poverty and wannop felt compassionate she was young and inexperienced and had been coldly treated by her neighbors  how is that he asked  after a moment of irresolution mrs olcott decided to tell him  mr allinson arranged about the house perhaps i shouldnt have allowed this but when he was wounded in the war my husband carried him out of reach of the boer fire  ah andrew ought to have made that clear but wont you go on with the explanation  mr allinson told me that no papers were needed i was to pay the rent to a man called judson he came here and said that there had been some mistake the rent was ten pounds more and i must share the cost of the alterations while the field adjoining which must go with the firs would be another extra when i declared i couldnt pay all this he said i was undoubtedly liable but he could find another tenant who would take the house off my hands  i see a clerical finger in this pie said wannop half aloud and smiled at his hostess i beg your pardon i suppose you didnt know that this is andrew allinsons house  mrs olcott started and colored  i did not know but if it is i cant understand why his agent  somebody is back of him now we had better be candid i venture to believe you can confide in me  what proof can i have of that you are a connection of the allinsons who seem bent on persecuting me have they sent you here  hilda did wannop replied with quiet goodhumor perhaps i had better say that on some points she and i are not quite in accord with the rest of the family i suppose andrew promised your husband to look after you until his return  mrs olcott agreed for her suspicions about his errand had vanished wannop mused for a few moments  i think you should stay here and fight it out until he comes back he said after all your neighbors are honest as far as they see and youll find them ready to make amends  mrs olcotts eyes sparkled but she hesitated  im afraid i cant hold out they have attacked me where im weakest  will you leave the matter of the house to me it can be put right  why are you willing to take the trouble  wannop laughed  for one thing i enjoy putting a spoke in the parsons wheel for another andrew made you a promise and the allinsons like to keep their word  he got up and held out his hand  ill have a talk with mr judson show your courage and hold your ground youll be glad you did so by and by  the next morning wannop called at the agents office in a neighboring town he was shown into a dingy room where an elderly man with spectacles received him with deference  ive been looking into accounts judson wannop began abruptly after deducting your commission and the cost of the repairs you agreed to i find that the return on my property for the past year is small now i met maxwell the other day and he hinted that it might be managed to better advantage  the agent looked alarmed  i understood you didnt wish to put the screw on your tenants and it isnt good policy  no said wannop i want to be fair i dont think andrew allinson would wish any undue pressure put on his tenants either as we talk over things now and then i know his views  judson pondered this without answering and wannop resumed  my business and andrews should be worth a good deal to you though maxwell seemed to think that both could be improved  maxwell couldnt get you a penny more than i have got judson declared i should be very sorry if you contemplated a change  i shouldnt do so without a strong reason you look after the reverend robert allinsons property but your commission on it cant be large  it is not said judson beginning to understand where the others remarks led  well went on wannop i saw mrs olcott yesterday and she mentioned the misunderstanding about her lease i may tell you that mrs wannop and miss allinson are friends of hers  judson was surprised but decided that if he must offend either wannop or the clergyman it would better be the latter  mr andrew called here in a hurry and said he had got a tenant for the firs and i was to have some alterations made he was driving and as his horse was restive he ran out before we could talk over details  wannop thought this was correct for andrew was sometimes careless  atkinson will take the field off your hands its not usual to charge a tenant with needful repairs and you mustnt be hard on mrs olcott about the rent perhaps you had better go over and put things straight with her  judson promised to do so and wannop took out some papers  heres a more important matter ive decided to buy bells place and you can see his agent and the architect as soon as convenient  he rode away knowing that his hints would be attended to during the evening he met hilda  ive seen mrs olcott and judson he told her its very unlikely that shell have any more trouble about the firs  thats splendid cried hilda but how did you manage it  wannop chuckled  my dear girl an explanation isnt always desirable when you know how a things done it spoils the trick  oh well said hilda it doesnt matter but you have a suspiciously complacent look one could imagine that you felt satisfied with yourself  theres some truth in that wannop laughed i feel that we have held our own against the more brilliant members of the family but heres robert  the clergyman appeared around a turn in the road and joined them  you seem amused he remarked may i share the joke  the points involved wannop said however youll agree that the wisest peoples plans sometimes fail  i cant deny it said robert looking puzzled still i fail to understand what the failure of wise peoples plans has to do with us  as a modest man said wannop ill admit that it doesnt seem to have much to do with me     chapter iv  the lake of shadows   the evening was gloomy and there was a boisterous onshore wind when jake carnally stood on a sawmill dump looking out across the lake of shadows its troubled waters reflected the color of the leaden clouds above though they were laced with tumbling foam and short whitetopped waves broke angrily upon the sweating sawdust at carnallys feet the tall pines that rolled back from the beach had faded to a deep somber hue the distance was blurred and gray the lake is a large one stretching many leagues to the south but it is strewn with forestclad islets and those inshore obstructed carnallys view on the nearest of them wisps of smoke drifted out from among the shadowy trunks and an aromatic smell of burning cedar reached him across the sprayswept sound holidaymakers from winnipeg had pitched a summer camp there  seeing nothing out on the lake he turned and glanced past the tall iron chimneystacks toward a row of pretty wooden houses beside the river mouth a moving cloud of sooty smoke floated above them and he knew that a westbound train was pulling out of the station then a man came up to him  why jake he cried you look as if youd been up against it when did you come down  carnally smiled he was tall and sparely but strongly built his kneeboots were dilapidated his brown overalls badly torn  this afternoon he answered took the river for it with two of the boys and a mighty tough time we had in getting through water was on the rock portages and we had to shove round through the bush it didnt seem worth while getting out my glad rags as i have to take the new boss up early tomorrow  looks as if hed got lost said the other i guess you heard he left for duck island with two of the companys roustabouts day before yesterday they hadnt much grub with them but he allowed hed be back this morning  what did he go to duck island for  to prospect the fireclay bed seemed to think the company might put up a smelter  its early for that said carnally with a grin theyve got to raise milling ore and pack it down first i suppose youve seen him whats he like i dont even know his name  big man about your age kind of slow thinks before he speaks but for an english sucker he shows some sense its my notion hes a stayer  were they riverjacks he took along  struck me as more like railroad shovelers though they could paddle in smooth water as theres a nasty sea running in the open youd better look for him if those fellows wreck his canoe and he has to spend the night on an island with nothing to eat while you sit in the hotel its steep chances he fires you  i dont care two bits whether i get fired or no the rain bluff mining company is the meanest business proposition ive ever run up against except the mappin transport which is worse all the same i guess ill have to go if youre going back to the hotel you might tell the boys to bring my canoe and blankets  the man promised to do so and carnally sat down out of the wind to smoke until the craft arrived he was tired by an arduous journey down a river swollen by heavy rain which throughout a good deal of its course poured over ledges and ran furiously between fangs of rock it had needed nerve and skill to shoot the rapids and to force a passage over the rugged portages had taxed the partys strength now he must launch out again and paddle perhaps all night in search of his missing chief  the canoe came lurching to the foot of the dump and as there was a chance of swamping her alongside it carnally ran out on a treacherous driftlog and sprang on board a man untrained to river work would have upset the craft or gone through her bottom but carnally came down safely and seized the steering paddle  this is rough on us boys but it has to be done he said shove her straight out for the gap  his companions were wiry darkfaced and darkhaired men whose frenchcanadian blood had in it a strain of the indianhard to beat at river work or travel through the wilds toiling strenuously they drove the light craft over the short seas with the spray whipping their faces and the foam washing in at the bows now and then they made no headway for a minute or two against a savage gust but when it lulled they slowly forged on again though they knew that to find a canoe among the maze of islands was as difficult a task as could be set them when they labored out into the more open spaces of the lake as dusk was closing in carnally roused himself to keen alertness here the waves were dangerously high and an error of judgment might involve a capsize  as it happened the craft they sought was battling with the breeze some distance offshore and andrew allinson kneeling astern glanced anxiously to leeward when he dared take his eyes off the threatening seas ahead they rolled down on the canoe ridged with foam and it needed quick work with the paddle to help her over them to make things worse she was half full of water and nobody could spare a hand to bale it out andrew was not an expert at canoeing but he had once made a journey up the canadian waterways and had been a yachtsman at home and when the breeze freshened and the waves got steeper it had become evident that neither of his companions was capable of managing the craft in broken water he had accordingly taken the helmsmans post and after running before the sea for the greater part of the day without a meal had discovered at dusk a long ridge of rocks and pines looming up not far ahead  they lost it in the growing darkness for andrew knew the risk of trying to land among big boulders on which the surf was breaking he must paddle out and clear the end of the island in the hope of finding a harbor on its sheltered side but it still lay to lee of him and breaking waves and savage gusts drove them nearer the threatening shore he was wet through and very tired one galled hand bled freely and the party had consumed the last of their provisions at breakfast this was the cause of the distressful stitch in his side and he was painfully cramped but he knew that he had to choose between paddling and trying to crawl out of the surf on a rugged beach amid the wreckage of the canoe so far as the other two could judge he was still serene and now and then his voice reached them hoarse but cheerful  a bit of a lull boys drive her at it in the smooth  he could see nothing to leeward except flying spray but he was not deceived by the emptiness the island must be close to them he did not think he could clear it but he meant to fight until the last moment  put some weight into the stroke well make a few yards now he cried  hold on shouted one of the others whats that  a hail reached them faintly and when they answered rose again a little nearer  are you the rain bluff crowd  sure we are  then follow us cried a voice as the blurred shape of a canoe appeared ahead dont let her sag to lee keep right astern  they got the canoe round stern to sea in some peril of being overturned and drove away at a furious pace with the other craft lurching before them through the spray in a few minutes shadowy pines appeared then a strip of foamswept beach at which andrew glanced anxiously he could not turn back now the dark frothridged seas drove him on but in a few more minutes the end of the beach slipped past and a narrow strip of water with pines about it opened up they ran in the wild lurching ceased and they paddled through smooth water until the craft ahead gently took the beach andrew now realized that he had mistaken two islands for one and was in the sound between them it was very dark among the trees when he came ashore but he heard one of the strangers asking for the boss and answered him  sit down out of the wind while we make a fire and get supper said the other i understood that your grub might be running out so we brought some along  the mans voice sounded familiar but andrew was too tired and cold to exert his memory finding a sheltered place among the rocks he waited until he was called then he saw that a fire had been lighted a shelter of bark and branches made and a meal which looked very inviting laid out beside it all had been done with remarkable neatness as well as celerity and andrew recognized the experienced bushmans skill then the firelight fell on his pilots face and he started  carnally by all thats wonderful he cried  carnally gazed at him in astonishment for a moment or two and then his expression grew reserved  yes he said thats my name  then you ought to remember me  sure youre lieutenant allinson late of the imperial yeomanry and i understand in charge of the rain bluff mining operations im the mine bosss assistant at your service  it was the greeting of a subordinate to his superior and andrew was puzzled he owed a good deal to the man and they had treated each other as comrades in south africa when as had happened once or twice the accidents of the campaign had enabled them to sink the difference of rank now it was the inferior who obviously meant to bear their relative positions in mind and that is not the canadian employees usual attitude toward his master the man he had known and liked as sergeant carnally had rather pointedly declined to see that he wished to shake hands  im very glad to run across you again and to find that we shall be working together andrew said  mutual pleasure carnally replied sit right down supper will be getting cold  the united party gathered round the fire sharing the meal but andrew failed in his attempts to lead carnally into friendly talk the man answered readily but he would not continue a conversation and there was a strange reserve about him indeed andrew was glad when the meal was over and soon afterward he lay down wrapped in damp blankets and went to sleep the next morning the wind had fallen the lake lay shimmering with light under a cloudless sky and they paddled smoothly between islands covered with dusky pines whose reflections quivered in the glassy water until they reached the little wooden town when they landed andrew touched carnallys arm  will you have supper with me tonight at my hotel he asked  sorry i cant said carnally got to meet a man at the other place if it will suit ill come over during the evening  andrew told him to do so though he was piqued he took supper with mappin the head of a transport and contracting company with which it seemed he was to have business relations mappin he thought was about thirty years of age a powerfully built man of city type with sleek black hair and a fleshy but forceful face his manner to the waitresses jarred on andrew for he gazed at one who was pretty with insolent admiration and bullied another who was nervous and plain in conversation he was brusque and opinionated but andrew was soon convinced that he possessed marked business ability after supper they sat smoking on a wooden balcony while the clean fragrance of the pines and the murmur of running water filled the cooling air andrew who was by no means oversensitive was unpleasantly affected by the way mappin bit off the end of his cigar he had large and very white teeth but his lower lip was unusually thick and there was something suggestive of an animal in the trifling action which made it repulsive though on the whole the fellow was coarsely handsome  i noticed a very pretty wooden house on one of the islands we passed this morning andrew said whom does it belong to  you must mean frobishers place calls it a summer camp though its fitted up luxuriously hes from across the frontier and a bit of a sport the americans are coming north largely now for shooting and fishing however as hell be here soon youre sure to meet him  a pleasant man  mappin laughed  he can be very dry and youd find it hard to get ahead of him but hes hospitable and you cant get a dinner like he puts up out of montreal ill take you across some evening hes by way of being a friend of mine then geraldine frobishers a picture figure like classical sculpture face with each feature molded just as it ought to be its a feast for the eyes to watch that girl walk  andrew had occasionally listened to similar descriptions of young women but he resented something in mappins appreciation of miss frobisher it struck him as wholly physical and gross  well he said curtly ill think over the matters we have talked about and let you know my decision  mappin looked surprised as if he had taken andrews assent to his suggestions for granted  no hurry but youll have to write he said as youre going up to the mine ill pull out on the toronto express in the morning and now there are some letters i must get off by the mail  andrew was not sorry to have him go and when carnally entered the balcony a few minutes later he was struck by the contrast between the two men the bushman was lean and wiry there was a lithe grace in his quick movements and a hint of the ascetic in his keen bronzed face one could imagine that this mans body was his welltrained servant and would never become his pampered master  sit down jake said andrew determined to penetrate his reserve take a cigar now we got on pretty well in the hospital and the prison camp didnt we  carnallys eyes twinkled when he had lighted his cigar  thats so i wasnt in your squadron then besides youve got moved up since youre colonel now  in a sense i am i dont know how you rank yet but i have some say in choosing my officers but well drop this fencing why did you hold off last night when i meant to be friendly  carnally considered before he answered  i know my place youre my boss if my attitude didnt please you tell me what you expect  ill try to begin with when i speak as the companys representative i must have what i want done  thats right im agreeable so long as i hold my job  dont you mean to hold it  that depends i havent made up my mind yet  then i want a man that i can rely on to help me through any trouble i meet andrew went on one that i can consult when its needful with confidence  its quite likely that we might look at things from a different point of view  andrew was frankly puzzled by his companions manner his reserve and lack of response were not in accordance with what he knew of carnally  well he asked what are you going to do  we might give the thing a trial do you know much about mining  nothing said andrew ill admit that to you i dont think youll take advantage of it  but how did you come to be sent over in charge of the mine if you dont know your work  im a director of the company and a good deal of the family money has gone into it  carnally looked grave at this and sat silent a few moments studying his companion  did you have anything to do with fixing up things on this side he asked  no my brotherinlaw hathersage came over and made all arrangements im rather ignorant about them  then he didnt take you much into his confidence about this mining proposition  no i cant say that he did  and you expect a fair return on your money and mean to see that your friends who have invested dont get left thats all  of course ive no claim to anything else  that said the canadian dryly is a point on which there might be some difference of opinion you want the shareholders to make a good thing  yes the firm has backed this mine i believe the name helped to float the scheme that makes me responsible to the people who found the money  carnally gave him a long searching glance and his expression changed  well he said with an air of quiet resolve i guess ill have to see you through  when carnally left a halfhour later he met a storekeeper of the town outside the hotel  youre looking serious jake the man remarked been with your new boss i heard what do you think of him  well carnally answered gravely its my idea hes white  then youre not going to quit as you talked of doing  no sir i guess the new boss and i will pull along  if hes square whys he working with mappin and the other grafters  carnally laughed  thats a point i dont understand yet but its my notion theres going to be less graft about this rain bluff proposition than you fellows think     chapter v  the first suspicions   trails of mist floated among the pines that stretched their ragged branches across the swollen river though there had been rain in abundance it flowed crystal clear out of the trackless wilderness of rock and forest that rolls north from the lake of shadows toward hudson bay this rugged belt which extends from ottawa river to the fertile prairie had until very recent days been regarded as valueless to man except for the purpose of trapping furbearing animals the pines are for the most part too small for milling and there is little soil among the curiously rounded rocks moreover the agents of the hudson bay company which long held dominion over the canadian wilds did not encourage the intrusion of adventurous settlers into their fur preserves at last however the discovery that there were valuable minerals in the rocks was made and hardy treasureseekers braved the rigors of the north  andrew and carnally knelt in the bottom of their canoe plying the paddle while a big halfbreed stood upright using an ironshod pole when the nature of the bottom permitted it the stream ran strong against them they were wet and had laboriously forced a passage between big boulders up rapids and a few slacker reaches since early morning a fine drizzle obscured their view but so far as they could see the prospect was far from cheerful ahead stony ledges broke the frothstreaked surface of the flood the pines were green by the waterside growing with vigor where they could find a hold among the rocks but farther back they were small and tangled leaning athwart each other stripped of half their branches some had been blackened by fire and there were unsightly avenues of tottering charred logs the picture was dreary and desolate  isnt it getting time for supper andrew asked as they rounded a bend in the river  not quite besides theres a mappin camp not far ahead and if we can make it well be saved some trouble  andrew nodded for he had discovered that cooking supper and arranging a shelter for the night is a tiresome business when one is wet and worn out by a long days journey  then wed better go on i suppose mappins boys are roadmaking  yes said carnally transport is going to be one of the companys biggest expenses though the river is available it pays to cut out the worst of the portages packing ore over a mile or two of slippery rock costs money and the river makes a big bend full of rapids a little higher up  i remember now the road is to go straight across by the old furtrade traverse and when its finished well put wagons on from the looks of the country it will be an undertaking  sure agreed carnally still if you get it done at a reasonable figure it ought to pay  it has struck me that were giving a good deal of work to mappin ever since we left the landing we have come across his men  its usual to put jobs youre unable to attend to into a contractors hands carnally replied  the men were now on more friendly terms but andrew had noticed that his companion was generally content with answering questions and seldom made a suggestion moreover he had an idea that carnally was quietly studying him the mans attitude was puzzling but he thought he would in due time find an explanation  they paddled on for another halfhour and then a sharp report rang out of the mist ahead it was followed by a succession of heavy crashes that might have been made by falling rock and carnally turned the canoes head toward the bank  giantpowder he explained the camps near by and the boys havent quit for supper yet  on landing they left the halfbreed to look after the canoe while they followed a narrow track through a belt of dismal tottering pines a low logbuilding stood in a clearing and beyond it the new road led up a ravine with rocky slopes in one place they had been violently rent for the ground was strewn with great fragments over which a cloud of dust still floated a group of men stood a short distance away as if afraid to approach nearer and their attitude suggested that something unusual was going on as andrew hurried toward them two more appeared staggering out of the dust and vapor in a curious drunken manner and dragging along a third his limpness and the slack way his arms hung down were unpleasantly suggestive  whats happened has he been hit by a stone andrew asked the nearest man but the tall lighthaired fellow shook his head as if he did not understand  andrew questioned another with no better success and then noticed two others moving cautiously toward the dust and smoke their care seemed uncalled for as the explosion had already occurred but it was obvious that somebody was lying in need of assistance among the stones brought down by the shot and andrew ran forward  plunging into the dust he noticed that it had an acrid smell and a moment later he felt dizzy then he was conscious of an intolerable headache and a feeling of nausea he could hardly see he was losing control of his limbs but he struggled on and overtaking the others helped to drag out an unconscious man then he sat down gasping and found it difficult to prevent himself from slipping off the stone  im sorry said carnally coming up at that moment i stopped behind to talk to one of the boys and as i didnt know what you were doing i couldnt warn you youll feel better presently  what is it andrew asked what knocked me and the other fellows over  giantpowder gas some kinds are worse than others though theyre all poisonous sit quiet while it works off  after a while andrews head got clearer and the pain less severe and then carnally took him to the logbuilding where supper was ready finding him a seat at the end of a long table he handed him a pannikin of strong tea andrew felt better when he had drunk it and he began to look about  the building was a wretched decrepit hovel the logs were small and sagged in the middle one could hardly stand up in the room and the rain that had run in through the leaking roof stood in pools on the earthen floor the bunks consisted of two splitboard ledges against the walls littered with dirty damp blankets and miry clothing which filled the place with a sour unpleasant smell the long table which ran up the middle of the one room was crowded with unkempt men eating voraciously and talking in what andrew presently recognized as norwegian though he thought he caught a word or two of german occasionally a very neat chinaman laid a plate before him but hungry as he had been before he breathed the powder fumes he revolted from the food the greasy pork smelt rancid the potatoes were rotten  i couldnt eat this if i were feeling fit he said disgustedly  carnally called the chinaman who took the plate away and substituted a piece of pie and one or two desiccated apricots this was better and andrew ate a little although he suspected that there was something wrong with the lard used in the pie and the fruit was small and wormeaten  lets get out he said i dont think im dainty but this place is too much for me  leaving the building they sat down at the foot of a rock which kept the drizzle off them andrew breathed the clean fragrance of the pines with delight  this is a great improvement he declared will you tell lucien to pitch our tent where theres shelter  as you wish said carnally i had figured on our sleeping and getting breakfast in the shack  heavens no  andrew lighted his pipe  ive recovered enough to feel curious how did the accident happen the men who use it must know that the fumes of giantpowder are dangerous why didnt they wait  it might be better if i let the man responsible explain  carnally beckoned the foreman  mr allinson wants to know why you didnt keep the boys back until the fumes had cleared  i gave them about the usual time but it looks as if id cut it too fine guess the damp and there being no wind stopped the gas from getting away besides were not using a highgrade powder  but if there was any doubt couldnt you have given them another few minutes andrew asked  the foreman smiled  i had to hold up a dozen men while that shot was fired and the rain has kept us back lately now a boss contractor knows how many yards of dirt a man can move in a day and how much rock you ought to shift with a stick of giantpowder its easy figuring how far the road should be pushed ahead for the money spent and ive got to keep up to schedule  andrew studied the man he looked hard capable of getting the most out of his subordinates but not brutal  then no allowances are made he suggested  no sir not on a mappin job you have to put through the work or get  he left them and andrew turned to carnally  is the shack these fellows live in better or worse than the average he asked  worse the boys are often quite comfortably fixed  what about the food  you can judge for yourself carnally drawled its the meanest hash i ever struck and you want to remember its no fault of the cooks the stuff is mighty bad when a chinaman cant dish it up fit to eat  are the men boarded free  not much they pay about six dollars a week and its enough now as a rule an employer doesnt look for a profit on the grub taking camps all round the boys get pretty good value for their money  then it looks as if this one were an exception said andrew why do they employ so many scandinavians  they get them cheap catch them newly landed anxious for a job before they find out what they ought to have a dollar looks big after a kroner thats my notion but well see if its right he called a canadian workman what would you fix a roadmakers wages at jim  you ought to know a good chopper and shoveler would get up to twofifty so long as he was west of cleared ontario  two dollars and ahalf a day carnally repeated to andrew in emphasis and addressed the man again what are you making now  dollar seventyfive i was cleaned out when i took the job these blamed dutchmen get onefifty the mappin crowds the meanest ive ever been up against  that leaves them three dollars a week for clothing and all expenses andrew observed when the workman went away considering what things cost in canada it isnt a great deal mappin seems a hard master do you know anything about him  hes a smart man said carnally with a smile i met him for the first time when i hired out with your company but i heard that he hadnt a dollar a few years ago he paused and added in fact ive wondered where he got the capital to finance this job  when they moved off to the camp which the halfbreed had pitched andrew sat thoughtfully smoking outside the tent while the mist gathered thicker about the dripping pines and the roar of the river rang in his ears he had been unfavorably impressed by mappin and had since learned that he treated his workmen with marked injustice indeed he had suffered in person from the fellows greed andrew felt that a company of which he was a director ought not to make a profit by trickery and oppression but that was taking something for granted for he had not ascertained that the rain bluff company received the benefit he must reserve the question for future consideration moreover he had been struck by the manner in which carnally had explained how the contractor conducted his business he had called in outsiders to check his statements and allowed them to supply the most damaging particulars it had been done with some skill andrew felt that carnally was anxious that he should learn the truth about mappin though his object was far from clear  then he began to think about carnally he had learned in south africa that the man had courage and keen intelligence and that he was to be trusted though fond of the vernacular his intonation was clean he had good manners and there were signs that he had enjoyed an excellent education  jake he said at last is there any reason why the company shouldnt do its own transport work  i dont know of any you would have to let mappin get through with his contracts first  of course what i mean is could we do it as cheaply as he does and pay regulation wages  it would take some figuring to answer that speaking without the book you ought to do the work at the contractors prices and have a profit he must make one and you can buy plant and tools on as good terms as he can  thats obvious then on the whole it ought to pay the company  what do you mean by the company  well the shareholders  it might paythem said carnally with suggestive emphasis  andrew smoked his pipe out before he answered  ill consider it when ive a little more to go on it strikes me that im learning things and now i think ill get to sleep my heads aching  he lay down on a bed of spruce twigs and soon sank into restful slumber but carnally sat a while in the tent door watching the dark river roll by allinson evidently meant to make him his confidential adviser and he felt his responsibility     chapter vi  dream mine   the next morning the party broke camp and after toiling hard with pole and paddle reached toward evening a forestshrouded gorge through which the flood swept furiously a quarter of a mile ahead steep rocks pent in the raging water which was veiled in spray but nearer at hand the stream widened into a pool at which andrew gazed with misgivings evidently carnally meant to cross it a wall of crag formed one bank the opposite beach was strewn with massy boulders over which the pine branches stretched and in between there ran a great wedgeshaped track of foam no canoe andrew thought could live through that tumult of broken water but it ran more slackly near the boulder bank and a short distance higher up an angry eddy swung back close inshore to the head of the pool where it joined the main downward rush at the junction a spur of rock ran out into the wild sideswirl of the flood shut in as it was by dripping pines the place had a forbidding look  it strikes me that the company will find carrying up its stores and plant very costly work andrew remarked as they rested in an eddy behind a stone im beginning to understand why leonard asked for so much capital my idea is that well have to do some preliminary reducing on the spot to save mineral transport  carnally nodded for a novice in such matters allinson was showing an unusual grasp of details  its a question of the quality of the ore in the north you must have a highgrade product that can be handled at a profit in small quantities it doesnt pay to work rock that carries a low percentage of metal  what grade of stuff are we turning out ive been unable to learn anything about it since i saw the results of the first assays  so far the company has not got up much ore the boys have been kept busy at development work but youll be able to judge for yourself shortly and we had better get on theres a slack along the edge of the spur at the head of the pool which we ought to make and it will save us some trouble in portaging ill land you if youd rather but i want a hand and lucien must give us a lift by tracking  if you can take the canoe up ill go with you said andrew quietly  they headed for the boulder beach where they landed the halfbreed he made a line fast to the craft and went upstream with the end of it while carnally thrust the canoe out and with andrews help forced her up against the current aided by the line it was arduous work the foam stood high about the bows eddies swirling up from the rough bottom swung them to and fro and although they strained every muscle now and then brought them to a standstill angry waves broke on board freely and andrew realized that if lucien lost his footing or slackened his efforts the line would be torn from him and they would be swept back to the tail of the pool this however would be better than being sucked into the cataract close outshore which would no doubt result in the canoes capsizing at last they reached a spot where they must stem the main rush which swung in nearer the bank  can we get through there andrew asked breathlessly  ill try said carnally if we fail i guess youll have to swim  andrew said nothing but the swollen veins rose on his forehead as he strained upon his pole frothing water broke into the canoe lucien was kneedeep in the foam braced tensely against the drag of the line spray lashed their hot faces and the air was filled with the roar of the torrent for nearly a minute they hung stationary their strength taxed to the utmost the poleshoes gripping the bottom then they moved a foot or two and the work was a little easier when they next dipped the poles they made a few yards with a cry to the halfbreed carnally loosed the line and they shot forward upstream with a backeddy it swirled about them in curious green upheavals streaked with lines of foam and they sped with it past boulder and shingle at a furious pace this was exhilarating but when steep rocks dropped to the water andrew glanced anxiously toward the white confusion where the eddy reunited with the downward stream its descent was not to be thought of but he could see no alternative except being dashed against the crag  carnally however did not seem disturbed he knelt in the stern his eyes fixed ahead quietly dipping the steering paddle for they had laid down the poles  use all your strength when i give the word he said  they slid on a tall projecting spur of rock drawing nearer with furious waves leaping downstream a yard or two outshore of it it seemed to andrew that destruction surely awaited them the turmoil grew closer the rock was only a yard or two away in another few moments the bow of the canoe would plunge into the tumbling foam then came a cry from carnally  now with your right shoot her in  andrew felt the stout paddle bend and afterward thought he had never made a stronger effort the bow swung inshore the rock unexpectedly fell back and as they drove past its end a narrow basin opened up the next moment they had entered it and gliding forward grounded on a gravelly bank a man scrambled down a ledge and helped them to drag out the canoe  ive been watching you didnt think you would make it he said the streams stronger than usual come along to my camp ill put you up tonight  thanks responded carnally this is mr allinson of the rain bluff mine he turned to andrew mr graham from the landing  andrew saw that the man was studying him with quiet interest graham was elderly his hair was gray and his face and general appearance indicated that he led a comfortable domestic life andrew supposed he was in business but when they reached his camp he recognized that it had been laid out by a man with some knowledge of the wilds  graham gave them a supper of gray trout and bannocks and they afterward sat talking while the halfbreed went fishing the rain had ceased though the mist still drifted heavily down the gorge and the aromatic smell of woodsmoke mingled with the scent of the pines somewhere in the shadows a loon was calling its wild cry piercing through the roar of water  a rugged and beautiful country graham remarked is this your first visit to it mr allinson  no andrew replied i was once some distance north looking for caribou im glad of an opportunity for seeing it again it gets hold of one  so you know that you have felt the pull of the lonely north curious how it draws some of us isnt it  have you been up there  oh yes as a young man i served the hudson bay ive been through most of the barrens between churchill and the mackenzie perhaps thats the grimmest hardest country white men ever entered but its one you cant forget  its undoubtedly hard said andrew we scarcely reached the fringe of it but i was dressed in rags and worn very thin when we struck lake manitoba i suppose you live at the landing now  ive been there twenty years built my house myself when there was only a shack or two and a hudson bay store the railroad has changed all that  mr graham is treasurer for the sawmill carnally explained  didnt you find it tamer than serving the fur company andrew asked  a curious smile crept into grahams eyes  one cant have everything mr allinson ive been content a willing slave of the desk only seeing the wilds for a week or two in summer but ive thought i might make another trip before i get too old  i think i understand andrew replied if ive a chance im going before i return home theres so much up yonder that impresses methe caribou the timber wolves the lake storms and the break up of the rivers in the spring what a tremendous spectacle the last must besixfoot ice piled up in wild confusion thundering down the valleys ive only followed the track of it in summer but ive seen the wreckage of rubbedout buttes and islands and boulders smashed to rubble  it is grand said graham quietly  i wonder if youd mind telling mr allinson about the silver lode you found carnally suggested i guess hed be interested  graham needed some persuasion before he began his tale  it happened a long time ago and i seldom mention it now in fact ill confess that the lode is looked upon as a harmless illusion of mine my friends call it my dream mine when i was a young man i was stationed at a hudson bay factory about four hundred miles north of here and was despatched with two halfbreeds and a canoe to carry stores to a band of indians no doubt you know that the great company held sovereign authority over the north for a very long time and the indians depended on it for their maintenance well we set off with the canoe paddling and portaging up rivers and across the height of land toward the south  then you were working across country toward the headwaters of this river andrew remarked  we didnt get so far but i did my errand and one day when crossing a divide we nooned beside a little creek as i filled the kettle i noticed something peculiar about the pebbles and picked up a few they were unusually heavy and dully lustrous which made me curious following the creek back i found a vein of the same material among the rocks i filled a small bag with specimens and took the bearings of the spot though we had to get on without loss of time because the rivers would soon be freezing up on reaching the fort i showed the agent the specimens i can remember his look of disgust he was a grim old scot  just pebbles im no saying but they might be pretty he remarked and opening the door threw them out yell think nae mair o them the companys no collecting precious stones and ye should ken a souters expected to stick till his last  i wonder said andrew which of you hailed from the border  both laughed graham he was a hawick terry i was born between selkirk and ettrick shaws the official language of the company was caledonian but thats beside the point i was young enough to feel hurt though i knew my man and how staunch he was to the companys traditional policy  what was that policy  the north for the hudson bay as you know in canada all minerals belong to the crown the first discoverer can claim the right to work them so long as he complies with the regulations  i see said andrew prospectors might scare away animals with skins worth a good deal of silver but i didnt mean to interrupt you  a day or two later i thought i would look for the stones but there had been a heavy fall of snow and i found only a few of them i never got the rest because i was away when the thaw came about a year later i was sent back with the same companions to the band of indians it was winter they were starving and the agent recognized their claim there was no oppression of native races in the hudson bay domains not a yard of the indians land was taken from them and drink could not be bought at the factories the company offered them a higher standard of comfort if they would work for it but there was no compulsion if they found english guns and stores and blankets better than the articles they had used the agents were there to trade  graham paused with a smile  im discursive mr allinson but ive a grievance against the hudson bay and i want to be fair  im interested andrew declared its a clean record for a commercial monopoly considering how cocoa rubber and one or two other things are often procured  we reached the indian camp handed over the supplies and started back with rations carefully weighed out to see us through in winter starvation stalks one closely across the northern wilds now i had meant to visit the creek where id found the stones but there was the difficulty that as the indians had changed their location it would mean a longer trip i couldnt rob the starving trappers of anything that had been sent them and i must make our provisions cover an extra three or four days there was a danger in this because an unexpected delay might be fatal and the dogs were already in poor condition i faced the risk we set off the sledge running heavily over soft snow and we reached the neighborhood of the creek in a raging blizzard and camped for twentyfour hours i could not find the creek it was impossible to wait and we went on through the bitterest weather i have known gales and snowstorms dogged our steps all the way to the fort and we reached it starving four days late one of the halfbreeds had a badly frozen foot and ill carry a memento of that march for the rest of my life  graham held up his left hand which was short of two fingers  the result of a small ax cut and putting on a damp mitten when we were near the creek  that put an end to your prospecting  it did i think the agent suspected me for he took care that i was not sent south again and during the next year i left the companys service i kept the stones and after some time took them to an american assayer he found them rich in lead and silver which are often combined and his estimate of the value of the matrix rock startled me it was beyond anything i had imagined  then theres a fortune awaiting exploitation beside that creek exclaimed andrew did you do nothing about it  graham smiled at him  i was married then mr allinson a clerk in a small sawmill what could i do stories of such strikes in the wilderness are common and i had nothing but two or three bits of stone to show a capitalist the countrys difficult to traverse it would have needed a wellequipped party to carry up stores and haul a canoe over the divides in winter provisions and sledge dogs could be obtained only from the hudson bay agents the company had to be reckoned with and it was too strong for me  they couldnt have forbidden you to prospect in their territory  oh no after all it belongs to canada but their agents could refuse me the assistance and supplies i couldnt do without it was impossible to hire an indian guide or packer without their consent if id been able to raise a thousand dollars i might have beaten them but that was out of the question  you tried ive no doubt  i spent a years savings on a visit to montreal and made the round of the banks and financiers offices here and there a man listened with some interest but nobody would venture five dollars on the project  and then said andrew  i gave up all idea of developing the mine i had two children to bring up my salary was small from the beginning my wife made light of my discoveryi dare say she feared i might go back to the norththe children as they grew up took her view and my silver mine became a joke among us for twenty years ive led a happy domestic life but ive never forgotten the lode and ive thought of it often the last year or two my girl is teaching the boy has got a post and i have a few dollars accumulating in the bank  graham breaking off filled his pipe and laughed softly before he went on  thats my story mr allinson but perhaps it isnt finished yet i may take the trail again some day but it will have to be soon the north is a hard country and im getting old  andrew was moved loving adventure as he did he could imagine what grahams selfdenial had cost him while he had cheerfully carried out his duty to his family  prospecting would no doubt be easier now he suggested  much easier said graham the railroad has opened up the country and the company finds miners very good customers only when you get back a short distance from the track the north is still unsubdued to grapple with its snow and ice its rapids and muskegs is mighty tough work  they talked about other matters until the chilly mist gathering thicker round the camp drove them into the tent     chapter vii  the amateur miner   it was afternoon and hot sunshine poured down into the little valley andrew stood at the foot of a low range looking about with keen interest the strip of level ground between rock and river was strewn with small fir stumps among which lay halfburned logs and branches on the edge of the clearing stood two log shacks and a smiths shop with an unsightly heap of empty cans broken boots and discarded clothing in front of them a bank of shattered stone stretched toward the stream and on a scarped slope of the hillside where the rocks shone a warm pink there was a black hole a stream of water flowing out of it ran down a trench this was the rain bluff mine andrew felt disappointed there was not much to show for the capital that had been subscribed he supposed however that the pieces of machinery which lay in disorder about the waterside were expensive and he meant to ascertain their cost  why dont they get those things fitted up and working he asked carnally who stood near him  theyre not complete were waiting until the mappin people bring the rest of them  andrew pointed to several stacks of small logs  i suppose those are props you seem to use a good many do you cut them on the spot  the mappin boys do the company pays for them by the foot  it strikes me that mappins doing a good deal of the companys work however it looks as if we meant to dig the ore out  carnally saw impatience and suspicion in his face  im asking a good many questions jake andrew went on but im in the unfortunate position of having to look after matters i know nothing about thats a rather remarkable qualification for a director  it isnt altogether unusual carnally replied i could point out one or two men who couldnt tell a pump from a rock drill and control mining concerns  it sounds surprising hows it done  by hiring subordinates with brains and keeping a careful eye on them  im serious jake the company pays my expenses and two hundred dollars a month while im in canada its the shareholders money i feel that i ought to earn it  you may have trouble  that wont matter ive had only a few words with the mine boss watson what kind of man is he  hes straight a smart manager underground good at timbering and getting ore out but thats as far as he goes  well well look at the workings  as they approached the adit watson came to meet them he was a short wiry man clad in wet soilstained overalls andrew indicated the drainage trench  there seems to be a good deal of water in the mine  thats so said watson we want to get rid of it ive several boys in the sump baling it up with coaloil cans  you mean the fivegallon drums you get your kerosene in andrew asked in surprise why dont you order a pump  weve got half of one and the engines fixed guess well get the rest when mappins ready  ill send down word about it to the landing  you neednt one of the river bosses is up here hes getting his dinner now  but dinner has been finished some time  that dont count we had pork today and the mappin man figured hed like trout so i had to tell yan li to cook him some if you want your plant brought up you have to be civil to the transport people  the color swept into andrews face  bring the fellow here  watson grinned and called to a miner at work on the dump the miner disappeared and presently came back with a man  you sent for me mr allinson he said as if he resented it  i did answered andrew curtly you have a pump of ours which has been in your hands some time i want it delivered here immediately  the man looked surprised at his tone  well do what we can but most of the boys are busy on the road  then you had better send them back to the canoes our supplies must not be stopped  its awkward said the other you dont quite understand yet how things are run here mr allinson you want to give and take  i expect to understand them better soon andrew dryly rejoined what we want at present is the pump and if it isnt here by next week ill charge your employer with the extra expense were being put to  the office wouldnt allow your claim  i wont make one said andrew ill knock it off your bill no accounts will be paid without my sanction  oh well said the other since you make a point of it ill get down the river right away and see where that pump is  he left them and watson looked at carnally as they entered the mine  and i thought he was an english sucker he remarked  you were wrong said carnally youll know mr allinson better in a little while  seeing that andrew was waiting watson gave him a small flat lamp to hook in his hat and they went down a narrow gallery by the uncertain smoky light andrew could see that it was strongly timbered stout props were ranged along its sides and beams some cracked and sagging spanned the roof between the floor was wet and strewn with large fragments which seemed to have fallen lately watson explained that they were working through treacherous rocks presently they stopped at the top of a dark hole where a man was busy at a primitive windlass  lode dips sharply here watson explained we had to go down a bit but well push on this heading pay dirts badly broken up but well fix things different when we strike it fair its pretty wet in the lower level do you feel like going down  andrew put on the waterproof jacket that had been given him and looked at the pit a rough ladder ran down its side but the man at the windlass turned to him as he emptied a big can into the drainage trench  the ropes quicker and quite as safe he said one of the mappin boys made that ladder and fixed it wrong catch hold here and get a turn round your foot you dont want to go through the bottom of the can  andrew having done as he was directed the man called a warning to somebody beneath and then let him go when he had descended a short distance the rope was checked and a man seizing it swung him across a murky pool in which the reflection of faint lights quivered then springing down he found himself in a short gallery a smoky lamp burned here and there among the timbering and shadowy figures were busy in recesses with hammer and drill the floor was strewn with broken rock damming back the stream that ran along it and water freely trickled in near at hand three or four men were building up a square pillar of timber and rock toward the roof they wore no clothing above the waist and the drips from the stone splashed on their wet skin watson spoke to one of them before he turned to andrew  ores pretty good here he said we had to make a show for the people in montreal to do some figuring onthat is why i cut so much stuff without leaving more support though i didnt know the roof was quite so bad well have her shored up in a day or two but the worst troubles the water  andrew asked him a few questions and presently went back to the surface where he sat down in the sunshine and lighted his pipe a good deal of capital had already been expended and the result looked discouragingly small the company owned a short tunnel driven into what was evidently inferior ore and another at the bottom of a pit which might be choked up by a fall of roof and was threatened with inundation still andrew supposed that success depended upon the quality of the main body of the ore which they had hardly reached as yet when he had finished his pipe he joined carnally who was busy among the machinery by the river  jake he said i want you to go to the landing and see that the mappin people send up the plant watson expects as soon as its off the cars i shall stay here a while and try to learn something about my business  well drawled carnally with signs of amusement there is a good deal to learn  he set off early the next morning and andrew putting on a suit of overalls went down into the mine and insisted on being given practical instruction in the use of the drill it was a painful process he was forced to kneel on sharp stones and sometimes in water while he held the steel bar which jarred his hands when his companion struck it nor did he find the work easier when he came to strike standing in a cramped position without room to swing the hammer his eyes fixed upon the end of the drill which must be squarely hit to miss might result in the other mans knuckles being smashed the inch of metal which glimmered in the lamplight formed a perplexing mark andrew had an accurate eye however and did not often miss and he forgave his instructor for hitting him on the wrist though this necessitated its being bound up for several days he learned the quick twist of the drill which brings the cutting edge to bear and how to wedge up the roof by setting a prop sawed a little too long for the position slantwise beneath a beam and hammering it straight and then he turned his attention to more advanced subjects  watson he commented one morning this mine strikes me as being badly arranged the best ores on the lower level the lode dips and having the shaft underground must give you extra trouble in getting the stone and water out  it does watson assented you want to remember that we took over rain bluff after work had been begun and the fellows who locate these bush mines often dont know much about their job if they think the ores there they start to get it out the best way they can ive seen that well have to drive a lower adit right in from outside sooner or later but im shy of the expense  it seems to me that the money will be profitably spent andrew said when they had discussed it for a while youll get it back by saving labor and pumping while the extra cost youre put to now would probably increase youd better start the work at once ill be responsible  watson was beginning to understand that the resident director possessed abilities which he had by no means suspected at first he did as he was told and for the next few weeks andrew was pleasantly occupied he learned to nip detonators on to fuses and how a stick of giantpowder should be inserted into a firing hole he studied the lines of cleavage in the rock calculated the cost in labor and explosives of the stone brought down and found it all interesting as a matter of fact it was the first time he had seriously interested himself in anything except sport and there was encouragement in feeling that he possessed some useful powers watson spoke to him as to one who could understand the miners did not seem to notice his clumsiness he had expected some banter from them but none was offered and he remembered that it was leonard and his relatives who had shown an amused disbelief in his capabilities  one day he descended to the lower level where the men were having trouble in the managers absence a number of lamps were burning and the place looked wetter than usual in the unsteady light water trickled down the end wall the rows of props were dripping and the halfnaked men splashed through pools when they moved to and fro they were feverishly busy one group building a massive pillar others putting up fresh props only two or three were breaking out ore at the working face then carnally came toward him and his wet face showed tense and anxious in the light of andrews lamp  the blamed roofs very shaky he said weve had two ugly caveins i wish watson was back and im getting scared about the water expect were tapping a tankpot in the hill but theres nothing to help us in locating it you might give the boys a hand with the pillar  andrew stripped to shirt and overall trousers and hurried toward the spot he saw that the men needed help for the cracked roof was bulging downward ominously and there were several heaps of freshly fallen stones they were constructing a square frame of logs crossed at the ends and filling it in with broken rock as fast as they could but there remained a wide gap between its top and the roof it was meant to support for an hour he worked savagely wet with falling water and dripping with perspiration passing up heavy beams and stones to the men who laid them in place he grew breathless and tore his hand but the flakes of rock which fell at intervals urged him on once or twice there was a crash farther down the tunnel and he saw shadowy figures scatter and others run in with props but for the most part he fixed his attention on his task because it looked as if they had no time to lose when a gush of water flowing down the heading splashed about his boots he called carnally  is this tunnel going to cave in he asked  thats more than i can tell carnally replied we may be able to shore her up but if its not done soon the chances of her crushing in are steep  i see said andrew and turned to his companions boys ill stand for a tendollar bonus if this jobs finished in half an hour  one of them laughed but there was no other response and they did not seem to increase their exertions much this suggested that they had been doing their utmost already with a clear recognition of the risk they ran their pay was good but something besides their interest urged them to keep the mine open these were men who would not easily be beaten by inpouring water or crushing rock they had braced themselves for a grapple with their treacherous natural foes  andrew however was feeling the strain his injured hand was painful the stones he had to lift were heavy his arms and back ached but he meant to hold out for the gap between roof and pillar was getting narrow he had raised a ponderous piece of rock and was holding it up to a man who reached for it when there was a smashing sound above and a dark mass rushed past him the tunnel echoed with a crash and andrew received a violent blow on his head the pain of it turned him dizzy but he heard a clamor of voices and harsh warning cries they were followed by a smashing of timber he saw two or three props crush in and then half the lights went out and he felt the water washing past his boots  the next moment his legs were wet and he set off for the shaft kneedeep in a rushing flood there was a confused uproar behind him stones falling timber breaking and then the last of the lamps went out it cost him an effort to keep his head hurrying men jostled him he struck his feet against sharp stones and was thankful that he did not fall while he battled with a growing horror he made for the feeble glimmer which marked the bottom of the shaft it was a short distance and he presently stood in the gathering water among a group of halfseen men watching one being slowly drawn up toward the brighter light above another was hurriedly climbing the ladder while a comrade waited to follow as soon as he was high enough then andrew felt a hand on his arm  i was looking for you carnally said you had better get up take the rope as soon as it drops  andrew felt a strong desire to do so but he mastered it  no he returned calmly not yet in a sense its my mine i must see the boys out  a man near him raised a shout  whats the matter with the winch cant you heave on it  a deepening rush of water swirled about them and there were sharp cries  you above get on to the handles whens that rope coming she ought to carry two  a man clutched at the rope which fell among them but when another grasped it andrew interfered  steady boys he said the winch wont lift you both being heaved up is too slow tell them to make the rope fast and then climb its strong enough to carry two or three  there was a growl of approval instructions were shouted up and while the water rapidly deepened the group at the foot of the shaft decreased andrew however was above his waist before he clutched the ladder while carnally seized the rope there was a man above him whose feet he must avoid and he felt the timber shake but it was with vast relief that he climbed out of the flood he was near the top when a crossbatten broke and grennan the fellow above him slipping down a foot or two bruised andrews fingers with his heavy boot for a brief moment andrew clung by one hand and then his overtired arm suddenly relaxing his fingers loosed their grasp and he fell half dazed from pain and horror into the swirling flood below a crash of the timbers somewhere in the shaft preceded a fresh onrush of water the flood was neckdeep and rapidly rising     chapter viii  the island of pines   when carnally crawled out wet and breathless into the open air with the last of the men he turned to speak to andrew  wheres the boss he demanded quickly of grennan  just then the roar of a fresh rushing of waters was borne up to them and carnally was filled with anxiety as he leaned over the edge of the pit  allinson he shouted  no answer came and before the scared miners could fully realize what had happened carnally was sliding down the rope in the feeble light at the bottom he saw andrews arms reaching above his head grasping desperately on to the ladder he seemed unable to pull himself up but held on with a visegrip  all right allinson carnally called across reassuringly  letting go of the rope a few strokes in the water brought him to the ladder  my knee explained allinson his face gray with pain struck a sharp ledge at the bottom  with carnallys assistance he managed to climb to the top of the ladder where a dozen arms were extended to pull him to safety he had a bad gash on his knee his fingers on one hand were bruised and bleeding and there was a large welt on his head where the crossbeam had struck him but there seemed to be nothing serious  he held out his hand to carnally and they gripped in silence words were unnecessary  the crosspieces of the ladder could not have been properly notched in andrew said after a while i think it was supplied by mappin  yes answered carnally and its a rough job  i must endeavor to see that mappin does his work better but whats to be done about the flooded level  try to pump it out its fortunate that with a woodburning engine fuel costs you nothing i expect watson will start all the boys at the new heading as soon as he gets back  they discussed the mine until yan li called them to supper and for the next two weeks they worked very hard then andrew went down to the landing on business and one day he sat lazily in a rowing skiff on the lake of shadows a blaze of sunshine fell upon the shimmering water which farther on was streaked with deepblue lines but close at hand it lay dim and still reflecting the somber pines the skiff was drifting past the shore of a rocky island on which a few maples turning crimson made patches of glowing color among the dusky needles when andrew saw a girl sitting on the shore she was near when he noticed her and it struck him that she was remarkably pretty the thin white dress cut in the current american fashion left her finely molded arms uncovered to the elbow and revealed her firm white throat her hands were shapely and for her hat lay beside her he noticed the warm coppery tones in her hair she had gray eyes and her face pleased him though while observing the regularity of her features he could not clearly analyze its charm then feeling that he had gazed at her as long as was admissible he dipped his oars but somewhat to his astonishment she called to him  did you see a canoe as you came she asked  no andrew answered have you lost yours  it floated away i didnt notice until it was too late it went toward the point  she indicated the end of the island and andrew nodded  it would drift to leeward ill go and look for it  as he swung the skiff round it struck him that she had kept curiously still her pose was somewhat unusual for she sat with her feet drawn up beneath her skirt and skirts as he remembered were cut decidedly short he rowed away and presently saw the canoe some distance off on running alongside he noticed a pair of light stockings in the bottom and laughed as the reason for the girls attitude became apparent pulling back with the canoe astern he loosed the light craft and drove it toward the beach with a vigorous push  thank you said the girl and he tactfully rowed away  he had not gone far when he heard a hail and saw her standing on the point waving her hand for a moment or two he hesitated as the canoe had grounded within her reach he could not see what she wanted and in view of the discovery he had made he had imagined that she would have been glad to get rid of him still she had called him and he pulled back  can i be of any further assistance he asked noticing with some relief that she now had her shoes on  yes she said frankly i am marooned here theres no paddle in the canoe  no paddle but how could it have fallen out  i dont know and it doesnt seem an important point perhaps the canoe rocked and it overbalanced  i could tow you to the landing andrew suggested  his manner was formally correct and she felt half amused this young man was obviously not addicted to indiscriminate gallantry  i dont want to go to the landing and the canoe would tow easier with no one on board your skiff should carry two  he ran the craft in made fast the canoe and then held out his hand when she was seated he pushed off  where shall i take you he asked gravely  to the large island yonderthe island of pines she said indicating it and he knew that this was geraldine frobisher whom mappin had discussed andrew admitted that his description of her was warranted  you have been unlucky he remarked  ive been careless and have had to pay for it we got breakfast early and ive missed my lunch  its nearly three oclock said andrew pulling faster but how is it no one came to look for you  my aunt goes to sleep in the afternoon my father had some business at the landingif he had been at home it would have taken him some time to find me he would have searched the nearer islands first systematically and in rotation she smiled thats the kind of man he is i suppose you have guessed who i am  miss frobisher  and youre mr allinson it wasnt hard to identify you perhaps you know that your doings are a source of interest to the people at the landing  i cant see why that should be so  for one thing they seem to think you are up against what they call a tough proposition  andrews face grew thoughtful since the collapse of the heading he had spent a fortnight in determined physical toil as his scarred hands and broken nails testified it had been a time of stress and anxiety and during it he had realized that the mine would be a costly one to work the ore must carry a high percentage of metal if it were to pay for extraction  im afraid thats true he said  then you wont get much leisure for hunting and fishing  andrew laughed  after all those were not my objects in coming out though youre not the only person who seems to have concluded that they were  i have no opinion on the matter geraldine declared but at the landing you are supposed to be more of a sportsman than a minerisnt it flattering to feel that people are talking about you then you are really working at the mine  so far ive saved the company about two dollars and ahalf a day  but isnt your voice in controlling things worth more than that  no andrew replied im afraid it isnt  then you dont know much about mining  i believe andrew answered dryly i know a little more than i did  geraldine was pleased with him the man was humorously modest but he looked capable and resolute  well she said it cant be easy work though one understands that getting the ore out is not always the greatest difficulty  its hard enough when the roof comes down and the props crush up and the water breaks in still i believe youre right  i know something about these matters she said and then surprised him by a sudden turn of the subject theres one man you can trust i mean jake carnally  do you know him  he built our boat pier and cleared the bush to make our lawn we often made him talk to us and i know my father whos a good judge thought a good deal of him  jake said andrew cautiously rather puzzles me i can get so little out of him though i like the man as you seem to know the people i have to deal with is there anybody else whose trustworthiness you would vouch for  geraldines face hardened  no i dont know of anybody else but you will soon be able to form your own opinion  this struck andrew as significant because she must have heard of his connection with mappin who visited the house just then he caught sight of a boat that swung around the end of an island and headed toward them with bows buried in foam  a gasoline launch he said shes traveling very fast  its ours explained geraldine my father must have got back from the landing and has come to look for me  the launch was soon abreast of them and stopped near the skiff a man of middle age in light clothes held the tiller and looked at geraldine inquiringly  i suppose you have been dreadfully worried she said with a smile at him i was cast away on a desolate island when the canoe went adrift and should have been there still only that mr allinson came to my rescue she turned to andrew my father henry t frobisher  andrew noticed that frobisher glanced at him keenly when he heard his name but he started the engine and ran the launch alongside  come on board and see our island he said ill take you back to the landing afterward  andrew followed miss frobisher into the craft and made the skiff and canoe fast astern and they set off and presently reached a short pier which ran out into still clear water a lawn stretched down to the shore bordered with flowers and at the end of it a wooden house stood against a background of somber pines a veranda ran across the front the rows of slender columns braced by graceful arches above were greenshuttered windows steep roofs and gables moldings scrolls and finials had been freely and tastefully used to adorn the building though andrew understood that frobisher used it only occasionally as a summer resort  andrew was taken in and presented to frobishers sister mrs denton a lady with a languid expression and formal manners then tea was served in artistic china and after some general conversation frobisher led andrew to a small room on the upper story which looked out upon the lake and gave him an excellent cigar noticing him glance at the maps unrolled on a table he smiled  i find that i cant get away from business he explained it follows me down here and in a new country like this theres generally some interesting project cropping up i go off into the bush hunting and see something that looks like an opportunity the idea sticks to me and begins to develop  so far i havent found the prospects here very encouraging but i suppose minings slow andrew responded what do you deal in  land lumber waterfalls that will drive turbinesanything in the shape of natural resources but how are you getting on at rain bluff  andrew reflected that as the companys operations would be freely discussed at the landing there was no reason why he should be reticent besides he felt inclined to trust his host the man had a keen thoughtful face but its seriousness was relieved by his genial smile  im afraid were not getting on very fast he said and related the mishaps they had met with  you seem to find the work harder than you expected  i must admit it said andrew if it were merely a question of propping up the roof getting rid of the water and cutting out the ore id feel less diffident its the business complications that i have the most trouble in understanding  frobisher gave him a keen glance  that sides generally involved rain bluff however has a good big capital i understand  which means big liabilities were naturally expecting to pay dividends on it  its an expectation thats not invariably realized frobisher remarked dryly you feel that your shareholders ought to be satisfied  of course thats why im here  our acquaintance is short but if you dont feel that im too much of a stranger i might perhaps be able to throw some light on any points that youre puzzled about ive had a pretty extensive experience in these matters  he was mildly gratified by his guests ready confidence but andrew had been endowed with a quick and accurate judgment of character he talked without reserve as frobisher drew him out and the american listened with unusual interest the affairs of the rain bluff company were no concern of his but the working of allinsons mind fixed his attention allinson was obviously a novice in such matters but for an untrained man he showed a grasp of the salient points and a boldness in attacking difficulties which frobisher thought remarkable lighting a fresh cigar when andrew had finished he smoked a while in silence with a few words he might explain the companys situation in a manner that would fill his guest with astonishment and perhaps dismay but on the whole it did not seem advisable that they should be spoken it would be better that allinson should find out for himself how matters stood frobisher felt strongly curious about what he would do then  andrew presently looked up as if he expected some comment  there are one or two suggestions i might make said frobisher  they were not of much moment though they promised to save andrew some time and trouble and after discussing them he rose to go when they reached the hall geraldine met them  if you are going to the landing ill come with you she said there are a few things i want from the stores  then if mr allinson will excuse me ill let you take him i have some matters to consider before the mail tomorrow and waiting while you buy millinery is a tedious business  frobisher shook hands with andrew cordially  come back to the island of pines whenever you feel inclined he said and andrew and geraldine walked down to the pier  she started the engine and stood aft holding the helm while andrew sat on a locker looking about while the launch swept noisily away the days were rapidly getting shorter and the sunlight had faded off the lake the breeze had fallen and the water lay gleaming smooth as oil with the shadow of the rocks and trees floating on it here and there a clump of pines to the westward stood out black and rugged against a glow of pink and green the air was cold and filled with a resinous fragrance but geraldine occupied most of andrews attention she stood gracefully poised her light dress fluttering in the draught made by the launchs speed and a clear warm color glowing in her face fine spray leaped about the bows around which there curled a wisp of foam and the froth streamed back far across the lake  andrew was inclined to be sorry the launch was so fast it was not far to the landing and he could have spent an hour or two pleasantly on board miss frobisher was not the first attractive young woman he had met and she had neither said nor done anything in particular to excite his admiration indeed when he came to think of it she had said little to him but somehow she impressed him as no other girl had done when presently she made some remark which demanded an answer they chatted gaily until she ran the launch alongside the wharf there andrew left her and went to his hotel  after making her purchases geraldine returned to the island where she found her father sitting on the pier with a notebook in his hand  you landed your passenger safely i see what did you think of him  he didnt give me much opportunity for forming an opinion except that hes rather serious geraldine answered with a smile besides i dont suppose my opinion would be worth as much as yours  thats a very modest admission i thought you imagined yourself a good judge of young men anyway im interested in this one perhaps because he has upset the ideas i had about him  how  for one thing hes straightstraight as a plumbline which isnt altogether what i expected then for a man engaged in business hes a type thats new to me  are those remarks connected geraldine asked with a laugh youre in business and nobody could be straighter than you are  frobisher looked at her with appreciation  im afraid there have been occasions when i had to sail dangerously near the wind but thats outside the question im sorry for this young fellowtheres trouble ahead of him  you mean financial trouble of course ive heard people talking about the mine  not altogether anyway if im right about him i dont think hell find that the worst frobisher broke into a thoughtful smile after all i have met business men who didnt consider their money the most important thing they could lose but im inclined to think the people who sent allinson over here have made a mistake  geraldine was unwilling to betray too great an interest in the man and indeed her curiosity about him did not go very far  oh well she said it really doesnt concern us  she turned toward the house and frobisher looked out across the water from what he knew about rain bluff mine he had concluded that allinson must be either a clever and somewhat unscrupulous exploiter of such ventures or a guileless ignoramus who could be made a tool of now having met him he was convinced that the man was neither of these however he had other things to think about and opening the notebook he busied himself with a scheme for utilizing some waterpower     chapter ix  among the ice   graham was sitting on the veranda of his house at the landing after supper one evening when andrew joined him the veranda was broad and covered with mosquitonetting and furnished with a table and one or two chairs the wooden house was small but pretty in front a plot of grass kept green throughout the hot summer by an automatic sprinkler ran unfenced to the edge of the dusty road across this a belt of blackened fir stumps stretched back to the stacks of lumber by the sawmill and beyond that the lake lay shining in the evening light  a window was open and andrew could hear a girl singing a rattle of crockery which suggested that mrs graham was busy with domestic duties also reached him now and then and a lad who had greeted him pleasantly as he passed sat on the nearest fir stump talking with a companion graham seemed to indicate it all with a movement of his pipe as he turned to andrew  my world mr allinson he said a happy one but narrow  i feel inclined to envy you andrew replied  i am to be envied i admit it with gratitude graham glanced half wistfully at a map on the table for all that i remember the wide spaces up yonder now and then  if i were in your place i wouldnt study that map too much  ah it isnt an amusement that i often indulge in but sometimes when ive spent a week making up trumpery lumber bills or getting in fivedollar accounts i find it a solace to recall what i used to do however ive inconsistently practised prudent selfdenial in other ways there was a moose heada beast i shoti took off its stand and gave to the institute an old pair of snowshoes that hung above the mantel i gave my boy he said they were very poor things and sadly out of date  andrew glanced at the map and noticed the lines penciled across it he felt that he was not acting considerately in tempting graham but he could not resist  those marks show the marches you have made he asked  graham laid his finger on the map moving it from spot to spot  yes i dont need a diary i can see it all again we started here one winter and made three hundred miles on half rations with wind and snow ahead all the way there we camped three days in a blizzard among a clump of willows while the snow piled up six feet deep to lee of us i made this line through a country new to me two hundred miles over soft snow with the dogs playing out and the timber wolves on my trail for the last few days this lake ends in a big muskeg and we snagged our canoe there one fall as shed ripped her bilge open we left her and spent a day and a half floundering through two or three feet of water and tall reeds and carrying loads of sixty pounds he paused and indicated a line that broke off abruptly in a wide bare space the lode lies south of here and i believe im the only survivor of the few who knew of it one halfbreed was drowned in a rapid another lost in a blizzard the agent so i heard afterward left the factory to visit some indians three or four miles off and they found him next day in a snowdrift frozen to death  a grim country andrew said thoughtfully one to make a man afraid and yet  graham laughed rather harshly  yes i think you know well im glad that for twenty years ive mastered the longing and kept my head now however my children have made a fair start with prospects of going farther than i have done and my responsibility is lightening a winter up there would satisfy meim afraid it would be all i could stand nowand though its still out of the question ive a feeling that a way may be found before i grow too old  he rolled up the map resolutely and laid it aside and soon afterward mrs grahams voice reached them  bring mr allinson in its getting chilly  andrew rose and followed graham into his sittingroom it was very small and there were signs of economy in its appointments but it had a homelike charm two or three sketches in color which showed some talent hung on the varnished board walls the lamp though obviously cheap was of artistic design the rug on the stained floor and the hangings were of harmonious hue mrs graham a little faded woman with a cheerful air sat sewing at a table and opposite her a girl was busy with some papers both greeted andrew cordially and a few minutes later the young man he had seen outside came in with a humorous tale he had heard  he was a handsome lad quicker of speech and more assertive than his father and the girl who now and then made a remark had a decided air though graham would occasionally talk without reserve he was as a rule quiet and dreamy it was not from him that his children had acquired a trace of the somewhat aggressive smartness which characterizes the inhabitants of the new western cities he had more in common with the silent dwellers in the lonely wilds these are for the most part sentimentalists of a kind loving the wilderness not for what can be made out of it and untouched by the materialistic ideas of the towns where the business chance is the chief thing sought their gifts become most manifest when the ice breaks up on the rivers across which they must get the dogsleds and when all the powers of mind and body are taxed to traverse the frozen waste before starvation cuts short the march it struck andrew that graham dressed in shabby clothes listening goodhumoredly while his children talked had somehow the look of a captive eagle conscious of crippled wings though the simile was a bad one because there was no predatory fierceness in him  one of you might shut the door said mrs graham the nights are getting colder fast well soon have to light the basement heater she turned to andrew this is a hard country in winter ive seen the thermometer stand a week at fifty below  dont be scared mr allinson laughed the lad as he closed the door its not often too fierce and in a place like the landing theres generally something going on will the frost interfere with your mining  not underground said andrew i understand that nothing can be done on the surface but we expect to send off a good lot of ore for experimental reduction in the next week or two then well have something to base our plans on  mappins going to handle the transport i guess that mans surely on to a soft thing i spose you know hes making his pile out of the rain bluff  mrs graham glanced at her son in rebuke  i dont think you should talk to mr allinson in that manner jim hes a good deal older and more experienced than you are  your ideas are out of date mother weve grown ahead of them mr allinson doesnt look as if he minded anyway he doesnt know as much as i do about the canadian contractor he turned to andrew do you like it up yonder  yes andrew answered goodhumoredly i like the work better than anything i remember having done  a matter of taste now i cant see much amusement in rolling rocks about or standing in wet slickers in a dark pit watching the boys punch the drills  mr allinson is not doing it for amusement said his mother  well money isnt often made that way you dont get rich by knowing how to use the hammer and giantpowder  i believe thats true andrew responded with a smile  a sure thing money is made by sitting tight in your office and hiring other fellows to do the rough work they break up the rocks and cut the milling logs you take the profit its business first and last for mine  then its fortunate there are people with different views his sister interposed if nobody were willing to live in the logging camps all winter and go prospecting in the bush you would be badly off  but so long as there are people who like doing that kind of thing were glad to let them  this is a favorite pose of his the girl explained to andrew its the latest fashion among the boys theyre afraid of being thought altruistic  now that everything is controlled by mergers and they make all we need so dear one is forced to be practical mrs graham remarked feelingly for all that it jars on me to hear our young people talk as they do  were realists with no use for sentiment jim replied we dont let our imagination run away with us it doesnt pay  you may be wrong in that said andrew smiling im not much of a philosopher but it seems to me that imaginations now and then a useful thing ive seen it help a man through tight places take your prospectors for example they often face risks that couldnt be justified by a return in money i heard of one fellow crossing a lake in a savage storm in a leaky canoe to keep the time hed allowed for his journey because he wouldnt be beaten and of another making two hundred miles on snowshoes with very little food because a party hed promised to meet was expecting him  that said the lad is the kind of thing father would do hes given to impractical idealism theres a mine up in the barrens he has talked about as long as i remember but if he found it i believe hed be content with that and sell the claim to any one for a few hundred dollars getting yourself frozen for an abstract idea isnt good business  graham laughed and changed the subject and soon afterward andrew took his leave he spent the next evening with frobisher whom he had now visited several times and on the following morning set out for the mine where he worked very hard for a few weeks they were still using the old adit though the new one was being driven toward the lower level then he and carnally left the camp in a canoe to hurry forward some stores and after arranging for their quicker transport stood on a little promontory looking down the river late one gloomy afternoon  winter had set in with unusual rigor the gray sky was barred with leaden cloud the pines which looked strangely ragged and somber stood out with harsh distinctness against the first thin snow and the river flowed a darkcolored riband through a cleancut channel in the ice a nipping wind blew down the gorge and now and then light flakes of snow fell  we had better push on carnally suggested it looks as if the messenger hadnt got through and well hardly make the mine before midnight theres heavy snow coming and we have no provisions or camp outfit  wait an hour said andrew the smelter people promised to let me know the results they got and the letter was due yesterday im anxious about the thing  carnally agreed they had sent out a quantity of ore for reduction and particulars of the yield in refined metal would throw a useful light on the prospects of the mine the last analysis of specimens selected to represent the bulk had not been encouraging but this test was unsatisfactory because the ore was variable  lets get out of the wind carnally said if id expected this kind of weather id have brought my furcoat along  they found a sheltered spot among a clump of pines where they sat down but andrew felt disturbed and apprehensive the company had spent money freely the mine was expensive to work and of late watson had grown morose and reserved even when andrew pressed him he had avoided giving his opinion the report of the smelting company would however show how matters stood and andrew looked out anxiously for the expected messenger  it got dark though they could still see the glimmer of the ice and at length they heard a faint regular splashing made by canoe poles a shout answered their hail and when they ran down the bank a man came cautiously across the fringe of ice  heres your mail he said handing andrew some letters now that ive given it to you well get back  wont you come on to the mine with us  no sir its steep chances you dont get there tonight and we can make a mappin camp in about three hours downstream  it would be wiser to follow him carnally suggested well have heavy snow before long  im going on said andrew doggedly i must compare the report with our books and get watson to tell me what he thinks as soon as possible  launching their canoe they poled her laboriously against the current which ran fast between its banks of ice andrew was thankful that the snow on the frozen surface threw up a faint light and they could see the glimmer of the floes that drifted down though it was not always possible to avoid them once or twice there was a crash as a heavy mass struck the canoe which was too lightly built to stand much of this buffeting andrew had thick mittens but they soon got wet and his hands grew numbed he was not clad for rigorous weather and his exertions failed to keep him warm  still they were making progress and they met with no serious difficulty until they entered a slacker reach it had been open when they came down but now the channel made by the current was glazed with thin ice through which they could hardly drive the canoe indeed in some places carnally was forced to break the crust with the pole while andrew paddled  if theres much more of this it will be late tomorrow before we make camp andrew remarked  well have to leave the river pretty soon but well stick to it as long as we can carnally replied its rough traveling through the bush and the shore ice is hardly safe yet  they got through the reach paddled laboriously against a swifter stream and dragged the canoe over a portage stumbling among big stones and across frozen pools during this passage andrew fell and hurt himself but stopping was out of the question launching the craft on the upper edge of the rapid they drove her out for a minute or two they made no progress and andrew straining at his pole feared that they would be swept down the wild foaming rush but they found slacker water and the ominous roar of the rapid died away then snow began to fall making it difficult to see though they had the faint glimmer of the shoreice for a guide in the reach up which they were poling it did not run out far because the stream was strong and they had gone some distance when there was a heavy thud and a curious crunch at the bows  in with her cried carnally head for the slack behind the point  they ran in through crackling ice and had reached the thicker strip along the bank when andrew felt his knees grow wet feeling with his hand he found there was an inch or two of water in the bottom of the craft  skins punched through carnally explained we cant bale her and use the pole youll have to get out  andrew did so hastily but the ice on which he landed cracked as he moved and he had gone several yards before it seemed strong enough to bear him carnally dragged the canoe out and then turned cautiously upstream  well have to chance the ice for the next mile or two he said its rough countrysteep rock and very thick scrubon this side  as they moved forward andrew noticed that the snow was falling faster and the wind freshening the cold flakes drove into his tingling face and he had to brace himself against the gusts the gorge they followed was wrapped in obscurity and filled with the roar of water and the wailing of the trees however he held on for some time and then suddenly felt no support for his foot it was too late to stop the next moment he was in the water the shock took his breath away he had a horrible fear of being drawn under the ice and it was with vast relief that he found he could stand up waistdeep moving cautiously he got his knee upon the ice but it broke away then he saw that carnally was lying down near the edge and holding out his hand  get your arms on it and catch hold he said as he obeyed andrew heard the ice crack but his weight was now well distributed and he crawled forward clutching carnallys hand then he got up dripping and shaking with cold  thanks he said thats a risk i dont mean to run again if it had been a foot deeper id never have got out  carnally turned toward the bank and in thick darkness they scrambled up a steep slope among stunted pines leaving its summit they floundered over the rounded surfaces of outcropping rocks and plunged into hollows filled with thick brush the pines were smaller farther on which made things worse for they had to force a passage through the snowladen needles some had been partly blown down and leaned on one another in tangles which would have been difficult to traverse in daylight how carnally kept his line andrew could not tell for they had lost the sound of the river and the snow was thick but he steadily pushed on and after a while the country grew more open here the wind was worse and andrew who was getting worn out struggled forward stupidly with lowered head and labored breath he could not remember how long he kept it up but at last a light blinked among the trees and he recognized joyfully that it came from a shack at the mine     chapter x  a crisis   it was late at night when andrew entered watsons office at the mine with the letters he had brought though a bitter wind blew the snow about it the little wooden building was hot and filled with the smell of pine boarding a stove glowing a dull red stood at one end and a kerosene lamp hanging from a beam threw a bright light on the faces of the men they were eager and expectant but andrews bore the stamp of fatigue for the journey upriver had tried his strength moreover he shrank from learning what the smelting companys report might reveal drawing a chair to the table he sat for a few moments lost in troubled thought  when he first reached the mine he had found a keen and scarcely expected pleasure in his work its difficulties seized his interest and for a while he enjoyed the grapple with them then misgivings crept in he felt that there was something wrong watson displayed no enthusiasm about the companys prospects and carnally let fall disturbing hints andrew however steadily occupied himself with his task which gained a stronger hold on him until he realized that all his mind was bent upon its successful accomplishment now he must put his halfformed plans and surmises to a searching test bracing himself he opened a large sealed envelope with a steady hand  as he took out the first of its contents he made an abrupt movement but he read on through several sheets while his face hardened and then he sat very still with the papers scattered about the table  well said watson in harsh inquiry  gathering up the papers andrew passed them to him without a word while carnally waited as if he knew what to expect when he in turn took the report from watson there was an oppressive silence in the shack andrew could hear the billets snap in the stove and the murmur of the river among the ice  it seems to me that this report leaves us no room for doubt he said when carnally had finished reading the papers we cant keep the mine working on such returns as these but i want your honest opinion  watson made a sign of agreement  well he said frankly you have got to have the truth though i guess it will cost me my job rain bluff will never pay its shareholders  you knew this some time ago  i was afraid of it but it wasnt my business i was sent here to get out as much ore as i could and ive done so  have you any suggestion to make  if you wrote down your capital got rid of mappin and did your transport work yourselves you might keep going the ores there though its hard to get at and not worth much  andrew turned to carnally  you suspected how matters stood from the beginning i see now that you meant to warn me  i guessed i couldnt speak plainly without proof  oh said andrew in a strained voice you knew so did watson and no doubt every man who works for us i and the unfortunate people who found the money were the only ones deceived he turned to the manager sharply what did you mean when you said the mine would never pay its shareholders do you imply that somebody else may make a profit out of it  youve hit it mappins making his pile and i guess theres a man with money backing him but thats no concern of mine im sorry for you mr allinson but i suppose i must hand you my notice and tell the boys to quit  no said andrew not yet let them go on as usual until i speak to you again  im not anxious to leave your serviceyoure square watson replied with an air of relief now if you dont want me any more ill go to bed  he left them and andrew quietly filled his pipe while carnally watched him with interest andrew had had a shock but he had borne it well instead of unnerving it had braced him to grapple with a difficult situation he had courage and determination but there was something else he must be told  jake andrew said at length this has been a blow i put a good deal of money into the company and will lose it but thats only half the troublethe rest will hardly bear thinking of my firm put its stamp on this venture backed it with its name and it was rotten from the first his face suddenly darkened with suspicion how leonard came to take it up i cant imagine  if hes the man who fixed things in montreal i guess hed tell you it was a fair business risk but you dont quite understand the matter yet its clear that mappin has the support of mr hathersage he finds him the money gives him the job at prices higher than you need pay and no doubt takes a share of the profit  andrew started  its hard to admit but i believe youre right then his mind leaped to a wider conclusion i dare say the company was started solely for hathersages benefit  i guess theres some foundation for that carnally said pointedly  neither spoke for the next few moments and then andrew looked up with a grim smile  im beginning to understand your attitude toward me when i first came you thought i was in the ringone of the people who knowing how bad it was led investors into this rotten scheme  i allow i did think something of the kind  and afterward my guess isnt flattering but i cant blame you jake you believed i was what you call a sucker sent here because i was too big a fool to find things out  carnally looked embarrassed  i figured it out like this he said the people who sent you expected youd spend your time hunting and fishing without taking much interest in the mine then if trouble came theyd leave you to face it being on the spot it would be your fault for not learning what was wrong  a clever plan after all its possible they took too much for granted  they did carnally declared you have shown a grip of things they didnt look for in my opinion they picked the wrong man for the part but youre in a pretty tight place you cant make this mine pay  no said andrew i dont mean to try if i can get his consent im going to look for grahams lode  carnally started  its a great plan will you want me  of course id be helpless without you  no carnally corrected him with a smile so far ive given you hints about things you couldnt be expected to know but ive taught you all i can and you take your right place now youre boss in this new proposition and ill be glad to be your second  thank you said andrew well start for the landing tomorrow and see graham  they left the mine at daybreak and on reaching the town andrew had first of all an interview with grahams employer the president of the lumber company sat at a desk in his office at the mill and listened attentively while andrew explained the object of his visit he was an elderly man with a keen but goodhumored expression and once or twice he glanced at andrew as if surprised when the latter had finished the millowner took a box from a shelf  have a cigar he said  andrew lighted one and looked round the room it was dusty and dingy with a rough board floor and a cloud of steam from a neighboring stack obscured the light that entered the windows a rusty stove stood at one end with a desk near it which graham had occupied for twenty years  so the mine has not turned out all you expected commented the lumberman  far from it andrew acknowledged  and you feel it a duty to do something to protect the interests of the shareholders  yes said andrew and added with a direct glance are you surprised  a smile crept into his companions eyes  i guess we can let that go you have done the square thing in coming to me before you spoke to graham hes a man we value and he has served us well but ive now and then felt sorry for him its possible he hasnt found it easy to spend the best part of his life here keeping our accounts on a very moderate salary though we pay him more than we could get another man for  its strange he didnt break loose from it long ago  i guess it cost him something to stay were an optimistic people mr allinson with a hankering after adventure but graham could never put by money enough to make the plunge he had his children to bring up and he spared nothing to give them a fair start i suppose this isnt quite the line you thought i would take  andrew admitted it with some embarrassment and the lumberman looked amused  there are plenty of big mills run entirely on the laws of supply and demand where men are scrapped as freely as obsolete plant and the one thing looked for is the maximum output still you see our isolated position gives us a monopoly and were small enough to take a personal interest in our older hands as a matter of fact we find it pays but that is not the point you are willing to guarantee graham against any loss if your search is unsuccessful  yes andrew promised he shall not suffer  then well do our share in keeping his place open as long as may be needful as it happens things are slack just now and to make this journey will set his mind at rest hell be content with the old routine when he comes back  then you count on his coming back to the mill  the lumberman looked sympathetic  i dont wish to discourage you but if graham finds that lode i shall be surprised  andrew thanked him and returned to his hotel where he wrote some letters and afterward decided to visit frobisher who was staying at the island of pines for a week or two graham was away on business down the line and would not return until the next day and andrew being in a restless mood felt that a talk with frobisher or his daughter might soothe him they were intelligent and sympathetic people and he had thought a good deal about geraldine of late  fine snow was driving before a stinging breeze when he walked out upon the frozen lake here and there its surface had been swept clear by the wind leaving stretches of smooth ice but for the most part its white covering offered good foothold it was dark and bitterly cold andrews hands grew stiff in his thick mittens and he shivered as he faced the stronger gusts guiding himself by the loom of the rocks and trees that now and then showed faintly through the snow the walk was far from pleasant and he realized that things would be much worse when he went up into the trackless spaces of the frozen north  reaching the house without misadventure he was received by geraldine mrs denton she explained was invalided by a cold caught on the train and her father had driven across to the landing for his mail but would be back soon she led andrew into a room which looked delightfully bright and comfortable after the shack at the mine and made him sit down by the hearth on which a pinelog fire burned gaily  you are thinner than you were when we last saw you and you dont look so cheerful she said taking a low chair opposite him  i think both things are explainable andrew replied with a rueful smile  geraldine quietly studied him he was troubled and could not hide it and he interested her the man was honest and forceful in an untrained way she could imagine his grappling with unaccustomed difficulties clumsily perhaps but resolutely though several years his junior she knew that she had the keener intelligence but this did not make her attitude contemptuous he had shown signs of qualities which sometimes carried one farther than superficial smartness  i suppose you have had some trouble at the mine  yes he said though he could not account for his candor ive had an experience that has rudely shaken me after all its possible that one needs something of the kind now and then and until lately ive escaped it  i wonder whether thats unfortunate  it is beyond a doubt ive taken life easily generally getting what i wanted without much trouble and now when ive no experience to fall back on im landed in a maze of difficulties but all this is too personal forgive me for boring you  but im interested she declared she felt that he would find a way out though it might not be the easiest one as you came over to canada i suppose you must have found the smooth life you led grow monotonous  not exactly i liked it but id a feeling now and then that it might be more bracing to do something useful make things for instance or even go into business  geraldine laughed and it struck andrew that she was very pretty as she looked at him with sparkling eyes  youre delightfully matteroffact you might have hinted at a longing for high adventure or something romantic  the worst of adventure is that you often get a good deal more than you bargain for said andrew soberly  you learned that in the north  yes he answered with a moody air that and other things for example i learned how moneys sometimes made and it was a shock  ah the money was yours  thats where the trouble lies so far ive been content with spending it  and you now feel that your responsibility doesnt end there but if you wished to go into business why didnt you do so  that is rather more than i can tell still whenever i hinted at it i was quietly discouraged i suppose it wasnt expected of me and the general opinion was that i was incapable  geraldine thought that his friends were mistaken in this conclusion but she could imagine his yielding to the representations of cleverer people without questioning the accuracy of their views about him he had however obviously broken loose from his tutelage and now stood firm ignorant perhaps of much that men who worked for their living knew confronting with undisciplined courage troubles new to him she had no doubt that he had courage and strong sincerity  im afraid im not very entertaining he apologized with a smile  its a compliment that youre natural geraldine said graciously one doesnt always expect to be amused but you have carnally to help you at the mine what do you think of him  i have a high opinion of jake  i believe youre right hes a favorite of mine what he undertakes he carries out you feel that he can be relied on that he would do the square thing however difficult it is after all one couldnt say much more of any man  no andrew responded gravely the trouble often is to see how the square thing should be done  there were footsteps in the hall and frobisher came in and greeted andrew cordially  i heard you were at the landing and im not sorry youll have to stay all night he said its snowing so hard that i had some difficulty in getting home with the team     chapter xi  the real boss   how have you been getting on in the bush frobisher asked his guest when they sat talking in his smokingroom you look worried  theres a reason for itthe mines no good andrew looked frobisher steadily in the face i dare say you knew that some time ago  i had my suspicions i wasnt singular in that  so it seems i must ask you to believe that it was only during the last few days that i found out the truth  frobisher smiled  after that id better say that i exonerated youi think its the right wordas soon as wed had our first talk i saw that you were being made a tool of  you were right said andrew it isnt a pleasant situation i dont mind its not being flattering thats the least trouble  what are you going to do about it  the square thing so far as im able allinsons so to speak guaranteed the undertaking  there was some extra color in andrews face and pride in his voice though he spoke quietly and frobisher sat silent a moment or two  have you made any plans yet the american then asked  andrew told him that he proposed to take carnally and graham north to search for the silver lode and frobisher looked grave  theres a point to be remembered he cautioned minerals in canada belong to the state which makes a grant of them to the discoverer on certain terms the lode will therefore become the property of whoever first locates and records it which will be open to any member of your party  ive thought of that the expedition will be financed by me and ill have an understanding with graham and carnally as to their share before we start  three claims could be staked and your companions could make them over to you when the development work was done if properly patented you would be the legal owner  i intend to become the owner  frobisher looked as if the statement surprised him  then youd better cut your connection with rain bluff before you set off he advised it might prevent some complications the directors might contend that you were not entitled to undertake private mining operations while you represented the company and drew its pay  i dont think you understand i mean to hold the claims in my own name so as to strengthen my position which will need it i expect to have serious trouble over the companys affairs  frobisher laughed softly  youre no fool you feel that you undertook to look after the shareholders interests when you came over and you have to make good  yes andrew assented i feel something of the kind  then well assume that you find the lode and that its as rich as graham believeswhich is taking a good deal for granted your shareholders learning that rain bluff is worthless would probably jump at a proposition that would give them back their money or even part of it you could buy them out and afterward repay yourself handsomely by developing the new mine  andrews face hardened  when these people gave us their money they did so expecting to get any profit that could be made its their due and so far allinsons has never broken faith with those who trusted it  frobisher was not surprised at the answer there was he had seen a clean pride in the man whom he felt disposed to pity allinson had obviously little knowledge of business and would have to meet the determined opposition of the clever tricksters who had floated the company he was entering on a hard fight with unaccustomed weapons nevertheless frobisher would not venture to predict his defeat courage such as allinson showed often carried one a long way and he had the right upon his side frobishers business experience had not made him an optimist but he was prepared to watch this altruistic champions struggles with friendly interest and to assist him as far as he could  you have undertaken a pretty big thing he said to begin with its a lonely country that youre going into and though having the lakes and rivers frozen may simplify traveling youll find it tough work living in the open with the thermometer at forty below winters a bad time for prospecting but as timbers plentiful you may be able to thaw out enough of the surface to test the lode and something might be done with giantpowder provisions will be your chief difficulty you will need a number of packers  if possible i must make the trip with no companions except carnally and graham everybody at the landing has heard about the lode and if we took up a strong party and failed to locate it wed have shown them roughly where it lay that would give the packers a chance for forestalling our next attempt their right to record the minerals would be as good as ours  frobisher was somewhat surprised allinson had thought out the matter in a way that would have done credit to a more experienced man  suppose we go down now he suggested after a while ill get geraldine to sing for us  andrew agreed and was glad he had done so when miss frobisher opened the piano he was not a musician but there was a sweetness in her voice that greatly pleased him he sat listening with quiet enjoyment to her first song watching her with appreciation the light from a shaded lamp forced up the strong warm coloring of her hair and fell on her face which was outlined in delicate profile against a background of ebony her figure lay half in shadow but the thin eveningdress shimmered in places flowing about her in graceful lines  he grew more intent when she sang again it was a ballad of toil and endeavor and the girl had caught its feeling andrew wondered whether she had chosen it by accident for the words chimed with his mood and he was stirred and carried away as he listened obscure feelings deep in his nature throbbed in quick response after wasted years of lounging he had plunged into the struggle of life and become a citizen of the strenuous world ingenuous as he was some of his lost youthful fervor awoke again he would never sink back into his former state of slothful ease bruised beaten perhaps he must go on the duty to which he had long been blind now burned like a beacon through the mists ahead yet it was no evanescent romantic sentiment andrew was a solid and matteroffact person  when geraldine closed the piano he rose and looked at her with a gleam in his eyes  thank you i mean it sincerely he said its a very fine song  its stirring she replied i dare say its trueone would like to think so  there was some color in her face and his heart throbbed at the knowledge that she had meant the song for him  then frobisher broke in humorously  that kind of thing appeals more to young folk when one gets to my age one would rather be soothed weve had enough of the roughandtumble scuffle its time to retire from the ring and sit comfortably in a front seat looking on  it would soon get tiresome declared geraldine you would want to take a side and instruct the combatants she added with an affectionate smile the temptation would be irresistible if somebody whom you thought didnt deserve it were getting badly hurt  i dont know interfering is a dangerous habit and people arent always grateful frobishers glance rested for a moment on his guest however i might still step into the ring if the provocation were very strong  then they engaged in casual talk until it got late and when geraldine and her father wished him goodnight andrew said diffidently  im grateful to you for keeping me here ill go back feeling brighter than when i came  he left them and frobisher looked after him with a humorous expression  that young man has chosen a hard row to hoe though i dont think he quite sees all hes up against its safer to take a bone from a hungry dog than to do a business man out of the pickings he thinks hes entitled to especially if hes engaged in floating companies  but that is part of your business  sure said frobisher its wiser to speak of the things you know ive picked up one or two good bones  but you had a right to them geraldine declared confidently  frobishers eyes twinkled  i believe there was a difference of opinion on the point but id got my teeth in first however ill admit that unless allinson was convinced the bone belonged to him hed let it go thats the kind of man he is and hes not likely to grow more prudent if you let him see that you agree with him  do you think ive done so geraldine asked  i dont know frobisher smiled it seems possible but ive no doubt your intentions were excellent youre a bit of an idealist however the fellow will do you credit he has sense and grit though hes what one might perhaps call superfluously honest  how could his virtues reflect any credit on me geraldine retorted besides your cynicism is assumed i dont believe you ever took a dollar you were not entitled to why do you always make a joke of things  its true that my ventures have generally paid a dividend but ive a suspicion that it was a lucky accident that one or two of them did so when i was young i was as serious as mr allinson but people sometimes grow more humorous as they get older they dont expect so much and they learn to make allowances  thats a mistake said geraldine i should never be content with the mediocre  she left him with a smile but frobisher looked thoughtful as he lighted a last cigar he had led a strenuous life stubbornly struggling upward from a humble beginning and the years of effort had tried him hard he had taken big risks and exacted every dollar he could but after all he did not think he had wronged anyone badly now that he had acquired power and influence he regarded human nature with whimsical forbearance but he was glad that his daughter seemed to demand conformity with higher standards thought she was free from the cant and prudery he hated then he thought of allinson for whom he had a warm liking he had fought many a stern battle before he was allinsons age but this did not make him contemptuous allinson was late in beginning but he showed a determination and what was more remarkable a sagacity that pleased frobisher well besides this the purity of his motives and his fastidious honesty roused the americans admiration frobisher would not have embarked on a long struggle for a principle but he could respect a man who did so allinson and geraldine had apparently the same ideals they had rapidly fallen into confidential termsbut that was a subject on which it was premature to speculate  andrew left the house the next day and on entering his hotel in the afternoon he found mappin sitting in the unoccupied generalroom he laid down his newspaper as andrew came in and looked up with a truculent expression in his heavy face  i got your letter at fort william as i was coming here he said it seemed to need an explanation what dyou mean by giving me warning to quit  his tone was offensive but andrew sat down quietly knowing it was desirable to keep cool  i thought id better send you notice that we may terminate our arrangements in three months as we have the option of doing he replied  but why do you want to terminate them  we may shut down the rain bluff its not paying  mapping gave a snorting laugh  what has that to do with it  it ought to be obvious andrew said curtly if the mine wont pay it must be closed allinsons is not in the habit of carrying on a business for its private benefit at the investors expense  i shouldnt have thought it mappin sneered and looked hard at andrew you seem to be taking a pretty decided line may i ask whom you are speaking for  for myself in the first place but i believe the shareholders would support me though i havent interfered much so far im the head of the firm  mappin was impressed by andrews manner and his tone became more conciliatory  im afraid you have kept out of business so long that you dont quite understand matters your brotherinlaw has arranged things here much better than you in your inexperience could do this propositions too big and complicated for a beginner to meddle with youd only involve yourself and everybody concerned in a deplorable mess be warned and let up make any small improvements and economies you can but leave the main points of hathersages scheme alone  there was some ground for mappins opinion and his air of conviction had weight but andrew had no thought of yielding  so far i cant tell what changes may be necessary but i expect to make them whatever they are as occasion arises  then hadnt you better wait until you know  mappin took a letter from his pocket suppose you tear this thing up  no andrew said firmly the notice stands  there was a moments silence while their glances met and each recognized that there should be no compromise henceforward they must be enemies  oh well said mappin with an air of ironic resignation ill continue to look after your transport until the time expires now that we understand things lets talk of something else have you seen frobisher lately im going across to his place after supper  a sudden anger seized andrew though he scarcely realized that it sprang from jealousy this coarse fellow with his low cunning and sensual nature had no right to enter the house that sheltered geraldine frobisher it was repugnant to think of his meeting her on friendly terms and having heard that he had been a frequent visitor he wondered what had induced frobisher to tolerate him an unpleasant suspicion crept into his mindperhaps the man had a friend in mrs denton who differed from her brother in many ways however andrew concealed his annoyance  it will be a fine night though the snows rather deep he said now what about the provisions i ordered  they discussed the matter for a while and then andrew went out to look for graham he found him alone in the mill office and the elder man listened eagerly to what he had to say then graham jumped up and strode excitedly up and down the room  after all the years of waiting i can hardly realize that im to have my chance he exclaimed i feel dazed the thingsoverwhelming  theres no doubt about it said andrew ive arranged matters satisfactorily with your president you have only to say that you will come  come grahams eyes glowed but he paused in sudden hesitation still i dont know how my wife will face it she must be told at once come with me and explaini think you will do it better than i can  he threw a book into the desk shut the desk noisily and took out his watch  mr allinson he said i believe this office has never been closed five minutes before the proper time since i first entered it but the habits of twenty years have lost their grip tonight i feel like a man unexpectedly let out of prison  andrew went out with him and nothing was said until they reached his house the table was neatly laid for supper and mrs graham was cheerfully bustling about it she stopped and looked at her husband with a start when he came in the man was trying hard to maintain his usual calm but his expression was strained and eager and his manner deprecatory as if he were half ashamed andrew thought mrs graham knew  can you spare me a few minutes andrew asked i have something to say  she sat down with forced quietness though her color faded  im afraid it will be a shock martha graham broke in he means to tell you that i am going north to look for the lode with him  the woman did not flinch she looked at her husband gravely with no sign of reproach and andrew saw that she had courage  i have expected this i knew it must come sooner or later she said quietly but go on mr allinson i will listen  andrew felt relieved she would give no trouble but her tense expression caused him a sense of guilt he explained the arrangements he had made and handed her two or three documents which included an order on a bank for certain payments to be made her if the expedition did not return by a specified date  mrs graham took the papers with a gesture of repugnance but a moment later she looked up quietly  its fair its generous mr allinson i am getting old and my daughter is very young then her lips quivered and she broke into a pitiful smile you have done what you can but it doesnt cover the greatest risk i run  i know responded andrew gently i am asking a great deal from you  well she said for his sake perhaps for my sake i must try to let him go she paused for a moment and then asked with an effort when do you start  as soon as we can andrew felt that it would be tactful to take his leave but i have a letter i must mail  come back please she said supper will be ready in about ten minutes  when andrew had gone out graham turned to his wife  im sorry martha i feel that i must go  she came to him and put her hands on his shoulders smiling bravely  why of course dear i wouldnt stop you  graham threw his arms around her  it isnt all restlessness marthathere is a chance what have i done so far but keep you poor it has hurt me to see you always hard at work at some drudgery living in this poor little house planning to save a few cents wherever you could now there may be a change our life will be very different and the childrens future brighter if i can find the lode but if i am to find it i must go now in a few more years it would be too late  yes she said softly but after all we have been happy here  he kissed her protesting that he had been far happier than he deserved but she drew away from him  still you have had your bad hours do you think i dont know it wasnt easy to go to the office day after day and keep accounts with the longing you couldnt get over and dreams of riches in your mind  im afraid i let you guess it but theyre not dreams i found a lode rich in silver i may locate it again  mrs graham smiled rather wearily  dear i hardly care whether you find the lode or not you will be content when you have looked for it and i shall be happier knowing that the restlessness you couldnt master has gone and will never trouble us again  when jim and his sister came in for supper andrew joined them and found that he was expected to talk over his plans it was obvious that graham had not strained his authority his was a harmonious household and its younger members expressed their opinions with freedom andrew was however amused to see that their father had risen in their esteem they had never attached much importance to his belief in the lode but since he had gained the support of a man of means it looked as if there might be something in the project nevertheless they bantered andrew freely and he took it in good part when he left mrs graham accompanied him to the door  youll try to forgive me he begged stopping a moment in the narrow shabby hall  yes she said i cant fairly blame you and i have been prepared for what has happened then she laid her hand on his arm i am trusting you with a great deal mr allinson its a heavy responsibility     chapter xii  interrupted plans   mrs denton reclined in an easychair in her room at frobishers house a shawl of beautiful texture covered her shoulders her feet rested on a stool and the lamp on a neighboring table was carefully shaded the dull pallor of her skin and the gauntness of her face suggested the invalid but her health while far from good had suffered from the thought she bestowed on it she was a reserved and selfish woman and her mean ambitions were responsible for much of the trouble that had befallen her geraldine and she were generally at variance frobisher bore with her but there was one person for whom she cherished a somewhat misguided tenderness mappin had been her favorite from his earliest years  his father had been her lover when the frobishers were poor and she had returned his affection nevertheless she had thrown him over when a richer suitor appeared and her marriage had turned out disastrously urged by a desire for social prominence and love of ostentation she had driven her husband into hazardous speculations for which he had weakly reproached her when the crash came he escaped total ruin by frobishers help but he afterward went downhill fast wrangling with his wife until his death set her free her old lover had also married and died a widower leaving one son and mrs denton had shown a benevolent interest in the boy he was bold and ambitious which was what she liked and she was not deterred by the lack of principle he early displayed success was the one thing she respected and as he grew up young mappin promised to attain it now she was expecting him for he came to see her whenever he was in the neighborhood and frobisher made him welcome for her sake  when mappin came in he was redfaced from the frosty air  this place is stiflingly hot he said im afraid thats because youre not feeling very fit yet  mrs denton told him she could not get rid of her cold and he had the tact to listen with a show of interest while she talked about her health  you will stay all night she asked  yes im sorry i must get back tomorrow  then ive no doubt its necessary she remarked in a suggestive tone  mappin laughed as if he understood her  it is as things are going business must come first besides i cant flatter myself that i gained much by my last visit  thats a point i cant speak upon but youre not likely to lose your head theres a coldblooded calculating vein in you i wonder whether that was why you came straight to my room though the society of a crotchety old invalid cant have much charm for you  the mans heavy face grew a trifle redder than usual  no he protested it wasnt im not dirt mean  oh well said mrs denton looking at him gently you know im your friend but i never pretended not to guess what brought you here  and i havent made a secret of it i mean to marry geraldine  shell have a good deal of money some day  mappin looked up angrily  ill admit that my interest generally comes first but id be mighty glad to take geraldine without a cent  then you had better bestir yourself allinson has been here pretty often and she seems to like him besides hes made a good impression on her father  ah exclaimed mappin that confounded englishman again its only a few hours since he threatened to cut my connection with the rain bluff and one way and another thats a bad setback he frowned and the veins showed on his forehead i was coining money out of my contract and i need it because i have my feelings and i wont ask frobisher for geraldine like a beggar he has a cool smiling way of saying unpleasant things that makes me mad i want to show him im as smart as he is and can give the girl as much as he can  when they were detached from his business mappins ideas were crude but mrs denton was not refined and found no fault with them moreover she had an interest in his success for a long time she had been the mistress of her brothers house and directed his social affairs the position was a desirable one especially as she had been left without means but it was threatened it was inevitable that geraldine would take the power she enjoyed out of her hands unless she married had mappin not entered the field mrs denton would have furthered the claims of any suitor to get the girl out of her way  i suppose money would gratify your pride but you may find waiting risky she said if youre wise youll make all the progress with geraldine you can  he smiled ruefully  i sometimes feel that im making none she looks at me half amused and half astonished when i express my opinions i have to keep a curb on myself when i talk to her in fact ive once or twice got mad i can take a joke but her condescending smile is riling  then why do you want to marry her  it puzzles me when i think it over coolly but thats difficult when shes near me i only know that i want her his eyes gleamed and his face grew flushed as he proceeded guess it must be her wonderful eyes and hair and skin the shape of her the way she stands the grit she shows once when i said something she flashed out at me in a fury and i liked her for it he clenched a big hand somehow im going to get her  mrs denton smiled the savagery of his passion did not jar on her she admired his determined boldness she respected force that was guided by capacity she liked a man who was strong or cunning enough to take what he desired her niece however held different views  that sounds genuine she said still you had better talk to geraldine in a more polished strain  no id do it badly and it wouldnt pay theres red blood in me and i havent found much difference in men and women if you hit straight at their human nature you cant go wrong a girls never offended because you like her for being pretty  he was wise in that he knew his limitations and never pretended to be what he was not his knowledge of human weaknesses had been profitable for he had not scrupled to prey upon them but he erred in assuming that his was the only rule of life virtue he frankly regarded as either absence of desire or a sentimental pose  youre too coarse too crude in your methods mrs denton persisted if youre not careful youll disgust geraldine you dont seem to see that shes different from the girls you are accustomed to  mappin laughed  oh he said at heart theyre all the same  in a sense youre wrong allinson lets geraldine see that he puts her on a higher plane and she likes it if you cant imitate him you had better watch him  if allinsons likely to make trouble ill fix him quick pretty talk and finicking manners thats all there is to him except a few fool notions about the mining business which he hasnt the grit or ability to carry out but you look as if you had a headache and i guess ive talked enough  she let him go fearing to strain the consideration he sometimes showed her for he was the only person for whom she had a scrap of affection mappin left her with halfcontemptuous pity he owed her some gratitude because it was on her account that he had been received in the house but he knew how little her support was worth for he was shrewd enough to see that her brother and her niece held her in no great esteem indeed he knew his position was not encouraging geraldine had shown him no favor and frobishers attitude was more marked by forbearance than friendliness but mappin was not deterred he had stubborn courage and a firm belief in his powers  reaching the bottom of the stairs he stopped in the shadow of a heavy curtain as geraldine came out of a door at the farther end of the large hall the girl did not see him and prompted by curiosity to learn what effect his sudden appearance would have he stood watching her she looked thoughtful and moved slowly but with a grace he did not miss the soft rustle of her dress stirred him he noticed with greedy eyes the fine outline about which the light material flowed the bloom of her complexion the beauty of her pose indeed he forgot why he had waited for his heart was beating fast and he felt his nerves tingle he was filled with a burning desire to possess her  then she saw him and recoiled there was a glitter in his eyes from which she shrank his face was stamped with gross sensual passion it alarmed her and filled her with disgust mappin however could not guess her feelings she was obviously startled perhaps he had shown what he thought of her too plainly and shocked her prudishness but this after all was no great matter delicacy was unknown to him he could hardly have been made to understand that geraldine regarded him with downright loathing still as he could think of nothing to say he was not sorry that she turned back without a word and with a harsh laugh he opened an adjoining door to look for frobisher geraldine returned to the room she had left and sat down with a sense of repulsion that presently gave place to burning anger she felt that she had received an outrageous insult  she did not see mappin again until the next morning when she was coldly polite and he left in a state of halfpuzzled irritation thinking more about allinson than he had done the man might prove a dangerous rival unless something were done to prevent it mappin however thought that he could deal with him and was glad he had written to hathersage giving him a hint that allinson threatened to make trouble for them both  as a result of mappins letter andrew was handed a cablegram one evening when he was discussing the preparations for the journey with carnally and graham in the latters house when he had opened it he frowned  this promises to complicate matters its from my brotherinlaw he explained and read out the message  do nothing until i arrive sailing sylvitanian  graham took up a montreal paper  one of the fast boats he should be here in nine days then he looked disturbed it may prevent your going north  no andrew said resolutely it shall not do that but ill have to see him its strange he should come though i told him the mine wasnt paying  you want to remember that mappins a friend of his carnally interposed theres another thing you cant tell him about the lode which so far doesnt belong to you i guess the less you say about your plans the better  i believe thats true andrew agreed well our start must be put off a while  leonard arrived accompanied by wannop who explained that he had come to see the country and look up one or two old friends soon after they reached the landing leonard had an interview with watson who had been summoned to meet him then he went with andrew to his room at the hotel it was small and scantily furnished but a galvanized pipe which ran up through the floor from the basement heater made it comfortably warm and leonard sitting in a rickety chair watched his brotherinlaw closely while he talked about the mine andrew had acquired a quickness of thought and a decision of manner which were new to leonard there was a pause after he had finished his explanation for both felt that the next few minutes might prove momentous they held widely different views and an unconsidered remark might bring them into open collision leonard waited ready to profit by any mistake the other made until andrew spoke  i was surprised to hear you were coming over though perhaps its as well you did so  when i got your letter the matter seemed serious enough to require my personal attention  you may tell me what you think said andrew and ill consider it carefully  to begin with why did you give mappin notice to terminate his contract  it seemed the best thing to be done in the shareholders interest  there was something impressive in andrews tone leonard knew that a conflict which he wished to avoid was imminent  i wont mince matters he replied you have no business experience and know nothing about mining you have acted rashly i made the arrangements with mappin and considered them satisfactory  im sorry to hear it i wish it had been somebody less closely connected with allinsons who concluded the deal with him the mans making a good thing out of his contract at the companys expense  you mustnt be hypercritical opportunities for picking up a few dollars are often attached to operations like ours and its wiser to let ones friends have them and look for favors in return besides the man does his work well  no corrected andrew he does it badly with a cool assurance that no fault will be found and well pass his bills in fact for the firm to take any favors from him would savor of corruption in the end the shareholders would have to pay for them  be careful leonard warned him you may cause a good deal of trouble without doing any good remember that youre only here on trial and accountable to the rest of the directors if necessary the power youre overstraining could be withdrawn  i think not said andrew in a sense im allinsons it would be a difficult matter to get rid of me i have neglected my duties but its not too late to make a change  leonard paused to light a cigarette he had been met with a firmness he had not expected and he realized that andrew might prove a formidable antagonist  very well he conceded if you insist on our giving no more work to mappin i suppose he must be sacrificed though you place me in an unpleasant position after all hes comparatively unimportant we must talk about the mine you seem to think it ought to be closed which is out of the question for the present you have no doubt learned that it often takes time to reach payable ore all sorts of preliminary difficulties have to be overcome and investors have frequently to exercise patience and put up with disappointments  you promised a good dividend in the prospectus  we didnt promise it on the first six months working besides one makes allowances for prospectus statements  it shouldnt be needful where allinsons is concerned but what do you suggest  that we keep the mine open and do everything possible to increase the output and strike better ore in the meanwhile we wont say too much about our troubles  when you increase the output you increase expenses this doesnt matter so long as the refined metal will pay for it but its a ruinous policy where the ores no good then you cant hide our difficulties the shareholders will expect a dividend and if it isnt forthcoming theyll demand an explanation at their meeting  that might be prevented the family vote could be relied on and its often possible to control a meeting and silence objectors these are matters you can leave to me  the objectors have a right to be heard they could be silenced only by trickery if we have made a mistake we must admit it and consider how we can cut the loss  admit our mistake leonard laughed youre talking at random  andrew leaned forward his eyes fixed on his brotherinlaw  this company should never have been floated well let it go at that the less said upon the point the better the question iswhat is to be done now well ive decided on two thingswell keep a few men working at the mine because the yield will cover their wages while i go into the bush and look for a richer lode ive heard about if im successful well consider the new situation  seeing that objections would be useless leonard reluctantly acquiesced and it was a relief to both when wannop came in  theres a friend of yours asking for you andrew i brought him up he explained and stood aside as frobisher entered  i came to ask you over for a day or two and i shall be glad if your relatives will come as well he said we have plenty of room and have been rather dull lately besides the hotel is too full to be comfortable  after some demur they agreed to go and andrew felt grateful to frobisher for the visit would relieve the strain that leonards society threatened to impose on him half an hour later they took their places in frobishers sleigh     chapter xiii  loves encouragement   it was after dinner and wannop lounging comfortably over his cigar in frobishers smokingroom smiled at andrew who sat opposite  this is a very nice house and i like your friend he commented its lucky he invited us because i dont know how theyd have put us up at the hotel  what brought you over with leonard andrew asked bluntly  gertrude wanted to make some visits this winter which set me free ive never been much away from home and it struck me as a good chance for seeing canada then jack cartwrightyou may remember himis in toronto its twelve years since ive met him though he has often urged me to come over and theres another man i know in winnipeg  i wonder whether that was all  wannop looked amused he was stout and clumsy but he had his jovial air  you seem to have been getting smarter since you came to canada he said perhaps id better admit that i was anxious to see how you were getting on  didnt leonard tell you  leonard was as guarded and diplomatic as usual he informed us that there had been some trouble at the mine and he was afraid you hadnt experience enough to deal with the situation then he gave us the impression that you were inclined to be rash and might make a mess of things unless he came over and put you right  ah exclaimed andrew i expected something of the sort  they looked at each other with mutual comprehension  can matters be straightened out wannop asked  not in the few days that leonard intends to devote to it its most unlikely that the rain bluff will ever pay  im sorry to hear it a good deal of my money and gertrudes has gone into the mine  you neednt be alarmed i dont think the shareholders will suffer  andrews tone was impressive and wannop looked at him sharply  that doesnt seem to agree with your last remark  ive a plan for working a richer lode but i cant tell you anything further because the secret belongs to another man until the minerals have been recorded and it wouldnt be fair to leonard and the directors who havent been consulted about the project yet when my plans are ready they will be disclosed perhaps im straining your confidence  it will stand some strain but are you sure that leonard will be fair to you  that is another matter andrew said quietly  well im glad you have told me something it gives me a lead it was obvious that you and leonard were at variance in fact ive foreseen a split for some time and if a side must be taken id rather stand by you  thanks but it may get you into trouble  wannop lighted another cigar and then looked up with a chuckle  were neither of us sentimentalists but theres something to be said you and i have always got on well and when i married gertrude you didnt lay such stress on the favor shown me in being allowed to enter the family as your estimable relatives did then were the two whose abilities arent held in much esteem which is some reason why we should stick together with all respect for the others i sometimes think theyre wrong  andrew laughed  well come to business wannop went on while the rain bluff shares were well taken up by outside investors a good many are held by the family these count as a compact block a strong voting powerthough its remarkable that leonard holds less than any of the rest of us so if theres to be a fight between you and him it will begin among your relatives their opinion is more important than that of the general shareholders  yes assented andrew leonard would be powerful if backed by the solid family vote  the point is that he may not get it anyhow gertrude and i will support you and we hold a good deal of stock between us  thanks said andrew still it may not come to a struggle of that kind after all it must be avoided if possible  then frobisher came in and interrupted them  leonard spent a week with frobisher driving across to the landing each morning on business he and andrew now and then discussed the companys affairs without open disagreement his attitude toward andrew was friendly but marked by a tone of goodhumored forbearance and when he spoke of him to frobisher it was with a trace of amusement as if andrew were erratic and needed judicious guidance it was done cleverly for leonard carefully avoided detraction but his remarks conveyed the impression that andrew was something of a simpleton  if allinson hasnt much judgment why did you send him over to look after the mine frobisher once asked him bluntly  leonard smiled at this  we didnt give him much responsibility to tell the truth we wanted to get him away for a while there was a young grasswidow that it seemed possible he might make a fool of himself about rather a dangerous woman i believe and andrews confiding  when his guests had returned to the landing frobisher remarked to his daughter  mr hathersage doesnt seem to think much of his brotherinlaw  so it seems said geraldine with an angry sparkle in her eyes he never missed an opportunity for cunningly disparaging him  then you dont agree with his opinion  i dont know that it was his real opinion geraldine replied i wouldnt trust the man she paused and asked sharply would you  if i had to choose i think id rather put my confidence in allinson  he looked thoughtful when his daughter left him for he had not spoken to her without an object and her indignation had its significance on the whole however frobisher saw no cause for uneasiness he liked andrew and though leonards explanation might have had a deterrent effect he disbelieved it  before returning to england leonard had an interview with mappin at the hotel  do you know anything of the lode allinson talks about he asked him  nothing except that it lies up in the northern barrens a mighty rough country and that people think its a delusion of the man who claims to have discovered it but didnt your brotherinlaw talk it over with you if hes interested in the thing  he did not i may as well admit that there are points upon which his views dont agree with mine  so i imagined mappin remarked pointedly  hes in favor of closing the rain bluff if that were done it would of course cost you your contract  mappin looked thoughtful leonard had already sketched out a plan by which the notice andrew had given mappin might be rendered of no effect  well he said id much rather keep it but we had better be frank you would prefer that allinson didnt find the lode  i dont want him to waste the companys time and money on a journey into the wilds and expensive prospecting work which will probably lead to nothing it would be wiser to keep the rain bluff going and get out as much ore as possible i neednt point out that this would be more to your interest  thats so chuckled mappin i begin to see im to make all the difficulties i can for allinson  leonard hesitated he was asked to give his confederate dangerous powers but he thought the safety of his position required it there did not seem to be much likelihood of andrews discovering valuable minerals but he might perhaps find somewhat better ore than the rain bluff was turning out and with a practical scheme for working it gain support enough to embarrass the directors if however andrew failed in his search it would be easier to discredit him and the demand he would no doubt make for the abandoning of the mine could be withstood  i think thats what i meant he said you are in charge of our transport and i expect hell need a quantity of food and prospecting tools sent up into the bush i can leave you to work out details  mappins eyes flashed  i guess i can fix it let it go at that now theres another matter i want to mention  leonard acquiesced in the change of subject feeling that he had done all that was possible to counteract andrews projects he left with the montreal express the next morning  two days later mappin was summoned to andrews room at the hotel and found him studying a list of provisions  we shall get off in the next few days he said i want you to send these supplies up to the mine where well call for them  what about the rest of your truck mappin inquired  carnally has sent it off already  mappin saw that he could not do as much as he had expected to delay the party  is there anything else he asked  yes said andrew as we cant transport stores enough for the whole march provisions will have to be cached for use on our return do you know where whitefish creek is  its a very long way up and said not to be indicated very correctly on the map two forks arent there  andrew nodded  a lake lies about two days march up the east branch and theres an island in it with a sandy tongue at one end take this list of provisions and have a cache made there get them up in a month from now you can do that  oh yes ive some smart packers  then heres another list to get to the whitefish you cross the height of land and theres a low neck in the middle of the long ridge i want another cache made at the bottom of the gap you understand that its important  ill make a careful note of it mappin promised your idea is to travel with light loads and replenish your stores at the caches as you come back  precisely carnally and graham have been calculating our supplies closely and we shall not have much left when we reach the first cache you had better put a barked firpole on the top of it there are trees about  the boys ill send up will see to it said mappin and after a few questions took his leave  a day or two later andrew walked across the ice in the evening to see the frobishers before he started on his journey and when he had spent some time with them geraldine went down with him to the hall they were alone for her father was searching for a compass he wished to give andrew geraldine stopped when she reached the foot of the stairs and stood with her hand on the balustrade her unstudied pose was graceful she made a very attractive picture and though she saw andrews admiration she was not displeased it was different from that which mappin had bestowed on her  i think you are doing a very fine thing she said diffidently you see i know something besides what you have told me about the mine and allinsons ethel hillyard wrote to me not long agoi knew her in englandand she said several nice things about you  did she said andrew with some embarrassment ethels a good friend but its rather trying to have things said about you  now youre curious geraldine replied and ill be indiscreet enough to mention one she said you were always sincere and to be relied on she paused a moment and added i think thats true your going to search for the lode proves it  andrew looked at her steadily his heart throbbing  would you be surprised to hear that you are largely responsible for the search  i what could i have to do with it  ill try to explain there was a time when i was half afraid to go on with my plans i could see nothing but trouble ahead then one day when you were speaking of carnally you said something about doing the square thing that and the song you sang one evening soon afterward decided me  then im afraid ive been very rash its a responsibility i should not have assumed after all i know nothing about the difficulties you may meet with  and i know very little except that theyll certainly be plentiful ignorance is a heavy handicap and it doesnt make things better when its your own fault still whether you meant it or not you showed me that there was only one course opento go straight ahead and leave the rest to fate  his words awoke a responsive thrill in geraldine for she knew his worth there was courage in him and sterling honesty he was entering on a hard fight for the sake of people unknown to him who had trusted to the honor of his house he would she believed be opposed by clever trickery prejudice and strong commercial interests but if the world were ruled by right as she tried to believe it was unthinkable that he should be beaten  well she said with the color in her face and sympathy in her eyes i wish you good luck but be careful up there among the rocks and muskegs dont run too many risks come back safe  thank you it would be something to you if we kept out of trouble  his gaze was steadily searching and for a moment she turned her head then though there was a slight change in her manner she looked around with a smile  yes of course she answered i shall be anxious while you are away and eager for news  andrew saw that there was nothing more to be said and he was glad that frobisher came down the stairs with the compass in his hand  its one of the cutest things of the kind ive seen said the american theres very little oscillation the card cant come unshipped and you can take a bearing correctly with the sights on this sliding ring  when andrew had thanked him for the gift he left the house it was a still night and bitterly cold but he walked back across the ice to the landing with a glow at his heart     chapter xiv  treachery   the afternoon was nearly over and the frost intense when andrew plodded up the frozen river with carnally and graham the snow crunched with a squeaking sound beneath their moccasins which andrew had had specially made because ordinary boots are not adapted to the extreme cold of the north on their western hand the pines stood out sharp and black against a coppery glare and as they passed the wider openings the light struck dazzlingly into their aching eyes ahead the white riband of river led into a wilderness of rocks and stunted trees but there was no sign of life in all the picture and everything was very still  the men were not heavily loaded for most of their supplies had been sent on to the mine but andrew had found his pack a bad enough handicap on the long march upriver and had noticed with some concern that graham seemed to feel the weight more than he did the old man had lagged behind but he now came up breathless  you want to get a move on carnally advised its most six miles yet to rain bluff and im feeling ready for my supper  so am i said graham but it was too cold to rest by the greenwood fire when we nooned and im not so young as you are then it is remarkable how twenty years of domestic life soften one  sure grinned carnally you dont find the man who gets his dinner every day leading in a long hard march that was allinsons trouble when he first took the trail with me  there may be disadvantages in having regular meals but i know from painful experience what an ache in the side you get when forced to go without andrew returned its one of the things ive learned in canada  youll learn a few more of the same kind before youre through carnally drawled but how do you like your moccasins  theyre comfortable the american shoe people have made them well but im not sure theyll last the journey through its lucky we have some spare pairs among the provisions mappin has sent up  it might have been better if wed hired two or three boys at the landing and packed the truck up along with us carnally remarked  mappin engaged to forward the things its his business  carnally looked unconvinced  i never deal with a man whos not straight if i can help it you cant tell when he may go back on you unless you can fix it so that his interest is the same as yours and you and mappin dont agree  thats a fact andrew admitted however well soon find out about the provisions  he forced the pace but it slackened again he was tired the red glare which grew more lurid hurt his eyes and he was thankful when it suddenly faded leaving the wilderness wrapped in soft blue shadow the packstraps galled his shoulders his furcap was thick with rime and its fringe of frosted hair stung his forehead they came to a narrow reach where the stream ran fast and the ice was thrown up in ragged hummocks it was difficult to pick their way in the dim light they slipped and stumbled breaking through the treacherous snow bridges between the blocks and when they came out upon a better surface it was dark shadowy firs rose about them here and there an icecrusted rock showed above the gray level of the stream except for their soft footsteps there was a deathly silence graham was now some distance behind them and after a while he made protest  hold on he cried im not toughened up to your mark yet  andrew was glad to wait for him though the frost bit keenly when he stopped and he was anxious to finish the long days march the ranks of stunted pines looked inexpressibly dreary looming out of the darkness and fatigued as he was the savagery of the surrounding desolation oppressed him they would reach warmth and shelter in another hour but when they went on again andrew thought with a heavy heart of the leagues of travel through the grim solitudes of the frozen north up there their only restingplace would be a hollow behind a rock or a trench scooped out of the snow still he was not daunted he had undertaken a big thing and he meant to carry it out  at last a twinkle of light showed among the trees and when they approached one of the shacks at the mine the door opened and a dark figure appeared against the brightness of the interior  is that you watson andrew asked has mappin sent up some provisions for us  nothing has turned up lately except some tools watson answered but come right in  they entered the shack which for the first few minutes felt intolerably hot  did those tools come in cases with a toronto freight tag carnally asked  they did said watson  carnally looked at andrew  thats what misled me i found out the cases had left the landing and thought they held our truck what i wasnt sure about was whether theyd reach here  the provisions havent come and a day or twos rest will do us good andrew replied i suppose the fellow will send some explanation  thats certain he wont want you to go down and look him up youll get word from him before long whether youll get your provisions or not is another matter  let it drop andrew advised and soon afterward they sat down to supper in an hour or two they were all asleep but the next day passed before they heard anything about the missing supplies they were sitting round the stove in the evening when watson came in with a letter  one of mappins boys has brought you this he said  andrew opened it and looked up with a frown  no answer let him go back when he likes  when watson left them he turned to the others  mappin regrets to say that our stores have been lost in transit and though he is trying to trace them there may be some delay he thinks i would like to know this at oncewhich looks like ironical wit if needful he will order a duplicate lot  is it worth while to go down and see him graham asked  id enjoy it said andrew grimly however now that we have come so far we cant waste time in going back and ive no doubt it would be a week or two before i could get the goods well have to do without them which is unfortunate  his anger was justified travel in the north where food is scarce is a question of transport as the traveler must take all he needs with him his supplies must be carefully regulated in accordance with the distance and his power of carrying them while an error in his calculations may result in starvation knowing this carnally and graham had considered how the weight could be cut down by the use of certain condensed foods as well as clothing and camp equipment made to combine the greatest warmth with lightness the goods were expensive but their value could hardly be reckoned in money  then we had better push on at once graham suggested we have the things carnally sent up and we ought to get some provisions at the hudson bay factory where i expect to hire the sledge dogs it will add to our loads and shorten our stay but well have to put up with that  you should have cut mappin right out of this business carnally said to andrew his first trick hasnt stopped us but i feel uneasy about leaving him to handle the food well need when coming down  andrew looked grave  the mans treacherous but he has gone as far as is safe already taking it for granted that he wishes to prevent our finding the lode one can understand his trying to hinder our outward journey he would however gain nothing by delaying our return and hes too clever to risk getting himself into trouble without a good reason  that sounds right i can find no fault with it carnally agreed well pull out tomorrow but id feel easier if the making of those caches wasnt in mappins hands  they left rain bluff the next morning and it was a week later when mappin learned that he had failed to detain them he had just returned to the landing from a business visit and was sitting in his room at the hotel when the messenger came in  did mr allinson seem annoyed he asked  cant say the man replied he didnt say a word to me told watson there was no answer and pulled out with the other fellows next day  i suppose they went off with pretty heavy loads  thats so took some of watsons blue camp blankets and i guess theyll soon get tired two of them are tenderfoots at the job  carnallys a smart bushman isnt he  sure but hed all he could carry  mappin was surprised at the turbulence of his feelings though of gross nature ambition and avarice had hitherto dominated him and he was generally marked by a coldblooded calm now however his passions were aroused and he was filled with an anger which he thought must be subdued before it led him into rashness he had done all he could to delay allinson and though he had failed it was not his habit to grow savage at a reverse moreover it was unlikely that the prospectors would get very far for all that he was disturbed allinson whom he had regarded with contempt as a fastidious tenderfoot might prove a dangerous rival that he had refrained from sending down an angry remonstrance suggested strong selfcontrol and a suspicion of mappins motives he must be careful and must make all the progress he could with geraldine while allinson was away  during the next three weeks he saw the frobishers often though he had undertaken an important railroad contract for which his men were cutting lumber in the bush geraldine treated him with a conventional politeness which misled him for he was inexperienced in dealing with girls of her character indeed except for his business capacity mappin was undeveloped and primitive for all that he felt that he was not advancing much in geraldines favor and he made up his mind to press his suit without delay allinson would be back before very long and the provisions he would need for his return journey must shortly be sent off  after waiting for an opportunity he found geraldine alone one evening in her drawingroom and sat down feeling unusually diffident as well as eager though he forced himself to talk about matters of no importance for one thing the room had a disturbing effect on him it was furnished with refined taste and all its appointments seemed stamped with its owners personality a faint perfume that she was fond of clung about it all this reacted on the man and the girls beauty worked on his passions  she listened with indifference now and then glancing toward him he was smartly dressed but he looked out of placetoo big and gross for his surroundings then by degrees she grew more intent there was a hint of strain in his voice and a gleam in his eyes which caused her vague alarm his face was slightly flushed he looked coarser than usual and when he was silent his lips set in an ugly determined fashion at last when she was thinking of an excuse for leaving him he rose  geraldine he said i have something to tell you  she looked up quickly somewhat frightened he thought and he was not displeased  oh she exclaimed is it necessary  i think so you shall judge for a long while ive been very fond of you  his ardent glance repelled her she resented it and this gave her courage  i wonder what you mean by that she asked coldly  the man failed to understand her love was not a complex thing to him  it ought to be pretty simple youre the girl i mean to marry i set my heart on it some time ago  mean to marry youre not diffident  mappin laughed and his amusement filled her with repulsion she was not encouraging he thought but he had not expected her to be so  no he replied im not bashfulness doesnt pay and i havent had time to study saying pretty things i want youthere it is  its a pity you didnt tell me this earlier it might have saved you some disappointment said geraldine  she was angry and alarmed but keenly interested she had not expected that her first offer would take this abrupt form but there was no doubting the strong primitive passion in the man it was a force to be reckoned with one could not treat it with indifference he looked big and clumsy as he stood with his eyes fixed on her but his face and pose suggested power  well he explained there was a reason i was pretty low down in the world i hadnt much to offer and i wouldnt have you think i wanted you for your money now ive got on i begin to see how im going to make a big success theres no longer anything to stop my claiming you  this sounded sincere but it was unthinkable that she should feel any tenderness for the man and he must be made to understand  mr mappin she began but he checked her  let me get through you shall have all you want a house in montreal or toronto as you like smart friends and positionguess if i set my mind on it i can get them in fact you shall have what you wishyoull only need to ask for it i want my wife to take a leading place and ill see she gets there  im sorry but its impossible for me to marry you said geraldine firmly  mappin regarded her with a grim smile  you look as if you meant it  i do geraldine tried hard to preserve her calm please understand that my mind is made up  oh he replied tolerantly i didnt expect to get you first try guess ill have to wait until you get used to the idea  i shall never get used to it  he had held himself in hand but as he heard the decision in her tone his passion mastered him  never is a mighty long time you have got to yield sooner or later i can make you  geraldine rose with all the dignity she could assume but he moved between her and the door  wait a bit he said with a harsh laugh now whats the matter with me  i think i need only say that youre very far from being the kind of man i could marry let me pass  mappin barred her way  well he said i know my value ill stand comparison with that finicking englishman  her blush told that this shot had reached the mark and he turned on her with fury  youll never get him count on that ill break the fellow  geraldine recoiled she thought that he meant to seize her he was capable of it indeed he moved a pace or two but this gave her an opportunity for reaching the door there she turned and saw that he was watching her with a curious grim smile  the subject is closed she said you have behaved hatefully  escaping into the hall she sought her room and shut herself in she felt humiliated and although there had once or twice been something ludicrous in the situation the mans overbearing boldness had strongly impressed her she was afraid of him he would not readily be beaten  mappin left the house without speaking to frobisher and returned to the landing the next day he sent for the packer who was to lead the party taking up andrews supplies the fellow was some time in coming and mappin waited for him in a threatening mood geraldines blush had filled him with jealous hatred allinson was a dangerous rival let him beware  you know the whitefish creek he said to the man he had summoned what lies between the forks  a piece of high and very rough country muskegs full of little pines mussed up with blown trees in the hollows  well said mappin youll cache the supplies for allinson where ive put the cross on this map think youve got it right  yes answered the packer it must be near the tall butte a piece up the creek thats a pretty good mark  then theres the other lot of supplies you can see the place for them on the height of land south of the whitefish  the man glanced at the map and nodded  well dump those first everythings ready well pull out as soon as i can get the boys together  he left the room and mappin lighted a cigar he felt somewhat nervous as if he had undergone a strain  if allinson gets through ill allow hes the better man he mused     chapter xv  the silver lode   a halfbreed stood on the river bank beside his dogteam while andrew handed carnally the packs from the sled it was late in the afternoon the valley was swept by driving snow and the mens hands were so numbed that they found it difficult to strap on their heavy loads the ice was several feet in thickness on the deeper pools but the stream ran strong along the opposite shore and its frozen surface was rough and broken in places by pools of inky water  it would save some trouble if we made our caches among these boulders graham suggested  thats so agreed carnally still i guess it would be safer on the other side where well strike it sooner coming back its wise to take no chances in this country  they were loaded at last and the gorge looked very desolate when the halfbreed vanished with his dogs beyond the summit of the bank he was not a man of much conversational powers but they had found his company pleasant in the grim solitudes andrew had hired him at an outlying hudson bay factory where he had had no trouble in obtaining food the fur trade was languishing thereabout and prospectors for timber and minerals were made welcome the scot in charge of the lonely post had however no dogs for sale though he engaged to transport a limited quantity of provisions to a point which one of the companys halfbreeds despatched on another errand would pass with his team  andrew considered carnallys caution well justified their supply of food was scanty and the journey attended by risks enough but he could sympathize with graham it was snowing hard the wind was rising and there was no sign of a campingplace in all the desolation they had gone a long way since sunrise and were too tired to think of lengthening the journey by looking for a better place to cross the river they went forward carefully avoiding the hummocks and winding around the larger cracks andrew was too occupied in picking his way to notice that graham had fallen some distance behind but when he had skirted a tall hummock a sharp cry reached him and he stopped in alarm he could see nothing except a stretch of rugged ice and a high white bank fading into the driving snow their companion had disappeared  guess he was straight behind us cried carnally as they turned back running  andrew fell over a block of ice but he was up in a moment for the cry came again and when they had passed a black pool he saw what seemed to be the head and shoulders of a man projecting from a fissure he sprang across a dangerous crack and as he ran he saw grahams face turned toward him with a strained tense look carnally was a pace or two in front and had seized grahams arm when andrew came up and grasped his collar they dragged him out of the crevice and set him gasping breathlessly on the ice with the water running from one of his moccasins  you were only just in time he said after a moment or two there was snow across the crack and it broke under me couldnt crawl out with my pack dragging me down  its blamed unfortunate you got your moccasin wet carnally remarked it ought to come off right away but we havent another think the water has got through  im afraid it has the back seam opened up a bit yesterday but my feet are so cold i can hardly feel  if mappin hadnt played that trick on us youd have a sound dry pair to put on but you want to keep moving and its getting dark  they crossed the ice without further misadventure toiled up a steep bank where short brush that impeded them badly rose out of the snow and an hour afterward found a hollow among the rocks sheltered by a few junipers and tottering firs carnally loosed the load from his aching shoulders and threw it down with relief  its that hog mappins fault were packing a pile of unnecessary weight along he said im looking forward to a talk with him when i get back  he set to work hacking rotten branches from a leaning fir while andrew scraped away the snow and built a wall of it between them and the wind graham lighted a fire filled the kettle with snow and spread branches and twigs to lay their blankets on it took time and andrew knew of no labor so irksome as making camp after an exhausting march but no pains could be spared if they wished to sleep without freezing at last they gathered about a crackling fire which threw an uncertain light upon their faces and carnally cooked a frugal supper  i guess we could eat more but it wouldnt be prudent he said as he shared out the food your lodes about a hundred miles off yet isnt it graham  yes as near as i can calculate  call it six days a fortnight anyhow before we get back here and that wont allow much time for thawing out and shotfiring then well have to reach our first cache before the grub runs out its going to be a blamed tight fit  andrew consumed his portion and glanced regretfully at the empty fryingpan then for fatigue had soured his temper he broke out  id like to have the brute who cut our rations short up here tonight blast his greed its an infamous thing that a man should make money by starving his fellow creatures  they seem to consider it legitimate in the cities said graham dryly we have mergers controlling almost everything we eat and drink and men get rich by bull deals in the wheat pits however your sentiments are not exactly new what do you think jake i havent heard you on politics  carnally grinned  as it looks as if im going to be hungry im a hardshelled gritsomething like your radicals he explained to andrew but if i thought we could get a good one id prefer being governed by an emperor so far as my experience goes one live man can run things much better than a crowd and its a poor mine or railroad boss who cant beat a board of directors  thats so graham assented theyre most capable when they let one of them drive the lot but theres the trouble that you might get the wrong kind of emperor its hard to tell a good man until he gets to work  sure agreed carnally if youre not pleased with the laurier gang you can fire them out and then you might not find the other crowd much better but if a bad emperor meant to stay with it youd have to use dynamite  the others laughed but andrew awkwardly filling his pipe with numbed fingers looked serious there was a truth in his companions remarks that touched him personally it was undoubtedly difficult to get rid of an able man entrusted with power which he abused to attack him might imply the breakup of the organization which had appointed him one might have to use destructive methods and andrew wished to build up the rain bluff company not pull it down for all that leonard must be stripped of the authority he had wrongly used though the task would be extremely troublesome with one or two unimportant exceptions he enjoyed the confidence of the allinson family as well as the support of the directors and andrew knew what his relatives thought of him in the first place however he must find the lode and he was glad to think it lay within a weeks march from camp  have you got that wet moccasin off yet carnally asked graham  graham confessed that he had been too tired and hungry to remember it and after drawing it off with some trouble he spent a while in chafing his foot which he afterward wrapped in a blanket then while the men sat silent a long howl came faintly down the bitter breeze  a timber wolf said carnally i saw some tracks this morning and the halfbreed told me theyd had a number of the big gray fellows near the factory they get pretty bold when theres no caribou about and its unlucky we havent struck any caribou it would help out the grub  three men with a campfire going are safe enough said graham  oh yes carnally assented still a timber wolf is a beast ive no kind of use for in winter  they lay down soon afterward but andrew heard the wolves again before he went to sleep he was very cold when he awakened the next morning and found carnally busy about the fire there was no wind the smoke went straight up and the snow stretched back from the camp glistening a faint silvery gray the firs were very black but indistinct in the growing light  get a move on we should have been off long ago carnally said and andrew rising with cramped limbs and sore shoulders awkwardly set about rolling up his pack  he shivered as he did so the cold bit through him his mittened hands would hardly bend but he strapped up his bundle and helped graham to put on his frozen moccasin they were careful to hang up their footwear in a warm place at night but the fire had sunk while they slept then they ate a hurried meal and struck out into the white wilderness as the light grew stronger they made by estimation eighteen miles by nightfall finding a creek and one or two small lakes over which traveling was easy but most of the way led across hillocks of rounded rock and through tangles of tottering pines where snowshoes could not be used some of the trees had been partly burned and others were slanted and distorted by the savage winds  toward the end of the march graham dragged behind and when they made camp he spent some time rubbing his foot  it feels dead he told them im afraid i got it nipped a bit but i dont think its bad  see that you get your moccasin properly dry tonight carnally warned him  the next morning he felt lame and the country was rougher but they made thirty miles in two days and set out again on the third dawn with thick snow driving into their faces fortunately the ground was smoother and they plodded on stubbornly with a short halt at noon carnally breaking the trail for the two behind graham had trouble in keeping up with his companions but they had no thought to spare for him during the laborious march it needed all their resolution to press forward against the searching wind at nightfall they camped in a sheltered ravine and when supper was over graham got carnally to help him off with his moccasin while they pulled at it he made an abrupt movement and carnally stopping glanced at a dark stain on the leather  that looks like blood  i think it is said graham i slept with the thing on last night to tell the truth i was afraid to take it off  it will have to come off now  carnallys face turned grave when graham removed his stocking part of his foot felt cold and lifeless the rest was inflamed and there was a red patch rubbed raw by the frozen moccasin  looks bad carnally said have you got an old handkerchief or anything to wrap round it  i couldnt walk with a bandage under my stocking  youre not going to walk you ought to know what trouble that might make carnally turned to andrew he cant go on its a dangerous thing to gall a frostnipped foot i dont see how it got so bad in four days time  graham broke into a wry smile  it began to hurt soon after i left the factory and getting it wet didnt improve things but i thought i could hold out until we made the lode  there was silence for a few moments grahams foot was throbbing painfully and having gone on until compelled to stop he knew his helplessness his comrades realized that they were burdened with a crippled man far from shelter and assistance in an icy waste dejection seized them and andrew glancing at the darkness round about felt a sudden horror of the desolation this however was a dangerous feeling to yield to and he strove to overcome it  were two days march from the lode he said its unthinkable that we should turn back without trying to locate it graham may be better after a rest it might be possible carnally that by forcing the pace we could knock a day off the double journey  ill give you six days graham said i can stay here but if you dont start the first thing tomorrow ill crawl on myself  no andrew declared whether we strike the lode or not well be back before the fourth morning the next thing is to consider what to do then provisions arent plentiful  they discussed the matter at length for even the finding of the lode was by comparison unimportant it would be some time before graham could walk far and with each days journey seriously curtailed there was grave danger of their food running out at first carnally was in favor of trying to reach the factory where they would find shelter but yielded to the objection that it was farther off than the nearer of the caches which mappin had been engaged to make he agreed that they would save several days by cutting the back trail between the mine and the spot where they had diverged to reach the factory and they would then pick up a hand sled they had used for a time and abandoned when the country grew very rough and their load lighter if grahams foot was still troublesome they could haul him on the sled and still make a good days march the plan was agreed on and after carefully arranging their packs for the expedition and getting the clearest instructions that graham could give them they went to sleep  the next morning long before daylight andrew and carnally were getting together a supply of branches and logs so that graham might keep a fire going night and day until their return for the double purpose of warmth and of protection against the timber wolves when they had made graham comfortable they set off they had heard no wolves of late which was reassuring but they had grave misgivings about leaving the crippled man and meant to save every possible minute on the march it was comparatively open country they could use their snowshoes and they pressed on until dusk without stopping though the last league taxed andrews strength he was badly tired when at noon the next day they reached a hillside commanding a rocky basin filled with stunted pines a shallow ravine ran at their feet  carnally stopped suddenly  i believe weve struck it he cried that must be the creek graham talks about  forgetting their weariness they ran down the hill and stopped beside a frozen stream hemmed in by iceglazed rocks  i guess were somewhere about the spot and well fire a dump shot on yonder ridge where theres not much snow carnally said thats all we can do  cant we stake three claims andrew suggested the recorder might allow graham one if things were explained  it cant be done you get the frontage you apply for on the reef but its extent is limited and full particulars must be supplied while a man can hold only one claim on the same vein then a record isnt secret if you dont stake off the best of the lode you give the thing away and send off every prospector who hears of it to locate what you have missed  the situation was clear to andrew and it was daunting after all the fatigue and dangers of the journey he must go back without accomplishing anything useful but there was no help for it  i suppose if we had a week we might form some idea of what is worth staking off even with the snow on the ground he said however as it is we have got about two hours we had better make the most of them  they lighted a fire and sat beside it thawing two sticks of dynamite a proceeding attended by some risk which carnally seriously increased when he crimped the powerful detonating caps on the fuses with numbed and clumsy fingers both men were moody and dejected but they did not express their feelings for they were capable of meeting reverses with silent fortitude carnally stood to lose more money than he had ever had a prospect of earning until his companion took him north andrew knew at what a disadvantage his failure would place him in the struggle with leonard he was sincere in his purpose to see justice done but he had no romantic ideas about it his task was based on common honesty allinsons had guaranteed the undertaking and allinsons must make good andrew was however troubled by two conflicting claims he had a duty to the shareholders which could best be discharged by remaining near the lode until he proved its value and a duty to graham whom he had promised to bring home safe and sound graham most unfortunately was crippled and the scarcity of provisions made it doubtful whether he could be taken back to the landing unless they started without delay the shareholders must wait  carnally kneaded the softening dynamite round the detonators  try to scrape down to the rock on the spot i marked he said ill come when youre ready and well fire the shot  andrew had some trouble in carrying out his instructions but when he had done so carnally laid the cartridges on the stone and covered them with snow carefully pressed down then they dragged up a small fallen spruce and laying it on the spot lighted the fuses and hastily retired in a minute there was a flash a sharp report and a shower of flying fragments plunged into the snow while a cloud of vapor curled up andrew sprang from his shelter but carnally seized his arm  hold on he cried you dont want the fumes to knock you over i guess well get dinner while we wait you cant expect any startling results from one shot  eager as he was andrew ate his share of the scanty meal he could practise selfcontrol and he had marched a long way on short rations in bitter frost  when they had examined the cavity made by the explosion carnally covered it with snow and picked up the broken bits of rock they had gathered a small heap and carnally carefully selecting a few looked at andrew with a smile  i suppose you feel that youd like to take the whole lot  i thought we might carry half of them andrew admitted  unless youre willing to dump your blankets these will be enough its a long way to the landing and we have to make the first food cache quick  youre right said andrew besides we must reach grahams camp by tomorrow night  rough on you carnally sympathized i havent as big a stake  nothing more was said while they rolled up their packs and set off grimly on the return trail  it had been dark for several hours the next night when andrew wearily toiled up a long rise dotted with ragged spruces he was hungry and very cold though he panted with the exertion he was forced to make there was no feeling in his feet which were bound to big snowshoes his hands were powerless in his thick mittens and he carried a light ax under his arm fortunately the trail they had broken when coming out led straight up the rise and carnally pressed on in front a gray shape outlined against the glitter of the snow a halfmoon hung above them in a cloudless sky the frost was intense and the white desolation lay wrapped in an impressive silence not a breath of wind stirred the tops of the spruces  andrews knees were giving way and it seemed to him that the ascent they were laboriously mounting ran on for ever he felt as if they had spent hours on it though the frozen river at its foot was not far behind them it was discouraging to fix his eyes on the black shape of a spruce ahead and see how slowly it grew nearer but he felt unequal to contemplating the long trail to the summit and he divided the distance into stages between tree and tree  at last they crossed the ridge and it was a relief to go downhill though the spruces grew in thicker belts and there was half a mile of timber that they were forced to traverse in their moccasins fallen logs obstructed their passage they plunged into tangles of blowndown branches the snow was loose among the slender trunks and here and there they sank deep in it andrew was however consumed by an anxiety which would brook no delay and when he had with difficulty replaced his snowshoes he looked up at his companion  we cant be far from camp he queried  about three miles we ought to see it when were through the timber on the lower bench graham had wood enough to keep a good fire going  they pressed on slipping down the steeper slopes stumbling now and then for both had regretted the necessity for leaving graham alone and at sunset they had seen the tracks of wolves at last they plunged into a thick belt of spruce where the trees were fairly large and there was not much fallen wood here and there a broad patch of moonlight glittered on the snow confusing after the deep gloom but the men could get through on their snowshoes and avoid the trunks they made good speed and when they broke out into the open andrew stopped where a bright blaze should have marked grahams fire there were only a few dying embers the old man was nowhere to be seen     chapter xvi  the cache   the two prospectors forgot their weariness as they rushed to the dying fire carnally looked at the embers  cant have been gone long he declared  shout jake cried andrew im out of breath  carnally called and andrews heart throbbed when a faint cry rose in answer his anxiety had not been groundless a lonely man runs many risks in the frozen north following the sound they hastened up the ravine and as they rounded a projecting boulder a red glow flashed out a little distance ahead died down and rose more clearly  thats mighty good to see carnally exclaimed  graham met them as they entered the firelight  had any trouble andrew asked anxiously  no and the foots feeling better the rest has done it good ive been pretty comfortable since you left though the wolves got so friendly last night that i thought id better shift my camp a bit tonight i didnt allow you could get back before tomorrow and i knew id hear you shout if you did i left the other fire burning as a beacon  andrew breathed deeply  its a wonderful relief he said  carnally looked hard at grahams face  guess you didnt sleep well but well get a good rest tonight now there are three of us a timber wolf is a cussed mean brute government ought to supply the bush settlers with free arsenic  there was a brief silence while graham waited intent and eager until carnally broke into a soft laugh  we struck it partner guess your lodes right there but we couldnt do enough prospecting to tell you what its worth  graham turned his head for a moment and his eyes glittered when he looked around  that is my misfortune and mappins fault but you must have your supper and then well talk  carnally glanced at andrew who had thrown off his pack and sat down on it in an attitude of exhaustion  allinson allowed wed be back tonight and he hustled me along pretty lively for a tenderfoot  they laughed at this and began the meal which graham soon had ready then sitting close beside the fire they filled their pipes and graham carefully examined the bits of stone carnally produced he poised them in his hands because the weight is a rough test before he looked up  what do you think of them jake he asked  my idea is that theyre pretty good though they are not carrying a remarkable quantity of metal of course we may have struck only the edge of the lode there wasnt time to find how it ran  graham sat silent a while and then turned to andrew with a strained expression  i agree with carnally so far as i can judge these specimens are not very rich though the ore might pay for reduction that i feel disappointed after waiting twenty years for this chance doesnt need saying but ive brought you here at a big expense and risk and i cant blame you if you let the matter drop  nothing is farther from my mind declared andrew smiling its unpleasant to feel beaten and im partly responsible for our failure by confiding in mappin if you and carnally still think im to be trusted as a partner well come back again though id prefer waiting until the ice breaks up in the spring  grahams relief carried him away  id trust you with my life allinson its hard to express what i feel but ive got to talk if we had failed to find the lode id have gone home content i think to forget it but to have struck it and got no farther would have been maddening the thing would have haunted me for the rest of my days but i hardly expect any one would have put up the money for another search i can see myself hanging round mining mens offices laughed and sneered at neglecting my work until the sawmill people turned me outtheyll tell you at the landing that im a crank but the silvers there allinson you have only to look for it  well have a good try andrew promised cheerfully but the first thing we have to do is to get home and im afraid it wont be easy i wish the hudson bay factory werent so far off  they discussed their return graham declaring that his foot was much better and that he ought to have no difficulty in keeping up with them and soon afterward they went to sleep  at daybreak they set off in a haze of driving snow and andrew long remembered the march with a shudder there was only one thing in their favorthe raging wind which drove the loose snow in clouds along the frozen creeks blew behind them the cold was intense even when no snow fell the light was dim but they stumbled on making the best progress they could on the second day out graham sat down among the willows on an island trying to alter the fastenings of his snowshoe carnally turning back with andrew through a cloud of drifting flakes glanced sharply at the sitting man  ah he said indicating a broad smear on his moccasin thats fresh and bigger than before  broken out again said graham curtly theres no use in talking about it i cant nurse it now  can you walk andrew asked  ill have to graham answered getting up  the truth of this was obvious for the alternative was to freeze to death he managed to keep up with the others though carnally slackened the pace all the afternoon when they camped at nightfall graham would not let him examine his foot  if the moccasin comes off ill never get it on again he declared  after this the distance traversed daily was reduced and rations were cut down to match one day when the wind raged behind them they made fourteen miles along a frozen creek but more often they made eight or nine and part of the time graham carried his snowshoes and limped in his moccasins his companions helped him as much as they could over the roughest ground but the only effectual way of assisting a crippled man is to carry him which they could not do their faces grew sterner and gaunter but with grim restraint they husbanded the rapidly running out provisions and one blustering morning they came upon the sled they had left on their outward journey half covered with snow  the traces though frozen hard were still attached to it and andrew slipped them over his shoulders when graham wrapped in all their blankets sat down on the sled it was a relief to get rid of their loads and for a while andrew made a moderate pace the wind had hardened the surface of the snow and the runners slid along easily but he found it different when he came to the next ascent the trace hurt his chest the weight he was hauling seemed to increase his breathing got harder his knees and shoulders ached  you had better let me have hold carnally suggested  ill get off said graham i could hobble along if you fixed the back posts so i could lean on them  stay where you are carnally bade him curtly we have to make good time and were going faster with you on the sled  they altered the traces and plodded forward side by side until the sled overturned on a steep slope and flung graham off for the next hour he had to walk while they struggled across rocky hummocks and through belts of small spruces and his face was gray with pain when he resumed his place still they made progress and felt more cheerful when they camped at night  i allow were four miles to the good on this stage carnally said thats a quarter of a day knocked off with luck and a smooth trail were going through  somehow they maintained the speed though the struggle was almost unbearably hard and one afternoon they nerved themselves to an extra effort as they toiled up a creek it ran between rugged hills and the snow was good they were badly worn out and andrew had a distressing pain in his side but he braced himself against the drag of the trace watching the white hillshoulders change their shapes ahead they were on the whitefish creek and the first provision cache was not far off when they reached it they would rest and feast luxuriously  keep her going urged carnally we want to make the island where the cache is before dark  for an hour they struggled on in a state of tension the snow crunching beneath their shoes large flakes blowing past them a heavy gray sky hung over head and the cold was biting then the hills in front grew dimmer the scattered spruces lost their sharpness of form dusk was falling when they came to a narrow lake here the snow was very firm and the pace grew faster they broke into a run when a blurred mass of willows came into sight the cruel aches in joints and muscles were no longer felt the food they craved was close at hand they drew near the willows rapidly though andrew was panting with exhaustion the first of the bushes slipped behind but more rose ahead and he grew savage as he glanced at them he knew that the island was small but they seemed to be getting no nearer to its upstream tongue where he had arranged with mappin that the cache should be made  get on he cried hoarsely i can stand a little more yet  a few minutes later they dropped the traces and the sled driving in among the willows stopped with a crash leaving graham to hobble after them andrew and carnally plunged through the branches and came out on a short level strip it was nearly dark now but the snow glimmered faintly and only a few clumps of brush broke its surface andrew stopped breathing hard and dismay seized him as he glanced about  this is the place he said hoarsely i cant see the cache  search round here ill try farther on carnally said and vanished among the willows  pulling himself together andrew spent a few anxious minutes hurrying up and down the open space but found nothing to suggest that it had lately been visited by a transport party when he stopped graham awkwardly hobbled toward him  havent you found it yet he asked  no said andrew as calmly as he could there may have been a mistake about the spot carnallys gone back to look  they stood still for a few moments while the willows rustled harshly in the bitter wind a little snow blew about them and it was very cold then andrew broke away from his companion and plunging into the bushes that grew thickly up the middle of the island savagely floundered through them he could not see where he was going snowladen branches whipped him and he stuck fast now and then but he thought that nobody could have traversed those thickets without leaving traces of his passage and finding none he presently returned to the clear space graham was still standing in the middle of it but they waited in silence until carnally appeared he was walking heavily and they knew he had been unsuccessful  nothing not a sign of a cache he reported in a strained voice so far as i can see this is the only place on the island where one could have been made i found a few small spruces on a higher patch well pack the truck along and camp there  it took them some time and they had trouble in helping graham through the brush but scarcely a word was spoken until they gathered about their fire then carnally broke into a harsh laugh as he laid three morsels of pork in the fryingpan and took out a very small bannock baked the previous night  this isnt the kind of supper i looked forward to but well get less tomorrow he said the blasted hog has played another trick on us     chapter xvii  the gap in the ridge   the scanty supper was finished before the three men held a council  well have another search in the morning but you can take it for granted that theres no cache here carnally said grimly  could mappin have made a mistake about the place graham suggested  no sir thats a sure thing but wait a minute i think i see carnally lighted his pipe before he resumed now you want to remember that were up against a clever man he didnt mean us to find the food but hed see that there was a chance of our getting through without it and try to fix things so allinson wouldnt have much ground for making trouble so he sent the supplies up  then where are they andrew broke in  let me finish i guess there was nobody else about when you told him where to make the cache  andrew nodded and carnally went on  you said the east whitefish and he sent the truck to the west fork its a point where one might go wrong and hell claim that he misunderstood you and you didnt make your instructions clear  i believe youre right andrew had a savage glitter in his eyes but the brutes coldblooded cunning is devilish he meant to starve us to death because i threatened his contract  thats not all mappins dirt mean but i guess he has a stronger count against you  ah said andrew sharply as a light dawned on him i wonder whether you have hit the mark  in spite of the peril to which he was exposed he felt a thrill of satisfaction it looked as if mappin whom he suspected of seeking geraldines favor had some ground for believing him a successful rival perhaps the girl had inadvertently betrayed a preference for him mappin would not be driven into a risky course by impulse he must have believed his jealousy wellfounded this was comforting but andrew had now to consider how he and his comrades were to escape from their difficulties  couldnt we get across to the west fork he suggested  well try said carnally its a rough bit of country  very rough graham agreed a low range with steep rock on this side runs through it ive no doubt mappin knew that when he decided to make the cache on the other fork  then suppose we cant get over  carnally looked thoughtful  if thats so well push on for the second cache  they looked at him in astonishment and he smiled the cache is theresomewhere about the neck you told him ofthough i guess hell have had it put where we wont find it easily anyhow it will have to be found and when it comes to bush work my heads as good as mappins  andrew made a gesture of assent apart from his knowledge of the wilds carnally had shown a power of close and accurate reasoning which had surprised him indeed andrew was inclined to think him a match for mappin all round and was glad of it because there was no doubt that he needed a keenwitted supporter  theres another thing carnally remarked presently has it struck you that hathersage may have given the hog a hint  andrew flushed  no he said sternly its unthinkable i cant discuss the point  oh well acquiesced carnally now that weve decided what to do wed better get to sleep we have to look for a way across the range the first thing tomorrow  at noon the next day andrew stood breathless halfway up a gully filled with hard snow walls of iceglazed rock shut it in but it led straight up the face of a towering crag toward an opening high above andrew carried a thick sharppointed stick with which he had laboriously broken holes for his feet because soft moccasins are treacherous things on a steep snowslope he and carnally had spent half an hour over the ascent and andrew looking up with a sinking heart thought it would take them as long to reach the summit provided they could avoid slipping which was doubtful  the gully lay in shadow a long deep rent widening toward the bottom in which the snow gleamed a soft bluegray though a ray of sunlight struck the beetling crag so that it flashed with steely brightness here and there a spur of rock broke the smooth surface and offered a restingplace but some of the spaces between them seemed dangerously precipitous andrew worn with hunger and fatigue frowned at the sight  this looked the quickest way up and we havent much time to lose he said ill feel very savage if we dont get a clear view from the top  youll get that replied carnally finding a precarious seat near by whether youll see a way through the rocks on the other side or not is another matter and im doubtful better get a move on hadnt you  andrew placed his foot in a hole he had made but the snow broke as he rested on it and he slipped down several yards before the stick brought him up he shuddered as he glanced below for it struck him that had he slid a little farther he would not have stopped until he reached the bottom  this is an abominable slope he exclaimed ive been on worse in switzerland but i had an iceax and wasnt half starved then however well have another try  he got up twenty yards clawing at the snow and then stopped for breath glancing ruefully at his mittens which showed signs of wearing through  it means frostbitten hands if these things give out and they wont stand much more he said the worst of it is that you think well find we have wasted our labor when we get to the top i believe i could feel cheerful if i could see mappin crawling up after us  mappin has more sense he stays in his office which is how money is made you dont as a rule get much for doing this kind of thing still he has to take some chances and one he didnt size up right is going back on him when im feeling tired and hungry i like to think of my meeting with that man  when youre feeling tired and hungry andrew exclaimed i feel both all the time  well returned carnally what can you expect if you will make trouble instead of letting things alone you must take the consequences now if you had been a sensible man and not worried about shareholders you have never seen you might have been sitting down to your lunch at home think of it a nice warm room a butler or somebody of the kind bringing you a menu as long as your hand put you there right now and youd take the whole lot say what do you have as a rule  stop said andrew it wont bear thinking of i know what ill get for supper and thats an inch or two of flinty bannock burned black outside  it was surface jesting and forced upon them because they would not face the tragic possibilities of the situation before it was necessary it was easier to do what could be done with a laugh still they had not laughed much lately until the imminence of disaster braced them to it  changing places now and then to relieve the leader of the work of breaking footholds they reached the summit and andrews heart sank as he gazed at the landscape which stretched away before him the air was clear bright sunshine glittered on the high rocks but the snow in the shadow was steeped in ethereal blue dark spruces broke the gleaming surface with a delicate intricacy of outline the scene had a wild grandeur but from andrews point of view it was inexpressibly discouraging they had laboriously scaled the first and largest rampart but beyond it lay a series of lower ridges with rugged and almost precipitous sides the hollows so far as he could see were filled with spruce muskegthe small rotting trees falling across each other with underbrush pushing up between to traverse these places would be a very difficult matter  it looks pretty bad he said slowly mappin knew his business when he had the cache made on the wrong side of the range  hes smart carnally agreed a hard man to beat and you want to use a fullsized club when you stand up to him but i guess hed go down if he got the right knockout  andrew tired and hungry failed to see how the decisive blow could be given there did not seem to be much probability of his ever coming to close quarters with his enemy so far as his brief experience went injustice was singularly hard to vanquish and the reformers path rough  couldnt we work around the hills to the other fork he asked  the grub would run out before we got there  i suppose we couldnt push straight across leaving graham until we came back  we might if we had time enough i believe theres forty miles of this broken country look at it  andrew had already done so and it had daunted him he remembered that they had been since sunrise reaching the top of the first ridge  then what must be done  my advice is to look for the second cache  they turned back following the crest until they found an easier but longer way down graham glanced at them sharply when they reached the camp and guessed the truth though andrew tried to smile  leave me behind he urged  no said andrew firmly not while we have strength enough to haul the sled theres no more to be said on that point were going on together to the gap in the long ridge  when do you mean to start  right now carnally broke in get the camp truck rolled up well have mighty keen appetites before we make the cache  in quarter of an hour they crossed the creek and toiled up a broken slope and when they gained the top andrew looked back at the island with a grim smile  yesterday afternoon i came up that river at four miles an hour looking forward to my supper like an epicure now im glad to see the last of the place  quit talking said carnally we can make a few minutes by a hustle down the pitch ahead  they went down stumbling and sliding while graham clung tightly to the lurching sled time was of vital importance to them now for its flight could be measured by the exhaustion of their food supply for the hour or two of daylight that remained carnally drove his comrade hard and it was with a strange savage hilarity that they rushed the sled down declivities and dragged it with many a crash and bump through thickets their course was roughly south and any deviation was intolerable night closed in but it was far from dark and they held on until andrew stumbled and fell the sled struck him before he could get up but a hard smile was on his lips when he rose shakily and looked about there was an uncovered rock not far off with a few junipers growing beside it  this is far enough jake he said youre bad to tire but i dont suppose you feel equal to hauling another passenger  they broke camp in the dark the next morning and the forced marches they made during the next seven days wore the halfstarved men terribly sometimes they had to contend with fresh snow in which the sled runners sank sometimes they plodded doggedly with lowered heads while a raging wind drove the stinging flakes into their pinched faces and there were days of bitter frost when they could not keep warm still they crept on across the rugged desolation and one evening reached a belt of timber beneath a low range that stretched across their path the ridge was broken by a gap a mile or two ahead and it was there that andrew had instructed mappin to make the second cache a crescent moon rose above the dark treetops as they lighted a fire andrew glanced at the hillside irresolutely  theres food up yonder if we could get our hands on it and i would enjoy a good supper heaven knows but i dont feel equal to facing another disappointment he said im afraid well have to wait until tomorrow  thats my feeling carnally agreed ive gone as far as im able and that grub wont be found easily you may as well gather some wood and fill the kettle  when they had eaten the few morsels he allowed them they sat smoking beside the fire the thin spruce boughs above them were laden with snow which now and then fell upon the brands a malignant wind swept between the slender trunks and blew the smoke about the men after a while the casual talk which had cost them an effort to keep up died away and there was a long silence until carnally spoke  i guess were all thinking about those provisions well look for them at sunup what ive been trying to do for several days is to put myself in mappins place  it must have been difficult andrew remarked if i thought you could do so id disown you but go on  well said carnally we have agreed that he meant to make it hard for us to find the cache but hed try to fix things so the packers he sent up with the truck shouldnt guess his object he wouldnt tell them to pick a place where nobody would think of looking  youre assuming that hed employ honest men graham objected whats to prevent his hiring three or four toughs and bribing them to say nothing  hes too smart said carnally promptly hed know that if we got lost up here the fellows could keep striking him for money and hed have to pay while if we got through thered be a risk of our finding them and buying them over besides men of the kind hed want are scarce in the bush if theyre to be found its hanging round the saloons in the cities  then well assume that the boys were square that would make it harder for him and easier for us what follows  carnally drank some tea from a blackened can before he answered  this matter needs a lot of thinking out and it looks as if our lives depended on our thinking right allinsons instructions to the hog seem to have been pretty clear and he wouldnt plant the cache too far from the gap then hed have to arrange things so the boys would think theyd dumped the truck in a handy place for a party coming down from the north  i believe he has never been up here andrew argued are there any good maps i couldnt get one  theyre sketchy graham said my idea is that mappin would get hold of a prospector who knows the country and have a good talk with him but he wouldnt send him up with the other men  its probable agreed carnally well in my opinion the provisions are lying south of the pass in one of the gulches leading down from the height of land but not directly on our line of march you can come up from rain bluff several ways and the hog would mark a route for the boys which would bring them in so far as he could figure a bit outside the shortest track weve got to find the gulch theyd pitch on its our brains against mappins  your brains andrew corrected him  carnally knocked out his pipe  i allow ill want a clear head tomorrow and im going to sleep  he and andrew left camp in the dark the next morning but day had broken when they stood in the gap of the neck looking down on the broken country beneath for a short distance the descent from the pass was clearly defined leading down a hollow among the rocks but after that it opened out on to a scarp of hillside from which a number of ravines branched off and led to the banks of a frozen creek they seemed to be filled with brush and the spurs between them were rough it was a difficult country to traverse and andrew realized with concern that the search might last several days  take that right hand gulch carnally directed follow it right down to the creek and come back up the next farther on while i prospect east if we find nothing in the ravines well try the spurs  the obvious place is the gap were standing in andrew pointed out how would mappin get over that without making his packers suspicious  i thought of it said carnally hed contend that he was afraid the cache might get snowed up and it would be a pretty good reason the drifts pile up deep in a gap like this  andrew left him and spent a long while climbing down a rough ravine which led him to the river it was noon when he came back up another and the exertion had told on him but they had long ago dispensed with a midday meal and he held on at a dragging pace until a thrill ran through him at the sight of a tall pole among the rocks ahead he made for it in haste floundering over the snowcovered stones and lost it once or twice at a bend in the gully at last he stopped in the bottom of the hollow looking up at a steep face of rock it was ragged and broken glazed with ice in some places and he doubted whether he could get up but a foot or two of the pole rose above the top following up the gully he looked for an easier ascent but he could not find one fearing to lose the pole he stopped and shouted on the chance that carnally might be in the neighborhood presently a cry answered him and when carnally came scrambling down the hollow andrew took him back and pointed out the pole  a dead fir cried carnally looks as if somebody had broken the branches off and there are no other trees about the trouble is we cant get up from here  we will have to declared andrew if you could give me a lift up over the worst bits id help you when i had found a hold anyway we must try  carnally consented dubiously the rock was about thirty feet in height and very steep though there were several crevices and broken edges andrew ascended one of the latter gripping it with hands and knees reaching a narrow ledge he leaned down and gave his hand to carnally and when he had helped him up they stopped for a minute or two they were weak and hungry and there was an awkward bulge above  steady me up said andrew if i can find a crack for my hand i can get up there  for a few moments he rested his foot on carnallys back then he pressed his toes against the stone and his comrade watched him disappear beyond the bulging rock with unpleasant sensations knowing that he would have to follow presently however the bottom of andrews fur coat fell over the edge and carnally seizing it scrambled up three or four feet until the projecting stone forced him outward losing hold with his feet he hung by his hands for a moment or two in a state of horrible fear  throw one arm over the projection andrew shouted  carnally found a hold andrew seized his arm and after an arduous struggle he stood gasping on a snowy knob the sharp edge of a big slab rose eight or nine feet above him  take a rest advised andrew if you go slowly you ought to get up this last bit  ill have to try its a sure thing i cant get down but how dyou come to be so smart at this work  i used to do something like it in switzerland  well said carnally youre a curious kind of man i guess you didnt have to climb id find it a bit too exciting if i wasnt doing it for money  were not climbing for money now andrew grimly reminded him theres food ahead of us and we must get on  they made the ascent though it tried their nerve severely when they finally crawled up to the summit andrew stopped growing suddenly white in the face  look he said hoarsely  carnally sat down heavily in the snow  a dead tree nobody put it there it grew  with an effort he pulled himself together  come well try farther on     chapter xviii  the empty flourbag   when it was getting dark andrew and carnally gave up the useless search a red glow flickering among the spruce trunks guided them down the pass and they saw grahams figure black against the firelight as they approached the camp he was standing up looking out for them but they came on in silence and after a quick glance at their faces he turned away and busied himself getting supper he knew they had failed and words were superfluous  they ate the small bannock he took from the fryingpan and andrew glanced about the camp when he had lighted his pipe graham had been at work while they were away laying down spruce branches and raising a wall to keep off the wind it was warm beside the fire and the place looked comfortable  there wouldnt be much to complain of if we had enough to eat said andrew its surprising how soon one gets grateful for such a shelter as this and i believe ive slept as soundly in the snow as i ever did in bed  i tried to fix things neatly though i wouldnt have been sorry if id wasted my labor graham replied and glanced at carnally it struck me we might be here a day or two  carnallys smile was rather grim  its very likely spose i ought to play up to allinson but hes put it a notch too high ive been doing some hard thinking while i was on the hill were certainly up against a tough proposition  youre still convinced the grub is here  that is a sure thingall we have to do is to find it but its going to be a big job i expect both of you want me to talk  their willingness to hear his views was obvious  the trouble is he explained you can get down from the neck a number of different waysthere are the spurs one could break a trail along and there are the ravines we may try them all before we strike the right one but well have a better chance if we work up instead of down  why andrew asked  because the packers would start from the low ground and the benches look different from below  do you think mappin told them to pick any particular place  ive been figuring on that hes learned something about the ground and my idea is that the provisions are dumped in a hollow that looks like a good road up to the gap that is as you would see it from the creek what we dont know is where his boys would strike the ice it might be anywhere within three or four miles  andrew knit his brows  its a puzzling question and we have only a day or two to find the answer the worst of it is that were worn out and famishing i feel that my wits would be quicker if i could come at it fresh from a square meal  no sir a mans brain is keenest when hes working on short rations  i believe thats true graham said  our rations contended andrew couldnt be much shorter but i couldnt think of anything intelligently as i stumbled along through the snow today and yet  he broke off remembering that once or twice of late he had become capable of a strange clarity of thought accompanied by an unusual emotional stirring it had passed but it had left its mark on him after all it was in the stern north that he had first seen things in their true proportions it was there that the duty he had vaguely realized had grown into definite shape and leonards treachery to allinsons had been clearly perceived moreover he had somehow gained a new and unexpected sense of power then as the fire blazed up he glanced with sudden interest at the faces of his comrades they were worn and haggard and grahams was stamped with lines of pain but there was something in them he could best describe as fine hunger and toil instead of subduing the men had given them new strength and an elusive dignity andrew remembered having seen that puzzling look in the lean brown faces of tired and thirsty soldiers as a brigade went by through the rolling dust of the african veldt it had been flung back shattered from a rock fortress and was pressing on undaunted to a fresh attack andrews heart had throbbed faster at the sight and he now felt something of the same thrill again but these things were not to be spoken of  well said carnally i might feel content if i thought mappin was as hungry as we are but theres not much fear of that the blasted hog has sense enough to keep out of the bush going about the country getting his hands on other mens money pays him better hes no use for eating supper behind a bank of snow the place viger and the windsor in montreal are more his style  this was far from heroic but andrew laughed the minor weaknesses of human nature seldom jarred on him  i think he suggested lightly you might for a change call him the swine its a term we sometimes use and it sounds grosser than the other the hogs ive seen running in the ontario bush were thin and not repulsive  ill admit its foolish but when i think of that man studying the menu i get mad cant you see him picking out the dollar dishes on the european plan canvasbacks and such if theyre in season  they wouldnt give him much canvasback for a dollar graham objected  that doesnt count the point iswhere does he get the dollar  im afraid he has got a few of them out of us said andrew he has got more out of the rain bluff shareholders though im glad to think that supply will be stopped anyhow our first business is to find the cache  thats so assented carnally as he threw some branches on the fire well try again at sunup though it makes you feel easier now and then talking doesnt do much good  a few minutes later they were all asleep and when day broke andrew and carnally descended a steep snowcovered bank below the neck their search proved unsuccessful and they were very silent after they returned to camp in the evening the next morning graham gave them a very small bannock for breakfast and then threw an empty flourbag into the snow  boys he said gravely you have got to find the cache today  spurred on by the imminence of starvation they started off again beating their way against a driving snowstorm stumbling often and rising each time with greater difficulty always however keeping eager watch for the pole that should mark the spot of the cache  after three days of fruitless search they could not bear to talk when they met in camp in the evening they knew that starvation was upon them their last strength was fast running out they were not the men however to give up easily and once more they set off grimly at sunrise  it was snowing hard when andrew knowing that he could drag himself no farther crawled into the shelter of a rock on the desolate hillside and sat down shivering there was an intolerable pain in his left side he was faint with hunger and his muscles ached cruelly his fur coat was ragged his moccasins were cut by the snowshoe fastenings and falling to pieces his face was pinched and hollow it was some hours since he had seen carnally he was physically unable to continue the search but he shrank from going back to camp where there was nothing to eat and facing his famishing comrade indeed as he grew lethargic with cold it scarcely seemed worth while to make the effort of getting on his feet again he sat still listlessly looking down across the white slopes carnally would probably pass near the spot though there was now no expectation of his finding the cache during the last few days they had sometimes met while they searched and exchanged a brief nothing yet or a dejected shake of the head it would be the same again though andrew felt that his comrade might have succeeded if they could have held out  he could not see far through the snow which swept along the hillside before a savage wind blurred clumps of spruce marked the edge of the lower ground but the river was hidden and the straggling junipers on the spurs were formless and indistinct at last however andrew noticed something moving near the end of a long ridge and as it must be a man he concluded it was carnally returning then he imagined that the hazy figure stopped and waved an arm as if signaling to somebody below that was curious for his comrade would be alone  andrew decided that he had been mistaken and bent down to brush the gathering snow from his torn moccasins but he started when he looked up there were now two men on the slope below and while he gazed at them a third emerged from among the rocks     chapter xix  a womans way   they had not been forgotten while they journeyed through the wilds frobisher thought of them now and then and his daughter more often indeed her mind dwelt a good deal on andrew after he left and she found herself looking forward eagerly to his return she spent some weeks in an american city with her father but its gaieties had less attraction for her than usual and she was glad when they went back for a time to the lake of shadows on the day after her arrival she drove across the ice to the landing and inquired at a store where news circulated whether anything had been heard of the allinson expedition the proprietor had nothing to tell her but while she spoke to him a man crossed the floor and she saw with annoyance that it was mappin she left while he made his purchases but he joined her when she was putting some parcels into the sleigh and did not seem daunted by the coldness of her manner  i didnt know you were coming back so soon he greeted her  didnt you she asked indifferently when my father had finished his business we suddenly made up our minds to leave without consulting mrs denton i suppose that explains your ignorance  youre smart he said as soon as youre ready to receive people i must make my call  it was getting dark but the lights from the store window fell on his face and geraldine saw a glitter in his eyes she thought he meant to defy her  you are excused so far as i am concerned she replied uncompromisingly  mappin stood silent a moment or two looking at her hard and she felt half afraid of him  you would rather see allinson but thats a pleasure you may find deferred you didnt get much news of him just now  i dont doubt that you heard me ask for it though there were two teamsters waiting to buy things who had the good manners to keep away  certainly i heard he answered coolly thats the kind of man i am i dont let chances pass  geraldine knew that he would make unscrupulous use of those he seized but his candor had its effect on her he was overbearing but there was force in the man and she grew uneasy though she shrank from him she admitted his power unless she roused herself to fight he might break her will  one could hardly consider it an admirable type she said getting into the sleigh however its too cold to stand talking  mappin was obliged to step back when she started the team and she drove off in some confusion glad to escape but feeling that she had run away it had seemed the safest course though she did not think she was a coward then as the team trotted across the frozen lake she remembered mappins curious tone when he had spoken of andrew allinson he had suggested with an unpleasant hint of satisfaction that andrews return might be delayed and she grew troubled as she thought of it still she reasoned as no news had reached the landing mappin could know nothing about the matter and the men andrew had with him were accustomed to the bush dismissing the subject she urged the horses and drew the thick drivingrobe close about her it was very cold and she shivered as she wondered how andrew and his comrades were faring in the north  some days later she met mrs graham at the postoffice and inquired about her husband geraldine thought she looked anxious  hes a little behind time but soft snow or storms might delay the party  then he mentioned a time when you could expect him  yes said mrs graham he warned me that he might be a week late but they thought out the journey very carefully because it was a question of carrying enough food  you mean that helped to fix the time of their return  of course they couldnt get food anywhere except at a hudson bay factory and they couldnt take a large quantity that means they knew within a week or so when they must reach the provision caches that were to be made for them north of the mine  i understand said geraldine they wouldnt delay when they came to the caches except perhaps for a days rest i suppose the food was taken up  oh yes i saw the packers leave and come down they were good bushmen and one of them knew the country he made the caches at the places decided on  then the expedition should be quite safe said geraldine cheerfully but when she left mrs graham she grew thoughtful  andrew was late and geraldine saw that delay might be dangerous the men would lose no time in coming south because considering the difficulty of transport the margin of provisions would not be large nothing but a serious accident would detain them which was disconcerting to reflect upon then she reasoned that their provisions would be nearly exhausted when they reached the caches and her mind dwelt on the point because it was essential that they should obtain fresh supplies she felt uneasy as she remembered a remark of mappins which she did not think he had made casually there had been a significant grimness in his manner when he had spoken of allinson after all however it was possible that there was no ground for anxiety the prospectors might turn up in the next few days  as there was no news of them however geraldine drove to the settlement one evening and called on mrs graham she found her seriously disturbed  a man came down from the mine this morning and my husband hadnt arrived she said im afraid something has gone wrong  what can have gone wrong  i dont know ive been thinking about it all the last few days and trying not to be afraid of course they would be safe if they reached the food caches  yes said geraldine those caches are important but as nobody has turned up i dont think you need be alarmed the worst would be if one came back alone  mrs graham did not seem much comforted when geraldine left her and the girl driving home in the moonlight tried to face the situation calmly she admitted without reserve for the first time that she loved andrew allinson and he was in danger something must be done to extricate him and while she wondered how she ought to set about it her thoughts turned to mappin it dawned on her that he knew what peril threatened the party and this suggested that he had either allowed the men to involve themselves in unsuspected difficulties or had brought the difficulties about they had depended on him in some way and he had betrayed them geraldine shuddered at the thought but she roused herself for it was obvious that if her suspicions were correct the mans designs must be combated mappin was strong and cunning but she had ready wits and her lovers safety was at stake  the next evening mappin came to the house and geraldine carefully made some changes in her dress before she entered the drawingroom where he was talking with mrs denton he rose with a challenging smile as she came in and geraldine was glad to feel that she was looking her best it was humiliating to dress to please this man but there was a struggle before her and she must use such weapons as she had  youre surprised to see me he said  oh no i didnt doubt your boldness  mappin glanced at her sharply for there was nothing ungracious in her tone her manner hinted at a change of mood but he understood that women were variable  then i have your permission to remain  im not sure that you need it and it would be inhospitable to refuse it geraldine replied as if amused  mrs denton looked from one to the other in a puzzled way but she said nothing and mappin began to talk relating scraps of news picked up at the landing geraldine showed some interest and after a while mrs denton seeing them apparently on good terms judiciously left them then the girl ceased to respond to her companions remarks and mappin never a brilliant conversationalist found it hard to go on he began to show impatience and geraldine enjoyed his embarrassment at last he glanced toward the piano  i wish you would play or sing something he begged  geraldine rose goodhumoredly and opened the piano  i didnt know you cared for music  i dont as a rule  that sounds like a compliment she answered smiling its a pity i havent any jingling ragtime tunes  theyre what i likemy taste isnt classical but i dont mind your taking a shot at me one doesnt want music to make one serious  you think one should be serious only where money is concerned  well he said grimly i havent found trying to get it very amusing but i can be in earnest in other matters  so i suppose responded geraldine turning over the music heres something that might please you will you light the candles  her amiability had cost her an effort and it grew harder as she opened the song it was pointed with witty coquetry and she hesitated for a moment with a feeling of humiliation though she meant to play out her part andrew and his friends were in peril in the icy wilds somehow they were at the mercy of this cruel grossnatured man and hateful as her task was she must not shrink she thought he could be led on to betray himself tingling with shame she sang with all the fire and art she could command and mappin was swept off his feet  music had no great charm for him but the ballad was one he could appreciate and the girls beauty had a stronger effect the light of the shaded candles fell on her face which was slightly flushed and forced up gleams in her hair she looked inexpressibly alluring her fine voice and arch smile well brought out the halftender mockery of the song he noticed the supple shapeliness of her figure and the polished whiteness of her skin and his heart began to throb fast and his eyes to glisten turning over a leaf he came near shaking down the music and he drew back thrilled when she made a gesture of amused rebuke there was he felt something very friendly in it  when she stopped he leaned on the piano looking down at her and geraldine knew that she had gone far enough after having treated him with cold indifference she must not be too gracious lest his suspicions be aroused the man was in her hands but he was not a fool she hated him as she saw the crude desire in his face  thank you he said hoarsely and picked out another song at random wont you try this ive never heard it  no she answered firmly not that one  it was the ballad which andrew had told her helped to send him up into the wilds where his duty lay henceforward it was sacrednot to be sung to such a man as mappin  why he demanded  i sing that only to people who i know will appreciate it  and you dont think i would  it strikes me as very doubtful she said with a smile in which there was a touch of scorn  his color deepened she had shown signs of yielding and how he wondered whether she had after all been amusing herself with him stirred as he was by passion he was in no reasoning mood savage jealousy filled his heart  its the kind of thing you keep for sentimental fools like allinson he exclaimed  geraldine had expected some such outbreak indeed it was what she desired  well she said with a tenderness which was meant to disturb her companion i sang it to him once  it will be a long while before you sing it to him again  the voice rang harsh with exultant fierceness and geraldine knew that she had gained her object in rousing the brute in him she had learned the truthfor whatever danger threatened her lover this man was responsible but there was more she must know  as hes a friend of ours youre not very considerate she said what makes you speak with so much certainty  mappin saw that he had been rash and he was instantly on his guard  it was a fool thing to go north in winter its no country for a raw tenderfoot and allinson should have taken a stronger party i know something about transport work in the bush  i suppose food would be their greatest difficulty geraldine remarked with a thoughtful air  no fresh snow and blizzards would trouble them worse  still food would be a consideration geraldine persisted i know they thought a good deal about the matter and had some caches made if they couldnt find them coming back it would be serious wouldnt it  mappins jealousy was heightened by her interest but he regretted his haste and meant to be cautious unfortunately for him the charm geraldine had exercised had carried him away he could not think as clearly as usual  the provisions were carefully packed and sent up in charge of good men he declared hotly they were properly cached every precaution was taken  were they your men  mappin glanced at her sharply but read nothing in her face he could not evade the question without rousing suspicion  yes he said thats why i know they could be relied on to do their work  geraldine sat silent a moment struggling to preserve her calm she had found out what she wished to know she understood now why mappin had insisted on the dangers of the journey and made light of the question of food he had with scarcely conceivable cruelty cut off the partys supplies still he must not suspect that she knew this with an effort she took up another piece of music  we are anxious for news of the expedition and its comforting to remember that they had an excellent guide she said but ill play you something  before the piece was finished her father came in and she left him to entertain their guest seeking her room she sat down feeling suddenly limp from strain that she was humbled and ashamed did not matter she was filled on the one hand with hatred and loathing for the man she had led on and on the other with anxiety for andrew     chapter xx  the rescue party   when mappin left frobisher went to his smokingroom where he was surprised to find geraldine waiting for him  i think he said with mock severity it was mean of you to leave mr mappin on my hands particularly as i dont suppose his visit was made on my account  did he bore you very badly geraldine inquired  we have had guests here whom id rather entertain but for your aunts sake i try to be civil after all we have known the man for a long while  i feel that we have been very patient in putting up with him hes insufferable  ah said frobisher taking out a cigar then you didnt happen to be here by accident sit down and well have a talk  geraldine took the chair he indicated  i have something to tell you she said with an effort mappin asked me to marry him a little while ago  it strikes me as curious that this is the first ive heard of it  i was ashamed to tell you geraldine admitted shyly i felt degraded besides you must have guessed  yes i had some idea of the mans ambitions in my opinion hes too coldblooded to be influenced by any more tender sentiment well take it for granted that you refused him nowadays it seems to be a fathers business to sanction and not to interfere but i really think if you had wanted to marry the fellow id have been as firm as adamant however this is not to the purpose why do you tell me about it now  youll see presently but try to remember that he has other feelings than avarice the mans unscrupulous and full of savage cruelty  well  to begin with will you read this its from ethel hillyard whom i met in london you have heard me speak of her  she gave him a letter containing sufficient information about the house of allinson to explain why andrew had gone to canada his character and his relations with hathersage and the rest of the family were cleverly sketched frobisher studied it carefully before he looked up  all this is not exactly new to me though miss hillyard who seems to be a shrewd young lady speaks strongly in allinsons favor from odd things he let fall id formed a pretty good idea of the situation now that you have cleared the ground you had better go on  father said geraldine so far you have done nearly everything i asked you and that is why im not afraid to ask for something else i want you to send up a party to look for mr allinson he and the others are in danger of starving in the snow  frobisher looked at her searchingly and she met his gaze for a moment though a flush crept into her face  well he said simply he is a straight man  and a friend of yours but you will send him help at once  first of all tell me why you think it is needful  geraldine spent some time over the explanation and concluded  you must see that their safety depends on their finding the provisions and mappin has had the caches made at the wrong places  for the next few minutes frobisher sat silent the smoke curling up from his neglected cigar while geraldine watched him in suspense  you have reasoned the matter out remarkably well he said and it strikes me that youre near the truth however i dont understand how you led mappin into making the dangerous admissions that gave you a clue hes a brute but i thought him a cunning one perhaps id better not inquire  geraldines embarrassment was obvious and there were signs of amusement on her fathers face  after all he resumed when you play a game for high stakes with a man like mappin you cant be fastidious  but what about the relief party geraldine asked  i think the situation is serious enough to need one ill drive over to the landing and see about it the first thing tomorrow  he got up and as he reached the door geraldine following put her arms about his neck and kissed him then she went past swiftly and vanished down the passage  the next morning frobisher learned that mappin had gone east by an early train and that there was not a man capable of undertaking a difficult journey into the wilds disengaged mappin had hired all the available choppers and packers and sent them into the bush to cut some lumber he required for his railroad contract frobisher could not determine whether this had been done with the object of preventing their being employed on a relief expedition but it looked suspicious being in a difficulty he called on the owner of the sawmill and told him as much as he thought advisable  as it happens i can help you said the lumberman there are two or three fellows on our pay roll whom we havent much work for at present though well need them later theyre good bushmen and i might raise one or two more by sending up to our logging camp  thanks said frobisher it will be a favor its lucky i thought of coming to you  never mind that i feel that i ought to help graham out hes an old and valued servant but i dont see how you are interested in the thing  frobisher smiled  its ones duty to help a fellow creature whos in serious danger then i believe i may call myself a friend of allinsons  theres a point to be considered the most likely place to meet the party would be in the neighborhood of the food caches you intimate that theres a risk of allinsons missing them but he must have a rough idea as to about where they are as mappins out of town wouldnt it be well to wire and ask him exactly where they were to be made  on the whole id rather get the information from mrs graham no doubt she knows her husbands plans  the millowner gave him a searching glance he was a shrewd man and suspected that there was a good reason for his visitors preference  yes he said pointedly that might be wiser  there may have been some misunderstanding about the precise location of the caches frobisher explained mrs graham will know where her husband meant them to be madewhich of course is the most important thing  just so agreed the other excuse me for a few minutes  he went out and returning a little later announced that three men would be ready to start upriver during the afternoon and that some more from the logging camp would follow in a few days frobisher left him and after calling on mrs graham went to the store where he ordered a quantity of provisions to be prepared it was evening when he reached home finding geraldine waiting for him he smiled at her as he took off his furs  ive had a busy day but ive got things satisfactorily fixed he said  you have found men to take up provisions geraldine asked eagerly  better than that replied frobisher ive sent them off  seeing the pleasure in his daughters face he nodded reassuringly and left her  the relief expedition had orders to lose no time two of the men as it happened had themselves narrowly escaped starvation in the wilds and their experience led them to urge the pace it was afterward admitted that they made an excellent march which was fortunate because a few hours meant much to the starving men  as andrew crouched at the side of the rock halfdazed with fatigue and want of food it was a moment or two before he could believe that he was not the victim of a disordered imagination as he stared at the three figures on the hillslope but the figures moved and grew more distinct he could not doubt that they were men and they were coming up the hill with his heart beating painfully fast he staggered up and raised a wild hoarse cry  it was answered one of the men waved to him they came on faster though he could see that they were heavily loaded stumbling now and then in their haste he could not imagine what had brought them into the wilds but they were obviously well supplied and he could purchase their provisions and recompense them for an abandoned journey when they were close to him the leader stopped a moment and called back to the others  weve struck it right its mr allinson  andrew recognizing the man whom he had seen at the landing stumbled forward and shook hands with him  im uncommonly glad to see you but what brought you here he cried  wheres the rest of you the other asked  carnallys down the hill somewhere grahams in camp beyond the gap  the man looked relieved  thats good we felt scared when we saw you were alone thought we might have come too late though we hurried some  then you knew we were here  sure frobisher sent us up with provisions for you we made a few caches as we came along and there ought to be three more of the boys on the trail behind us you dont want to worry well see you down  andrew felt shaky relief had come so unexpectedly his troubles were over but there was more than this frobisher had despatched the men he might have done so at his daughters request at least it showed a very friendly feeling andrew began to wonder how frobisher could have known he needed help but this was a matter of much less importance and he turned to the packers  if one of you would go down the next spur and look for carnally id be glad he said i expect hes near the river and hes pretty hungry  a man threw off his load and set off rapidly downhill while andrew climbed with the others toward the neck scarcely able to keep on his feet his companions slackened their pace and glanced at him compassionately crossing the gap they saw the light of grahams fire in the gathering dusk and when they neared the belt of timber andrew waved his hand to a dark figure that appeared in an opening among the trunks  no more trouble he cried help has arrived  a few minutes later graham shook hands with the newcomers whom he knew  boys he said hoarsely now that i see who you are i know you made good time and you hadnt much to spare when did you leave  one of them told him and he and andrew looked astonished while the packer laughed  we certainly hustled he said with a deprecatory air but ive been four years at the mill and never had trouble over charging my time your paysheet was square  thats so agreed his companion they might have laid me off a while last summer when we ran out of logs but mr graham fixed it so i kept my job  andrew smiled at graham who looked confused  if you do these things you must take the consequences but ive met people with shorter memories  anyhow weve got here ahead of the logging crowd and im mighty glad said the first packer those fellows think nobody can break a trail unless he lives in the woods now you sit by quiet while we get supper  before the meal was ready carnally arrived with the man who had gone to look for him and the party feasted royally when they had finished carnally sighed with deep content  i just dont want to move he remarked i feel most too good to talk but if the rest of you have anything to say ill try to listen  whats your program one of the men asked we have food enough to take us down going easy  i want two days rest said andrew until theyre up well do nothing but eat and lie about the fire and smoke  carnally looked up lazily  that sounds nice but im going to locate mappins cache before we start  the others began to talk to graham but andrew did not know how long they continued for he was soon fast asleep  they broke camp on the third morning and when they crossed the neck carnally divided the party which had been joined by the loggers some he told to follow down one or two ravines at a distance which he had not searched and then meet the others who would work along the ridge toward evening a man hailed him and andrew from a slope some way off and when they joined him he led them into a deep hollow in the middle of it a small barked fir projected from a snowy mound  its the kind of place youd break a trail up if you were trying to make the neck the packer explained  it looks a good road from here carnally assented we didnt get so far along but well climb up a piece  the hollow died out into a snow slope and when they had walked on farther they lost sight of it then carnally stopped and carefully looked about  we might have struck that gulch first shot but the chances were against it you can only see it from below you want to remember that the line the fellows who made the cache would take would depend on where they left the big loop of the lower river mappin was smart enough to see that now well have a look at the provisions  they proved to be sufficient in quantity and in excellent order when the cache was opened but carnally had expected that  i wonder how mappin will feel when he sees us come marching in andrew said lightly they could laugh now  not very comfortable ill promise you carnally declared with a glint in his eyes     chapter xxi  a bushmans satisfaction   andrew reached the landing physically exhausted and troubled by a heavy depression the longcontinued strain had left its mark on him for having proposed the expedition he felt responsible for the safety of his friends and his strength and endurance deserted him shortly after the arrival of the rescue party relief had been followed by a severe reaction which left him limp and nerveless and the homeward march proved long and toilsome as they had food there was no longer the same necessity for haste but the rigor of the weather forced the men to push on as fast as possible and andrew found it difficult to emulate his rescuers pace moreover he was seriously troubled about graham whose foot appeared to be getting worse and he was deeply disappointed with the result of his search he had found the lode but so far as he had been able to test it the ore did not promise much  dusk was falling when they saw the lights of the settlement and as they passed the first house a man greeted them after a word or two he ran on ahead and the party following slowly worn with the march found most of the inhabitants gathering in the street eager helpers took their packs from them and seized the traces of the sled questions and congratulations were showered on them and to andrews annoyance they entered the town in a triumphal procession he was plodding along too tired and listless to notice the remarks of the curious and sympathetic crowd when carnally touched his arm  you can go straight to the hotel he said ill take graham home  no said andrew firmly thats my business and it cant be shirked you might send the doctor  carnally disappeared among the crowd and andrew went on shrinking from the meeting with his comrades wife though when the time came he found it less trying than he had feared as they turned into a side street there was a shout  make room let her pass its mrs graham  the men in the traces stopped and graham spoke to them  you might help me up boys  they got him on his feet and fell back as a woman hurried toward him she flung her arms about his neck and it was several moments before she saw andrew  we have brought him back but im afraid hes a little the worse for wear he said  you have brought him back she cried that is the greatest thing  graham walked along with her for a few yards and then stopped his face contorted  if you dont mind ill finish the journey on the sled my foots rather sore  when they reached his house he insisted on getting up and after telling andrew to follow limped in unhelped but he sat down heavily on a couch  i suppose this moccasin had better come off now though its going to give me trouble he said with a rueful smile  no advised andrew not until the doctor comes he should be here directly id like to see him mrs graham but youll want to talk to your husband may i wait in the other room  she let him go and he spent an anxious halfhour he heard the doctor arrive and mrs graham hurry about the housegetting water and bandages he thought then there was silence for a while until the doctor entered the room where he was sitting  his foots in a very bad state he reported theres some risk of mortification though i think it can be averted ill be able to tell you more in a day or two  do you know of any surgeon in winnipeg or toronto you would like to bring out  theres a good man in winnipeg which is much nearer on the whole it might be advisable to get his opinion  then wire for him said andrew and send for a trained nurse if one can be had  the doctor left and andrew rose as mrs graham came in  im afraid youll find it hard to forgive me he said  mrs graham looked troubled  i must try to be fair you are really not to blame even if he hadnt met you he would have gone to look for the lode some day then im confident you took every care of him but after all  i know andrew sympathized he was well and strong when i took him away and i have brought him back disabled that cant be got over he paused and resumed in a diffident tone i feel responsible there are things i cant put rightyour distress the pain your husband suffers his regret at being laid up helpless while his foot gets betterbut i must insist on making what amends are in my power i think you understand  yes mrs graham gave him a grateful glance but well talk of that later then she smiled he sent you a messageyou are to mail the specimens to an assayer the first thing  ill do so andrew promised turning toward the door ill come back and see how hes getting on early tomorrow  on reaching the hotel he sought carnally  jake he said you might fix things with the packers give them any bonus you think fit over regulation wages then because we owe them more than we can pay in money you had better get up a supper and dance they could bring their wives to  its a good idea theyll like that ill see about it tomorrow i need a rest tonight and theres a job i want to be fit for in the morning  andrew was too weary to ask him what it was and after sending a message to frobisher and getting supper he went off to bed rising late the next day he went to grahams and then took a sleigh drive and by doing so missed a scene which caused some sensation in the town  about the middle of the morning mappin was sitting in his office which was situated above a store opposite the secondclass hotel the hotel was full for some loggers had come in the previous night and a number of railroad carpenters whose work had been interfered with by a snowstorm were staying there mappin had heard of andrews return and he was in a thoughtful mood though he had so far avoided meeting with any of the party he could not however continue to do so and he felt that he might as well get the interview with allinson over as soon as possible even if allinson suspected treachery he had no proof and the worst charge he could make would be one of carelessness on the whole it had been a relief to see that the man had escaped he had acted in the heat of passion when he cut off his supplies and had afterward experienced a twinge of remorse mappin felt that he was a match for the fellow and he had gone a needless length in plotting to destroy him  he was thinking over the matter when he heard some one ask for him in the store through which it was necessary to pass to reach his office then there were footsteps on the stairs and he looked up in surprise as carnally came in it was allinson he had expected to see  carnally was smartly dressed and though his face was thin and worn it wore a look of satisfaction that puzzled mappin  wheres your boss this morning mappin inquired ive been waiting for him  at grahams said carnally sitting down ive come instead mr allinsons got into a habit of leaving matters to me there are things i do better than he can im not so fastidious as he is  then let me know what you want  its about those provisions you sent up mr allinson told you where to make the caches  yes i carefully put it down  got the paper or the notebook  i cant say where the notebook is but i believe i could find it  carnally smiled as if he were enjoying the situation  if you produce the book it will be because it doesnt agree with what mr allinson says he told you but that wouldnt prove much youre capable of writing down what you meant to do and not what he said if youre not able to find it the reason is that you thought of the trick you played us after you saw him  then you didnt find the provisions i sent as easily as you expected  no you know we didnt  mappin had plenty of courage  well what about it he asked with a little smile of scorn  i know the hand youre playing from its a pretty good one mr allinson believes he gave you orders to make the caches in certain places you contend he told you somewhere else and there was nobody about when you were talking to decide the thing somehow an unfortunate mistake was made  it looks like that said mappin feeling uneasy at the mans ready acquiescence in the situation  sure thing carnally cheerfully assented you fixed it all so neatly that you left only one way of getting after you but i wont grumble because its the one i like he rose and his expression changed the mistake you meant to make came mighty near starving three men to death stand up and answer for it you blasted hog  so thats your line  mappin did not move as he rapidly considered his course overbearing as he was he did not often give way to anger unless his passions were strongly roused a brawl with carnally could lead to no useful result and it would attract undesirable attention  you have hit it first time got feet havent you you seem to want some stirring up carnally reached for an inkwell and flung it across the office at mappins head sorry i missed he said but ive spoiled your clothes  mappin rose with a savage frown  do you mean to go on with this fooling  sure replied carnally if i cant wake you any other way ill fire your office fixings out of the window guess that will bring the boys around and ill be glad to tell them what the troubles about  a heavy accountbook deftly thrown swept mappins desk scattering pens and papers across the room seeing that a struggle was unavoidable he sprang forward caution had hitherto held him back but his patience had its limits and he was the heavier man he missed carnally with his first two blows but the third took effect with sledgehammer force flinging him back upon the officetable and during the next few minutes carnally gasped and dodged he saw that he must try to wear out his antagonist and he watched his chance before he clinched for a while they grappled in the middle of the floor swaying breaking ground with heavy feet striking when they could and then as mappin freed himself the door was flung open and the storekeeper and several of his customers ran in  hold on he cried whats the trouble i thought you were coming through my ceiling  carnally looked around flushed and breathless  stand back this business has to be got through with its pretty well known that the fellows smart at stealing his boys time but he took on too big a contract when he played a lowdown trick on me he turned to mappin are you ready you fat swine or must i fire you down the stairs  leave them to it advised a big logger with an appreciative grin ill put a dollar on the bushman  youre wrecking the place objected the storekeeper indicating the dislodged stove from which thick smoke was pouring and a broken chair  that doesnt matter carnally replied mappin can meet the bill he seems a bit slow in moving theyve been too liberal with the corn  one or two of the men laughed but mappin looked dangerous the struggle that occupied the next few minutes was a determined and strenuous one and the spectators watched it with frank delight mappin was powerful and could use his strength but he had lived indulgently a prey to his appetites carnally lived for the most part in the wilds and hard toil and plain fare had toughened him moreover as a matter of necessity he frequently taxed his endurance to the limit and this stood him in good stead now he was quicker than his enemy and recovered sooner when they broke away from a grapple he was the fresher  mappin began to show distress he panted hard his face grew suffused the perspiration dripped from him his collar had burst open and his torn sleeve hung loose about his arm he looked strangely brutish and his eyes had a murderous expression by comparison carnally seemed cool his thin brown face was quietly intent resolute without passion he fought cautiously avoiding his antagonists furious rushes breaking away from an occasional grapple endurance was his strongest point and he meant to tire his man mappin guessing this saw the advisability of bringing the struggle to a speedy conclusion he clinched again trying to throw his agile opponent by sheer force and for a moment or two carnally seemed helpless in his grasp he could not get free and mappin drove him backward across the narrow floor while the spectators who had increased in number looked on in tense excitement  in the west personal combat is hampered by few of the rules of the boxing ring but there is a rough notion of fair play and there are limits which may not be exceeded thus when carnally driven hard against the edge of the table seemed to grow limp there was a shout of protest as mappin reaching out with free right arm seized a heavy poker from the woodbox he was ready to strike when carnally realizing his peril rallied his strength for a decisive effort the poker struck the table with a resounding crash carnally secured a firm hold before mappin recovered his shaken balance and lifted him from his feet he lurched forward while the spectators scattered and reeling through the doorway plunged down the stairs  mappin was undermost he struck the steps halfway down but it did not stop them they rolled into the store amid a confused outcry none of those who watched could tell whether mappin scrambled up or carnally lifted him from the floor but in a moment they were on their feet carnally driving the other toward the door with a last effort he hurled him backward and mappin went down headlong into the snow  he got up in a halfdazed manner and carnally leaned against the doorpost breathing hard and regarding him with a grim smile  you can do what you like about it but if youre wise youll keep out of my sight he said it wont hurt me to let people know what made the trouble  carnally turned back into the store and sat down on a barrel hot disheveled and generally the worse for wear  its a long while since i felt so good boys he grinned  mappin slunk away to his hotel knowing that a grave misfortune had befallen him he was a hard master and accustomed to get more than the full equivalent of their wages out of his men but in this his overbearing manner had assisted his cunning in logging camps and on new roads courage and muscular strength command respect but now that he had been ignominiously thrown out of the store before a derisive crowd his prestige had gone henceforward there would be serious risk of his mutinous subordinates following carnallys example  the man however was far from a coward it would be pleasanter to leave the town where he was not held in much esteem until the matter blew over and he had work going on in other places but he did not mean to run away from allinson the latter of course now understood that he had been tricked over the location of the food caches and mappin wondered what he would do it was however obvious that there was no really effective course open to allinson carnally had been shrewd enough to take the only possible means of obtaining redress but his primitive methods were not likely to be adopted by his employer  after removing the signs of battle so far as he could from his clothes and person mappin returned to his office and spent the day there waiting for a visit from his rival allinson however did not come it looked as though he meant to do nothing and this caused mappin some uneasiness the man was cleverer and perhaps more to be feared than he had thought     chapter xxii  fresh plans   geraldine frobisher sitting by the hearth in her drawingroom glanced compassionately at andrew he looked gaunt and very weary and she noticed a significant slackness in his pose there was no one else in the room the lamps were lighted and a log fire diffused a pleasant glow and an aromatic odor  you are quiet tonight she said  andrew looked up with a deprecatory smile  i fear im disgracefully dull but i dont seem able to think of anything except that its very pleasant to be here again  you consider that a good excuse  i cant judge i felt that i needed one in fact i dont know what is the matter with me since i came downriver  geraldine had some idea a glance at the man supplied an explanation  you are worn out for one thing she answered sympathetically  he mused for a few moments and the girl was not displeased from the first she had felt on curiously confidential terms with him he was direct and sincere and though by no means shallow he seldom puzzled her  no he said its not altogether that we had a rather bad time before the relief party arrived but i felt up to my workanxious of course but not troubled by the slackness that has since got hold of me all this however isnt of much consequence im very grateful to you and your father for sending helpwe were in a very tight place when it came but i dont understand how you knew we needed it  geraldine looked down to hide her confusion  i wonder why you associate me with my father  i cant tell you clearly but i feel that you had something to do with the matter indeed it made the relief more welcome but you havent given me an explanation  do you understand why you failed to find the food  yes said andrew grimly ive a suspicion that you know as much about it as i do though its hard to see how you came by the knowledge  geraldine looked up with a forced smile he must not guess how she had led mappin to betray himself  it is rather astonishing isnt it the search gave you trouble and you have some respect for your thinking powers  ive more respect for carnallys he found the clue but he was on the spot  and i was handicapped by being at home do you know i sometimes think im not altogether stupid  youre exceptionally clever said andrew warmly you have a gift for seizing on the truth and sticking to it i think its because the truth is in you that you recognize it thats different from smartness  she checked him with a gesture of mocking rebuke  you should have learned that i dont expect you to pay me labored compliments  it wasnt labored i believe it was a flash of insight andrew declared he glanced at her face and laughed looking baffled  there was silence for the next few moments geraldine knew what the man thought of her but she approved of the respectful diffidence he generally displayed now that he was safe she preferred that they remain on a purely friendly footing for a time he was hers but she shrank with a fluttering timidity from an open surrender it was not difficult to repulse him gently when he grew too bold nevertheless his wan and downcast appearance roused a deep and tender pity she longed to hear his troubles and comfort him  you suddenly changed the subject we began she said were you not going to tell me why you feel depressed  something of the kind replied andrew it didnt seem a very happy topic  that was a mistake declared geraldine reproachfully you shouldnt have doubted my interest and it lightens ones troubles to confide in a friend  andrew in his dejected mood felt a longing for sympathy and encouragement  well he said failure is hard to bear and ive a strong suspicion that ive undertaken more than im able to carry out so far ive made a deplorable mess of things we reached the neighborhood of the lode with no time to search the ground and for all the results we got we might as well have stayed at home  but its something to have proved that the lode exists  im not sure its worth proving the value of the ore is the most important point because a mine could not be worked up there unless it was very rich then theres a risk of grahams being lamed for life mappin has beaten us badly at the beginning of the fight  its only a small reverse you would not use the means he employed they were infamous  the trouble is that other opponents i shall have to meet may use similar methods and unless i do the same ill be further handicapped as it happens im carrying weight enough already  geraldine looked thoughtful  in a way youre right ive learned something about the situation  if we had proved the lode to be rich i should have had something to fall back on but ive failed now i must attack strong vested interests with the whole influence of my conservative relatives against me my chief antagonist enjoys a high prestige and has made an excellent profit on the money handed him andrew laughed in a rueful manner and im the fool of the family who has lately taken to upsetting a very satisfactory state of affairs can you imagine the surprise and disgust of everybody concerned  but your people are upright arent they  oh yes theres no doubt of that but with one or two unimportant exceptions theyre conventional and prejudiced they believe in what they see the prosperity of allinsons the dividends coming in they distrust anything that seems out of the usual course and they couldnt bring themselves to think there should be anything wrong with the firm i whom they goodnaturedly look down on have to convince them to the contrary  it will be hard one can understand that but the feeling of helplessness that troubles you now will pass you must remember that you have borne enough to exhaust you  my bodys tired andrew admitted one can get over that the real difficulty is that my mind feels sick  is there no connection between the two geraldine smiled at him you make me think its the first time you have had any serious difficulties  thats true it looks as if there were some benefit in being dull youre saved a good deal of trouble if you dont notice things  i didnt mean that geraldine objected youre not really dull you know  then im something like it but you dont think ive been foolish in starting on this campaign  no said geraldine promptly i think you are doing what is fine you must go on i want you to win the difficulties wont look so serious if you attack them one by one and it must be worth something to have the right on your side there is so much injustice everywhere and few people seem to mind no doubt its dangerous to interfere but its encouraging to find a man here and there who is not afraid  she looked up at a sound and saw her father standing in the doorway  one here and there smiled frobisher youre not exacting in france they once asked for a hundred men who knew how to die and found them in one southern town  geraldines color was higher than usual but she laughed  i suppose i am a bit of a sentimentalist but youre too cynical i dont see why you should be proud of your detached and critical attitude you look on as if the sight of people struggling amused you  i dont think i really am proud of it but perhaps theres something to be said for the intelligent spectator who knows his limitations and is content with trying to see fair play however i came to take allinson away for a smoke if i leave him to you youll be sending him off on some new chivalrous adventure  seeing that his host was waiting for him andrew rose but as he reached the door geraldine looked at him with a smile  what i said was rather crude but i meant it  she generally does mean things its a habit that has its drawbacks frobisher said as he led andrew to his smokingroom where he gave him a cigar and pointed to an easychair  what are you going to do about mappin the american asked bluntly  nothing as he has only to deny what i told him to clear himself theres no means of punishing him i cant see any use in making a fuss that can have no result it would simply show i was the weaker party  youre wise frobisher agreed then his eyes twinkled carnally however seems to have seen a way out of the difficulty you havent heard what happened at the settlement  no i hired a sleigh and went for a drive after that i slept until i came here i tried to keep out of peoples way  you missed a dramatic scene at the store im told carnally threw mappin downstairs and out into the snow  andrew shook his head dubiously  its a pity but i might have been prepared for something of the kind i can hardly grudge him any satisfaction he derived from it  it was a good stroke mappin will find it damaging  but i understood he was a friend of yours andrew said with some awkwardness  he came to my house i put up with him which i think describes it best though i fail to see much reason for doing so any longer but what are you going to do about the lode  go back and investigate it thoroughly well wait until the spring  then you mean to proceed with your scheme i see trouble but i mustnt discourage you now i guess the situation warrants some candor has it struck you that mappin is working hand in hand with your brotherinlaw  im afraid its true andrews face was grave you can see how it complicates things  but you mean to go on  i must said andrew simply  frobisher leaned forward and touched his arm  you have grit allinson it will be a tough fight but i feel that youll make good  he changed the subject abruptly and they talked of other matters until they went back to the drawingroom some time afterward there was a knock at the door and geraldine opening it held out a telegram to andrew  its from the assayer i left word at the settlement for the message to be sent on he explained you will excuse my opening it  of course said geraldine may it bring you good news  andrew tore open the envelope and there was an exultant tone in his voice as he read out  specimens unpromising  frobisher and geraldine looked puzzled  but you seem satisfied the girl said  i am i asked the man to let me have his general opinion as soon as he could hes to send a regular analysis later he has been quick but perhaps he has some rough preliminary test  but he tells you theyre unpromising  im beginning to think mr allinson is a bit of a genius frobisher observed no doubt hell explain his mysterious proceedings  i gave the man a threeword code reversing the meaning and his answer puts the quality of the ore so to speak in the comparative degree it shows that we have struck the edge of the lode and careful prospecting should give us better results  he broke off standing still the message in his hand and a look of marked relief in his face and frobisher turned to his daughter  it was a maxim of napoleons that one should use every means of misleading the enemy and mr allinson seems to know that telegrams are handled rather casually in these small places a mineral claim doesnt belong to its discoverer until its duly staked off and recorded and if all the formalities are not complied with it can be jumped  he was called away a few minutes later and andrew took his place by the hearth with geraldine sitting opposite him  im very glad you got such good news she said with a curious softness in her voice  thank you it was you who brought it to me but that wasnt all you did i came here dejected and now im cheerful again  but that isnt surprising after the message  it wasnt the message i was bracing up before it came you and your father made me feel that i neednt despair in fact i was getting ashamed of being downcast after the confidence you seemed to have in me  geraldine smiled at him  ah she said it must need a good deal of courage to lead a forlorn hope and one could imagine that your undertaking looked like that it must be much pleasanter to feel that you have some chance of winning but what will you do next  go home i think i want to see how i stand there  for long geraldine asked quietly  no for a month or so i shall be eager to get back andrew paused and asked with a hint of tension in his voice will i be missed  of course geraldine looked up with friendly candor but will you be able to make the double journey and do all thats needful in a few weeks  andrew felt gently rebuffed geraldine had a way of checking him when he tried to draw closer to her and her unembarrassed frankness was deterring  ill try he said doggedly  frobisher came in then and they chatted about various matters until andrew took his leave when he reached his hotel he wrote a letter home announcing his return and the next morning he had a long talk with carnally whom he empowered to act as his deputy while he was in england then he went to grahams and found the winnipeg surgeon leaving his report was favorable grahams foot could be saved though it would be some time before he recovered the use of it  andrew was shown into a room where his comrade lay on a couch  ive heard the news and im very glad he said i was troubled about you  you couldnt hide it graham smiled at him it wasnt your fault i got frostbitten anyway but have you heard about the specimens  yes the first reports encouraging of course i havent learned the full results yet  grahams eyes glistened and he moved into a comfortable pose with a look of deep content  thats good now i must try to get about again as soon as possible  theres no hurry as you know you neednt go back to the mill until youre able then as carnally and i know where the lode is it isnt strictly necessary that you should come with us  isnt it ive been thinking about that lode for twenty years and do you suppose i could let another man locate it besides we must stake three claims on the best frontage  that would be better but what about mrs graham havent you given her enough anxiety  graham looked disturbed  i cant predict what line shell take but i venture to believe shell let me go knowing ill be satisfied for good when i have finished my work  andrew told him about his trip home and the arrangements he had made with carnally and left soon afterward during the next week he came in daily and spent two evenings with the frobishers and then he left the landing early one morning by the montreal express  the atlantic passage was short and uneventful and late one afternoon he alighted from a local train at a wayside station among the english hills wannop and hilda were waiting on the platform and after the first greetings were over the girl regarded her brother critically  andrew she exclaimed you havent come back the same how did you get those lines on your forehead  are there some andrew asked with a smile i suppose i was anxious now and then not knowing whether youll get enough to eat makes one think  hilda shook her head  no thats not it my dear boy you have been developing since you went to canada  if youre right laughed andrew it was getting time i did but youre standing in the way of the baggage truck  they moved on and when they drove off in wannops trap andrew sat silent for a while looking about delightedly it was open weather by comparison with the canadian cold the air was soft and mild a gray sky hung above the hills but there was a glimmer of pale red and saffron low in the west and the rugged slopes clothed with withered fern shone a rich warm brown then they dipped into a valley which struck andrew accustomed to the monotonous snowglare as wonderfully green the shining riband of a river wound through its midst clover growing among the stubble and broad strips of rawred soil where sheep netted in stood about the turnipcutters checkered the pasture land they passed climbing woods where the leafless branches formed blurs of blue and gray and here and there a white thread of foaming water streaked the heights above  it was a countryside that andrew loved but now while softly beautiful it looked strangely smalla narrow green strip shut in by lofty moors then there were many tall hedgerows and big stone walls one could not wander there at will the wide horizons and the limitless stretch of trackless woods were missing it was curious andrew thought with what content he had once searched stubble and turnips for partridges and stood with gun ready outside the woods from which the pheasants broke on clattering wings now all that seemed tame he had lost his zest for it in a sterner chase  hilda broke in upon his reflections  you havent spared me much attention yet she said how do you think im looking  now that i think of it youre growing rather pretty though that is what i expected  im aware of it hilda made him the best curtsey that space allowed but dont you notice that im looking more mature and intellectual  steady wannop cautioned you nearly knocked the whip out of my hand keep that kind of thing for the ballroomits wasted on your brother  the maturity didnt strike me but you used to show signs of intelligence now and then andrew answered  perhaps its better to be pretty cleverness is open to any one who is willing to study but did you see any girl as nicelooking as i am while you were in canada  even at the risk of giving offense i can think of onethough of course beauty is largely a matter of taste  ah exclaimed hilda delightedly i had my suspicions i suppose you mean the girl who wrote to ethel about you  andrew started and wannop laughed  i knew she was up to something that is what she has been leading you on to  how did you hear about her andrew asked did ethel tell you  as a matter of fact she wasnt very communicative but i elicited a few scraps of information its surprising how one can follow up a clue  i suppose so said andrew whether it leads you right or not is another matter im thankful i havent your fervid imagination  how he puts it off hilda said to wannop hes been learning diplomacy in canada  wannop chuckled  i always knew he wasnt a fool but i wish you would keep still the horse is fresh and this is a steep bit of road  hilda changed the subject for she had learned enough from her brothers start to give her food for thought  leonard will be down tomorrow with florence wannop said when they approached the house i suppose youll have something to tell us i neednt remind you that if theres any difficulty you can count on me  andrew gave him a grateful nod and a few minutes later they drove up to ghyllside     chapter xxiii  unexpected support   the day after andrews return he was sitting in the library at ghyllside waiting for dinner though a fire burned on the hearth by which he lounged cigarette in hand two of the tall windows were open and the air that flowed in was soft and muggy he had spent most of the day in shooting and after a long walk across wet meadows and a boggy moor he now felt very comfortable and somewhat drowsy he would have to bestir himself when the guests he expected arrived and he was enjoying a few minutes rest his cigarette was however only half smoked when wannop walked in  as i didnt see you downstairs i came up to look for you gertrudes with hilda havent florence and leonard arrived yet  train seems to be late andrew replied i suppose i should have gone to meet them but i felt lazy  was that all  it wasnt my only reason to tell the truth i shirked the drive home with leonard im a poor dissembler and our relations are rather strained it will be easier to meet him when there are others about  theyll be on his side  i expect so but im not afraid of direct opposition its beating about a delicate subject and trying to keep on safe ground that bothers me  i know its embarrassing you wont be able to broach matters of any importance tonight  no well have one or two outside people here and i want my homecoming to be harmonious well let things stand over till tomorrow  feeling nervous about it wannop suggested with a grin  ill confess that i do its the preliminary tussle and i havent many backers  you neednt be downhearted i dont know that your people are remarkably broadminded but theyre straightill say that even for robert theyll come round if they think youre right but dont be apologetic take a firm tone manner goes a long way and after all you are the head of allinsons  the trouble is that ive allowed leonard to usurp my place and hell be hard to depose  andrew rose for there were voices and footsteps below and they went down to meet the arriving guests the hall was large and square with seats in recesses and one or two small tables and comfortable chairs scattered about mrs fenwood had come with robert allinson who shook hands with andrew heartily though there was a hint of constraint in his manner afterward he was not quite satisfied with andrews conduct before leaving england and could not forget that his interference in the matter of mrs olcotts house had been thwarted he regarded wannop who was saying something humorous to mrs fenwood with a suspicious eye  then there was a rattle of wheels outside and florence hathersage came in with leonard he expressed his pleasure at andrews safe return and after a few friendly words hurried off to his room when he came down again three more guests arrived and andrew went eagerly to meet them ethel hillyard and mrs olcott were foremost and after welcoming them andrew turned toward a man with a lined brown face bearing the stamp of the soldier it was with marked cordiality that they shook hands  its good to see you tom andrew said i heard you had just got home and though its an unhealthy country youre looking very fit  a little fever now and then though i escaped fairly well rejoined the other with a friendly smile i have a good deal to say to you when we get a chance he lowered his voice as he added im deeply grateful  the meeting had a dramatic interest to the onlookers every eye had been fixed on the stranger as he had come with mrs olcott his identity was obvious and the goodwill both men had shown had its significance then andrew led the olcotts forward and presented them to the elderly unmarried relative who managed his household and looked after hilda mrs olcotts color was slightly heightened though she smiled for she understood the interest she had aroused and this was her triumph she had produced the husband whose absence had excited comment and whose existence some had ventured to doubt moreover he was a man to be proud of and nobody who had witnessed their meeting could doubt that he was andrews trusted friend robert allinson looked at him earnestly and then turned to leonard with a frown he was narrow and censorious but he was just and he felt that he had been mistaken or perhaps misled  they went in to dinner and andrew sat at the head of his table saying enough to keep conversation going but content to give leonard the lead considering how he stood toward his host hathersage showed admirable tact he skilfully turned every topic which might prove difficult and kept the others on safe ground he was witty in a polished manner but if anything a little too obviously at ease for the first time it struck one or two of the party with surprise that there was something in andrews bearing which his more brilliant brotherinlaw lacked the soldier from tropical africa bore the same elusive stamp of command sincerity and steadfastness ethel hillyard studying them carefully decided that leonard was by comparison cheap and superficial  still it was largely due to his efforts that dinner was a pleasant function without an awkward pause in it and afterward the guests dispersed through several rooms to amuse themselves when andrew found a place by ethel hillyard in a recess in the hall she surveyed him with smiling scrutiny  i think you did well in going to canada she said though i cant quite express what i mean you look bigger  as a matter of fact im a good deal lighter  ethel laughed  oh well i dont want to make you embarrassed i believe you had a trying time looking after the silver mine didnt prove as easy as you expected  i dont remember what i expected but i found it very difficult  so i gathered antony wannop seems to think the reforms you have in view wont be popular i suppose you have been summoned home to explain  no said andrew i came theres a difference  its marked ethel answered but we are old friends andrew follow your own bent stick to your guns whatever plans you have determined on will be fair once before i told you not to be daunted but it strikes me that you need less encouragement now  thank you said andrew im sorry i cant tell you much about the matter you see  its a family affair and after all i have my ideas but you made some new friends by the lake of shadows didnt you  yes staunch ones they showed their friendship in a very practical way thats something i owe to you i suspect that you have been prejudicing them in my favor  then you have a good opinion of geraldine  andrew colored as he met her inquiring glance  yes he said simply the highest im capable of forming  ethel smiled rather curiously two or three years earlier she had contemplated the possibility of andrews seeking her for his wife but her feelings had not been deeply stirred and when she saw that she had taken too much for granted she quietly submitted and retained a very friendly interest in him now however there was something grimly amusing in the thought that she had given him to geraldine  well she said im sure she merits it but to speak of something else im glad you asked the olcotts here  thats another matter in which im indebted to you what do you think of olcott he sat next to you  a delightful man ethel who was direct and fearless looked up at her companion no one could doubt mrs olcotts devotion to him and i think its warranted then she rose you must have a good deal to say to the others and i mustnt monopolize you  andrew went to the smokingroom which proved to be unoccupied but as he was leaving it olcott came in  i stole away and followed you he said sit down a minute and light up  cigars in that drawer said andrew lighting a cigarette drinks in the cupboard below  olcott took out two glasses and filled them  its your house but i feel at home  so you ought  olcott raised his glass  heres to you old friend and may you get with full measure as you give i cant wish you anything better he put down his glass and continued and now well proceed to business as soon as id had a talk with clare i paid a check into your bank  sure its convenient  quite i had my duties increased and what was much less usual a corresponding increase of pay id rather have come over when you were alone and i only got home yesterday but clare insisted on my appearing tonight can you guess the reason  yes andrew flushed but looked at his friend with steady eyes i got very savage about the matter and wondered whether id been in any way to blame still you left things pretty mixed when you went awayyour wife needed somebody to straighten them out and im not a tactful person  id only a day or twos notice and there wasnt time to arrange matters properly but its hard to imagine that people who knew you could be such credulous fools i mustnt say anything stronger of your relatives  i dont think being my relatives makes them any brighter andrew replied with a grin my father was the last genius in the family talent often skips a generation but well let the matter drop  if you find gratitude hard to put up with it seems that your sister hilda has told clare something about your adventures you had some rough experiences in canada  one or two i shouldnt imagine they were uncommon in west africa  youre right returned olcott grimly we must have a long talk but heres the clergyman coming in search of you and he looks as if he had something important to say  he withdrew and robert allinson sat down with a confused but resolute air  andrew he said i have come to express my regret at having wronged you by suspicions which i am now ashamed of  after all perhaps you had some excuse i wasnt as careful as i should have been but im getting tired of the subject  its painful but i must go on i knew what a mistake i had made as soon as i saw olcott come in but you dont understand yet how far my suspicions led me i felt it my duty to see judson about mrs olcotts lease  ah you mean you put the screw on him im glad your plot seems to have failed  so am i said robert ill confess that i was disappointed at first and suspected wannop of interfering as you know hes lax in his views  its unfortunate the laxity you complain of isnt more common andrew broke into a smile no doubt wannop was too clever for you but i dont bear you any grudge i believe you meant well and good intentions seem to excuse a good deal of harshness  i did what i thought was my duty robert said with dignity and moved away  shortly afterward andrew entered the drawingroom where he was surprised to see robert talking to mrs olcott the clergyman looked unusually solemn and mrs olcotts expression was resigned hilda joining her brother glanced toward the other two  isnt he amusing she said with a soft laugh hes doing penance and feeling as awkward as he deserves no doubt mrs olcott feels horribly bored  what do you know about the matter andrew asked sharply  more than you think robert believes hes making full amends by countenancing mrs olcott as hes doing after this of course nobody need fight shy of her  andrew knew that reproof would be useless hilda would laugh at him  well he said ive a higher opinion of robert now than ive had for some time  hes pompous and silly hilda declared sometimes i feel sorry for him sometimes he makes me positively wicked but after all he has his good points for one thing hes not afraid  she went away when andrew joined his elder sisters and the evening passed pleasantly when the party broke up andrew strolled out to the terrace and leaned on the low wall there was no moon but the night was clear and mild bare trees rose in shadowy masses across the dark stretch of lawn the ghyll beyond it was filled with mist out of which there rose the gurgle of running water in the distance a ridge of moor cut darkly against the sky the lights in the house went out one by one the stillness was soothing and andrew became lost in thought  he knew and loved every wood and field in the dim countryside he looked out upon he had spent happy healthful days on the purple moors when the grouse came flitting across the heather among the turnips and yellow stubble in the valley where the partridge coveys lay and by deep pools in the ghyll where the silver seatrout gleamed through the brown peat water it was a harmless life he had led there but he felt that it had been a wasted one its peaceful sounds had dulled his ears to the clamor of the busy world where the work he had neglected badly needed doing he was not a prig and felt no call to be a general reformer but the allinson honor was tainted and it was his business to remove the stain he might fail but he must concentrate upon the task all the power he possessed  then he began to consider ways and means a good deal depended on his relatives attitude they could hamper him by their resistance and he wanted their support though he was prepared to go on without it tonight they had obviously acquitted him of a supposititious folly which was something to the good indeed he had been especially pleased by roberts frank expression of regret he had looked for determined opposition from the clergyman but now he did not despair of winning him though prejudiced and conventional robert was sincere and that was a great thing  tomorrow evening the family council must be held he imagined that leonard was clever enough to have put him in the wrong beforehand he would no doubt be called on to explain his rash interference with the companys canadian affairs and he must make the best defense he could indeed he must bear with a good deal if needful to make his defense effective but if this could not be done there was another line he meant to take he would let those who misjudged him know that he was the head of allinsons and would go on as he had begun     chapter xxiv  the truth about rain bluff   dinner was a solemn function the next evening andrew who had been shooting with wannop and olcott all day was quietly thoughtful and the rest of the party felt a sense of constraint conversation dragged once or twice it nearly died away and leonard prevented an awkward pause by his polished wit between whiles however wannop jested bravely and hilda seconded him occasionally at roberts and leonards expense the others talked without much point when they could think of anything to say but preoccupied as they were it was a relief to all when they dispersed for half an hour before meeting andrew in the library he spent the interval in his smokingroom thinking hard but he looked up when hilda came in and sat down on the lounge beside him  feeling very bad old boy she said  i have spent more cheerful moments andrew replied  hilda nodded  it must be tryingthe pause before the battle but youll shake off the sinking feeling when you get into action dont let them bully you andrew they can look very wise but theres none of them you need be afraid of unless its leonard antony of course will back you all he can  thanks for the encouragement but im not sure you have any right to talk about these things  oh dont be silly cant you realize that ive grown up and if i hadnt as much sense as robert and mrs fenwood id feel very sorry for myself but we had better be practicali suppose you see what you ought to do  no andrew admitted not as clearly as i could wish  then what troubles the others is that they cant think for themselves they must have a lead as leonard knows and he has cleverly given them one so far they have followed him docilely now you must make them follow you  can you tell me how it should be done  ill admit that its easier to sketch out a general plan than to fit in the details but thats your business said hilda then her tone changed and grew tinged with haughtiness first of all remember that youre fighting for allinsons im glad the others are nearly as proud of the name as we are its unthinkable that leonard should drag it down and sell it for what he can gain you stand for what we hold precious you must beat him  ill try andrew promised soberly and hilda kissed him and went hastily from the room  andrew remained for a few minutes feeling cheered geraldine ethel and now hilda had urged him on they thought he was right and it looked as if all had some confidence in his ability he was not sure that it was well founded for he knew his limitations the worst of which was ignorance still he must try not to discredit his supporters and his task could not be shirked he went to the library where his relatives were waiting and gravely asked them to be seated though two pillar lamps were lighted the large room was shadowy a silver stand with candles burning occupied the middle of the great oak table round which the party gathered flinging a clear illumination on their faces  andrew took the head of the table and there was something the others had not expected in his quiet manner he did not look as if he had come to make excuses or ask their forbearance leonard sitting opposite eyed him sharply florence and gertrude did not seem at ease mrs fenwood and robert allinson were heavily serious wannop waited with amused expectancy  i asked you to meet me here because you all have a large interest in allinsons and the rain bluff mine andrew began i thought it fit that you should hear why i have made some changes in our canadian plans  it would be better not to confuse allinsons with the mine leonard interposed the rain bluff is of course an independent company  no said andrew sternly in a very real sense that is not correct the two must stand together the rain bluff shares were largely taken up by the family and our customers the mine cannot prove a failure without discrediting the firm which launched and tacitly guaranteed it a pledge given by allinsons must be redeemed  that is obvious robert solemnly agreed  andrew is begging the question in speaking of the mine as being guaranteed by the firm leonard persisted the shares were offered to the public on the inducements stated in the prospectus  they were subscribed for because it was an allinson venture but well leave that point for a while i feel justified in asking your attention as rain bluff shareholdersthough i have learned that leonard has lately reduced his holding  several of the others showed surprise and leonard looked disconcerted but wannop broke into a deep chuckle  i felt tempted to do the same after what i learned at the lake of shadows he remarked however when id had a few words with andrew i decided to hold on though hes carrying a good bit of my money i felt he was worth backing  well said andrew i was sent out to look into canadian matters and i have done so the discoveries i made are by no means reassuring  he paused with a dry smile and his listeners felt uncomfortable he had not been sent out to investigate the mining operations but to keep him out of harm leonard was conscious that he had made a mistake andrew had developed unsuspected capabilities  a large proportion of the companys work is done by contract and i found that newly arrived immigrants ignorant of their rights were mainly employed they were badly fed though in canada the rudest laborers are given a generous diet worse housed paid less than standard wages and cheated of part of their due it is not by such means that allinsons should make money  it is not robert firmly declared  he was the last ally andrew had looked for but robert had been thinking to some purpose leonard had deceived him about mrs olcott he had been led into conduct which savored of cruelty and which he regretted leonard having played false in one matter might do so in another roberts faith in him had been rudely shaken and he felt that the man must be watched  after all we are not responsible for the evils andrew mentions mrs fenwood broke in it must be the contractors fault  responsibility said robert cannot be shuffled off though what one may call the impersonal nature of a public company seems to make it easier the money is yours and you expect to draw the dividends it is a pernicious idea that one may make a profit by investing in a company whose business is harmful and go free from blame i may say that i was once urged to apply for shares in a new brewery a little before they were put on the market and i felt that i had done right in declining though they went to a handsome premium shortly afterward  the tone in which he concluded suggested keen regret and wannop laughed  andrew is probably mistaken in what he alleges leonard said  ill give you a few figures andrew read from a notebook particulars of the wages paid by mappin as compared with other contractors i have seen the rest of the things there can be no doubt about them i presume leonard was ignorant of the contractors character and the methods he employs  andrew stopped having scored a point leonard could not profess a knowledge of mappins doings although to admit his ignorance of them was to acknowledge his antagonists superiority  it seems that i have been somewhat mistaken about the man he said  now that you have been informed you cannot feel that we ought still to entrust our work to him  wannop gave andrew an approving smile recognizing that he had taken a very judicious line leonard must respect the opinions of the others and he knew that they would not sanction anything flagrantly unjust and discreditable  no he conceded not in a general way at the same time sudden and severe changes should be avoided the man is carrying out his duties efficiently and economically  i think not said andrew ill have to tax your patience with some more figures they show that we could do the work cheaper without wronging anybody we employ  opening his notebook he supported his claim and there was a brief silence when he had finished then florence broke in angrily  as a shareholder in my own right i am entitled to speak leonard was satisfied with the arrangements and you all know his long experience and business ability its absurd that andrew should presume to question what leonard has done his judgment cannot be as good  that is obvious mrs fenwood said  andrew realized that his relatives prejudices had still to be reckoned with in their eyes he was a rash beginner liable to be misled  i spent some time on the spot investigating things he reminded them you have heard our contractors charges and i have given you the cost of cutting rock and supplying props at regulation wages is leonard inclined to challenge the figures  after all said leonard the subject is not of the first importance it is more serious that you have taken upon yourself to reduce the output of the mine  it is undoubtedly a grave matter unfortunately there seems to be no prospect of the mines paying  the announcement caused some sensation but while the others looked at him in surprise and concern leonard flushed  there is a risk in jumping to conclusions he said the allround quality of the ore can only be proved by extensive working and you must be aware that to increase the quantity of the output reduces the cost per ton  that is a maxim which requires some thinking over wannop observed to begin with i dont see how you can cut down the cost when you have a good deal of the work done by a contractor at a fixed price then if theres a loss on every ton it puzzles an outsider like myself to understand how you expect to make a profit by producing a very large quantity  im afraid it would take me some time and trouble to explain the thing leonard said with a polished sneer  theres no doubt youd find it difficult wannop retorted  are we to understand that there will be no dividends mrs fenwood interposed in alarm if so i feel that i have been cruelly deceived i was promised a handsome profit in the prospectus  i have much the same feeling said robert allinson the matter is one of importance to me my stipend is not large the expenses which my work in this parish entails are heavy i bought the shares because i expected they would pay  its the usual reason for buying shares but investors are disappointed now and then wannop said genially  you took a business hazard robert as did mrs fenwood leonard contended even if our canadian prospects were as bad as andrew imagines which i do not admit you would have no grievance  youre mistaken exclaimed mrs fenwood i have heard that mining shares are risky but i had every reason to believe that allinsons never took up anything that was not perfectly sound  that was true until recently andrew said quietly looking steadily at his brotherinlaw i think i may say that it will again be the rule in the future  leonard smiled and turned to the others  i agree with andrew but i must suggest more caution on his part after careful investigations in canada i made arrangements for the working of the new company everything promised well there was no prospect of any difficulty and i must confess to some astonishment when andrew told me we were threatened by serious trouble if he is right i feel that he is to some extent responsible in his inexperience he has i fear acted with more zeal than discretion  its the only conclusion one can come to mrs fenwood remarked severely  is it seriously suggested that andrews inexperience has had some effect on the nature of the rock we are working wannop inquired  after all continued leonard i think i may say that there is no cause for alarm if the mining is proceeded with on the lines i laid down and no rash experiments are made we shall no doubt presently reach excellent ore i must deprecate the undertaking of any new ventures such as andrew seems to have in view  the listeners showed relief one or two questions were asked and leonard feeling that he was getting the better of the situation went on gravely  his favorite scheme i understand is the exploitation of a lode far to the north which was discovered by a sawmill clerk twenty years ago though in the place where he lives the thing is looked on as a delusion of the mans indeed it is said that he is crazy on the subject it strikes me as highly injudicious that the companys capital should be wasted upon a search for imaginary minerals  i will engage that not a penny shall be unprofitably spent said andrew if the thing prove a failure i will bear the expense  no one spoke for a few moments and then robert looked up  i feel that we are entitled to ask for a few particulars he said  there we must disagree andrew replied if i am right about the lode you and the other shareholders will be told all you wish to know if i am wrong the loss will be mine  they were puzzled by his resolute air he was placing himself at a disadvantage by refusing an explanation but this did not seem to trouble him he had all along adopted a strangely masterful tone without a hint of doubt or hesitation  i hardly think you are treating us fairly by keeping us in the dark robert protested  andrew smiled  then i must ask your forbearance i was given full authority as a director when i went to canada and i must try to use it as i think best for the shareholders benefit moreover it cannot be rescinded until the next general meeting of the company when that is held i shall be ready to give an account of what i have done  then it looks as if we had been brought here for nothing mrs fenwood complained  hardly so you have learned that the mine cannot be profitably worked on the present system and that i am making changes which may improve the companys prospects you have had an opportunity for condemning my policy which you have not done i venture to believe you are reserving your judgment which is all i can ask  there was a pause for the next few moments andrew had changed his tone to one of grave appeal and as he leaned back waiting with the light of the candles on his face it struck one or two of them that he looked very much like his father who had retrieved and added to the fortunes of the firm robert glanced at him in frank sympathy which touched andrew for he had not expected it then leonard broke the silence  andrew is asking you to trust him with extensive powers in fact he demands something of the nature of a blank check without explaining what use he means to make of it i willingly admit that the position he holds by right is a strong one and we have no direct means of restraining him his interest in the firm gives him more authority than any of us individually holds for all that it must be remembered that he could not stand against the unanimous family vote and i have no doubt he will agree that you are now called upon to act as a kind of informal jury whatever course you decide on the directors must adopt your position is accordingly a serious and important one andrew is young and inexperienced the affairs of a company like the rain bluff demand careful and skilful handling  leonard has stated the situation fairly i have nothing to add andrew said quietly  his relatives hesitated looking irresolute with the exception of florence and mrs fenwood who regarded andrew with distrustful severity after a few moments wannop addressed them  my suggestion is that we do nothing at present but wait as andrew asks until a meeting of the shareholders is held when he must give a full account of his plans then we will see our course more clearly but if he finds he can take us into his confidence sooner so much the better  florence and mrs fenwood dissented but the others acquiesced including leonard who knew how far it was prudent to go and the party broke up andrew however remained in his place and leonard lingered to light a cigarette  i must congratulate you he said you handled the thing better than one could have anticipated i suppose you are going back shortly to look for the lode  i am going back i cannot tell you what i shall do until i arrive  leonard winced  youre not disposed to be confidential but i wont complain of that he added quietly be careful andrew its easy to make trouble and hard to put it right you havent accomplished much yet and there are serious difficulties ahead  thats true admitted andrew with a direct glance i am however not making trouble its all round me and must be grappled with  then i wish you luck said leonard and went out  andrew lighted a cigar he deeply distrusted leonard whose confederate perhaps with his knowledge had plotted to starve him to death it was irksome that he should be forced to treat the man as an honored guest of late he had been subject to fits of savage anger as he remembered how his attempt to find the lode was thwarted so far as it was possible he must play out the game correctly in accordance with conventional rules his relatives would insist on this an outbreak would shock them and cost him their support nevertheless it was hard to dissemble and treat leonard courteously  flinging his cigar into the grate andrew rose with a frown his brotherinlaw was right there was trouble ahead he had not only leonard but the unscrupulous mappin to grapple with     chapter xxv  a delicate point   the afternoon was drawing to a close when andrew olcott and a friend of the latters carrying guns and spread out in line entered a stretch of rough boggy pasture near the river clumps of reeds and rushes grew along the open drains water gleamed among the grass and the bare trees on the high bank across the stream stood out sharp and black against a glow of saffron light the men were wet to the knees and a white setter splashed with mire trotted in front of them murray olcotts friend who was on andrews right sprang across a broad drain and laughed when he alighted  over my boots but my feet cant get any wetter he remarked i dont know that this is a judicious amusement after being invalided home from the tropics but it looks a likely place for a mallard  allinson had met murray for the first time that morning and noticed that the man a government official in a west african colony looked at him rather intently when they were introduced they had however spent a pleasant day and andrew was going to olcotts to dinner  im afraid the plover will put up any ducks there are about he said theyre a nuisance and youre not allowed to shoot them here it will be bad to keep our line over this rough ground  four or five lapwings screaming shrilly wheeled in wide circles overhead showing sharply black and white as the light struck them and fading into indistinct gray patches as they turned in erratic flight the men advanced cautiously searching the ground with eager eyes and keeping their positions as closely as possible this was needful for the safety of the party in case a bird got up and crossed their line of march when the right to first shot would be determined by the code of shooting etiquette  andrew was plodding through a belt of rush with a plover circling close above his head when the setter after creeping slowly forward for a few paces suddenly stopped then a small gray object sprang up from a drain and andrew threw his gun to his shoulder he dropped it the next moment with a low call to murray  your bird  the snipe had swung a little to the right in its swift flight swerving in sharp corkscrew twists and murrays gun twice flashed the bird however held on and faded against the dusky background of the river bank murray stopped and turned to andrew with a laugh  im afraid im hardly up to snipe he said its a pity you were generous enough to give me the shot  it was yours by right  that murray disputed is an open point if i had been in your place and could have hit the bird i wouldnt have let it go however if the firing hasnt made them wild you may get another chance  the sun had sunk behind the tall bank and the pale yellow light that lingered was confusing when the setter flushed a second snipe which went away at long range in front of andrew during a part of each quick gyration he could not see it but when it was outlined for a second black against the light his gun flashed and the bird fell among the reeds when the setter had found it murray looked surprised  considering the bad light and the distance it was a remarkably clean shot he said i expected to see that you had hit it with only a stray pellet or two  i used the left barrel andrew explained smiling its a halfchoke an old gun that accounts for the charge hanging together  it doesnt account for your killing your bird at a long range with shot which wouldnt spread but its getting dark and weve had enough  they turned back to the nearest road and an hour or two after reaching home andrew walked across to olcotts ethel hillyard was there and when they went into dinner murray sitting next to her glanced at andrew near the other end of the table  i was out with mr allinson today he said as hes a neighbor of yours ive no doubt you know him pretty well he struck me as a particularly straight man  he is so declared ethel warmly i dont know a straighter still i dont see how you came to that conclusion by watching his shooting  it doesnt seem very obvious murray responded with a smile however so far as my experience goes a man whos scrupulous in one thing is very apt to prove the same in another when we were out this afternoon a snipe got up in front of him and he let me have the shot  but how does that prove his general honesty  im not sure i was entitled to the shot though as the bird headed slightly toward me there was some doubt about the matter allinson gave me the full benefit though i think he must have known that i would miss  is it a great sacrifice to give up a shot  a snipe said murray is very hard to hit though allinson showed us afterward that he is capable of bringing one down now when you know you can do a difficult thing neatly its not easy to refrain  perhaps thats true ethel agreed no doubt the temptations stronger when you have an appreciative audience  mine said murray was too polite to laugh  mrs olcott asked him a question and they changed the subject but after dinner murray found an opportunity for a word with andrew whom olcott had left alone in his smokingroom  perhaps its hardly correct to talk to you on business here and i wont press you but theres some information you may be able to give me he said  andrew looked at the man more carefully than he had hitherto done murrays face was thin and rather haggard but it bore the stamp of authority his manner was grave but pleasant  i am at your service he replied  then i want to ask about the rain bluff mine a little time ago a stockjobbing friend told me it ought to turn out a good thing he said that whatever allinsons took up could be relied on and it was clear that he had a high opinion of your house on the strength of it i put some money into the venture he paused with a smile now you are wondering why a man with means enough to speculate should go to west africa  something like that was in my mind  well i learned that id the knack of getting on with primitive peoples in fact its my only talent and i felt that i had to make use of it then its a mysterious country that gets hold of one and perhaps is hardly so bad as its painted as a rule i dont have fever more than half a dozen times a year whats more to the purpose part of the money was lately left to me but im getting away from the point  andrew was favorably impressed by the man they had something in common for both were imbued with a sense of responsibility murray had lightly indicated this and andrew knew that west africa is far from a desirable place to live  you have a reason for feeling anxious about those shares  yes in my district the risk of getting permanently disabled by the climate or shot by an ambushed nigger has to be considered stipend and pension are small and i felt that i needed something to fall back on that was why i bought the rain bluff stock now my friend tells me that the shares are being quietly sold in small lots which he seems to think ominous if you can tell me anything about the matter ill be grateful  andrew was silent for a minute or two feeling troubled he did not pity the regular stockjobbers and speculators who had bought rain bluff stock for they were accustomed to playing a risky game it was however different with such investors as murraymen of small means who had carefully saved something to provide for old age and women left with just enough to keep them from want these he thought formed a numerous class and demanded his sympathy they had no doubt avoiding ventures which offered a larger return been influenced by a desire for security which would seem to be promised by allinsons connection with the mine  well he said at last i believe it is true that shares have been parted with by a man who has a say in the management of the company  that sounds discouraging if i sell out ill lose three or four shillings on every share  yes and if others follow your example it will weaken the companys position however i think you can venture to keep your stock  you cant expect me to take the risk of holding in order to support a concern in which im badly disappointed i must ask you frankly what is wrong at the mine  in strict confidence i may say that the ore we are working does not promise well  murray looked at him in astonishment  you are remarkably candid but you give me a curious reason for holding on to my shares  heres a better one said andrew we have another mine in view but whether it turns out rich or not no holder of rain bluff stock shall lose a penny by his confidence in allinsons  though i dont know much about stockjobbing that strikes me as an extraordinary promise  i dare say it is andrew replied i offer you no guarantee you must use your judgment  murray looked up sharply  i believe your word is good enough you have taken a load off my mind mr allinson ill hold those shares may i add that if my proxy is likely to be of any value at your meetings you may count on it  thanks and now did i tell you that olcott promised to bring you out again tomorrow theres a cover i want to beat and the pheasants ought to be plentiful  they went down together and murray joined ethel hillyard in the drawingroom  ive had a talk with mr allinson which confirms your opinion of him he said but i must say that he doesnt fit in with my idea of a company director  ethel laughed  andrews new to the business and undertook it with reluctance from a sense of duty for all that though his ignorance of commercial matters must be a handicap i expect him to make a success of it  one would imagine that a desire to make money is the more usual object but i think youre right in fact you have touched upon a pet idea of mine  the girl turned and studied him there was a trace of gravity in his manner and she understood that he had done with credit difficult and dangerous work  what is the idea she asked  to put it roughly something like thismore depends on character than specialized training determination and strong sincerity often carry one farther than a knowledge of the rules of the game one sees people who rely on the latter come to grief  even in company floating  that said murray smiling is a subject about which im ignorant i was speaking of the general principle  do you mean that right must prevail  im sanguine enough to believe it often does in the end  one would like to think so but as we seem to be getting serious isnt the question whether it prevails or not another matter from an altruistic point of view  murray pondered this and then looked up with a twinkle  so long as im not priggish i dont mind being serious you see im fresh from the shadowy bush where life is solemn enough and when i came home not long ago after a three years absence i felt strangely out of place youre at a disadvantage when you cant talk about the latest musical comedy or popular dancer and its as bad not to know the favorite for an approaching steeplechase however to stick to our subject i see what you mean one must do ones work and not worry about the result  olcott was passing and he stopped beside them  murray seems to be moralizing he laughed i must warn you that he spends his evenings in africa sitting behind a mosquitonetting studying the early victorian philosophers its some excuse for him that when the niggers are quiet he has nothing else to do and nobody to talk to except a colored official  dont you get any newspapers ethel asked  theyre often too wet and pulpy to read and now and then the sporting natives bag the mailcarrier ive known them try to stalk the white officer responsible for too drastic reforms  ethel regarded murray with heightened interest there was something that both amused and touched her in the thought of the lonely man shut in by the black steamy forest spending his evenings reading philosophy  i wonder she said whether you find any practical application of the great thinkers theories  one old favorite of mine strikes me as rather grim and singularly hard to please but so far as i can judge he hits the mark now and then its a pet theme of his that only that which stands on justice and is better than what it displaces can endure you see that worked out in a primitive country like west africa  but isnt the progress of civilization assisted by machineguns and followed by gin  a fair shot laughed olcott our rules often faulty but its a good deal better than the natives had before murray knows a creek that mutilated corpses used to drift down after each big palaver and celebration of juju rites  i suppose he had some trouble in putting a stop to it  olcott broke into a grim smile  one would imagine so from what i heard of the matter an army of savages with flintlocks took the bush on the other side there were about two dozen colored mohammedan soldiers a white lieutenant carried in a hammock because he was too ill to walk and a civil officer who wasnt authorized to fight to carry out the reforms though it didnt look encouraging at the start they were effected  ah said ethel one could be proud of things like that after all mr murrays philosopher may be right its cheering to find a man ready to put his belief in justice to the test  theres one said olcott indicating andrew i shouldnt wonder if it costs him something  the group broke up and some time later andrew walked home with ethel the distance was not great the road was dry and a half moon threw down a silvery light thin mist filled the hollows the murmur of the river rose from a deep valley and the air was soft  its very open weather ethel remarked i suppose its different in canada  in the part im best acquainted with the thermometer is now registering forty degrees below zero and it would need a charge of dynamite to break the ice on the lakes  prospecting must be stern work said ethel speculatively its curious that you havent thought it worth while to give me an account of your adventures wont you do so  well you mustnt blame me if you find them tedious as a matter of fact i havent said much about them to anybody yet  he began with a few rather involved explanations but his style became clearer as he followed up the main thread of the tale and ethel listened with close interest  so it was the frobishers who saved you by sending off a rescue party she exclaimed when he had finished but how did they know you were in danger  thats more than i can tell of course we were behind our time but that doesnt account for all ive a suspicion that miss frobisher had some means of finding out the most serious risk we ran  ethel thought this indicated that geraldine took a marked interest in the man she wondered if it had occurred to him  and you believe the fellow really meant to starve you she said  he didnt intend us to find the food it comes to the same thing  but his conduct seems so inhuman surely he would not have let you die of hunger with no better reason than to prevent you from interfering with his contract  andrew hesitated he could not tell her that mappin might have been actuated by jealousy modesty prevented his doing so  the fellow is greedy and unscrupulous enough for anything he replied evasively  but you hinted that he was clever ethel persisted only a fool would commit a serious crime for a small advantage  its certainly puzzling andrew admitted  then he was surprised and disconcerted when ethel turned on him a searching glance  andrew she said the man must have been given a hint by some one more powerful his is not the strongest interest you are opposed to  the color crept into andrews face he suspected leonard but it was unthinkable that he should declare his brotherinlaws infamy this was a matter that lay between the culprit and himself  its an unpleasant topic and the fellows a rascal he answered its hard to say what might influence such men theyre not quite normal you cant account for them  but youre going back to look for the lode arent you ethel laid her hand on his arm be careful you have had a warning i suppose you must do what you have fixed your mind on and knowing you are right i dare not dissuade you  ill run no risks that can be avoided and in particular trust no outsider to look after the supplies for our next trip andrew said grimly one experience like the last is enough  for a few minutes they walked on in silence ethel knew her companions character and admired it and now she had met murray who in some respects resembled him as did olcott all were men of action and there was the same indefinite but recognizable stamp on them they were direct simple in a sense which did not imply foolishness free from petty assumption and incapable of suave diplomacy but one could rely on them in time of stress leonard was a good example of the opposite type but she found the other more pleasant to think about when she reached the gate she gave andrew her hand  you know you have my good wishes she said     chapter xxvi  a suspicious stranger   andrew returned to canada satisfied with his english visit he had not convinced his relatives that his judgment was entirely to be trusted but he knew that he stood higher in their esteem than he had done and that was something to be thankful for leonard he thought would find it more difficult to prejudice them against his plans on reaching the lake of shadows he found graham recovering and learned that the frobishers had left for their home in denver after remaining a few days at the landing he went up to the mine where the ore showed no sign of improvement for all that he spent a month there waiting until the thaw came and maturing his plans for his second journey to dream mine  at last the rotting ice began to yield and andrew sat outside watsons shack one day watching an impressive spectacle the river broke up with violence the ice ripping and rending with a sound like the roar of artillery and as the great torn masses swept away the water pent up in the higher reaches poured into the gorge swollen with melting snow it rolled by in savage flood laden with tremendous blocks of ice some of which cemented together near falls and rapids were the size of small frame houses among them drove huge floes into which the floating cakes had solidified during the earlier frosts here and there one stranded upon a point or swung in an eddy until another crashed into it and both were shattered amid a bewildering uproar then for a while the stream was filled with massive driving sheets of ice which ground the banks with a tremendous din and scored the tops of projecting boulders while waterlogged pines and stumps sunk in the riverbed were crushed to pulp  andrew had never seen any display of natural forces to equal this and when he went into the shack for supper he found that he could not get the recollection of it out of his mind the lonely north is a savage country very grim and terrible in some of its moods andrew however had carefully considered and endeavored to guard against its dangers and when a canoe which had been especially built for him in toronto arrived he set out on his journey with carnally and graham there was now no risk of frostbite and the gray trout would help out their food supply but they knew the trip would cost them much exhausting labor  for some days they poled and paddled up the swollen river spending hours in dragging the canoe and provisions across rocky portages to avoid furious rapids and often wading waistdeep in icy water with the tracking line at night they slept generally wet through among the stones though there was often sharp frost and the slack along the bank was covered with fresh ice in the morning but they made steady progress until the stream broke up into small forks and they must cross the height of land this was singularly toilsome work in some places they were forced to hew a path through scrub spruce bush in others there were slippery rocks to be scrambled across while two in turn carried the canoe borne upsidedown upon the shoulders then there were the provisions to be brought up and in relaying them each difficult stage had to be traversed several times so that once or twice when they had made only a mile or two in an exhausting day andrew almost despaired of getting any farther  at last however they found a creek rushing tumultuously down the back of the divide they followed it one of them checking the canoe by the tracking line while the others kept her off the rocks with pole and paddle their provisions were secured so far as possible from damage by water but there was danger of losing them in a capsize and boiling eddies and roaring rapids made caution needful for a while the creek led them roughly where they wished to go and then turned off and they crossed a high ridge in search of another lakes and rivers abound in those wilds which are almost impassable on foot during the short summer as they worked north the sun grew warmer but the temperature fell sharply at night and now and then the waste was swept by piercing winds  one of these was raging when they scudded down a lake on a cold and lowering evening gray vapor blurred the rocky shore but here and there a few dark pines stood out harshly distinct the water was leadencolored between the lines of foam and short slashing seas broke angrily about the canoe which ran before them with a small lugsail set carnally knelt astern holding the steering paddle andrew lay down amidships out of the wind and graham crouching forward fixed his eyes ahead  there seems to be a creek abreast of us carnally said were in shoaling water watch out for snags  a violent gust struck them and the canoe drove on furiously lifting her bows on a foaming ridge while the water lapped level with her stern  shoot her up graham called out sharply log right ahead  andrew seized the sheet and carnally plied the paddle but the warning had come too late while the canoe slanted over until her lee side was under water as she altered her course there was a sharp crash her speed slackened for a moment or two then she lifted as a white wave surged by and when she drove on again the water poured in through a rent in her side  cant be kept under by baling carnally remarked well have to put her on the wind and make the beach  he hauled the sheet but she would not bear the pressure when she brought the wind abeam and seeing the water pouring in over her lowered side carnally let her fall off again  looks as if we had to keep her running he said  the end of the lake cant be far off and the waters too rough to do much with the paddle  they scudded on andrew and graham baling as fast as possible while the rising water gained on them until blurred trees and rocks began to grow out of the haze ahead then as a strip of beach became distinguishable they lowered the sail and soon afterward jumped over and carried her out across the jagged driftwood that hammered on the pebbles there was a small promontory near at hand and carnally walked across it while the others made camp supper was ready when he returned and after the meal was finished he lay down near the fire  the canoe wants a patch on her bilge he said could you sew on a bit of the thin cedar with the copper wire graham theres some caulking gum in the green can  it would take me a day to make a neat job  no hurry replied carnally the outlet from the lakes just beyond that rise and it looks pretty good when you have finished the canoe you and andrew could take her down and wait for me where the creek runs into the river were looking for  it would be hard work at the portages but why arent you coming with us andrew asked  i ought to make the creek where mappin cached the first lot of stores for our other trip in about two days march  we have enough without them  thats so anyhow i want to look at the cache stores are a consideration on a trip like this the less you have to pack over the portages the quicker you can travel though we didnt find it mappin knows where the cache was made  i dont see the drift of this andrew said  carnally smiled  hasnt it struck you that we might be followed sending up the canoe and camp truck would show the people at the landing that we were ready to start and mappin knows our line roughly as far as the cache you cant make camp and haul across brush portages without leaving a trail  ah that makes one think of course we would have no legal claim to the lode unless we got our stakes in before anybody else  its not enough you have to get back to a government office and file your record before youre safe well considering everything i guess ill start for the cache at sunup  the others agreed to this and after he left the next morning they set to work on the canoe and repaired her satisfactorily then they launched her on the outflowing stream and a few days later made camp on the bank of a larger river where they sat beside their fire late at night the gorge was filled with the clamor of rushing water but the night was very still and they could hear sounds in the bush through the deeptoned roar of the flood outside the glow of the fire which fell on the straight spruce trunks there was nothing to be seen but they sat listening for carnally had been longer than he expected and andrew was anxious  at last graham raised his hand  i heard something  andrew turned his head but for a while could hear only the hoarse turmoil of the river then he started as a faint crackle came out of the shadows it rose again more clearly and presently a mans dark shape emerged from the gloom a few moments later carnally threw off his pack and sat down by the fire his boots badly ripped and his clothing tattered  i struck some pretty rough country he explained the creek winds a lot and i came across the range  did you find the cache andrew asked  sure it had been opened not long before and provisions taken out  graham moved abruptly  i suppose the things couldnt have been taken by indians  no sir indians would have cleaned out the whole lot whoever found the cache left some food to pick up when coming back there were three or four white men in the party i learned that when i struck their empty camp looks as if the hog was still getting after us  im afraid so said andrew frowning whats to be done to shake off his men  the fellows were heading downstream and i guess theyd hold on until they struck this river where theyd make a base camp and look for our trail well instead of keeping to the water as theyd expect well strike across the divide though it will be an awkward traverse  his companions approved the plan and the next day they found a spot where smooth rocky slabs dropped gently to the water here they took off their boots to avoid leaving telltale scratches and then they hauled out the canoe they were able to carry her some distance before they met with much brush and when they had brought up the provisions carnally looked about with a satisfied air  this wouldnt strike one as an easy place to portage across and the stream runs smartly past the stones we landed on he chuckled i guess mappins boys will go straight on and it may be some time before they get suspicious  his opinion was reassuring as far as it went but andrew felt daunted as he studied the rise ahead the ravines were filled with brushwood the spurs clothed with spruce and he failed to see how the canoe was to be conveyed to the top it must however be tried and they set to work laboriously carrying her up the steep slopes a few yards at a time until they reached a gully choked with brush where progress became almost impossible they were forced to drag her through thick bushes stopping every two or three minutes for breath while on the steeper pitches they buried knees and toes in the gravel as they passed her from hand to hand the light was fading when they reached the crest exhausted and it cost andrew a determined effort to go back some distance with carnally for the provisions indeed it was only hunger forced him to do so  the nights had been getting lighter rapidly but the soft dimness was puzzling when the two men faced the ascent they could not judge the steepness of the slope they plunged into bushes they had not noticed and there were spots where they narrowly escaped dangerous falls slipping scrambling floundering andrew struggled up with his load and sank down worn out and aching beside grahams fire  youll have to cook i cant make another move he said it strikes me that the man who finds a mine in this country deserves all he gets that raises the questionhow is it that mappin can trust the rascals he has sent after us suppose they found the lode why couldnt they stick to it  a mineral vein is of little use to a man without money graham explained it would cost him a good deal in transport of provisions and tools before he got his legal development work done and then he wouldnt be much farther on because hed have to put up expensive plant and clear a trail to bring the ore out as a matter of fact the fortunate prospector is forced to look for a capitalist  that remarked carnally is how we are fixed you neednt worry about our going back on you  rot said andrew you know id trust either of you with my last penny  its your trouble that youre a confiding man but i guess you have learned that it doesnt pay to take any chances when you deal with mappin  im convinced of it one experience of his tricks is enough  ill confess it wasnt enough for me when id fired him out of the store i felt so good that i set up drinks for all the thirsty slouches in the hotel but i made a mistake ive been sorry for ever since instead of letting him walk off i ought to have punched the hog until they had to take him to a winnipeg hospital for one thing it would have saved us portaging over this blamed divide  the others laughed and though andrew admitted that carnallys methods were primitive he thought there was some excuse for them mappin might be considered an outlaw against whom any weapons could be used  they went to sleep soon after supper and resuming the march the next morning they spent two arduous days transporting the canoe to the nearest water and paddled down it seeing nothing of mappins men the canoe received some damage when running a rapid into a lake and it cost them a day to repair her though carnally showed much impatience at the detention when dusk fell they sat smoking by the fire for the night was cold the wild cry of a loon rang at intervals across the palely gleaming water the resinous smell of the spruces was in the air and the soft splash of ripples upon the shingle accentuated the stillness  the loons call suddenly broke off in the middle and carnally got up sharply a little later he pointed to a dark speck which appeared out on the lake  the loon he commented it was in the shadow by the big stone and must have swum a good piece under water somebody scared the bird now its gone again  the black spot vanished and carnally stood still in fixed attention while andrews heart began to beat quickly he could hear nothing but he knew that carnally was seldom mistaken in matters of this kind some minutes passed and then as footsteps broke the silence carnally beckoned graham to give him a rifle they had brought  come out of the bush so we can see you he cried  a shadowy form appeared against the gleaming water and stopped  what do you want carnally asked are you alone  something to eat said the stranger theres nobody with me  one of the mappin crowd i guess wheres the rest of you  i dont know its three or four days since i left them  then you can come along i see you have a gun if youre wise youll keep it at the trail  dont be scared said the other advancing im not looking for trouble  in a few moments he entered the firelight and stopped at a motion from carnallya ragged and very weary man with a pinched and eager look in his face  now said carnally what brought you here  im starving the man replied and andrew thought his appearance bore it out  he sat down with the rifle he had carried across his arm and carnally indicated the fryingpan  theres a bannock and some pork yonder it wont take long to warm up but before you get any we must have a talk why did you leave the rest of mappins hobos  we wrecked our canoe in a rapid and lost all the grub there was some trouble about it and when the others turned back to make the cache i allowed id follow you missed your trail once or twice but i figured on the line youd take and picked it up again  andrew thought the tale was plausible and a bruise on the mans face seemed to corroborate it as it hinted at the reason for his leaving his comrades  will they follow us up he asked  cant tell said the stranger theyd be mighty hungry when they made the cache anyhow id had enough of them  give him some supper said andrew  graham put on the fryingpan and in a few minutes the man fell upon the food ravenously when he had finished he felt for his pipe and ruefully put it back andrew laughed and threw him a pouch of cut tobacco  youre white said the stranger with a curious look  while he lighted his pipe carnally leaning quickly forward picked up his rifle and flung it into the lake  why did you do that the fellow asked in anger  youll have something else to carry and one guns enough for this crowd carnally significantly replied  then you dont mean to fire me out  oh no i guess well engage you as packer but i must speak to the boss first and carnally led andrew a short distance back into the shadow  is it wise to take the rascal with us andrew asked  it seems the only thing to do you dont want him to starve  certainly not but couldnt we give him a few provisions and let him go  if he had a little grub to go on with he might catch a trout in the shallows or snare something that he could eat then hed either follow us or join his friends and put them on our track i prefer to have him under our eye  but hell see where the lode is  sure ill take care he does no prospecting three claims on the best of the vein will give you all you want to work and as soon as your records filed youll have prospectors coming up by dozens  well concluded andrew you must do what you think fit  they went back to the fire and carnally turned to the stranger  your engagement begins tomorrow if you do your work youll get your grub and nothing else then he added if that doesnt seem good enough you can quit when you like  it was as both recognized an impossible alternative because if the fellow left their service he must starve  call it a deal he said you have got me safe  thats so said carnally you want to remember that the moment you give us any cause for suspicion you get fired now what about your partners how long would it take them to make the cache  two or three days  then theyd have to come back and find our trail i reckon were six days ahead and that ought to be enough you have a blanket you can choose your place and sleep when you like  the man who was obviously worn out gathered some spruce twigs and lay down on them but the others sat a while beside the fire before they followed his example     chapter xxvii  andrew stakes his claim   soon after daybreak they launched the canoe and though she was now rather deeply loaded they made good progress down the outflowing creek when it was necessary for one to wade and check her with the tracking line their new companion was allotted the task and at the portages carnally took care to give him the heaviest load though it was obvious that he had not recovered from his long forced march he seemed a goodhumored rascal and resigned himself to the situation philosophically  in the afternoon they came to a rapid and spent some time hauling the canoe round it and then they went back for the stores turner as the newcomer was called was first despatched with a load which contained nothing eatable and andrew was the last to set off dark spruces on the high bank cut off the wind the sun was very hot and the perspiration dripped from andrew as he floundered across the stones they were large and uneven and he had to proceed cautiously to save himself from falling into the hollows between graham and carnally were some distance ahead but after a while he overtook turner who was moving slowly shortly before andrew came up the man dropped the things he carried and turned with signs of distress in his hot face  im not trying to kick he said guess youve got a pull on me and i have to work but im a bit played out yet and your partner piled more weight on me than i can stand  stop and take a smoke said andrew handing him his tobacco pouch i dont feel very fresh but i could carry those blankets let me have them  ill have to do that or leave them it was a tough march i made with nothing to eat he filled his pipe before he resumed theres no meanness in you  never mind that what was mappin to give you for this job  three dollars a day while i was out on it four hundred dollars when id staked the claim if the specimens assayed right  but how could he tell whether you would do the square thing by him  turner grinned  it wouldnt be safe to do anything else supposing id gone round looking for another buyer hed have had me doped or sandbagged before id made the sale you cant fool mappin you have to put your job through when you deal with him  it seems to me that you havent made a success of this particular business andrew remarked  i certainly havent the other admitted with a rueful air your partner has me fixedhes a smart man therell be no three dollars a day for mine when i go home  you have struck bad luck said andrew with a smile im not sure you dont deserve it but thats another matter and now give me the blankets well take the things along  they went on and when they reached the next wild stream where tracking was necessary andrew got into the water turner gave him a grateful glance but he afterward did his share of the heaviest work and when they made camp in the evening he soon went to sleep when the firelight leaping up fell on his shadowy form carnally chuckled  a handy man hes going to save us a lot of trouble and we got him cheap  hes a bit of a rogue and claimjumping isnt a creditable profession andrew replied still i dont think we ought to take too much advantage of the fellows necessity after all hes only a tool its his employer whos really responsible  just so graham agreed the pity is that he should find men willing to do his dirty work on very moderate pay but theres no lack of them there are men you can only dynamite out of the mire because if you pull them out by gentler means they crawl straight back again its unfortunate because you meet some with a few likable qualities i think our new packer is one of these  their trouble generally begins when they get into the clutches of such a hog as were up against carnally said he knows how to handle them and it needs some grit to break away from him well get turner to tell us some of his claimjumping experiences tomorrow night youll find them interesting  supper was finished and they were sitting in camp after a hard days toil when carnally cleverly drew the packer out he was not unwilling and warming to his subject recounted incidents that filled andrew with surprise and disgust sitting in the shadow with his eyes fixed on the ragged adventurer he heard how small sawmill owners had been jockeyed out of the timber leases they were not rich enough to defend how dams and flumes had been tampered with until their harassed proprietor sold out his water rights and the means by which impecunious owners of minerals had been robbed of their claims turner occasionally chuckled over the memory of some roguish trick but for the most part his manner was impressively matteroffact andrew did not think he was drawing much upon his imagination but it seemed incredible that such things should be done without the men who plotted them and reaped the benefit incurring general odium after turner had strolled away he said something of the kind to graham  the point is graham explained the lowdown rascals who are used as tools darent talk where theyll be heard and nobody attaches much importance to what is said in thirdrate saloons respectable people dont ask too many questions when they see a prospect of dividends there may be something not quite straight but so long as its well hidden they dont want to know still ill say this if you put the ugly facts square before them theyll quite often act even if they have to make some sacrifice to set matters right  yes assented andrew i believe thats true theres a reason why i find it encouraging  now well talk of something else carnally interposed its my opinion that we ought to leave the water soon perhaps tomorrow and push straight across the last height of land for the lode we want to keep well ahead of the mappin boys  they discussed it until they went to sleep and the next day they carried the canoe some distance back from the river and carefully hid her in the brush farther on they cached part of their stores and then plunged into a desolate stony waste their journey across it proved uneventful and at length they came down into the hollow where the lode lay as it was noon they ate a meal before anything was said and then carnally gave turner a fishingline with a trolling bait on it  you go back to the last creek we crossed and catch some trout he ordered stay there until supper whether you get any or not  turner winked  if i catch one with this outfit it will be a mighty silly trout the things made for spinning behind a canoe on a lake dont you want help with your prospecting i know something about minerals  so do we carnally replied id rather hear that you were fond of fishing because youre going to get a good deal of it every day were here youll light out after breakfast and not come back till dark if we see you from the camp well fire you on the spot  i understand said turner guess ill stay out ive no use for taking the trail without any grub  he left them and carnally turned to graham  we must get our prospecting done before the mappin gang arrives and the sooner we start the better well begin where we fired the shot last time and follow up the vein  it proved to be fairly well defined when they set to work with the light tools they had brought and their task was rendered easier because the small but rapid creek had exposed the strata in scouring out its channel in some places they picked a hole in others they fired a charge of giantpowder carefully separating the specimens they obtained and when evening came they sat in camp examining several heaps of stones  theyre promising said graham the weight is a good rough test and though it doesnt tell us much about the proportion of lead to silver i can find out something about that tomorrow jake you might pound this handful of stuff as fine as you can  he opened a small box which he had taken great care of during the journey and andrew was surprised to see it contained a delicate balance and several phials  i didnt know you were an assayer he said  im not graham answered smiling but you must remember that for twenty years ive clung to the idea that i might find the lode and perhaps it isnt astonishing that i should try to learn something about minerals and chemistry in fact its been my only recreation but i didnt bring this outfit last trip because the frost would have prevented my making much use of it  there was something that touched andrew in the thought of the sawmill clerk patiently discharging his monotonous duties year after year and preparing himself for the search which was the great object of his life though he knew he might never be able to make it it was however obvious that he had studied to some purpose because he had shown skill in tracing the vein and andrew had noticed that carnally who knew a good deal about minerals deferred to him  i was lucky in getting hold of you and jake he said  soon afterward turner appeared with one trout which he confessed he had caught with his hands and graham carefully put away the box and specimens  they began again at sunrise and worked with determined activity before noon it grew very hot there was no wind in the sheltered basin and the smell of the scattered spruces filled the listless air by degrees the men stripped off most of their clothing and the strong sun burned andrews bare arms and neck as he swung the pick they stopped only a few minutes for dinner and continued with no slackening of exertion until the shadows of the rocks covered the hollow then andrew throwing down his tools glanced with a curious satisfaction at the pile of stones which marked the course of the vein he had accomplished something that day the result of his toil could be seen  you look pleased carnally commented  i feel so declared andrew we havent improved the appearance of the place from an artistic point of view but i dont know when i felt so content with what ive done i used to feel proud when id helped to fill the game cart at home but this is different somehow its more bracing  i understand though im not much of a sport and when i work it isnt for fun  andrew slept as soon as he lay down on his bed of spruce twigs and awakened fresh and sanguine ready for another days determined toil there was something strangely exhilarating in the resinscented air andrew felt vigorous and cheerful graham had expressed his satisfaction with the rough tests he had made and the more they exposed the reef the better the ore looked it would undoubtedly pay for working and might yield a handsome profit and andrew felt that the first half of the battle had been won the other half would no doubt entail some stubborn fighting but he looked forward to it with new courage he had proved his ability and gained confidence in himself it was no longer a forlorn hope he was leading he would meet his cunning antagonist on fairly equal terms  apart from all this he found a keen pleasure in his work it was good to get up in the bracing cold of dawn and smell the aromatic wood smoke as he renewed the fire he had never enjoyed his breakfast as he did in the desolate north there was satisfaction in using the drill with a dexterity he had painfully acquired he could bring down the hammer squarely upon the head of the tool and swing the pick all day with delight in the strength of his muscles instead of exhaustion it was gratifying to find that he had chosen the right line of cleavage in the stone when the great fragments leaped up through the vapor of the exploding charge judgment as well as strength was needed in these thingsall were worth doing and made for health and tranquillity of mind  turner seemed to recognize that carnally was not to be trifled with he gave them no trouble remaining away until the days work was done then as they lounged about the fire in the sharp cold of the evening he told stories amusing and grim and andrew listened divided between admiration of the mans ingenuity and daring and disgust at his frank rascality  when the claims had been carefully staked and the last evening came andrew was sensible of a keen regret he had been happy in the wilderness and it was hardly probable that he would use the pick and drill again henceforward his duty would lie in a different sphere it was the last time he would lie down in soilstained clothes healthily tired after a day of bodily labor the air was wonderfully clear scattered spruces and towering rocks stood out with sharp distinctness against a glow of transcendental green the smoke of the fire rose straight up the splash of the creek came musically out of the shadow  i think were all ready to start south at sunrise graham said presently and looked at turner can you guess why your partners havent turned up  no answered the man ill allow that ive been expecting them the last day or two perhaps they couldnt strike your trail and theres a chance that when they made the cache starving they found there wouldnt be grub enough to take them up and down  its possible said andrew and looked at the others though i think weve staked off the best of the vein it seems a pity that you couldnt secure some of the rest  it cant well be done carnally explained a man can locate only one claim on the same lode but if the ore pans out as good as it looks ill be content with the terms you promised me  im the one whos got left turner broke in ive packed your truck and done your hardest work and dont get five cents for it it wouldnt rob you if you let me stake a claim  the difficulty is that youd have to sell it to mappin andrew reminded him  thats so turner admitted if i tried to go back on that man it would be the worse for me the way im fixed is mighty rough  you got your grub said graham you ran a big risk of being left to starve and you might have got shot it strikes me you had better quit mappins service and try how honesty pays  they left camp at sunrise and met with no misadventures on their journey south it was nearly completed and they expected to reach the mine in a few more days when carnally called turner as he was loading the canoe one morning  you can let up on that job we wont want you any more he said bluntly  turner looked at him dismally  are you going to fire me here  youve hit it said carnally well give you grub for two meals and if you hustle you ought to make the camp back at the awkward portage by noon tomorrow youll find a cache with provisions that should last you to the mine by the waters edge as ill give watson orders youre not to have a canoe we should be down at the settlement a week before you get there  well turner acquiesced i guess its no use grumbling  he was leaving the camp when andrew called to him  though i suppose you would have jumped our claim without hesitation i dont want to be too hard and we have found you a useful help if you will call on me at the landing i think i can promise you three dollars for every day you have been with us but its conditional on your playing no tricks  your partner doesnt leave me many chances turner grinned  they launched the canoe and were paddling downstream when carnally alluded to the matter  i dont know that the fellow could make trouble for us but hes safer up here until we get our records filed he said  then he swung his paddle and the canoe drove faster toward a rapid     chapter xxviii  geraldine   on reaching the landing andrew learned that frobisher had returned and he rowed across to visit him it was evening when he disembarked at the little pier geraldine came down across the lawn and andrews heart beat fast as he watched her she was wonderfully graceful he thought her white summer dress and light hat became her there was a tinge of color in her face and she was obviously eager to hear his news she gave him a quick glance before they met and then smiled in cordial welcome for the mans expression was suggestive he had lost his strained and anxious look there was now an assured tranquillity in his bearing he had not come back disappointed and for his sake she rejoiced at this then as she gave him her hand and noticed the eager light in his eyes she grew suddenly disturbed  you have been successful im very glad she said  yes responded andrew holding her hand things have gone well with us but except for the mineral recorder you are the first person ive told the good news to that strikes me as particularly appropriate  why  i dont suppose id ever have found the lode if you hadnt encouraged me i felt daunted once or twice then i ventured to think that youd be interested  i am interested geraldine assured him gently withdrawing her hand you neednt doubt that but wont you come up to the house  andrew laughed with a trace of awkwardness as he realized that he had been standing at the top of the uncomfortably narrow steps by which one reached the pier  it might be better if you and mr frobisher are not engaged  hes writing letters though i think hell have finished soon wherever he is hes generally busy but i can answer for his being glad to see you  thats good to hear im heavily in your fathers debt but id like to think hes not the only one in the family to feel the pleasure  geraldine smiled at him mockingly  how delightfully formal mr allinson besides you seem to need a good deal of assuring  a fair shot andrew laughed im afraid when im really in earnest im apt to be stilted but perhaps it isnt an altogether unusual fault the correct light touch seems hard to acquire  not stilted thats too harsh now and then youre rather too serious  looking at her steadily he saw amusement in her eyes but he had not wit enough to read all it covered and he felt slightly chilled the girl knew his love for her and had thought of him often and anxiously in his absence but now that he had come back safe and successful she was seized by a strange timidity she shrank from the drastic change in their relations which his attitude threatened he must be kept at a distance until she had become more used to the situation  its very possible wouldnt it be pleasanter here he hinted as they approached a seat which stood in the shadow of the firs we might disturb your father by going in  yes geraldine assented somewhat dubiously though the house which faced the west was uncomfortably hot  they sat down and she glanced at him unobtrusively she was now very cool and free from embarrassment while the man seemed to be suffering from constraint moreover he looked disappointed and she felt sorry for him  so you found the lode and recorded your claims she said that must have been a great relief but what will you do next  andrew grew impatient he would have preferred to discuss something more personal than his mining affairs  oh he exclaimed you must have heard enough about the lode to make you tired of it however i expect i shall have to go back to england before long  geraldine wondered whether the curt announcement was meant to alarm her and decided that it was not the man was too modest to make sure of her affection for him nevertheless it caused her some concern  will it be a visit or do you think of staying there she asked  i cant tell said andrew moodily if i can get things straightened up i may come back to the new mine but i shall not know until i arrive  do you wish to come back  yes he answered emphatically very much indeed  then you will no doubt find an excuse for doing so it shouldnt be difficult to a fertile mind  unfortunately mine often seems to suffer from sterility it has been subjected to stimulating influences here and ill miss them on the other side  if needful couldnt you take carnally with you geraldine spoke with a touch of raillery  carnallys useful as far as he goes but im not sure that hed be much help in england and hes not the only person ive so to speak come to lean on  geraldine regarded him with faint amusement  then perhaps its better that all outside support should be withdrawn and you learned to stand on your own feet dont you think you could do so if you made an effort  its possible ive no doubt ill have to try but when its been generously given one gets into a habit of looking for help and applause  thats unfortunate criticisms much more bracing im afraid you havent had enough of it  havent i said andrew i got nothing else at home and its damping to have somebody always ready to point out how much better you might have managed things if i do any good when i get back it will be because of the encouragement ive had here  thats a very poor reason you ought to do what you intend because you feel its right  no doubt said andrew with a stern smile still you see it needs a good deal of nerve  geraldine mused for a few moments he had played up to her as she thought of it but in his halfhumorous manner there had been a touch of gravity and she knew what her commendation had been worth to him she was glad that he valued it but she could not have him guess this and she shrank from showing too much earnestness  well she said the mail must be sent across to the landing soon id better tell my father  she got up and a few minutes afterward frobisher appeared and took andrew to his smokingroom when they had talked for a while andrew took out a few specimens  so far as we were able he said we picked out the best of the lode but i believe much of the ore is of excellent quality i brought you these specimens to look at and the assayers report on those we sent him after the first trip  frobisher examined them with care  a good business proposition this stuff should pay for smelting i suppose you realize that your knowledge of the locality is valuable  thats what i am coming to if the things in your line any information i can give you is at your service  ah said frobisher let us understand each other do you want to sell  not to you we have staked three claims which is all we can legally hold and our records were only filed an hour and a half ago by using my map of our route and a sketch of the vein you or anybody you may send could reach the spot and have some days for prospecting before anybody else could find it  then youre offering me this out of friendship  not altogether i dont forget that you saved us from starving but apart from that id rather have somebody i know as owner of an adjacent claim youll excuse my saying that i cant tolerate mappin there i understand it isnt difficult to get up disputes over boundaries and waterrights and hed find some means of attacking us  youre wise and i appreciate your generosity theres every reason to believe you have put me on to a good thing but im getting too old to make the journey and theres no time to be lost the trouble is to fix on the right men to send because theyll have to be reliable i know two or three boys in colorado who would see the thing through but it would take a week to bring them here and only a british subject can file a record  he broke off and sat silent a few moments i have it he exclaimed theres a fellow at the landing who i think would deal honestly but he must get off with some packers tomorrow if youll excuse me ill go across  andrew went to a writingtable and hastily filled up a sheet of paper then took a map from his pocket and wrote some directions on the back of it  heres an order on watson at the mine for any provisions and tools he can supply it will save your men some transport and that means a quicker journey now listen carefully for a minute  thanks said frobisher when he had finished and left him on the word  andrew laughed as he sat down to finish his cigar the americans promptness was characteristic and he was glad to feel that he had been of some service to him  when he went out he found geraldine on the lawn  what have you told my father she asked he ran past me without speaking and nearly fell into the water as he jumped on board the launch i cant remember having seen him go so fast  perhaps its not surprising i told mr frobisher about the lode and where the best locations were  the information ought to be valuable the ore is rich isnt it  i think so but of course it isnt mine to give away all i did was to give your father some information which should help him to find it before anybody else he means to send up a prospecting party at once  geraldine pondered this the man was too modest to make much of the affair but her fathers eager haste had its significance his judgment on business matters was unusually good and she had no doubt that the minerals were worth locating it was however more important that andrew had been able to place him under an obligation because in a sense his power to confer a favor proved his value she had believed in him from the first but it was pleasant to feel that others must recognize his merits  well she said smiling you have made some progress in his esteem hes inclined to judge people by what they have done and you have found a rich mine  wouldnt it be fairer to judge them by what they would like to do its often better than the other  oh no likings easy one often gets no farther accomplishment is hard but it counts  strolling to the beach they found a seat on the pier there was not a breath of wind and the languid ripples splashed softly on the shingle near the land the dark shadow of the pines floated on the glassy water but farther out it gleamed with silvery light to the west the black rocks and ragged trees cut sharp against a glow of vivid green andrew was silent for a while geraldine had quietly checked him whenever he bordered on the sentimental and it was disconcerting though he felt that it would be wiser to make no effort to come to closer quarters until she tacitly gave him encouragement  what a beautiful country this is he said at length feeling that the topic was safe  yes answered geraldine it is beautiful and rugged very different from your wellcaredfor england and i suppose it gets wilder as you travel north  its the wildness that gets hold of one i dont know when i was so happy as i was when hauling the canoe over portages tracking her up rapids and blowing rocks to bits there must be a primitive strain in us that shows itself in the waste  it may be useful now and then but indulging it doesnt make for progress even our indians have found that out and those who still cling to their primitive customs live miserably in skin tepees by catching fish i dare say any of them could take a canoe up a rapid better than you  theres no doubt of that andrew responded but i dont see your drift  one gets impatient now and then with the cult of the physical which theyre so proud of here its good in a way but it doesnt lead to much for example you cant continue finding valuable claims and there must be something for you to do besides drilling holes for dynamite  shooting pheasants is easier andrew smiled i cant say its more useful  and is there nothing else  andrew grew suddenly thoughtful  ill confess to a hazy idea that if i succeeded in straightening up the allinson affairs id retire from the business while my laurels were fresh and turn miner the claims will need attention and it would be more in my line than the management of the firm  you mean you would like it better  im beginning to understand andrew looked at her gravely if anybody else had hinted as much id have felt it was exacting and i was being driven too hard with you its different once or twice already you have given me the impetus i needed and youre right now but if im not required by allinsons why shouldnt i attend to the claims  looking up he saw the launch which had rounded a neighboring islet heading for the pier and shortly afterward frobisher joined them  ive got everything fixed he said jubilantly three men will start at sunrise but you look as if you had been discussing something important whats it all about  give us your opinion father mr allinson seems to think he can make a few drastic reforms in his firm and then leave such matters alone my idea is that he will find it harder than he expected  frobisher laughed with quiet amusement  mr allinson has still a good deal to learn and im afraid hes much mistaken in this matter he turned to andrew once you take an active interest in a big business youll find you cant let go instead of your directing the concern it will come to own and drive you unmercifully hard for the last ten years ive been trying to take life easier and escape from the pressure of affairs but im still a long way from doing so in fact in spite of my good resolutions its only an hour since i launched out on another new venture  isnt it largely a matter of temperament andrew asked  no doubt but not quite in the way you thinkthat is its not always a question of making money if a man has what well call the constructive genius he cant stand and look on when he sees anything that needs to be done he feels that he must take his coat off and get to work  andrew had an uncomfortable feeling that geraldine and her father were right one thing led to another and he might be drawn irresistibly into a long series of business complications which was by no means what he had at first contemplated nevertheless if his services were of any value allinsons had the first claim on them he dismissed the matter when frobisher suggested that they go in to supper frobisher was witty geraldine charmingly cordial and it was with regret that andrew took his leave geraldine walked to the pier with him and he noticed a gentleness in her face that set his heart to beating he thought the soft dusk emphasized her beauty by etherealizing it when they reached the steps she turned to him with a smile  i feel as if id presumed too far she said after all im only a girl and younger than you are which doesnt seem to justify my imposing my halfformed views on you  i dont think that matters returned andrew i believe those views are right  then though you had better test them thoroughly you dont feel offended  i am grateful but theres one point that disturbs me i shouldnt like to think you were reconciled to the idea of getting rid of me  geraldine smiled at him  that would be a wrong conclusion if its any comfort we shall miss you but it isnt such a very long journey from england to the lake of shadows you will find it needful to come over and see how the mines are working now and then  whether the mines need me or not i shall come  she gave him her hand  well consider it a promise but youre not going yet and you neednt neglect us before you start  when she turned away andrew got into his canoe and paddled back to the landing he had he felt been firmly held off at arms length but for all that he had noticed faint hints of tenderness in the girls manner which were highly encouraging and she undoubtedly took a strong interest in him he must proceed cautiously and avoid alarming her by being precipitate that after all was the course he preferred for he was strangely diffident in love  a day or two later he saw turner in the bar at the hotel where several others were lounging but the man gave him a careless greeting andrew went into the lobby and turner presently sauntered in  can you come down to the beach behind the sawmill dump in a few minutes he asked  andrew nodded and when turner went out he put some bills into his wallet and made for the beach it was a quiet place hidden between a rocky head and a bank of sawdust and turner was waiting for him  i suppose you have come for the money i promised you andrew said  thats not the only thing though id be glad to have it  andrew counted out several bills  i didnt want to be seen talking to you at the hotel turner explained it mightnt have been safe for me if mappin got to hear of it but theres something you ought to know the boys he sent after you heard about the strike you made when they came down here for grub and are on the trail again  i dont see how that matters when mappins rascals reach the lode theyll find we have staked off the best and it looks as if every man about the settlement who can get away is going up to prospect  those fellows persisted turner are old hands at the game i dont know their plans but theres one thing you can depend onthey mean to make trouble they might shift some of your stakes and then claim that your record wasnt correct which would give mappin a chance of getting after you it takes a smart surveyor to lay out boundaries and frontage in such a way that they cant be questioned i want to warn you to be on the lookout  andrew considered he knew there was sometimes litigation over mineral claims and he had to deal with a clever and unscrupulous man  i wonder why you told me this  you treated me like a white man turner answered with a trace of awkwardness and then broke into a grin besides i was getting tired of the business anyhow there wasnt a dollar in it for me now i guess ill light out before somebody comes along  andrew thanked him and then went off in search of carnally feeling glad that he had treated turner leniently the man was a rogue but he had the virtue of gratitude     chapter xxix  the jumpers   the sun was rising when joe thorpe made a hasty breakfast with his two companions in their camp beside the lode he was a logger by profession though he had an extensive experience in prospecting for timberrights and minerals big joe was known as an honest man that was why frobisher had selected him to stake off a claim and he had arrived late on the previous night after a forced march  we ought to have a clear day or two before the first of the crowd thats following us comes in but thats all he said we want to get our prospecting done and the best locations picked before the rush begins and well start as soon as youve finished  ill be through in a minute said one of the others with his mouth full its a pretty fair deal frobisher made with us and hes not the man to go back on one  thats more than id say of mappin remarked the third of the party hes in this somehow isnt he what was it carnally said to you when we were getting ready to start joe  told me to watch out for the mappin crowd it seems mappins put scaith who made the trouble over the newark timberrights on to the job the fellows a crook and two of the others have been mixed up in jumping rows now we like carnally and he allowed he was on to a good thing in the allinson claims anyhow watkins youve had enough for one man let up on the pork and bring along the drill  they set to work and it was late in the afternoon when stripped to shirt and trousers and dripping with perspiration joe stopped for a few moments to look about thirty feet behind him the creek swirled furiously around a rocky head the steep face of which was fumed and scarred by giantpowder a stake was driven into the crest of the promontory another could be seen a short distance back and straggling jackpines and spruces followed the edge of the bank the ground had been disturbed all round and was strewn with piles of soil and stones  i guess the allinson outfit know their business he observed it looks a curious way to pitch a claim but if you come to figure out the thing it gives them the best frontage they could get this corner posts just where id have put it if theyd located it a bit to the right it would have swung their line off the richest stuff theres no room for us here on pay dirt well move higher up  he took a few steps forward but stopped suddenly at a sharp crash followed by a puff of vapor that curled up among the rocks ahead great fragments leaped out of it and joe ran for his life as one large piece that turned over as it sped came toward him it fell short with a heavy thud and he swung around angrily  what in thunder are you firing two sticks for where you werent told he cried  watkins likes a big charge grinned his companion hes surely rough on giantpowder  the third man came toward them and explained  that blamed allinson corner post shoves us back and i wanted to see if we could squeeze in a block beside them and keep on the ore though i guess theres not much use in it if i was a jumper id shift that stake  you cant do it joe replied promptly were acting square but when the fumes have cleared well look at what youve got  the examination confirmed his opinion that they were shut out by the allinson claim which must be respected and they moved farther up the lode it was dusk when they stopped work and they spent the following morning digging holes and firing shots before deciding on their locations these they roughly marked with piles of stones but there were distances to be carefully measured and bearings verified before their stakes were driven and while they were getting dinner another party arrived the men were ragged and weary and the appearance of several was far from prepossessing  theres scaith and nepigon jim watkins exclaimed brought four other fellows with them theyre a toughlooking crowd  the newcomers lighted a fire and while they prepared a meal their leader strolled across to the other camp he was a short wiry man with keen eyes  well joe he said youve been over the ground whats it like  pretty good joe answered the allinson gang got first pick and weve had the next but theres plenty pay dirt left i suppose youre up here for mappin you want to keep off our blocks  sure we will said the other genially well take a look round after grub and see where we can begin you got away from the landing mighty smart  we wanted to keep ahead of the crowd i suppose the boys were getting ready when you left  they were quitting work all round the settlement one or two outfits would get off soon after us we made pretty good time over the allinson trail but i guess our dinners ready  he moved away and joe turned to his companions with a meaning glance  thats a man wholl want some watching he warned them  during the afternoon he and the others drove in their stakes and there was apparently nothing to prevent their return to record the claims but joe declared that he was tired and they would not get far enough before dark to make it worth while to start accordingly they lounged in camp while the newcomers wandered about the neighborhood testing the ground it struck joe as suspicious that they seemed to find it necessary to cross the allinson claims very frequently toward evening the sky grew overcast and rain began to fall but joes camp was sheltered and when it grew cold after supper they made a bigger fire  some of the boys from the settlement should get through by morning and theyre a straight crowd joe said well take the trail first thing after breakfast  a raw wind sprang up the rain got heavier and dusk fell early but when the others went to sleep joe sat up a while he had done what he had been sent to do and would receive a good reward for it besides retaining an interest in the claims when frobisher took them over after the development work had been done the thought of it excited him but after a while he laid his blanket in a hollow and went to sleep  it was however not sound sleep for every now and then he opened his eyes and at last raised himself to a sitting position and looked about the fire had burned very low so that its light did not dazzle him and he could see the shadowy trunks that ran up into the gloom heavy drops fell among the red embers the wind wailed dolefully about the branches and he could hear the rain beat upon the stones though it was darker than usual the sky was visible and rocks and trees stood out black against the surrounding obscurity knowing that he had a long march before him joe felt irritated because of his restlessness but as he did not feel at all sleepy he lighted his pipe and began to think of his return journey  presently scaiths campfire caught his eye it was burning brightly which seemed to indicate that the party had sat up very late or that somebody had risen and thrown on fresh fuel this struck him as curious and he watched the flickering glow before he had smoked out his pipe he imagined that he saw a blurred figure among the smoke it vanished though he did not think the fellow had left the camp he sat for a few minutes pondering the matter although they had given him no reason for doing so he suspected scaiths party and felt uneasy wishing that the night were clearer large objects were faintly distinguishable but joe did not think he could see a man except at a very short distance and the wind among the spruce tops would prevent his hearing footsteps it was raining very hard trickles of water ran down the trunks and cold draughts eddied about him he would be more comfortable lying down under his blanket but he was troubled by vague suspicions and felt that he must keep watch  at last he got up and picked his way toward the newly staked claims the ground was rough and he fell over a heap of stones but he reflected that the darkness which prevented his seeing anything would also prevent his being seen he had flung his blanket over his shoulders and though it impeded his movements it kept him drier he wandered about for some time before he could find the first stake but it was easier afterward because he knew the line and had only to count his paces the other posts were all in their proper positions it looked as if he had wasted his pains for no attempt had been made to tamper with the boundaries  this was satisfactory but joe did not feel quite at ease he wished that some of the other parties from the landing had arrived because he knew the men and knew that they would keep a keen lookout for any trickery claimjumping is sternly discountenanced by honest miners who are apt to deal with the jumpers in a drastic manner joe however could not delay his departure the filing of an application form in the recorders office is the first proof a discoverer of minerals can advance of his right to them  he stopped a few moments by the last stake feeling that he could now return to camp but still irresolute it would be dark for some time yet and mischief might be on foot then it dawned on him that the allinson claims would be better worth attacking than his and he moved toward the corner post which was the key to their position their safety was no direct concern of his and he was getting wet but carnally was his friend and allinson was held in much esteem at the landing as a just and considerate employer with difficulty he found the post which seemed to have been undisturbed but he felt suspicious and reluctant to leave the spot finding a hollow to lee of a rock he sat down  for a while nothing disturbed him he could hear the creek roaring among the stones below for the steep edge of the bank was only a few yards away scaiths fire glowed in the distance and the rain blew in sheets past the edge of his shelter joe thought he was foolish for waiting but he stayed then all at once a dim figure was outlined against the sky only a few paces from him  joe had heard nobody approach and he was startled but the next moment he became cool and intent a man was moving toward the allinson corner post he had his hands on it when joe sprang forward but he was too late to surprise the fellow joe closed with him in a savage grapple but he could not throw him and glancing sideways at a sound he saw that he would shortly have to deal with a second enemy another man was running hard toward them  it was obvious that he would be overpowered unless he could disable the fellow he had seized before his confederate arrived and with a tense effort he drove him backward clutching each other they staggered a few yards through the darkness until joe felt the ground slant sharply beneath his feet then using all his force he flung off his adversary the man disappeared and there was a splash in the creek below then joe turned breathlessly to meet the other man  he was near at hand but instead of attacking him the fellow stopped and cried out this however did not trouble joe because the shout would bring his companions upon the scene as well as the other party moving cautiously in search of clearer ground on which to meet the rush he expected his foot caught in his blanket which had fallen off and he swiftly picked it up he had hardly done so when the fellow ran at him and joe meeting him with a staggering blow flung the heavy blanket over his head he stumbled unable to see and joe leaping upon him bore him to the ground there he had the advantage of being uppermost and getting his knee on the others chest managed to hold him down this was satisfactory so far as it went but he did not know what to do with his captive and shouts now broke out in the darkness the rest of scaiths friends were evidently coming to the rescue but he could hear watkins voice and wondered anxiously which would arrive first  he spent a minute or two holding the fellow down and thumping him as a hint to keep still while hurrying footsteps rapidly drew nearer a voice he did not know reached him and he remembered that although there was a rifle in camp he was unarmed and if he stuck to his prisoner there would be two of his friends to four of scaiths that was long odds it looked as if he must be driven off the field but he determined to give the other side all the trouble he could  a moment or two later a man appeared  scaith he called and the fellow under the blanket struggled as if he had heard  quit it warned joe striking him hard and then shouted stand off before you get hurt  the newcomer stopped no doubt trying to make out the meaning of what he indistinctly saw and joe hearing two or three more running did not get up if the fellow attacked him he would resist but he wished to keep his captive out of action as long as possible they waited both expecting help until watkins and the third of joes party came upon the scene behind them appeared three others and both parties paused in the darkness it was difficult to discover what was going on  wheres our boss the first of the strangers asked  i cant say joe answered one of your crowds in the gulch and ive another here wholl sure get damaged if he dont keep still i dont know which is which  scaiths friends seemed disconcerted at the news  whats to be done about it joe watkins broke in  well said joe coolly i guess well give them a chance to quit he addressed the opposite party you had better look for your partner boys therell be no stakes pulled up tonight  we can wipe you out was the answer weve got a gun  sove we replied watkins ive got something else that will fix you as quick get a hustle on weve no use for jumpers  nobody stirred joe knew that he must confine himself to a defensive course scaiths was the stronger party but they were apparently daunted by the loss of their leader  you want to be reasonable argued one what were out for has nothing to do with you this isnt your claim  were going to watch it joe said  run them off cried one of the others weve talked enough  they seemed ready for a rush and watkins quickly struck a match in the shelter of his jacket the next moment a slight hissing became audible and he held up something which emitted small red sparks  i guess you know what this is he remarked the fuse is pretty short and theres a stick of giantpowder at the end of it you had better quit before i pitch it into the midst of you he added sharply get up joe  they were startled by his coldblooded daring and though it may have been discharged by accident a pistol flashed then as joe sprang to his feet watkins yelled in mockery and flung the dynamite cartridge into the air a train of sparks marked its flight but the others did not wait and while joe and his comrades ran off there was a flash and a detonation  it was followed by a shout some distance off and a sound of men running hard joe called his friends back it was not scaiths party he heard the footsteps were too numerous  whats the trouble somebody shouted  jumpers joe answered and turned to his companions its the first of the boys up from the settlement  in a minute or two the newcomers arrived and joe explained the matter  we were making for your fire when we heard the shot and hastened on our fastest hustle said one now well go along and bounce the blamed jumpers out  dawn was breaking when they reached scaiths camp they found several men very busy but they stopped a moment when the party came up  you have to get off the ground ordered one of the men from the landing the sooner you quit the better for you  were going was the sullen answer i reckon we know when youve got the best of us  then said the other man well wait till you startand we wont wait long  shortly afterward scaiths party took the trail to the south and as there were six of them joe concluded that his first assailant had not been seriously damaged by his fall into the ravine when they had gone one of the new arrivals turned to joe  carnally and graham should be here before night he said they were getting ready to come up when we left jake allowed he wanted to be on the ground     chapter xxx  the eve of battle   it was evening when the big liner which had left montreal at daybreak steamed slowly past the ramparts of quebec the roar of her whistle echoing among the rocks the tide which had floated her across the shoals of lake st peter was running low the great river was unruffled and andrew leaned on her saloondeck rails watching the city open up as she swung inshore with the slack stream behind the wharves and warehouses at the waterside old buildings and loftier modern ones stores banks and churches rose in picturesque confusion tier above tier to the heights girdled by dufferin avenue and the huge frontenac hotel it struck him as a beautiful city viewed from the river but it bore an exotic stamp in spite of the sooty smoke of the locomotives and the rattle of steamboat winches it had a stronger resemblance to the old romantic towns of france than the business centers of essentially modern canada  a feeble scream answered the sonorous whistle and the engines stopped for a few minutes as a tug steamed out from the wharf she brought a dozen passengers besides a number of mailbags and when she cast off the screw throbbed again and the liner forged ahead it was with mixed feelings that andrew watched the city drop behind and the white thread of montmorency falls disappear behind a long green island beyond it the river widened the shores were falling back and dusk was creeping across the oily water open sea was still far away but andrew felt that he had parted from canada and though he was going home with his work successfully done the thought filled him with wistful regret in spite of many hardships and difficulties he had been happy in the northern wilds and happier with geraldine by the lake of shadows he meant to come back when he had finished his fight for allinsons and he thrilled as he wondered how geraldine would welcome him she had given him a gracious farewell and her sincere good wishes but she had with gentle firmness prevented his making any direct appeal this he determined should not be the same again when he returned she should hear him out but there was still much to be done before he could prove his right to claim her for the possibility of ignominious failure confronted him  before the next few weeks had passed he might be beaten and discreditedjeered at as a rash fool who undertaking a task beyond his powers had brought disaster upon those he meant to benefit and wrecked an honored firm but apart from such considerations he knew that he had turned his back upon the strenuous life of the wilderness even if he returned to the lode for a month or two he would travel by wellmarked roads surrounded by some degree of civilized comfort there would be no more of the zest of the unknown trail the charm of the lonely north would be broken by the crash of machinery and the voices of busy men  the dinner bugle broke his reverie and when he was leaving the saloon a steward gave him a letter the tender had brought recognizing carnallys writing he opened it eagerly in a quiet corner of the smokingroom and as he read it he felt a faint envy of his comrade who was using pick and powder in the wilds this however gave place to more practical considerations carnally related the jumpers defeat which he described as mappins last attempt to trouble them the claims he said were safe from any fresh attack and there was a marked improvement in the ore as they opened up the lode he thought andrew could devote himself to his english business with undisturbed confidence  andrew realized that the latter would need all his attention and during the short voyage he had little to say to his fellowpassengers revolving schemes in his mind he found weak points in all of them for it was a serious problem he had to attack he could see several ways of regulating the rain bluff companys affairs if leonard would agree and he could bring charges against his brotherinlaw which would cost him his relatives support but this course was not admissible leonard must be deprived of all control over allinsons but it must be done without suspicion being cast upon the integrity of the firm that would be difficult then florences position required thought andrew wished the unraveling of the matter had been left to somebody else with more tact and acuteness but it was his duty and he must do the best he could  on landing he traveled straight to london and after taking a room at a hotel went on foot to the allinson offices it was a sultry day with rain at intervals the streets were miry and smoke thickened the listless air as he walked eastward along the strand the roar of traffic jarred on his ears and he noticed the streaky grime on the wet buildings but it was the intent pallid faces of the passersby that impressed him most when he approached the city some were pinched and hungrily eager some were gross and fleshy but the steady direct frankness of the canadian glance was missing and there was a more marked difference in the movements of andrews city countrymen all were in a hurry bolting into and out of dingy offices but they had not the free virile grace of the men who followed the lonely canadian trails nor had they so far as their expressions hinted the optimistic cheerfulness that is common in the west  though he was glad to be at home andrew was sensible of a faint depression the people he saw about him were those he would henceforward work among he must change the drill and canoe paddle for the pen and breathe the close air of offices instead of the fragrance of the pines had the option been his he would have turned away from the city but as the head of allinsons he was not free to choose doggedly as when he had followed the frozen trail on a morsel of food he held on eastward past the law courts  at the office he learned that leonard was away at a german health resort but would be back in a few days and that florence was staying at ghyllside andrew was sorry for florence and felt guilty when he thought of her though she had always taken her husbands view and refused to consider him a person of any importance she was his eldest sister had she been less prejudiced she might have helped him to come to some understanding with leonard which would have prevented a direct conflict but he feared he could look only for opposition and bitterness next he learned that the rain bluff shareholders meeting which he had suggested had been fixed for an unexpectedly early date he surmised that leonard having his plans ready meant to get them adopted before his own were prepared  summoning sharpe the elderly chief accountant who had served his father andrew spent some hours with him mastering so far as possible the state of the firms affairs with a few exceptions they were prospering there was no doubt that in a sense leonard had done his work well in particular the returns from foreign ventures were excellent and though sharpe could not tell him precisely how the profits had been made andrew with wider knowledge on some points could guess he feared that a full explanation would not redound to the honor of the firm he knew of lands to which allinsons money had been sent where the high interest was wrung out of subject races with fiendish cruelty  at last when the electric lights were burning in the lavishlydecorated office sharpe closed his books  i think that is all i can tell you mr allinson he said on the whole i venture to believe you must find our position eminently satisfactory the one weak point if i may say so is the rain bluff mine you will have seen that the shares are quoted down  ive noticed it whats the reason the directors wouldnt let any information that might have a depressing effect leak out  there has been some selling sharpe answered with a shrug its possible that things have been kept too close a little encouraging news given to the press now and then goes a long way but silence tends to uneasiness he hesitated i suppose i must not ask about the companys prospects until you have met the board  you have been investing  sharpe admitted it  i bought in the open market with no favor shown the firm has treated me liberally but i may have to make room for a younger man by and by and i had two boys to start one at law the other as surgeon but they are only beginning to stand on their own feet and it was a drain what was left went into the rain bluff i felt i was safe in a venture organized by us  he looked at andrew eagerly but for a few moments the latter mused it was he thought such men as this old servant patient highly trained toilers who would have been hardest hit by the failure of the mine when he answered his expression was unusually grave  i think i can say that you have no cause for anxiety  thank you said sharpe your assurance is a great relief i wonder whether i may mention that you have your fathers manner it was his habit to make a curt statement without an explanation but it always carried weight you remind me of him strongly though i never noticed the resemblance until today  you have paid me a sincere compliment said andrew quietly  he spent the evening studying figures in his hotel with no thought of the attractions the city had to offer and the next day he proceeded to call on as many of the rain bluff directors as he could find in their offices they were city men ignorant of any but the financial side of mining and he saw that the first two regarded him as an inexperienced meddler these he thought had been given a hint by leonard though he did not question their honesty another insisted on talking about canadian sport with the fixed impression that he had really gone out to shoot and fish and andrew abandoned the attempt to undeceive him the fourth however heard what he had to say with close attention  to divulge this news would bring about a dangerous crisis he warned andrew i must strongly urge you to consult with hathersage and defer any mention of new arrangements until after the meeting  then i should have you gentlemen united against me  you do us injustice rahway protested on some of the points involved our judgment is necessarily better than yours and we would no doubt insist on following it but you will not find us neglectful of the real interests of the company  they can be served only by a radical change of plans as it stands the company is rotten  grave language mr allinson  its warranted you must submit a report to the shareholders is it prepared  the director handed him some sheets of paper which andrew studied with rising indignation  i recognize hathersages work he exclaimed theres no hint of the difficulties that confront us he wrote this  its a draft i have just received from him  and after what ive told you about the mine you think it should stand  rahway looked disturbed with a few exceptions i must say that i do you are new to these matters and dont realize how undesirable it is that we should make our troubles public give us time to consider and mature fresh schemes and if matters are really so serious as they seem to you we may find some judicious remedy undue haste can only have disastrous results  andrew lost his patience  you want to tinker with the situation to keep the shareholders in the dark while you try to patch up a tottering concern its an impossible course the truth must be faced boldly and the company reorganized from the start  if that is so it must be done by the directors with great caution i must beg you not to force our hands  well replied andrew i have nothing more to say i shall attend the meeting and do what seems advisable  he left the office convinced that he could take only a bold independent course for no help could be expected from the men he had called on leonards influence over them could not be combated he thought they might honestly doubt that the state of affairs was as serious as he had represented but if they were convinced of this their chief desire would be to keep the mine going long enough to save their credit and to make disclosure gradually he was glad he had told them nothing about the richness of the graham lode and that the claims on it were held under his personal control on reaching his hotel he wrote to the directors he had not been able to see though he did not expect much result from this and the next morning he left for his home  though he had a cordial welcome he did not explain his plans to his relatives and florence seemed to regard him with suspicion a week later leonard came down to take her home and asked for a private interview after dinner on the night of his arrival andrew went with him to the library and waited calmly until he began  we must understand each other leonard said i hear you have found the lode will you tell me your plans  not to begin with i want some information about yours first no doubt mappin cabled you news of our discovery  he did i might retort that you have seen my colleagues and tried to gain them over in my absence instead of waiting for my return but that is not an important matter what is it you wish to know  andrews voice was quietly steady as he asked the test question upon which their future relations turned  do you mean to submit the report to the rain bluff shareholders as it stands  yes leonard answered curtly and andrew knew that there could be no compromise it was now a trial of strength one of them must be driven off the field  knowing it to be misleading he said very well i cant prevent its issue i suppose you have heard that your confederate has been beaten in what must be his last attempt to thwart me  i heard that an attempt had been made to jump the companys claims  my claims said andrew  the companys i think you were our representative when you found them  well let that go its not a point thats likely to be raised  as the question of the ownership of the claims seemed to be of importance leonard looked puzzled  oh well he said ive told you that if needful mappin must be sacrificed  that is not what you told him you must have meant to trick one of us or play false to both  i cant tolerate such words  leonard lost the indulgent air he had so far assumed and andrew leaning forward with elbows on the table fixed his eyes on him  well drop all disguises you have plotted against me ever since i went to canada and im showing you more consideration than you deserve in speaking of these things in private instead of before the family it is for florences sake im doing so he raised his hand let me finish you would have ruined the rain bluff company sooner than allow me to reorganize it you conspired with mappin to starve me and my friends to death  leonard sat back in his chair with a harsh laugh  that is ridiculous if we are to talk the matter out try to be calm ill admit that i would have been glad to prevent your wasting the companys time and money on an absurd adventure and gave mappin a hint to that effect if he went farther for his own ends im not responsible  id like to believe that you speak the truth apart from this you have persuaded the directors that my suggestions are not to be considered seriously and whats worse you have from the beginning prejudiced my relatives against me its your doing that they think me a fool  a smile crept into leonards eyes  it looks as if you mean to force a quarrel he said  in a sense youre right we cant go on as we have been doing  very well what do you suggest  in the first place i ask for your resignation from the rain bluff board that shouldnt be difficult you have been selling your shares  leonard considered for a minute  i might agree three of the directors must retire and the company isnt likely to prosper if you get control  i understand your reasons the concern has got into trouble for which im to be held responsible and you clear out because you find it impossible to curb my recklessness you expect to save your credit in that way  have it so if you like said leonard coolly  his answer convinced andrew that leonard did not know of the richness of the lode andrew thought he had honestly disbelieved in it and mappin who had informed him of its discovery which had not yet been widely mentioned in the canadian papers might not have made him understand its importance indeed it was possible that mappin meant to throw over his english confederate  i have another demand to make i want your consent to a dissolution of your partnership in allinsons  leonard started and his face grew hard though it seemed impossible that andrew whom he had genuinely looked down on should urge the matter  this is too much he exclaimed have you lost your senses  i think not you have betrayed the trust my father had in you you have started allinsons on a downward course that you have with the exception of the rain bluff speculation so far made money for the firm does not count because you cant continue doing so theres a code of business morality they are not fools in the city and your methods would be found out then the reputation we trade upon would be gone but enough of this put your price on your position and ill pay it if possible  leonard clenched his hands  no he answered i hold my place you cannot get rid of me  is that your last word  yes ive tried to be forbearing but you push me too hard it has come to an open fight which may as well begin at the shareholders meeting i shall not resign from the board  it was bound to come said andrew we know how we stand  leonard rose  florence and i leave tomorrow there is no train tonight  that must be as you wish responded andrew as he went out  half an hour later florence found him on the terrace her face was flushed and her eyes were angry  andrew she cried do you mean to persist in this madness shall i try to make peace with leonard before it is too late  im sorry its too late already i cant think he sent you  no i came because i felt i must cant you see that you are bent on ruining yourself and bringing discredit on the firm  i think not but its a point on which we cant agree i cant blame you for taking leonards side  oh she cried try to be sensible think how leonard has developed the business and earned the money that you have spent try to remember all you owe to him  a queer smile crept into andrews eyes he knew what he owed to leonard but florence must not guess she should keep her faith in her husband if she could  at the worst he would leave the firm with a very much larger capital than when he joined it and there are no doubt other firms which would welcome him  florence turned upon him with a mocking laugh  but leonard is not going to leave the firm tell me for one thing why you wish him to  it was far from andrews intention that she should ever learn  well he said slowly our views are so different on almost every point that its impossible we should get on im very sorry florence but you cant mend the matter the split was inevitable  and you venture to set your immature judgment against leonards  im forced to dont say any more florence i suppose the thing must trouble you forgive me if you can  ill try when you have found out your folly she said and left him     chapter xxxi  allinsons makes good   it was with a strange sense of detachment that andrew attended the first meeting of the shareholders in the rain bluff mine he had thought of the event with great anxiety made numerous plans and abandoned them and now he had come in a sense unprepared determined to submit two general propositions and let the shareholders decide for themselves ignorant of the usual mode of procedure at such meetings he had consulted nobody better informed and realized that he might be ruled out of order or shouted down but he was sensible of a coolness that somewhat surprised him  the room hired for the occasion was large and handsome with a floor of inlaid hardwood frescoed walls and lofty roof it had something of the look of a chapel at one end a group of wellgroomed frockcoated directors were seated at a fine oak table with the companys secretary behind an array of books and papers all that the eye rested on suggested stable prosperity for leonard knew the effect that imposing surroundings had on the small provincial investor it would be difficult for inexperienced and unorganized malcontents to disregard the air of severe formality which he meant to cast over the proceedings  andrew missed nothing as he entered to face a crisis had a steadying effect on him and his manner was very tranquil as he walked up the long room  carefully scanning the assembled shareholders he surmised from their dress and appearance that a number of them were people of small means from country towns there were a few women who looked nervous as if they felt themselves out of place he was surprised to see gertrude and mrs fenwood and then as his glance roved farther he caught sight of wannop who gave him an encouraging grin robert allinson was nearby looking unusually grave but murray caught andrews eye and smiled on the whole he was glad that he had made no attempt to win over his relatives since his return it was better that they should judge and vote like the rest of the shareholders then as he took his place he looked at his fellowdirectors whom he had not seen since his futile interviews they wore an air of staid formality and he suspected that before the meeting was finished they would regard him as a traitor to his class but that did not matter he had given them their opportunity and they would not seize it leonard dressed with fastidious taste looked as usual suave and wellbred but the quick glance he gave andrew seemed to hint at anxiety  he made a short speech calculated to reassure but containing very little definite information his audience listened in an apathetic manner and it struck andrew that a curious matteroffact dullness characterized the proceedings leonard stated that the business of the meeting was to adopt the report and elect new members of the board in place of those who retired though they were he added eligible for reelection then there was a discordant note for a short man in badly cut clothes with spectacles and upstanding red hair rose in the body of the hall  i take it that our chairman has made an error he said our business is to consider the report not necessarily to adopt it  that is correct said leonard smiling we invite your best consideration i will now ask the secretary to read the document  the secretary did so in a monotonous voice as if it were a matter which must be got through with out of respect to custom and andrew felt that it would be a bold shareholder who ventured to disturb the tranquillity of the meeting moreover he recognized the cleverness of the report it said a good deal that was not to the point and avoided every loophole for adverse criticism there was only one weak spotno dividend was declared though it was hinted that a satisfactory profit might be anticipated when the companys property had been further developed  somebody proposed that it be adopted a seconder appeared and then while andrew felt that his time to speak had come the short man with the red hair got up again  i move as an amendment that the report be held over until we are supplied with more details he said what i want to know iswhy there is no dividend and when we may expect one  one or two of the directors looked supercilious the others amused and leonard smiled indulgently he was used to dealing with objectors  the question he explained is complicated but i think we have answered it already i may add that it is unreasonable to expect a dividend on the first years operations preliminary expenses are large and a mine is not like a factory the ground must so to speak be cleared before you can get to work headings must be driven and timbered pumps and machines of various kinds have to be put up  were you ever in a mine the redhaired man interrupted amid some laughter  i hardly think that is to the point leonard answered lightly though i must admit that i have not been down a shaft i have a knowledge of the commercial side of the subject which is all that concerns me  so i thought exclaimed the other you cant know much about your work unless you have put up pitprops and used the pick now the chairman of a mining company ought  he was interrupted by cries of sit down and some ironical encouragement and leonard frowned it might be dangerous to allow the meeting to get out of hand and this troublesome fellow was giving andrew of whom he was half afraid his opportunity  may i inquire whether the gentleman is a practical miner himself one of the directors interposed  i was when i was young now i keep a shop and deal with pitmen but i came here expecting to be told about a dividend i put three hundred pounds into the company because lawyer jesmond said one could rely on anything that was started by allinsons the money wasnt easily saved but there was no opening in my businesswhat with the cooperatives cutting into a small mans trade  thats enough said somebody and there was a shout of dont waste our time but the shopkeeper sturdily stood his ground  im not here for myself alone he resumed i came up by excursion to speak for other people in our town jesmond did their business and he said  there was loud interruption the meeting was getting unruly but wannops voice broke through the uproar  go on man  i mean to replied the speaker calmly whats more i have signed proxies in my pocket to be filled up as i think fit  its doubtful how far thats in order the secretary objected  let him fill them up by all means exclaimed a stockjobber ironically if all his friends gave him proxies they wouldnt count for much there are individual holders present whose votes  he broke off at a touch from a neighbor and andrew cast a keen glance at the quieter portion of the audience it was composed of city men who seemed inclined to support the directors they were perhaps not satisfied with the report for several had been whispering together but andrew thought they would prefer to avoid a disturbance and disclosures that might injure the company if the meeting could be got through safely they could afterward sell out at once and cut their loss andrews sympathies however were strongly with such investors as the determined shopkeeper he could imagine the patient drudgery and careful frugality which had enabled them to buy their shares  i must ask the gentleman to find a seconder for his motion leonard broke in  there was a pause and the shopkeeper looked eagerly round the hall where he seemed to have no friends then andrew got up and quietly faced the assembly  i second the amendment he said  a murmur of astonishment greeted the speech  a director exclaimed somebody and a whisper ran through the hall mr allinsonthe companys agent in canada  deep silence followed and andrew saw that every eye was fixed on him he was acting against all precedentopposing his colleagues on the board who were in a manner entitled to his support  i suppose im taking an unusual line in offering the gentleman who has been speaking information which the chairman has refused him he said he asked when he might expect a dividend the answer isnever unless a radical change is made in the companys policy  the plain words made a sensation and after an impressive pause an uproar began  what about the prospectus with your name on it  what changes would you make  keep quiet and let him speak  no its a case of collusion theres some trick in it  the meeting raged confusedly until leonard got up he looked shaken by the storm of indignation  order gentlemen there is a motion before you  the amendment first somebody shouted  the amendment said leonard a show of hands will serve that the report be held over pending the furnishing of further details  the audience appeared to be unanimous as the hands went up and leonard sought to turn the matter to his advantage  carried he said we will now adjourn the meeting until the information which is asked for can be supplied  that andrew stated firmly is not needful i can give now an accurate outline of the companys position  the secretary protested that this was informal and one of the directors requested leonard to rule it out of order but the meeting had got beyond the chairmans control there were poor men present who thought they had lost their all as well as rich men who believed they had been deceived and leonards words were greeted with angry clamor  murray jumped to his feet  i suggest that we hear mr allinson we will learn the truth from him he said  let him speak shouted some one  andrew standing very still and intent of face raised his hand and the turmoil ceased  i ask your attention first i must show you the worst of things as i learned it on the spot in canada the mine is threatened with inundation which can be prevented only by the use of powerful pumping machinery the rock is unusually broken up and faulty which necessitates expensive timbering and impedes the work these difficulties however need not be enlarged upon because if the quality of the ore justified it they could be overcome instead i will tell you roughly how much capital we have expended the quantity of ore raised the cost of its extraction and the value of the yield in refined metal  he quoted from his notebook and there was a strange quietness as he proceeded  though the figures might be challenged and slightly modified by experts the conclusion is inevitablethe ore turned out at the rain bluff can pay only a small interest on the cost of labor the capital spent in acquiring the mine has irretrievably gone  then the storm broke questions reproaches and insulting epithets were hurled at the directors some of whom tried to smile forbearingly while others grew red and leonard sat grim and silent with his hand clenched andrew waited unmoved and seized on a pause to continue  there is every reason to believe that your directors acted as they thought in your interests but they have been misled  so have we exclaimed a furious investor  im afraid thats true andrew agreed its an important point but i must ask you to consider the remedies in the first place i will if necessary redeem every rain bluff share which has been allotted that is my brokers will buy up all that are brought to them  he was heard with astonishment some of those present knew a good deal about commercial companies but that a director of one should make such an offer was unprecedented in their experience on the surface it was surprisingly fair but they suspected a trick  at what price cried one the shares will fall to a few shillings as soon as the truth about the mine is known  at par said andrew you will be returned every penny you have paid in  it was obvious that the greater part of his audience did not know what to make of this that he should be in earnest scarcely seemed possible as his offer seemed the extremity of rashness no one spoke for a moment or two and then robert allinson rose  if any guarantee is needed i shall be glad to supply it so far as my means allow my name is allinson a member of the family controlling the firm which promoted this company i may perhaps remark without undue pride that it is a point of honor with allinsons to keep its promises  bravo bob cried a loud hearty voice  i think said robert in a tone of grave rebuke that is not altogether seemly at a public meeting  wannop got up with a laugh in which a number of the listeners joined  and i am prepared to back my relative andrew allinson to my last shillingin which mrs wannop joins me between us we hold a good deal of stock  there was applause mixed with expressions of relief but some still suspected knavery  what is mr allinsons object a man blurted out what does he expect to gain  andrew flushed but answered quietly  if you close with my offer i shall undoubtedly benefit but i do not urge you to do so listen to the alternative and then decide but i must ask for patience while i tell you the story of another mine  as chairman i must raise a point of order leonard objected but they silenced him with shouts and he sat down baffled knowing that the game was up  go on they ordered andrew and with a steady voice he began to tell them of grahams discovery of the lode  he paused once or twice but they encouraged him and as he proceeded nobody felt that the narrative was out of place a few indeed forgot what they had come for and listened with a sense of romance and high adventure while he told them of the sawmill clerks steadfast longdeferred purpose here and there women who had been keenly anxious a few minutes earlier watched him with fixed sympathizing eyes and andrew cheered by the close attention was conscious of a new power he could hold these people and take them with him into the frozen wilds  they followed the march of the starving men across the northern snow saw them blasting icy rocks and searching with desperate eagerness for the food caches then as he told of the hardwon triumph when the vein was at last disclosed a hoarse murmur that had something of a cheer in it filled the room it was forced upon those who had doubted him that they were listening to an exceptional man who had borne and done things that needed the staunchest courage for honor and not for gain  now he said with an abrupt change of tone i have told you how we found the graham lode on which three of the richest claims have been contracted to me let me read you the reports of different assayers to whom i submitted specimens he did so and added the original documents are here you may examine and pass them round but i must get on these claims are mine though my right to them might be contested by the directors of this companythe cost of finding and proving them has been borne by myselfbut if you agree to their development and the abandoning of the rain bluff i propose to hand them over as your property  there was confused applause in the midst of which leonard rose  in face of the want of confidence you have shown in us and the extraordinary course mr allinson has taken my colleagues and i feel compelled to resign in a body  let them go were well rid of them exclaimed the shopkeeper you dont join them he said anxiously to andrew  i had better do so and offer myself for reelection  then i have much pleasure in proposing mr allinson said murray i should like to mention that i remained a shareholder in this company because i preferred his bare word to the strong recommendations of experienced stockjobbing friends  several men rose to second him and when every hand went up amidst a burst of applause andrew said with some emotion  thank you for this mark of trust my first offer standsanybody anxious to have his shares redeemed at par need only apply to my brokers whose address is here he laid an envelope on the table in sight of all  well go on with the election resumed the shopkeeper with the permission of the meeting ill ask mr allinson whom hed like to have on the board  andrew smiled  youre giving up your rights and offering me a very unusual privilege  never mind that rejoined a stockjobber dryly these proceedings have been remarkably unusual from the start in fact i imagine we have reached the limit of irregularity for a company meeting for all that i support our spokesmans plucky offer  very well said andrew i would suggest the nomination of three of your previous directors i believe they would serve you well and their appointment might act as a judicious check on me  the gentlemen he named looked irresolute and somewhat embarrassed but after a word or two with him they expressed their willingness to serve they were elected without dissent and then robert allinson stood up  i have pleasure in proposing mr antony wannop who is a large shareholder and mr allinsons brotherinlaw though i may be prejudiced i feel that i may say that your interest may safely be trusted to the allinson family  after what we have heard here that is an opinion with which i heartily agree a man at the back declared none of us can doubt that allinson is a justly respected name  wannop was chosen and several more and then a man got up  if its necessary to hold an adjourned meeting it will be attended as a matter of form he said i propose that we instruct mr allinson to push on with the development of the new lode as fast as possible giving him with confidence full authority to do what he thinks fit  though the secretary tried to point out that the board must act as a body the proposal was carried with acclamation and as the meeting broke up andrew leaned forward rather heavily on the big oak table he was filled with confused emotions and the strain had told on him when he looked up the room was almost empty and leonard had gone but the reappointed directors whom he had suggested remained  we have something to regret said one awkwardly its unfortunate we didnt quite grasp your intentions we feel that although you took us unprepared you have treated us with exceptional fairness  you may remember that you wouldnt listen when i tried to explain matters andrew answered with a twinkle in his eyes however your greater experience should be valuable to me and ive no doubt well get on well in future  after a few cordial words they withdrew and one of them turned to his companion  though im glad we rejoined i dare say you noticed the personal tone he took its clear that he expects us to play second fiddle  well after all allinson has shown that hes capable of leading the tune  when they had gone wannop came up to andrew  its a compliment when i tell you i wasnt a bit surprised he said id expected something of the kind from you the allinson strain showed up well today you got hold of them and swept them off their feet robert too proved himself a brick but hes waiting in the passage and we must try to shunt him hell lecture me on my new duties and i want a big long drink in fact half a dozen would be better  andrew laughed and they went out wannop talking excitedly     chapter xxxii  the head of the house   on the day after the meeting andrew returned to ghyllside and hilda met him at the station her eyes sparkling with delight  you have won she cried antony came down last night and brought us the news then gertrude was over this morning and could talk of nothing else she said you were splendid and she got quite vexed when i told her she neednt speak as if she hadnt expected it  after all my position was a strong one andrew said it doesnt need much skill to win the game when you hold the best cards and of course dream mine was the ace of trumps leonard could only throw down his hand when i brought it out  ah but how did you get the ace it wasnt by chance you searched for it starving in the snow but its a silly metaphorone isnt allowed to choose ones cards  thats true andrew replied with a trace of gravity it was dealt to mei think not by accident without it i should not have won the game  hildas manner changed for she was seldom serious long  well she said when he had helped her into the waiting trap in the future youll be called on to play a different one you cant reasonably expect to find another mine and youll have no excuse for tramping through the wilds on snowshoes after this instead of furs and moccasins youll have to wear a silk hat and a bond street coat and write things in ledgers instead of firing off dynamite how will you like it  i dont know however i suppose it will have to be done though i might perhaps hire somebody to do the writing for me  that would be better hilda laughed your writing isnt good but im afraid theres a bit of a trial in store for you tonight all your friends and relatives in the neighborhood are coming to dinner and of course theyll congratulate you and try to look as if you hadnt astonished them in a way the situation is distinctly humorous  how so  hilda broke into a delighted laugh  cant you see its the triumph of the foolish and lookeddownupon members of the family youre a popular hero antonys a director and im no longer a person who neednt be considered  but what had you to do with it andrew asked with unflattering frankness  i believe i pulled some strings in a humble way you know youre not really brilliant andrew and im afraid you never will be perhaps thats why you cant see the large part we women had in your triumph of course you can walk a long distance in snowshoes and use a pickax but who led you to think of putting the snowshoes on  graham i believe  try to use some imagination go back a little farther who made you see that allinsons had a claim on you encouraged you to go to canada and prompted you to right that horrid contractor can you deny that i and ethel and the girl in canada now and then gave you the push you needed indeed i think miss frobisher must have been very firm with you  youre right andrew admitted am i to understand that you propose to continue your supervision and assistance in my duties as the companys manager  you might do worse than consult me sometimes but you must get a good partner who knows the things you havent learned when leonard leaves hilda looked up anxiously i suppose he is going to leave  im inclined to think so andrew replied with some severity still i havent seen him since the meeting its fortunate i know of a partner wholl make up for my deficienciesi mean our old accountant sharpe  but surely he has no money  no you may have heard that money can be valued too highly and i believe its true  hilda chatted on general topics during the remainder of the drive and soon after he got home andrew went down to receive his guests ethel hillyard was the first to arrive and she smiled at him as she gave him her hand  i have heard the news and am very glad she said but it was only what i had confidently looked forward to  then you had a narrow escape of being badly disappointed as a matter of fact i owe a great deal to the staunchness of my friends i should hardly have pulled through if they hadnt cheered me on  thats an easy task it was you who made the fight  i had no choice said andrew humorously there was no retreat then i was well supportedby olcotts friend upon whom i had no claim among others  mr murray i dont suppose you know that you won him over by letting him miss a snipe you could have shot its a curious reason for giving you his confidence isnt it but it has struck me that in many ways you and he are alike  after that i can hardly say that murrays a good sort andrew laughed however we must drop the subject for here he comes  he saw that murray had not noticed him but was advancing straight toward ethel and that a faint tinge of color showed in her face then after a word of welcome to the man he turned away  mrs fenwood appeared next and greeted him with more cordiality than he could remember her displaying  its a gratification to see you following in your fathers steps at last though i must say that for a long time we doubted your ever doing so one recognized that you were influenced by a very proper sense of your responsibility yesterday and though i thought you were perhaps somewhat rash robert assures me that you showed signs of business acumen  the trouble is that i may not be able to keep on doing so if roberts capable of judging on such a matter im afraid youll have to be patient with me and make allowance for my wasted years  dont be flippant it isnt becoming mrs fenwood rebuked him you have begun well and it would be a grief to all of us if you relapsed again  mrs olcott came to his rescue and soon afterward they went in to dinner andrew was quiet during the meal though he felt content the strain he had long borne had told on him and a mild reaction which brought a sense of fatigue had set in he wanted to rest and he had not finished with leonard yet  it was a calm warm evening and though a few shaded candles threw a soft light over the table the windows were wide open and the smoky red of the dying sunset gleamed above the shadowy hills wannop was in a boisterous mood and hilda abetted him apparently to roberts irritation ethel talked to murray who seemed gravely interested mrs olcott was patiently listening to mrs fenwood gertrude now and then made furtive attempts to check her husband andrew looked on with languid satisfaction and joined in only when it was necessary presently to his annoyance wannop filled his glass and got up  you have all heard what happened in london yesterday he said now that we are here together and those who have joined us are our hosts good friends it seems opportune to wish a long and useful career to the head of the house  they rose with lifted glasses and andrew felt a thrill as he read the goodwill in their faces and knew his victory over his relatives prejudices was complete the toast they drank with hearty sincerity was in a sense an act of homagea recognition of his authority instead of bearing with and trying to guide him they would henceforward follow where he led there was a moments silence after they sat down and then he thanked them awkwardly  as they left the table mrs fenwood remarked to hilda who was nearest her  its your brothers rightful place but he was a long time claiming it and after all i dont see what leonard can have done that he should be deposed  that lies between him and andrew hilda replied i think hes the only one who knows and he will never tell  im afraid i havent appreciated andrew as he deserves mrs fenwood observed with a thoughtful air  the remainder of the evening passed pleasantly and the next day andrew received a telegram requesting him to call on leonard at the companys offices he declined to do so feeling that if leonard wished to make terms he must come to him and he smiled when another message stated that his brotherinlaw would arrive that evening it was getting dark when leonard reached ghyllside and was shown into the library where andrew was waiting for him  if you will let your man keep the horse ready i could catch the new night train back from the junction he said that would perhaps suit both of us best  as you wish responded andrew  leonard laid some papers on the table  you made me an offer a little while ago  which you refused said andrew  i did things have changed since then  they have though i told the secretary to take care that only a very brief notice of the meeting was sent to the papers news of what took place has no doubt leaked out it was impossible to prevent this from happening and it must have had some effect in the city you are afraid it will damage your prestige and weaken your position  im not prepared to admit that altogether  it cant be denied you no longer command public confidence as you did youll find it has been rudely shaken  well let that subject drop i must remind you that your fathers will and the partnership deed prevent your getting rid of me unless im willing to go  andrew regarded him with amusement  i cant deny it but i think you will be willing however id better say that i dont wish to take an undue advantage of the situation what do you propose  that you buy me out as you offered ive sketched out the termsyoull find them here with an estimate of my average profits and what my interest in the firm is worth  he pushed the papers across the table and andrew carefully studied them before he looked up  the fairest way would be to submit these figures to an outside accountant as soon as he has made up a statement ill meet you at carter  rodings office and get them to draw up any documents that are needed to annul our partnership are you agreeable  yes well consider the thing decided leonard hesitated for a moment i dont see he added that you will gain anything by letting florence and the others know exactly what we differed about  i quite agree with you there are reasons enough to account for the splitthe incompatibility of our views on business matters your objection to taking a subordinate place even at the cost of allowing florence to blame me the truth must be kept from her  thank you said leonard i believe ive said all thats needful and i may as well be off its a long drive to the junction  andrew let him go he had accomplished all that he had laid himself out to do gained his relatives confidence reorganized the mining company and got rid of leonard who had been a menace to the good name of allinsons it had been easier than he expected the task he had shrunk from had become less formidable when boldly attacked though he admitted that fortune had favored him henceforward he was his own master the acknowledged head of allinsons and that brought with it a deep sense of responsibility nevertheless he no longer felt daunted for he had gained selfconfidence there were many things of which he was ignorant but they could be learned then he remembered that he must go back to canada for a while after he had arranged matters with leonard and had thoroughly informed himself about allinsons affairs  it was a month before he could get away and wannop drove to the station with him when he shook hands as the train came in he smiled  bring her back with you then the credit of the allinson family will be in safe hands  ill try andrew promised i wish i felt more sure of succeeding but i wasnt thinking of the credit of the family  thats the proper line to take wannop answered smiling as he stood with his hand on the carriage door dont be timid im inclined to think you have done more difficult things  he made room for hilda and pulled her back as the train started and they stood waving their hands until the last carriage vanished into a tunnel  andrew needs some encouraging he remarked when theres anything to be gained for himself hes too diffident but perhaps its a good fault and by no means common  though he talked a good deal about the mine we all know why hes going back said hilda i suppose you are satisfied about this miss frobisher  so far as my opinion goes shes what you might call eminently suitable if i had any doubt on the matter andrews firm conviction would decide me though it was a long time before the family realized it his judgment is to be relied on  yes agreed hilda in some things he is really very sensible  when andrew reached the lake of shadows he found carnally awaiting him with a satisfactory account of the progress of development work on the lode and they spent some time talking over it in andrews room at the hotel  jake are you willing to take the post of our general manager in canada andrew asked  under hathersage as boss director  no under me hathersage has left the firm for good  then ill be proud to take it said carnally quietly  its yours you havent asked about the stipend  thats so carnally drawled i guess i can leave you to do the square thing then his eyes twinkled ive kept you here some time talking business and it strikes me youre anxious to get away youll find a skiff ready and id like to wish you good luck  thanks responded andrew soberly perhaps you had better wait until i come back  he hurried to the beach and rowed across the lake with steady determined strokes and it happened but not by accident that geraldine was waiting on the lawn she had seen a trail of engine smoke drift across the pines an hour earlier and at last a skiff shoot out across the sparkling water as it drew near the landing she felt tempted to retreat to the house but she waited and the color crept into her face when andrew took her hand in a masterful grasp  i think you know why i have come he said at once  no doubt you had mining matters to arrange she answered with an attempt at light raillery though her heart was beating fast  i had they have kept me since the train came in and i never grudged loss of time so much but i felt that i required something to steady me before i rowed across the fact is i felt extremely anxious  anxious you knew you would be welcome  to be welcomed as i was sent away didnt seem enough andrew held fast the hand she had given him you were very gracious and i knew what i owed to you but you kept something back and it was that i wanted i told you how i had got on in england but im afraid i havent learned to stand on my own feet yet you know how you have helped me so far wont you do so altogether  if i remember i said it was criticism you needed geraldine answered softly looking down  that or censure whatever it is it will be right if it comes from you andrews voice grew tense as he drew her nearer i ask for the greatest gift i need you geraldine  she yielded looking up at him swiftly with eyes that shone and then turned her head which sank until it rested on his shoulder it was getting dusk the scent of the pines stole out of the shadows and the call of a loon came ringing to them over the water as if in blessing   the end     john fox jrs stories of the kentucky mountains
