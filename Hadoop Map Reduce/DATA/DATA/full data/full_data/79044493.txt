every day   the little girl came into her papas study as she always did saturday morning before breakfast and asked for a story he tried to beg off that morning for he was very busy but she would not let him so he began  well once there was a little pig  she put her hand over his mouth and stopped him at the word she said she had heard little pigstories till she was perfectly sick of them  well what kind of story shall i tell then  about christmas its getting to be the season its past thanksgiving already  it seems to me her papa argued that ive told as often about christmas as i have about little pigs  no difference christmas is more interesting  well her papa roused himself from his writing by a great effort well then ill tell you about the little girl that wanted it christmas every day in the year how would you like that  firstrate said the little girl and she nestled into comfortable shape in his lap ready for listening  very well then this little pigoh what are you pounding me for  because you said little pig instead of little girl  i should like to know whats the difference between a little pig and a little girl that wanted it christmas every day  papa said the little girl warningly if you dont go on ill give it to you and at this her papa darted off like lightning and began to tell the story as fast as he could    well once there was a little girl who liked christmas so much that   she wanted it to be christmas every day in the year and as soon as   thanksgiving was over she began to send postalcards to the old   christmas fairy to ask if she mightnt have it but the old fairy   never answered any of the postals and after a while the little girl   found out that the fairy was pretty particular and wouldnt notice   anything but lettersnot even correspondence cards in envelopes but   real letters on sheets of paper and sealed outside with a   monogramor your initial anyway so then she began to send her   letters and in about three weeksor just the day before christmas   it wasshe got a letter from the fairy saying she might have it   christmas every day for a year and then they would see about having   it longer    the little girl was a good deal excited already preparing for the   oldfashioned onceayear christmas that was coming the next day and   perhaps the fairys promise didnt make such an impression on her as   it would have made at some other time she just resolved to keep it to   herself and surprise everybody with it as it kept coming true and   then it slipped out of her mind altogether    she had a splendid christmas she went to bed early so as to let   santa claus have a chance at the stockings and in the morning she was   up the first of anybody and went and felt them and found hers all   lumpy with packages of candy and oranges and grapes and pocketbooks   and rubber balls and all kinds of small presents and her big   brothers with nothing but the tongs in them and her young lady   sisters with a new silk umbrella and her papas and mammas with   potatoes and pieces of coal wrapped up in tissuepaper just as they   always had every christmas then she waited around till the rest of   the family were up and she was the first to burst into the library   when the doors were opened and look at the large presents laid out on   the librarytablebooks and portfolios and boxes of stationery and   breastpins and dolls and little stoves and dozens of handkerchiefs   and inkstands and skates and snowshovels and photographframes   and little easels and boxes of watercolors and turkish paste and   nougat and candied cherries and dolls houses and waterproofsand   the big christmastree lighted and standing in a wastebasket in the   middle    she had a splendid christmas all day she ate so much candy that she   did not want any breakfast and the whole forenoon the presents kept   pouring in that the expressman had not had time to deliver the night   before and she went round giving the presents she had got for other   people and came home and ate turkey and cranberry for dinner and   plumpudding and nuts and raisins and oranges and more candy and then   went out and coasted and came in with a stomachache crying and her   papa said he would see if his house was turned into that sort of   fools paradise another year and they had a light supper and pretty   early everybody went to bed cross  here the little girl pounded her papa in the back again  well what now did i say pigs  you made them act like pigs  well didnt they  no matter you oughtnt to put it into a story  very well then ill take it all out  her father went on    the little girl slept very heavily and she slept very late but she   was wakened at last by the other children dancing round her bed with   their stockings full of presents in their hands    what is it said the little girl and she rubbed her eyes and tried   to rise up in bed    christmas christmas christmas they all shouted and waved their   stockings    nonsense it was christmas yesterday    her brothers and sisters just laughed we dont know about that its   christmas today anyway you come into the library and see    then all at once it flashed on the little girl that the fairy was   keeping her promise and her year of christmases was beginning she   was dreadfully sleepy but she sprang up like a larka lark that had   overeaten itself and gone to bed crossand darted into the library   there it was again books and portfolios and boxes of stationery   and breastpins  you neednt go over it all papa i guess i can remember just what was there said the little girl    well and there was the christmastree blazing away and the family   picking out their presents but looking pretty sleepy and her father   perfectly puzzled and her mother ready to cry im sure i dont see   how im to dispose of all these things said her mother and her   father said it seemed to him they had had something just like it the   day before but he supposed he must have dreamed it this struck the   little girl as the best kind of a joke and so she ate so much candy   she didnt want any breakfast and went round carrying presents and   had turkey and cranberry for dinner and then went out and coasted   and came in with a  papa  well what now  what did you promise you forgetful thing  oh oh yes    well the next day it was just the same thing over again but   everybody getting crosser and at the end of a weeks time so many   people had lost their tempers that you could pick up lost tempers   anywhere they perfectly strewed the ground even when people tried to   recover their tempers they usually got somebody elses and it made   the most dreadful mix    the little girl began to get frightened keeping the secret all to   herself she wanted to tell her mother but she didnt dare to and   she was ashamed to ask the fairy to take back her gift it seemed   ungrateful and illbred and she thought she would try to stand it   but she hardly knew how she could for a whole year so it went on and   on and it was christmas on st valentines day and washingtons   birthday just the same as any day and it didnt skip even the first   of april though everything was counterfeit that day and that was   some little relief    after a while coal and potatoes began to be awfully scarce so many   had been wrapped up in tissuepaper to fool papas and mammas with   turkeys got to be about a thousand dollars apiece  papa  well what  youre beginning to fib  well two thousand then    and they got to passing off almost anything for turkeyshalfgrown   hummingbirds and even rocs out of the arabian nightsthe real   turkeys were so scarce and cranberrieswell they asked a diamond   apiece for cranberries all the woods and orchards were cut down for   christmastrees and where the woods and orchards used to be it   looked just like a stubblefield with the stumps after a while they   had to make christmastrees out of rags and stuff them with bran   like oldfashioned dolls but there were plenty of rags because   people got so poor buying presents for one another that they   couldnt get any new clothes and they just wore their old ones to   tatters they got so poor that everybody had to go to the poorhouse   except the confectioners and the fancystore keepers and the   picturebook sellers and the expressmen and they all got so rich   and proud that they would hardly wait upon a person when he came to   buy it was perfectly shameful    well after it had gone on about three or four months the little   girl whenever she came into the room in the morning and saw those   great ugly lumpy stockings dangling at the fireplace and the   disgusting presents around everywhere used to just sit down and   burst out crying in six months she was perfectly exhausted she   couldnt even cry any more she just lay on the lounge and rolled her   eyes and panted about the beginning of october she took to sitting   down on dolls wherever she found themfrench dolls or any kindshe   hated the sight of them so and by thanksgiving she was crazy and   just slammed her presents across the room    by that time people didnt carry presents around nicely any more they   flung them over the fence or through the window or anything and   instead of running their tongues out and taking great pains to write   for dear papa or mamma or brother or sister or susie or   sammie or billie or bobbie or jimmie or jennie or   whoever it was and troubling to get the spelling right and then   signing their names and xmas 18 they used to write in the   giftbooks take it you horrid old thing and then go and bang it   against the front door nearly everybody had built barns to hold their   presents but pretty soon the barns overflowed and then they used to   let them lie out in the rain or anywhere sometimes the police used   to come and tell them to shovel their presents off the sidewalk or   they would arrest them  i thought you said everybody had gone to the poorhouse interrupted the little girl  they did go at first said her papa but after a while the poorhouses got so full that they had to send the people back to their own houses they tried to cry when they got back but they couldnt make the least sound  why couldnt they  because they had lost their voices saying merry christmas so much did i tell you how it was on the fourth of july  no how was it and the little girl nestled closer in expectation of something uncommon    well the night before the boys stayed up to celebrate as they   always do and fell asleep before twelve oclock as usual expecting   to be wakened by the bells and cannon but it was nearly eight oclock   before the first boy in the united states woke up and then he found   out what the trouble was as soon as he could get his clothes on he   ran out of the house and smashed a big cannontorpedo down on the   pavement but it didnt make any more noise than a damp wad of paper   and after he tried about twenty or thirty more he began to pick them   up and look at them every single torpedo was a big raisin then he   just streaked it upstairs and examined his firecrackers and   toypistol and twodollar collection of fireworks and found that they   were nothing but sugar and candy painted up to look like fireworks   before ten oclock every boy in the united states found out that his   fourth of july things had turned into christmas things and then they   just sat down and criedthey were so mad there are about twenty   million boys in the united states and so you can imagine what a noise   they made some men got together before night with a little powder   that hadnt turned into purple sugar yet and they said they would   fire off one cannon anyway but the cannon burst into a thousand   pieces for it was nothing but rockcandy and some of the men nearly   got killed the fourth of july orations all turned into christmas   carols and when anybody tried to read the declaration instead of   saying when in the course of human events it becomes necessary he   was sure to sing god rest you merry gentlemen it was perfectly   awful  the little girl drew a deep sigh of satisfaction  and how was it at thanksgiving  her papa hesitated well im almost afraid to tell you im afraid youll think its wicked  well tell anyway said the little girl    well before it came thanksgiving it had leaked out who had caused all   these christmases the little girl had suffered so much that she had   talked about it in her sleep and after that hardly anybody would play   with her people just perfectly despised her because if it had not   been for her greediness it wouldnt have happened and now when it   came thanksgiving and she wanted them to go to church and have   squashpie and turkey and show their gratitude they said that all   the turkeys had been eaten up for her old christmas dinners and if   she would stop the christmases they would see about the gratitude   wasnt it dreadful and the very next day the little girl began to   send letters to the christmas fairy and then telegrams to stop it   but it didnt do any good and then she got to calling at the fairys   house but the girl that came to the door always said not at home   or engaged or at dinner or something like that and so it went   on till it came to the old onceayear christmas eve the little girl   fell asleep and when she woke up in the morning  she found it was all nothing but a dream suggested the little girl  no indeed said her papa it was all every bit true  well what did she find out then  why that it wasnt christmas at last and wasnt ever going to be any more now its time for breakfast  the little girl held her papa fast around the neck  you shant go if youre going to leave it so  how do you want it left  christmas once a year  all right said her papa and he went on again    well there was the greatest rejoicing all over the country and it   extended clear up into canada the people met together everywhere and   kissed and cried for joy the city carts went around and gathered up   all the candy and raisins and nuts and dumped them into the river   and it made the fish perfectly sick and the whole united states as   far out as alaska was one blaze of bonfires where the children were   burning up their giftbooks and presents of all kinds they had the   greatest time    the little girl went to thank the old fairy because she had stopped   its being christmas and she said she hoped she would keep her promise   and see that christmas never never came again then the fairy   frowned and asked her if she was sure she knew what she meant and   the little girl asked her why not and the old fairy said that now   she was behaving just as greedily as ever and shed better look out   this made the little girl think it all over carefully again and she   said she would be willing to have it christmas about once in a   thousand years and then she said a hundred and then she said ten   and at last she got down to one then the fairy said that was the good   old way that had pleased people ever since christmas began and she   was agreed then the little girl said whatre your shoes made of   and the fairy said leather and the little girl said bargains   done forever and skipped off and hippityhopped the whole way home   she was so glad  how will that do asked the papa  firstrate said the little girl but she hated to have the story stop and was rather sober however her mamma put her head in at the door and asked her papa  are you never coming to breakfast what have you been telling that child  oh just a moral tale  the little girl caught him around the neck again  we know dont you tell what papa dont you tell what     turkeys turning the tables   well you see the papa began on christmas morning when the little girl had snuggled in his lap into just the right shape for listening it was the night after thanksgiving and you know how everybody feels the night after thanksgiving  yes but you neednt begin that way papa said the little girl im not going to have any moral to it this time  no indeed but it can be a true story cant it  i dont know said the little girl i like madeup ones  well this is going to be a true one anyway and its no use talking    all the relations in the neighborhood had come to dinner and then   gone back to their own houses but some of the relations had come from   a distance and these had to stay all night at the grandfathers but   whether they went or whether they stayed they all told the   grandmother that they did believe it was the best thanksgiving dinner   they had ever eaten in their born days they had had cranberry sauce   and theyd had mashed potato and theyd had mincepie and pandowdy   and theyd had celery and theyd had hubbard squash and theyd had   tea and coffee both and theyd had appledumpling with hard sauce   and theyd had hot biscuit and sweet pickle and mangoes and frosted   cake and nuts and cauliflower  dont mix them all up so pleaded the little girl its perfectly confusing i cant hardly tell what they had now  well they mixed them up just in the same way and i suppose thats one of the reasons why it happened    whenever a child wanted to go back from dumpling and frosted cake to   mashed potato and hubbard squashthey were oldfashioned kind of   people and they had everything on the table at once because the   grandmother and the aunties cooked it and they couldnt keep jumping   up all the time to change the platesand its mother said it   shouldnt its grandmother said indeed it should then and helped it   herself and the childs father would say well he guessed he would   go back too for a change and the childs mother would say she   should think he would be ashamed and then they would get to going   back till everything was perfectly higgledypiggledy  oh shouldnt you like to have been there papa sighed the little girl  you mustnt interrupt where was i  higgledypiggledy  oh yes    well but the greatest thing of all was the turkey that they had it   was a gobbler i tell you that was nearly as big as a giraffe  papa    it took the premium at the county fair and when it was dressed it   weighed fifteen poundswell maybe twentyand it was so heavy that   the grandmothers and the aunties couldnt put it on the table and   they had to get one of the papas to do it you ought to have heard the   hurrahing when the children saw him coming in from the kitchen with   it it seemed as if they couldnt hardly talk of anything but that   turkey the whole dinnertime    the grandfather hated to carve and so one of the papas did it and   whenever he gave anybody a piece the grandfather would tell some new   story about the turkey till pretty soon the aunties got to saying   now father stop and one of them said it made it seem as if the   gobbler was walking about on the table to hear so much about him and   it took her appetite all away and that made the papas begin to ask   the grandfather more and more about the turkey  yes said the little girl thoughtfully i know what papas are  yes theyre pretty much all alike    and the mammas began to say they acted like a lot of silly boys and   what would the children think but nothing could stop it and all   through the afternoon and evening whenever the papas saw any of the   aunties or mammas round they would begin to ask the grandfather more   particulars about the turkey the grandfather was pretty forgetful   and he told the same things right over well and so it went on till   it came bedtime and then the mammas and aunties began to laugh and   whisper together and to say they did believe they should dream about   that turkey and when the papas kissed the grandmother goodnight   they said well they must have his mate for christmas and then they   put their arms round the mammas and went out hawhawing  i dont think they behaved very dignified said the little girl  well you see they were just funning and had got going and it was thanksgiving anyway    well in about half an hour everybody was fast asleep and dreaming  is it going to be a dream asked the little girl with some reluctance  didnt i say it was going to be a true story  yes  how can it be a dream then  you said everybody was fast asleep and dreaming  well but i hadnt got through everybody except one little girl  now papa  what  dont you go and say her name was the same as mine and her eyes the same color  what an idea    this was a very good little girl and very respectful to her papa   and didnt suspect him of tricks but just believed everything he   said and she was a very pretty little girl and had red eyes and   blue cheeks and straight hair and a curly nose  now papa if you get to cutting up  well i wont then    well she was rather a delicate little girl and whenever she   overate or anything  have bad dreams aha i told you it was going to be a dream  you wait till i get through    she was apt to lie awake thinking and some of her thinks were pretty   dismal well that night instead of thinking and tossing and turning   and counting a thousand it seemed to this other little girl that she   began to see things as soon as she had got warm in bed and before   even and the first thing she saw was a large  bronzecolored  turkey gobbler  no maam turkey gobblers ghost  foo said the little girl rather uneasily whoever heard of a turkeys ghost i should like to know  never mind that said the papa if it hadnt been a ghost could the moonlight have shone through it no indeed the stuffing wouldnt have let it so you see it must have been a ghost    it had a red pasteboard placard round its neck with first premium   printed on it and so she knew that it was the ghost of the very   turkey they had had for dinner it was perfectly awful when it put up   its tail and dropped its wings and strutted just the way the   grandfather said it used to do it seemed to be in a wide pasture   like that back of the house and the children had to cross it to get   home and they were all afraid of the turkey that kept gobbling at   them and threatening them because they had eaten him up at last one   of the boysit was the other little girls brothersaid he would   run across and get his papa to come out and help them and the first   thing she knew the turkey was after him gaining gaining gaining   and all the grass was full of henturkeys and turkey chicks running   after him and gaining gaining gaining and just as he was getting   to the wall he tripped and fell over a turkeypen and all at once she   was in one of the aunties room and the aunty was in bed and the   turkeys were walking up and down over her and stretching out their   wings and blaming her two of them carried a platter of chicken pie   and there was a large pumpkin jackolantern hanging to the bedpost   to light the room and it looked just like the other little girls   brother in the face only perfectly ridiculous  illustration the old gobbler first premium said they were going to turn the tables now    then the old gobbler first premium clapped his wings and said   come on chickchickledren and then they all seemed to be in her   room and she was standing in the middle of it in her nightgown   and tied round and round with ribbons so she couldnt move hand or   foot the old gobbler first premium said they were going to turn the   tables now and she knew what he meant for they had had that in the   reader at school just before vacation and the teacher had explained   it he made a long speech with his hat on and kept pointing at her   with one of his wings while he told the other turkeys that it was her   grandfather who had done it and now it was their turn he said that   human beings had been eating turkeys ever since the discovery of   america and it was time for the turkeys to begin paying them back if   they were ever going to he said she was pretty young but she was as   big as he was and he had no doubt they would enjoy her    the other little girl tried to tell him that she was not to blame and   that she only took a very very little piece    but it was right off the breast said the gobbler and he shed   tears so that the other little girl cried too she didnt have much   hopes they all seemed so spiteful especially the little turkey   chicks but she told them that she was very tenderhearted and never   hurt a single thing and she tried to make them understand that there   was a great difference between eating people and just eating turkeys    what difference i should like to know says the old henturkey   pretty snappishly    people have got souls and turkeys havent says the other little   girl    i dont see how that makes it any better says the old henturkey   it dont make it any better for the turkeys if we havent got any   souls we cant live after weve been eaten up and you can    the other little girl was awfully frightened to have the henturkey   take that tack  i should think she would a been said the little girl and she cuddled snugger into her papas arms what could she say ugh go on    well she didnt know what to say thats a fact you see she never   thought of it in that light before all she could say was well   people have got reason anyway and turkeys have only got instinct so   there    youd better look out says the old henturkey and all the little   turkey chicks got so mad they just hopped and the oldest little   heturkey that was just beginning to be a gobbler he dropped his   wings and spread his tail just like his father and walked round the   other little girl till it was perfectly frightful  i should think they would a been ashamed    well perhaps old first premium was a little because he stopped   them my dear he says to the old henturkey and chickchickledren   you forget yourselves you should have a little consideration   perhaps you wouldnt behave much better yourselves if you were just   going to be eaten    and they all began to scream and to cry weve been eaten and   were nothing but turkey ghosts  there now papa says the little girl sitting up straight so as to argue better i knew it wasnt true all along how could turkeys have ghosts if they dont have souls i should like to know  oh easily said the papa  tell how said the little girl  now look here said the papa are you telling this story or am i  you are said the little girl and she cuddled down again go on  well then dont you interrupt where was i oh yes    well he couldnt do anything with them old first premium couldnt   they acted perfectly ridiculous and one little brat of a spiteful   little chick piped out i speak for a drumstick ma and then they   all began i want a wing ma and im going to have the wishbone   and i shall have just as much stuffing as ever i please shant i   ma till the other little girl was perfectly disgusted with them she   thought they oughtnt to say it before her anyway but she had hardly   thought this before they all screamed out they used to say it before   us and then she didnt know what to say because she knew how   people talked before animals  i dont believe i ever did said the little girl go on    well old first premium tried to quiet them again and when he   couldnt he apologized to the other little girl so nicely that she   began to like him he said they didnt mean any harm by it they were   just excited and chickledren would be chickledren    yes said the other little girl but i think you might take some   older person to begin with its a perfect shame to begin with a   little girl    begin says old first premium do you think were just beginning   why when do you think it is    the night after thanksgiving    what year    1886    they all gave a perfect screech why its christmas eve 1900 and   every one of your friends has been eaten up long ago says old first   premium and he began to cry over her and the old henturkey and the   little turkey chicks began to wipe their eyes on the backs of their   wings  i dont think they were very neat said the little girl  well they were kindhearted anyway and they felt sorry for the other little girl and she began to think she had made some little impression on them when she noticed the old henturkey beginning to untie her bonnet strings and the turkey chicks began to spread round her in a circle with the points of their wings touching so that she couldnt get out and they commenced dancing and singing and after a while that little heturkey says whos it and the other little girl she didnt know why says im it and old first premium says do you promise and the other little girl says yes i promise and she knew she was promising if they would let her go that people should never eat turkeys any more and the moon began to shine brighter and brighter through the turkeys and pretty soon it was the sun and then it was not the turkeys but the windowcurtainsit was one of those old farmhouses where they dont have blindsand the other little girl  woke up shouted the little girl there now papa what did i tell you i knew it was a dream all along  no she didnt said the papa and it wasnt a dream  what was it then  it was atrance  the little girl turned round and knelt in her papas lap so as to take him by the shoulders and give him a good shaking that made him promise to be good pretty quick and very well then says the little girl if it wasnt a dream youve got to prove it  but how can i prove it says the papa  by going on with the story says the little girl and she cuddled down again  oh well thats easy enough    as soon as it was light in the room the other little girl could see   that the place was full of people crammed and jammed and they were   all awfully excited and kept yelling down with the traitress   away with the renegade shame on the little sneak till it was   worse than the turkeys ten times    she knew that they meant her and she tried to explain that she just   had to promise and that if they had been in her place they would   have promised too and of course they could do as they pleased about   keeping her word but she was going to keep it anyway and never   never never eat another piece of turkey either at thanksgiving or at   christmas    very well then says an old lady who looked like her grandmother   and then began to have a crown on and to turn into queen victoria   what can we have    well says the other little girl you can have oyster soup    what else    and you can have cranberry sauce    what else    you can have mashed potatoes and hubbard squash and celery and   turnip and cauliflower    what else    you can have mincepie and pandowdy and plumpudding    and not a thing on the list says the queen that doesnt go with   turkey now you see  the papa stopped  go on said the little girl  there isnt any more  the little girl turned round got up on her knees took him by the shoulders and shook him fearfully now then she said while the papa let his head wag after the shaking like a chinese mandarins and it was a good thing he did not let his tongue stick out now will you go on what did the people eat in place of turkey  i dont know  you dont know you awful papa well then what did the little girl eat  she the papa freed himself and made his preparation to escape why sheoh she ate goose goose is tenderer than turkey anyway and more digestible and there isnt so much of it and you cant overeat yourself and have bad  dreams cried the little girl  trances said the papa and she began to chase him all round the room     the pony engine and the pacific express   christmas eve after the children had hung up their stockings and got all ready for st nic they climbed up on the papas lap to kiss him goodnight and when they both got their arms round his neck they said they were not going to bed till he told them a christmas story then he saw that he would have to mind for they were awfully severe with him and always made him do exactly what they told him it was the way they had brought him up he tried his best to get out of it for a while but after they had shaken him first this side and then that side and pulled him backward and forward till he did not know where he was he began to think perhaps he had better begin the first thing he said after he opened his eyes and made believe he had been asleep or something was well what did i leave off at and that made them just perfectly boiling for they understood his tricks and they knew he was trying to pretend that he had told part of the story already and they said he had not left off anywhere because he had not commenced and he saw it was no use so he commenced  once there was a little pony engine that used to play round the fitchburg depot on the side tracks and sleep in among the big locomotives in the carhouse  the little girl lifted her head from the papas shoulder where she had dropped it is it a sad story papa  how is it going to end asked the boy  well its got a moral said the papa  oh all right if its got a moral said the children they had a good deal of fun with the morals the papa put to his stories the boy added go on and the little girl prompted carhouse  the papa said now every time you stop me i shall have to begin all over again but he saw that this was not going to spite them any so he went on one of the locomotives was its mother and she had got hurt once in a big smashup so that she couldnt run long trips any more she was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you could see her but she could work round the depot and pull empty cars in and out and shunt them off on the side tracks and she was so anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her and they were very kind to the little pony engine on her account though it was always getting in the way and under their wheels and everything they all knew it was an orphan for before its mother got hurt its father went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea and was never heard of again he was supposed to have been drowned the old mother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if she had been there but poor dear no 236 was always so venturesome and she had warned him against that very bridge time and again then she would whistle so dolefully and sigh with her airbrakes enough to make anybody cry you see they used to be a very happy family when they were all together before the papa locomotive got drowned he was very fond of the little pony engine and told it stories at night after they got into the carhouse at the end of some of his long runs it would get up on his cowcatcher and lean its chimney up against his and listen till it fell asleep then he would put it softly down and be off again in the morning before it was awake i tell you those were happy days for poor no 236 the little pony engine could just remember him it was awfully proud of its papa  the boy lifted his head and looked at the little girl who suddenly hid her face in the papas other shoulder well i declare papa she was putting up her lip  i wasnt any such thing said the little girl and i dont care so and then she sobbed  now never you mind said the papa to the boy youll be putting up your lip before im through well and then she used to caution the little pony engine against getting in the way of the big locomotives and told it to keep close round after her and try to do all it could to learn about shifting empty cars you see she knew how ambitious the little pony engine was and how it wasnt contented a bit just to grow up in the ponyengine business and be tied down to the depot all its days once she happened to tell it that if it was good and always did what it was bid perhaps a cowcatcher would grow on it some day and then it could be a passenger locomotive mammas have to promise all sorts of things and she was almost distracted when she said that  i dont think she ought to have deceived it papa said the boy but it ought to have known that if it was a pony engine to begin with it never could have a cowcatcher  couldnt it asked the little girl gently  no theyre kind of mooley  the little girl asked the papa what makes pony engines mooley for she did not choose to be told by her brother he was only two years older than she was anyway  well its pretty hard to say you see when a locomotive is first hatched  oh are they hatched papa asked the boy  well well call it hatched said the papa but they knew he was just funning theyre about the size of teakettles at first and its a chance whether they will have cowcatchers or not if they keep their spouts they will and if their spouts drop off they wont  what makes the spout ever drop off  oh sometimes the pip or the gapes  the children both began to shake the papa and he was glad enough to go on sensibly well anyway the mother locomotive certainly oughtnt to have deceived it still she had to say something and perhaps the little pony engine was better employed watching its buffers with its headlight to see whether its cowcatcher had begun to grow than it would have been in listening to the stories of the old locomotives and sometimes their swearing  do they swear papa asked the little girl somewhat shocked and yet pleased  well i never heard them near by but it sounds a good deal like swearing when you hear them on the upgrade on our hill in the night where was i  swearing said the boy and please dont go back now papa  well i wont itll be as much as i can do to get through this story without going over any of it again well the thing that the little pony engine wanted to be the most in this world was the locomotive of the pacific express that starts out every afternoon at three you know it intended to apply for the place as soon as its cowcatcher was grown and it was always trying to attract the locomotives attention backing and filling on the track alongside of the train and once it raced it a little piece and beat it before the express locomotive was under way and almost got in front of it on a switch my but its mother was scared she just yelled to it with her whistle and that night she sent it to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender  but the little pony engine didnt care it had beaten the pacific express in a hundred yards and what was to hinder it from beating it as long as it chose the little pony engine could not get it out of its head it was just like a boy who thinks he can whip a man  the boy lifted his head well a boy can papa if he goes to do it the right way just stoop down before the man knows it and catch him by the legs and tip him right over  ho i guess you see yourself said the little girl scornfully  well i could said the boy and some day ill just show you  now little cocksparrow now said the papa and he laughed well the little pony engine thought he could beat the pacific express anyway and so one dark snowy blowy afternoon when his mother was off pushing some empty coal cars up past the knownothing crossing beyond charlestown he got on the track in front of the express and when he heard the conductor say all aboard and the starting gong struck and the brakemen leaned out and waved to the engineer he darted off like lightning he had his steam up and he just scuttled  well he was so excited for a while that he couldnt tell whether the express was gaining on him or not but after twenty or thirty miles he thought he heard it pretty near of course the express locomotive was drawing a heavy train of cars and it had to make a stop or twoat charlestown and at concord junction and at ayerso the pony engine did really gain on it a little and when it began to be scared it gained a good deal but the first place where it began to feel sorry and to want its mother was in hoosac tunnel it never was in a tunnel before and it seemed as if it would never get out it kept thinking what if the pacific express was to run over it there in the dark and its mother off there at the fitchburg depot in boston looking for it among the sidetracks it gave a perfect shriek and just then it shot out of the tunnel there were a lot of locomotives loafing around there at north adams and one of them shouted out to it as it flew by whats your hurry little one and it just screamed back pacific express and never stopped to explain they talked in locomotive language  oh what did it sound like the boy asked  well pretty queer ill tell you some day it knew it had no time to fool away and all through the long dark night whenever a locomotive hailed it it just screamed pacific express and kept on and the express kept gaining on it some of the locomotives wanted to stop it but they decided they had better not get in its way and so it whizzed along across new york state and ohio and indiana till it got to chicago and the express kept gaining on it by that time it was so hoarse it could hardly whisper but it kept saying pacific express pacific express and it kept right on till it reached the mississippi river there it found a long train of freight cars before it on the bridge it couldnt wait and so it slipped down from the track to the edge of the river and jumped across and then scrambled up the embankment to the track again  papa said the little girl warningly  truly it did said the papa  ho thats nothing said the boy a whole train of cars did it in that jules verne book  well the papa went on after that it had a little rest for the express had to wait for the freight train to get off the bridge and the pony engine stopped at the first station for a drink of water and a mouthful of coal and then it flew ahead there was a kind old locomotive at omaha that tried to find out where it belonged and what its mothers name was but the pony engine was so bewildered it couldnt tell and the express kept gaining on it on the plains it was chased by a pack of prairie wolves but it left them far behind and the antelopes were scared half to death but the worst of it was when the nightmare got after it  the nightmare goodness said the boy  ive had the nightmare said the little girl  oh yes a mere human nightmare said the papa but a locomotive nightmare is a very different thing  why whats it like asked the boy the little girl was almost afraid to ask  well it has only one leg to begin with  pshaw  wheel i mean and it has four cowcatchers and four headlights and two boilers and eight whistles and it just goes whirling and screeching along of course it wobbles awfully and as its only got one wheel it has to keep skipping from one track to the other  i should think it would run on the crossties said the boy  oh very well then said the papa if you know so much more about it than i do whos telling this story anyway now i shall have to go back to the beginning once there was a little pony en  they both put their hands over his mouth and just fairly begged him to go on and at last he did well it got away from the nightmare about morning but not till the nightmare had bitten a large piece out of its tender and then it braced up for the homestretch it thought that if it could once beat the express to the sierras it could keep the start the rest of the way for it could get over the mountains quicker than the express could and it might be in san francisco before the express got to sacramento the express kept gaining on it but it just zipped along the upper edge of kansas and the lower edge of nebraska and on through colorado and utah and nevada and when it got to the sierras it just stooped a little and went over them like a goat it did truly just doubled up its fore wheels under it and jumped and the express kept gaining on it by this time it couldnt say pacific express any more and it didnt try it just said express express and then press press and then ess ess and pretty soon only ss ss and the express kept gaining on it before they reached san francisco the express locomotives cowcatcher was almost touching the pony engines tender it gave one howl of anguish as it felt the express locomotives hot breath on the place where the nightmare had bitten the piece out and tore through the end of the san francisco depot and plunged into the pacific ocean and was never seen again there now said the papa trying to make the children get down thats all go to bed the little girl was crying and so he tried to comfort her by keeping her in his lap  the boy cleared his throat what is the moral papa he asked huskily  children obey your parents said the papa  and what became of the mother locomotive pursued the boy  she had a brainfever and never quite recovered the use of her mind again  the boy thought awhile well i dont see what it had to do with christmas anyway  why it was christmas eve when the pony engine started from boston and christmas afternoon when it reached san francisco  ho said the boy no locomotive could get across the continent in a day and a night let alone a little pony engine  but this pony engine had to did you never hear of the beaver that clomb the tree  no tell  yes some other time  but how could it get across so quick just one day  well perhaps it was a year maybe it was the next christmas after that when it got to san francisco  the papa set the little girl down and started to run out of the room and both of the children ran after him to pound him  when they were in bed the boy called downstairs to the papa well anyway i didnt put up my lip     the pumpkinglory  illustration   the papa had told the story so often that the children knew just exactly what to expect the moment he began they all knew it as well as he knew it himself and they could keep him from making mistakes or forgetting sometimes he would go wrong on purpose or would pretend to forget and then they had a perfect right to pound him till he quit it he usually quit pretty soon  the children liked it because it was very exciting and at the same time it had no moral so that when it was all over they could feel that they had not been excited just for the moral the first time the little girl heard it she began to cry when it came to the worst part but the boy had heard it so much by that time that he did not mind it in the least and just laughed  the story was in season any time between thanksgiving and new years but the papa usually began to tell it in the early part of october when the farmers were getting in their pumpkins and the children were asking when they were going to have any squash pies and the boy had made his first jackolantern  well the papa said once there were two little pumpkin seeds and one was a good little pumpkin seed and the other was badvery proud and vain and ambitious  the papa had told them what ambitious was and so the children did not stop him when he came to that word but sometimes he would stop of his own accord and then if they could not tell what it meant he would pretend that he was not going on but he always did go on  well the farmer took both the seeds out to plant them in the homepatch because they were a very extra kind of seeds and he was not going to risk them in the cornfield among the corn so before he put them in the ground he asked each one of them what he wanted to be when he came up and the good little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a pumpkin and be made into a pie and be eaten at thanksgiving dinner and the bad little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up a morningglory  morningglory says the farmer i guess youll come up a pumpkinglory first thing you know and then he hawhawed and told his son who was helping him to plant the garden to keep watch of that particular hill of pumpkins and see whether that little seed came up a morningglory or not and the boy stuck a stick into the hill so he could tell it but one night the cow got in and the farmer was so mad having to get up about one oclock in the morning to drive the cow out that he pulled up the stick without noticing to whack her over the back with it and so they lost the place  but the two little pumpkin seeds they knew where they were well enough and they lay low and let the rain and the sun soak in and swell them up and then they both began to push and byandby they got their heads out of the ground with their shells down over their eyes like caps and as soon as they could shake them off and look round the bad little pumpkin vine said to his brother  well what are you going to do now  the good little pumpkin vine said oh im just going to stay here and grow and grow and put out all the blossoms i can and let them all drop off but one and then grow that into the biggest and fattest and sweetest pumpkin that ever was for thanksgiving pies  illustration two little pumpkin seeds  well thats what i am going to do too said the bad little pumpkin vine all but the pies but im not going to stay here to do it im going to that fence over there where the morningglories were last summer and im going to show them what a pumpkinglory is like im just going to cover myself with blossoms and blossoms that wont shut up either when the sun comes out but ll stay open as if they hadnt anything to be ashamed of and that wont drop off the first day either i noticed those morningglories all last summer when i was nothing but one of the blossoms myself and i just made up my mind that as soon as ever i got to be a vine i would show them a thing or two maybe i cant be a morningglory but i can be a pumpkinglory and i guess thats glory enough  it made the cold chills run over the good little vine to hear its brother talk like that and it begged him not to do it and it began to cry  whats that the papa stopped short and the boy stopped whispering in his sisters ear and she answered  he said he bet it was a girl the tears stood in her eyes and the boy said  well anyway it was like a girl  very well sir said the papa and supposing it was which is better to stay quietly at home and do your duty and grow up and be eaten in a pie at thanksgiving or go gadding all over the garden and climbing fences and everything the good little pumpkin vine was perfectly right and the bad little pumpkin would have been saved a good deal if it had minded its little sister  the farmer was pretty busy that summer and after the first two or three hoeings he had to leave the two pumpkin vines to the boy that had helped him to plant the seed and the boy had to go fishing so much and then in swimming that he perfectly neglected them and let them run wild if they wanted to and if the good little pumpkin vine had not been the best little pumpkin vine that ever was it would have run wild but it just stayed where it was and thickened up and covered itself with blossoms till it was like one mass of gold it was very fond of all its blossoms and it couldnt bear hardly to think of losing any of them but it knew they couldnt every one grow up to be a very large pumpkin and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had one left and then it just gave all its attention to that one and did everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it would  all this time the bad little pumpkin vine was carrying out its plan of being a pumpkinglory in the first place it found out that if it expected to get through by fall it couldnt fool much putting out a lot of blossoms and waiting for them to drop off before it began to devote itself to business the fence was a good piece off and it had to reach the fence in the first place for there wouldnt be any fun in being a pumpkinglory down where nobody could see you or anything so the bad little pumpkin vine began to pull and stretch towards the fence and sometimes it thought it would surely snap in two it pulled and stretched so hard but besides the pulling and stretching it had to hide and go round because if it had been seen it wouldnt have been allowed to go to the fence it was a good thing there were so many weeds that the boy was too lazy to pull up and the bad little pumpkin vine could hide among but then they were a good deal of a hinderance too because they were so thick it could hardly get through them it had to pass some rows of pease that were perfectly awful they tied themselves to it and tried to keep it back and there was one hill of cucumbers that acted ridiculously they said it was a cucumber vine running away from home and they would have kept it from going any farther if it hadnt tugged with all its might and main and got away one night when the cucumbers were sleeping it was pretty strong anyway when it got to the fence at last it thought it was going to die it was all pulled out so thin that it wasnt any thicker than a piece of twine in some places and its leaves just hung in tatters it hadnt had time to put out more than one blossom and that was such a poor little sickly thing that it could hardly hang on the question was how can a pumpkin vine climb a fence anyway  its knees and elbows were all worn to strings getting there or thats what the pumpkin thought till it wound one of those tendrils round a splinter of the fence without thinking and happened to pull and then it was perfectly surprised to find that it seemed to lift itself off the ground a little it said to itself lets try a few more and it twisted some more of the tendrils round some more splinters and this time it fairly lifted itself off the ground it said ah i see as if it had somehow expected to do something of the kind all along but it had to be pretty careful getting up the fence not to knock its blossom off for that would have been the end of it and when it did get up among the morningglories it almost killed the poor thing keeping it open night and day and showing it off in the hottest sun and not giving it a bit of shade but just holding it out where it could be seen the whole time it wasnt very much of a blossom compared with the blossoms on the good little pumpkin vine but it was bigger than any of the morningglories and that was some satisfaction and the bad little pumpkin vine was as proud as if it was the largest blossom in the world  when the blossoms leaves dropped off and a little pumpkin began to grow on in its place the vine did everything it could for it just gave itself up to it and put all its strength into it after all it was a pretty queerlooking pumpkin though it had to grow hanging down and not resting on anything and after it started with a round head like other pumpkins its neck began to pull out and pull out till it looked like a gourd or a big pear thats the way it looked in the fall hanging from the vine on the fence when the first light frost came and killed the vine it was the day when the farmer was gathering his pumpkins in the cornfield and he just happened to remember the seeds he had planted in the homepatch and he got out of his wagon to see what had become of them he was perfectly astonished to see the size of the good little pumpkin you could hardly get it into a bushel basket and he gathered it and sent it to the county fair and took the first premium with it  how much was the premium asked the boy he yawned he had heard all these facts so often before  illustration took the first premium at the county fair  it was fifty cents but you see the farmer had to pay two dollars to get a chance to try for the premium at the fair and so it was some satisfaction anyway he took the premium and he tried to sell the pumpkin and when he couldnt he brought it home and told his wife they must have it for thanksgiving the boy had gathered the bad little pumpkin and kept it from being fed to the cow it was so funnylooking and the day before thanksgiving the farmer found it in the barn and he said  hollo heres that little fool pumpkin wonder if it thinks its a morningglory yet  and the boy said oh father maynt i have it  and the father said guess so what are you going to do with it  but the boy didnt tell because he was going to keep it for a surprise but as soon as his father went out of the barn he picked up the bad little pumpkin by its long neck and he kind of balanced it before him and he said well now im going to make a pumpkinglory out of you  illustration heres that little fool pumpkin said the farmer  and when the bad little pumpkin heard that all its seeds fairly rattled in it for joy the boy took out his knife and the first thing the pumpkin knew he was cutting a kind of lid off the top of it it was like getting scalped but the pumpkin didnt mind it because it was just the same as war and when the boy got the top off he poured the seeds out and began to scrape the inside as thin as he could without breaking through it hurt awfully and nothing but the hope of being a pumpkinglory could have kept the little pumpkin quiet but it didnt say a word even after the boy had made a mouth for it with two rows of splendid teeth and it didnt cry with either of the eyes he made for it just winked at him with one of them and twisted its mouth to one side so as to let him know it was in the joke and the first thing it did when it got one was to turn up its nose at the good little pumpkin which the boys mother came into the barn to get  show how it looked said the boy  and the papa twisted his mouth and winked with one eye and wrinkled his nose till the little girl begged him to stop then he went on  the boy hid the bad pumpkin behind him till his mother was gone because he didnt want her in the secret and then he slipped into the house and put it under his bed it was pretty lonesome up there in the boys roomhe slept in the garret and there was nothing but broken furniture besides his bed but all day long it could smell the good little pumpkin boiling and boiling for pies and late at night after the boy had gone to sleep it could smell the hot pies when they came out of the oven they smelt splendid but the bad little pumpkin didnt envy them a bit it just said pooh whats twenty pumpkin pies to one pumpkinglory  it ought to have said what are oughtnt it papa asked the little girl  it certainly ought said the papa but if nothing but its grammar had been bad there wouldnt have been much to complain of about it  i dont suppose it had ever heard much good grammar from the farmers family suggested the boy farmers always say cowcumbers instead of cucumbers  oh do tell us about the cowcumber and the bullcumber and the little calfcumbers papa the little girl entreated and she clasped her hands to show how anxious she was  what and leave off at the most exciting part of the pumpkinglory  the little girl saw what a mistake she had made the boy just gave her one look and she cowered down into the papas lap and the papa went on  well they had an extra big thanksgiving at the farmers that day lots of the relations came from out west the grandmother who was living with the farmer was getting pretty old and every year or two she thought she wasnt going to live very much longer and she wrote to the relations in wisconsin and everywhere that if they expected to see her alive again they had better come this time and bring all their families she kept doing it till she was about ninety and then she just concluded to live along and not mind how old she was but this was just before her eightyninth birthday and she had drummed up so many sons and sonsinlaw and daughters and daughtersinlaw and grandsons and greatgrandsons and granddaughters and greatgranddaughters that the house was perfectly packed with them they had to sleep on the floor a good many of them and you could hardly step for them the boys slept in the barn and they laughed and cut up so the whole night that the roosters thought it was morning and kept crowing till they made their throats sore and had to wear wet compresses round them every night for a week afterwards  when the papa said anything like this the children had a right to pound him but they were so anxious not to have him stop that this time they did not do it they said go on go on and the little girl said and then the tables  tables well i should think so they got all the tables there were in the house up stairs and down for dinner thanksgiving day and they took the grandmothers workstand and put it at the head and she sat down there only she was so used to knitting by that table that she kept looking for her knittingneedles all through dinner and couldnt seem to remember what it was she was missing the other end of the table was the carpenters bench that they brought in out of the barn and they put the youngest and funniest papa at that the tables stretched from the kitchen into the diningroom and clear through that out into the hall and across into the parlor they hadnt tablecloths enough to go the whole length and the end of the carpenters bench where the funniest papa sat was bare and all through dinnertime he kept making fun the vise was right at the corner and when he got his help of turkey he pretended that it was so tough he had to fasten the bone in the vise and cut the meat off with his knife like a drawshave  it was the drumstick i suppose papa said the boy a turkeys drumstick is all full of little wooden splinters anyway  and what did the mamma say asked the little girl  illustration caught his trousers on a shinglenail and stuck  oh she kept saying now you behave and well i should think youd be ashamed but the funniest papa didnt mind her a bit and everybody laughed till they could hardly stand it all this time the boys were out in the barn waiting for the second table and playing round the farmers boy went up to his room over the woodshed and got in at the garret window and brought out the pumpkinglory only he began to slip when he was coming down the roof and hed have slipped clear off if he hadnt caught his trousers on a shinglenail and stuck it made a pretty bad tear but the other boys pinned it up so that it wouldnt show and the pumpkinglory wasnt hurt a bit they all said that it was about the best jackolantern they almost ever saw on account of the long neck there was to it and they made a plan to stick the end of the neck into the top of the pump and have fun hearing what the folks would say when they came out after dark and saw it all lit up and then they noticed the pigpen at the corner of the barn and began to plague the pig and so many of them got up on the pen that they broke the middle board off and they didnt like to nail it on again because it was thanksgiving day and you mustnt hammer or anything so they just stuck it up in its place with a piece of wood against it and the boy said he would fix it in the morning  the grown folks stayed so long at the table that it was nearly dark when the boys got to it and they would have been almost starved if the farmboy hadnt brought out apples and doughnuts every little while as it was they were pretty hungry and they began on the pumpkin pie at once so as to keep eating till the mother and the other mothers that were helping could get some of the things out of the oven that they had been keeping hot for the boys the pie was so nice that they kept eating at it all along and the mother told them about the good little pumpkin that it was made of and how the good little pumpkin had never had any wish from the time it was nothing but a seed except to grow up and be made into pies and eaten at thanksgiving and they must all try to be good too and grow up and do likewise the boys didnt say anything because their mouths were so full but they looked at each other and winked their left eyes there were about forty or fifty of them and when they all winked their left eyes it made it so dark you could hardly see and the mother got the lamp but the other mothers saw what the boys were doing and they just shook them till they opened their eyes and stopped their mischief  show how they looked said the boy  i cant show how fifty boys looked said the papa but they looked a good deal like the pumpkinglory that was waiting quietly in the barn for them to get through and come out and have some fun with it when they had all eaten so much that they could hardly stand up they got down from the table and grabbed their hats and started for the door but they had to go out the back way because the table took up the front entry and that gave the farmers boy a chance to find a piece of candle out in the kitchen and some matches and then they rushed to the barn it was so dark there already that they thought they had better light up the pumpkinglory and try it they lit it up and it worked splendidly but they forgot to put out the match and it caught some straw on the barn floor and a little more and it would have burnt the barn down the boys stamped the fire out in about half a second and after that they waited till it was dark outside before they lit up the pumpkinglory again then they all bent down over it to keep the wind from blowing the match anywhere and pretty soon it was lit up and the farmers boy took the pumpkinglory by its long neck and stuck the point in the hole in the top of the pump and just then the funniest papa came round the corner of the woodhouse and said  what have you got there boys jackolantern well well thats a good one  he came up and looked at the pumpkinglory and he bent back and he bent forward and he doubled down and he straightened up and laughed till the boys thought he was going to kill himself  they had all intended to burst into an indian yell and dance round the pumpkinglory but the funniest papa said now all you fellows keep still half a minute and the next thing they knew he ran into the house and came out walking his wife before him with both his hands over her eyes then the boys saw he was going to have some fun with her and they kept as still as mice and waited till he walked her up to the pumpkinglory and she was saying all the time now john if this is some of your fooling ill give it to you when he got her close up he took away his hands and she gave a kind of a whoop and then she began to laugh the pumpkinglory was so funny and to chase the funniest papa all round the yard to box his ears and as soon as she had boxed them she said now lets go in and send the rest out and in about a quarter of a second all the other papas came out holding their hands over the other mothers eyes till they got them up to the pumpkinglory and then there was such a yelling and laughing and chasing and earboxing that you never heard anything like it and all at once the funniest papa hallooed out wheres gramma grammas got to see it grandmall enjoy it its just grammas kind of joke and then the mothers all got round him and said he shouldnt fool the grandmother anyway and he said he wasnt going to he was just going to bring her out and let her see it and his wife went along with him to watch that he didnt begin acting up  the grandmother had been sitting all alone in her room ever since dinner because she was always afraid somehow that if you enjoyed yourself it was a sign you were going to suffer for it and she had enjoyed herself a good deal that day and she was feeling awfully about it when the funniest papa and his wife came in she said what is it what is it is the world aburnin up well you got to wrap up warm then or youll ketch your death o cold runnin and then stoppin to rest with your pores all open  the funniest papas wife she went up and kissed her and said no grandmother the worlds all right and then she told her just how it was and how they wanted her to come out and see the jackolantern just to please the children and she must come anyway because it was the funniest jackolantern there ever was and then she told how the funniest papa had fooled her and then how they had got the other papas to fool the other mothers and they had all had the greatest fun then you ever saw all the time she kept putting on her things for her and the grandmother seemed to get quite in the notion and she laughed a little and they thought she was going to enjoy it as much as anybody they really did because they were all very tender of her and they wouldnt have scared her for anything and everybody kept cheering her up and telling her how much they knew she would like it till they got her to the pump the little pumpkinglory was feeling awfully proud and selfsatisfied for it had never seen any flower or any vegetable treated with half so much honor by human beings it wasnt sure at first that it was very nice to be laughed at so much but after a while it began to conclude that the papas and the mammas were just laughing at the joke of the whole thing when the old grandmother got up close it thought it would do something extra to please her or else the heat of the candle had dried it up so that it cracked without intending to anyway it tried to give a very broad grin and all of a sudden it split its mouth from ear to ear  illustration my sakes its comin to life  you didnt say it had any ears before said the boy  no it had them behind said the papa and the boy felt like giving him just one pound but he thought it might stop the story and so he let the papa go on  as soon as the grandmother saw it open its mouth that way she just gave one scream my sakes its comin to life and she threw up her arms and she threw up her feet and if the funniest papa hadnt been there to catch her and if there hadnt been forty or fifty other sons and daughters and grandsons and daughters and greatgrandsons and greatgranddaughters very likely she might have fallen as it was they piled round her and kept her up but there were so many of them they jostled the pump and the first thing the pumpkinglory knew it fell down and burst open and the pig that the boys had plagued and that had kept squealing all the time because it thought that the people had come out to feed it knocked the loose board off its pen and flew out and gobbled the pumpkinglory up candle and all and that was the end of the proud little pumpkinglory  and when the pig ate the candle it looked like the magician when he puts burning tow in his mouth said the boy  exactly said the papa  the children were both silent for a moment then the boy said this story never had any moral i believe papa  not a bit said the papa unless he added the moral was that you had better not be ambitious unless you want to come to the sad end of this proud little pumpkinglory  why but the good little pumpkin was eaten up too said the boy  thats true the papa acknowledged  well said the little girl theres a great deal of difference between being eaten by persons and eaten by pigs  all the difference in the world said the papa and he laughed and ran out of the library before the boy could get at him  illustration     butterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterfly  illustration   one morning when the papa was on a visit to the grandfather the nephew and the niece came rushing into his room and got into bed with him he pretended to be asleep and even when they grabbed hold of him and shook him he just let his teeth clatter and made no sign of waking up but they knew he was fooling and they kept shaking him till he opened his eyes and looked round and said oh oh where am i as if he were all bewildered  youre in bed with us they shouted and they acted as if they were afraid he would try to get away from them by the way they held on to his arms  but he lay quite still and he only said i should say you were in bed with me it seems to be my bed  its the same thing said the nephew  how do you make that out asked the papa its the same thing if its enchantment but if it isnt it isnt  the niece said what enchantment for she thought that would be a pretty good chance to get what they had come for  she was perfectly delighted and gave a joyful thrill all over when the papa said oh thats a long story  well the longer the better i should say shouldnt you brother she returned  the nephew hemmed twice in his throat and asked drowsily is it a littlepig story or a fairyprince story for he had heard from his cousins that their papa would tell you a littlepig story if he got the chance and you had to look out and ask him which it was going to be beforehand  well i cant tell said the papa its a fairyprince story to begin with but it may turn out a littlepig story before it gets to the end it depends upon how the prince behaves but im not anxious to tell it and the papa put his face into the pillow and pretended to fall instantly asleep again  now brother you see said the niece being so particular  well sister said the nephew it wasnt my fault i had to ask him you know what they said  well i suppose weve got to wake him up all over again said the niece with a little sigh and they began to pull at the papa this way and that but they could not budge him as soon as they stopped he opened his eyes  now dont say where am i said the niece  the papa could not help laughing because that was just the very thing he was going to say well all right what about that story do you want to hear it and take your chances of its being a prince to the end  i suppose well have to wont we sister  yes well leave it all to you uncle said the niece and she thought she would coax him up a little and so she went on i know you wont be mean about it will he brother  no said the nephew ill bet the prince will keep a prince all the way through whatll you bet sister  i wont bet anything said the niece and she put her arm round the papas neck and pressed her cheek up against his ill just leave it to uncle and if it does turn into a littlepig story itll be for the moral  the nephew was not quite sure what a moral was but at the bottom of his heart he would just as soon have it a littlepig story as not he had got to thinking how funny a little pig would look in a princes clothes and he said yes itll be for the moral  the papa was very contrary that morning well said he i dont know about that im not sure theres going to be any moral  oh goody said the niece and she clapped her hands in great delight then its going to be a prince story all through  if you interrupt me in that way its not going to be any story at all  i didnt know you had begun it uncle pleaded the niece  well i hadnt but i was just going to the papa lay quiet a while the fact is he had not thought up any story at all and he was so tired of all the stories he used to tell his own children that he could not bear to tell one of them though he knew very well that the niece and nephew would be just as glad of it as if it were new and maybe gladder for they had heard a great deal about these stories how perfectly splendid they werelike the pumpkinglory and the little pig that took the poison pills and the proud little horsecar that fell in love with the pullman sleeper and jap doll hopsings adventures in crossing the continent and the enchantment of the greedy travellers and the little boy whose legs turned into bicycle wheels at last the papa said this is a very peculiar kind of a story its about a prince and a princess  oh went both of the children and then they stopped themselves and stuffed the covering into their mouths  the papa lifted himself on his elbow and stared severely at them first at one and then at the other have you finished he asked as if they had interrupted him but he really wanted to gain time so as to think up a story of some kind the children were afraid to say anything and the papa went on with freezing politeness because if you have i might like to say something myself this story is about a prince and a princess but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactly alike they were twins the prince was a boy and the princess was a girl that was a point that their fairy godmother carried against the wicked enchantress who tried to have it just the other way but it made the wicked enchantress so mad that the fairy godmother had to give in to her a little and let them be named almost exactly alike  here the papa stopped and after waiting for him to go on the nephew ventured to ask very respectfully indeed would you mind telling us what their names were uncle  the papa rubbed his forehead i have such a bad memory for names hold on wait a minute i remember now their names were butterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterfly of course he had just thought up the names  and which was which uncle dear asked the niece not only very respectfully but very affectionately too she was so afraid he would get mad again and stop altogether  why i should think you would know a girls name when you heard it butterflyflutterby was the prince and flutterbybutterfly was the princess  i dont see how were ever going to keep them apart sighed the niece  youve got to keep them apart said the papa because its the great thing about the story that if you cant remember which is the prince and which is the princess whenever i ask you the story has to stop it cant help it and i cant help it  they knew he was just setting a trap for them and the same thought struck them both at once they rose up and leaned over the papa with their arms across and their fluffy heads together in the form of a capital letter a and whispered in each others ears you say its one and ill say its the other and then well have it right between us  they dropped back and pulled the covering up to their chins and shouted dont you tell dont you tell and just perfectly wriggled with triumph  the papa had heard every word they were laughing so that they whispered almost as loud as talking but he pretended that he had not understood and he made up his mind that he would have them yet a little and a more he said and i should never have gone on again  go on go on they called out and then they wriggled and giggled till anybody would have thought they were both crazy  well where was i this was another of the papas tricks to gain time whenever he could not think of anything more he always asked well where was i he now added oh yes i remember well once there were a prince and a princess and their names were butterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterfly and they were both twins and both orphans but they made their home with their fairy godmother as long as they were little and they used to help her about the house for part board and she helped them about their kingdom and kept it in good order for them and left them plenty of time to play and enjoy themselves she was the greatest person for order there ever was and if she found a speck of dust or dirt on the kingdom anywhere she would have out the whole army and make them wash it up and then sandpaper the place and polish it with a coarse towel till it perfectly glistened the father of the prince and princess had taken the precaution before he died to subdue all his enemies and the consequence was that the longest kind of peace had set in and the army had nothing to do but keep the kingdom clean that was the reason why the fairy godmother had made the generalinchief take their guns away and arm them with long featherdusters they marched with the poles on their shoulders and carried the dusters in their belts like bayonets and whenever they came to a place that the fairy godmother said needed dustingshe always went along with them in a diamond chariotshe made the general halloo out fix dusters make ready aim dust and then the place would be cleaned up but the generalinchief used to go out behind the church and cry it mortified him so to have to give such orders and it reminded him so painfully of the good old times when he would order his men to charge the enemy and cover the field with gore and blood instead of having it so awfully spickandspan as it was now still he did what the fairy godmother told him because he said it was his duty and he kept his troops supplied with sudsine and dustene to clean up with and brushes and towels the fairy godmother  illustration fix dusters make ready aim dust  excuse me uncle said the nephew with extreme deference but i should just like to ask you one question will you let me  what is it said the papa in the grimmest kind of manner he could put on  ah brother murmured the niece for she knew that he was rather sarcastic and she was afraid that something ironical was coming  illustration the generalinchief used to go behind the church and cry  well i just wanted to ask whether this story was about the fairy godmother or about the prince and princess  very well now said the papa youve asked your question i didnt promise to answer it and im happy to say it stops the story ill guess ill go to sleep again i dont like being waked up this way in the middle of the night anyhow  now brother i hope youre satisfied said the niece  the nephew evaded the point he said well sister if the story really isnt going on i should like to ask uncle another question how big was the fairy godmothers diamond chariot  it was the usual sized chariot answered the papa  whew it must have been a pretty big diamond then  it was a very big diamond said the papa and he seemed to forget all about being mad or else he had thought up some more of the story to tell for he went on just as if nothing had happened the fairy godmother was so severe with the dirt she found because it was a royal prerogativethat is nobody but the king or the kings family had a right to make a mess and if other people did it they were infringing on the royal prerogative  you know the papa explained that in old times and countries the royal family have been allowed to do things that no other family would have been associated with if they had done them that is about the only use there is in having a royal family but the fairy godmother of prince  butterflyflutterby said the niece  and princess  flutterbybutterfly said the nephew  correct said the papa  the children rose up into a capital a again and whispered he didnt catch us that time and fell back laughing and the papa had to go on  the fairy godmother thought she would try to bring up the prince and princess rather better than most princes and princesses were brought up and so she said that the only thing they should be allowed to do different from other people was to make a mess if any other persons were caught making a mess they were banished and there was another law that was perfectly awful  whatwasitgoahead said the nephew running all his words together he was so anxious to know  why if any person was found clearing up anywhere and it turned out to be a mess that the royal twins had made the person was thrown from a tower  did it kill them the niece inquired rather faintly  well no it didnt kill them exactly but it bounced them up pretty high you see they fell on a bed of indiarubber about twenty feet deep it gave them a good scare and thats the great thing in throwing persons from a high tower  the nephew hastened to improve the opportunity which seemed to be given for asking questions  what do you mean exactly by making a mess uncle  oh scattering scraps of paper about or scuffing the landscape or getting jam or molasses on the face of nature or having bonfires in the back yard of the palace or leaving dolls around on the throne but what did i say about asking questions now theres another thing about this story when it comes to the exciting part if you move the least bit or even breathe loud the story stops just as if you didnt know which was the prince and which was the princess now do you understand  the children both said yes in a very small whisper and cowered down almost under the clothing and held on tight so as to keep from stirring  illustration the young khan and khant entered the kingdom with a magnificent retinue  the papa went on well about the time they had got these two laws in full force and forty or fifty thousand boys and girls had been banished for making a mess and pretty nearly all the neat old ladies in the kingdom had been thrown from a high tower for cleaning up after the prince and princess butterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterfly the young khan and khant of tartary entered the kingdom with a magnificent retinue of followers to select a bride and groom from the children of the royal family as there were no children in the royal family except the twins the choice of the khan and khant naturally fell upon the prince  butterflyflutterby  and the princess  flutterbybutterfly  correct it also happened that the khan and the khant were brother and sister but if you cant tell which was the brother and which was the sister the story stops at this point  why but uncle said the little girl reproachfully you havent ever told us which is which yourself yet  i know it because im waiting to find out you see with these asiatic names its impossible sometimes to tell which is which you have to wait and see how they will act if there had been a battle anywhere and one of them had screamed and run away then i suppose i should have been pretty sure it was the sister but even then i shouldnt know which was the khan and which was the khant  well what are we going to do about it then asked the nephew  i dont know said the papa we shall just have to keep on and see perhaps when they meet the prince and princess we shall find out i dont suppose a boy would fall in love with a boy  no said the niece but he might want to go off with him and have fun or something  thats true said the papa weve got to all watch out of course the khan and the khant scuffed the landscape awfully as they came along through the kingdom and got the face of nature all daubed up with marmaladethey were the greatest persons for marmaladeand when they reached the palace of the prince and princess they had to camp out in the back yard and they had to have bonfires to cook by and they made a frightful mess  well there was the greatest excitement about it that there ever was the generalinchief kept his men under arms night and day and the fairy godmother was so worked up she almost had a brainfever and if she had not taken six of aconite every night when she went to bed she would have had you see the question was what to do about the mess that the khan and khant made they were visitors and it wouldnt have been polite to banish them and they belonged to a royal family and so nobody dared to clean up after them the whole kingdom was in the most disgusting state and whenever the fairy godmother looked into the back yard of the palace she felt as if she would go through the floor  illustration she was going to take the case into her own hands  well it kept on going from bad to worse the only person that enjoyed herself was the wicked enchantress she never had such a good time in her life and when the fairy godmother got hold of the grand vizier and the cadi and told them to make a new law so as to allow the army to clean up after royal visitors without being thrown from a high tower the wicked enchantress enchanted the whole mess so that the army could not tell which the prince and princess had made and which the khan and khant had made they were all four always playing together anyway  it seemed as if the poor old fairy godmother would go perfectly wild and she almost made the general crazy giving orders in one breath and taking them back in the next she said that now something had got to be done she had stood it long enough and she was going to take the case into her own hands she saw that she should have no peace of her life till the prince and princess and the khan and khant were married she sent for the head imam and told him to bring those children right in and marry them and she would be responsible  the imam put his head to the floorand it was pretty hard on him for he was short and stout and he had to do it kind of sidewaysand said to hear was to obey but he could not marry them unless he knew which was which  the fairy godmother screamed out i dont care which is which marry them all just as they are  but when she came to think it over she saw that this would not do and so she tried to invent some way out of the trouble one morning she woke up with a splendid idea and she could hardly wait to have breakfast before she sent for the generalinchief her nerves were all gone and as soon as she saw him she yelled at him a sham battletodaynowthis very instant right away right away right away  illustration the imam put his head to the floor  the general got her to explain herself and then he understood that she wanted him to have a grand review and sham battle of all the troops in honor of the khan and khant and the whole court had to be present and especially the timidest of the ladies that would almost scare a person to death by the way they screamed when they were frightened the general was just going to say that the guns and cannon had all got rusty and the powder was spoiled from not having been used for so long with the everlasting cleaning up that had been going on but the fairy godmother stamped her foot and sent him flying so the only thing he could do was to set all the gnomes at work making guns and cannon and powder and about twelve oclock they had them ready and just after lunch the sham battle began  the troops marched and countermarched and fired away the whole afternoon and sprang mines and blew up magazines and threw cannon crackers and cannon torpedoes there was such an awful din and racket that you couldnt hear yourself think and some of the court ladies were made perfectly sick by it they all asked to be excused but the fairy godmother wouldnt excuse one of them she just kept them there on the seats round the battlefield and let them shriek themselves hoarse so many of them fainted that they had to have the garden hose brought and they kept it sprinkling away on their faces all the afternoon  illustration they began to scream oh the cow the cow  but it was a failure as far as the khan and the khant were concerned the fairy godmother expected that as soon as the loudest firing began the girl whichever it was would scream and so they would know which was which but the khan and khants father had been a famous warrior and he had been in the habit of taking his children to battle with him from their earliest years partly because his wife was dead and he didnt dare trust them with the careless nurse at home and partly because he wanted to harden their nerves so now they just clapped their hands and enjoyed the sham battle down to the ground  about sunset the fairy godmother gave it up she had to anyway the troops had shot away all their powder and the gnomes couldnt make any more till the next day so she set out to return to the city with all the court following her diamond chariot and i can tell you she felt pretty gloomy she told the grand vizier that now she didnt see any end to the trouble and she was just going into hysterics when a barefooted boy came along driving his cow home from the pasture the fairy godmother didnt mind it much for she was in her chariot but the court ladies were on foot and they began to scream oh the cow the cow and to take hold of the knights and to get on to the fence till it was perfectly packed with them and who do you think the fairy godmother found had scrambled up on top of her chariot  the nephew and niece were afraid to risk a guess and the papa had to say  the khant the fairy godmother pulled her inside and hugged her and kissed her she was so glad to find out that she was the one and she stopped the procession on the spot and she called up the imam and he married the khant to prince  the papa stopped and as the niece and nephew hesitated he said very sternly well  the fact is they had got so mixed up about the khan and the khant of tartary that they had forgotten which was butterflyflutterby and which was flutterbybutterfly they tried shouting out one the one and the other the other but the papa said  oh no that wont work ive had that sort of thing tried on me before and it never works i heard you whispering what you would do and you have simply added the crime of doubledealing to the crime of inattention the story has stopped and stopped forever  the nephew stretched himself and then sat up in bed well it had got to the end anyway  oh had it what became of the wicked enchantress the nephew lay down again in considerable dismay  uncle said the niece very coaxingly i didnt say it had come to the end  but it has said the papa and im mighty glad you forgot the princes name for the rule of this story is that it has to go on as long as any one listening remembers and it might have gone on forever  i suppose the nephew said a person may guess  he may if he guesses right if he guesses wrong he has to be thrown from a high towerthe same one the wicked enchantress was thrown from  there shouted the nephew you said you wouldnt tell how high was the tower anyway uncle as high as the eiffel tower in paris  not quite it was three feet and five inches high  ho then the enchantress was a dwarf  who said she was a dwarf  there wouldnt be any use throwing her from the tower if she wasnt  i didnt say it was any use they just did it for ornament  this made the nephew so mad that he began to dig the papa with his fist and the papa began to laugh he said as well as he could for laughing you see the trouble was to keep her from bouncing up higher than the top of the tower she was light weight anyway because she was a witch and after the first bounce they had to have two executioners to keep throwing her downa day executioner and a night executioner and she went so fast up and down that she was just like a solid column of enchantress she enjoyed it firstrate but it kept her out of mischief  now uncle said the niece youre just letting yourself go what did the fairy godmother do after they all got married  well the story dont say exactly but theres a report that when she became a fairy grandgodmother she was not half so severe about cleaning up and let the poor old generalinchief have some peace of his lifeor some war there was a rebellion among the genii not long afterwards and the general was about ten or fifteen years putting them down  the nephew had been lying quiet a moment now he began to laugh  what are you laughing at demanded his uncle  the way that khant scrambled up on top of the chariot when the cow came along just like a girl theyre all afraid of cows  the tears came into the nieces eyes she had a great many feelings and they were easily hurt especially her feelings about girls  well she wasnt afraid of the cannon anyway  that is a very just remark said the uncle and now what do you say to breakfast  the children sprang out of bed and tried which could beat to the door they forgot to thank the uncle but he did not seem to have expected any thanks
